            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I have always heard amazing things about argan oil helping with hair, skin, face, etc.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice product.</li>
            <li>Does give it a nice shine though.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my colored hair healthy and looking good.  </li>
            <li>I can get build-up if I use it too many days in a row, but a day without and a good shampoo is all it takes.</li>
            <li>Good stuff :)</li>
            <li>It has a nice musky kind of fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice and gives the hair a nice shrine after sitting under the dryer.</li>
            <li>(the reviewer who said it was musky is correct, with a warm spicy undertone)</li>
            <li>The kind that is FRIZZZZZZZZZY, brittle, looks like straw no matter what I use..</li>
            <li>It also smells good, though Moroccanoil smells a bit more heavenly.    </li>
            <li>--a pump would have been nice.</li>
            <li>SO.. in conclusion.. The Real Moroccanoil is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this order,thank you so much.</li>
            <li>extremely fast delivery and absoloutely perfect product.  </li>
            <li>I have never had to deal with this kind of problem(damaged goods, Amazon as mediator)so maybe I should have questioned the solution.</li>
            <li>And I wonder if olive oil would have been just as effective?  </li>
            <li>so that was nice.</li>
            <li>As the day went on I realized that though the product does shine my hair up nicely, it was the smell I was hooked on.</li>
            <li>and it was packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>looks brilliant and light and healthy.</li>
            <li>Kind of musky.</li>
            <li>Smells nice though.</li>
            <li>Nice change though.</li>
            <li>The pump was a nice addition and works well.</li>

            <li>This is some kind of silicone hair product.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice.   </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it smells good and repairs damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It came with a nice pump that helps you control the amount that you use at one time.</li>

            <li>Love, Love, Love this product!</li>
            <li>My first impression was I loved the scent, and then once my hair was done, I loved the silky feel and healthy look of my hair.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this at my hair salon for $48 and loved it.</li>
            <li>but this really helps it feel wonderful and smooth.  </li>
            <li>although it would be much more handy if it came in a \\&quot;squirt\\&quot; type bottle :)</li>
            <li>It has a very attractive light scent and my hair is incredibly soft and shiny after an application.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li>one teeny bit got her hair picture perfect and shiny and glamorous for her date...with NO other products.  </li>

            <li>Oh yea - this is the perfect travel size of this great product that really supports healthy hair - I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>At first it worked great</li>
            <li>It became evident to me then that the Morrocan Oil was extremely of great</li>
            <li>The hair is much softer, and the oil smells beautiful....</li>
            <li>If the price is too good to be true then it is.</li>
            <li>very light and airy..  feels as if nothing is on my hair</li>
            <li>Not greasy, very light, smoothing, and exotically fragrant.</li>
            <li>the bottle was oily, the pump didn&#x27;t work well (and was very cheap feeling)</li>
            <li>The Moroccon oil is very smooth and improves the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Wish they could claim it was all natural/organic, as that&#x27;s very important to me, but I won&#x27;t argue with results.  </li>
            <li>It makes my long hair look great, not just smell great.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells nice and lingers without being too musky or strong.</li>
            <li>Works wonders along with smelling super good.</li>
            <li>It is a good product but nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is fantastic for treating hair and keeping it healthy and shiney!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had friends try it who have shiney, smooth hair, and it does not work for them, but I absolutely love it!</li>

            <li>I love Morroccanoil, use it every day.  </li>
            <li>This smells lovely and works well; depending on hair length and thickness, you may need to use more than the suggested quarter size.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs instantly on damp hair, and smells great too!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>it just moisturizes and creates a healthy look and feel.  </li>

            <li>so I can take better care of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t use a lot, Try it you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>The texture of my hair is better without it.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my salon suggested it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This has worked for me even in the most humid weather.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>the price is steep but ordering through amazon I was able to get it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Amazon  A Satisfied Customer :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>, sometimes I feel like I cant stop touching my hair, to someone who doesn&#x27;t know how well this works I might appear to have a disorder where my arm flies up to my hair all the time....    </li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love how my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>My hair has become so healthy I cannot believe it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>love the oil.</li>
            <li>However, if you want a product that makes your hair a bit healthier-looking and has more healing ingredients, and you want to get way more bang for your buck, try L&#x27;anza.</li>
            <li>I took away another star because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look as awesome as L&#x27;anza&#x27;s , which I&#x27;ve set as the gold standard.</li>
            <li>As for this product, I love it to death.</li>
            <li>This product is the reason I am able to wear my hair wavy/curly rather than having to do through the torturous process of straightening it every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite thing about this oil.     </li>
            <li>It made my hair softer for sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 more now.</li>
            <li>My hair is so healthy</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent and the lightweight feel.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I do still heat style my hair, but the results are so much better.</li>
            <li>and I have used this product for months and love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people rave about this as I&#x27;ve seen and used better stuff that exist out there and thats cheaper.</li>
            <li>The real Moroccanoil is great.</li>
            <li>But, when I am using Moroccan Oil, I get compliments from complete strangers on how wonderful, silky smooth my hair is.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I have bought so many, many oils</li>
            <li>This stuff is unreal....absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Thirdly, our hair has a wonderful shine to it now.</li>
            <li>So some people might be able to stretch the bottle a bit more.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser talked me in to investing in Moroccanoil and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My hairdresser tells me I have the most challenging hair she has ever seen.  </li>
            <li>Save your money for better moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many product from Frederic Fekkai glossy cream to Frize Ease, none have worked for me like this product.</li>
            <li>I have puchased this oil many times and will again.</li>
            <li>Love the product,but the bottle was leaking and the solution was to take $4 off the purchase price.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>of course you go to a salon and think whatever they used you have to get to recreate the magic.  </li>
            <li>So, i&#x27;ll keep trying it and hope to fall in love.</li>
            <li>Love Morocco oil, for my curly hair</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I find it works much better if I rub a quarter sized dollop into my hair after a wash and condition it while it&#x27;s damp.</li>
            <li>At these prices, I&#x27;d rather not use a whole lot of it - LOL.</li>
            <li>I love smell.</li>
            <li>and I have never gotten so many compliments on my shiny hair :-)</li>
            <li>Brazilian consumer :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure you can use with a volumizing product and it wouldn&#x27;t make your hair yucky.</li>
            <li>She has tried many different Argon oil based products but has found this one to be the best.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>it was authentic  </li>
            <li>I remain sure it in fact is not.</li>
            <li>Understandably it would have a screw cap top for shipping, options, etc.  </li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>LOVE WHAT THIS DOES</li>
            <li>I would not say it helps at all with static though.</li>
            <li>I never thought my hair would look so healthy after what I put it through.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I shopped around and could not find a better price than amazon.</li>
            <li>In addition, I am currently serving in Afghanistan and as you can imagine the water I bathe in is not the best.</li>
            <li>I love Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>you can get better products for this price.</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to put a lot more.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice my hair to be any easier to style or more bouncy or softer in texture and that is why I&#x27;m not giving it five stars.</li>
            <li>It seems to work more on the surface/appearance of my hair rather than penetrating the strands and changing the body or softness from within if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li>My sister &amp; I fell in love</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and lightly fragrant in time for a great night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li>But this one is the one I use the most.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I tried to many products to make my hair shine, but they all made it oily looking.</li>
            <li>I have tried the garnier oil treatment and wasnt sure what to expect .</li>
            <li>I love Garnier and didnt know what to expect because it was a oil .</li>
            <li>(the top 5 ingredients of any item are basically what make the product)</li>
            <li>I read about this making hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>With it, my hair dries faster, and is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks nothing like the sleek, shiny, and healthy hair that I have when I walk out of the salon after using this product.  </li>
            <li>You may wanna find a better oil moisturizer that is truly going to help you through the transition :)</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Even my mother who is allergic to most smelly lotions, hair products and perfumes loooooves this oil.</li>
            <li>I always love buying Moroccan Oil from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I had to use a lot more to see a difference</li>
            <li>Many times no need for anything else.</li>
            <li>I always compare with an authentic product before I buy online</li>
            <li>Love this product,  use it every day...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>my hair has never been this healthy.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the smell.  </li>
            <li>Glad that I found it here instead.</li>
            <li>I mix some of the Moroccanoil Oil Treatment with the Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream and apply to my hair after I shower making sure to brush it through.  </li>
            <li>shine spray to top it off...</li>
            <li>Enjoy the product!</li>
            <li>Love the smell more than anything.</li>
            <li>Nice and light oil</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I get compliments often on how shiny and healthy it looks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic</li>
            <li>Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in love with it</li>
            <li>and my husband loves it:)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and more manageable and now with the pump that comes with it</li>
            <li>I love how luxurious my hair looks and feels when I use this.  </li>
            <li>:]</li>
            <li>pleased.  </li>
            <li>Ok this is my story.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product since it arrived safely and its been months</li>
            <li>and I love how it smells :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely Love Marvelous Oil Deep Nourish!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this bottle, and it is much more perfumed than the sample.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a month, my hair looks 100 times better.</li>
            <li>I love this hair treatment.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried it; I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>I love this hair product.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>extra work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and great job!</li>
            <li>I love it and we&#x27;ve bought over $100 of it.</li>
            <li>I never used more than a dime sized amount when I applied it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This is seriously my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>and they charged me $49 before taxes-- which is 10% more than what the Moroccan oil website charges.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product makes it easier to brush after washing, and keeps it a lot smoother and more hydrated.    </li>
            <li>My hair now is not only silky and shines, but this oil smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This one is just OK...</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I am glad that my friend recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brandname hair products that simulate moisture and advertise prevention of fly-away hair, but none works as well as Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>and i fell in love.</li>
            <li>Organix makes my hair feel much better for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>and I love the pump that came with it.</li>
            <li>I use it most every night after I shower.</li>
            <li>but it will looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed the benefits of THIS brand of Moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li>Great value much cheaper than in my salon.</li>
            <li>and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I have found another way to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it at a better price</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m confident with the quality, I can give gals a recommendation.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The more heat you put on your hair the better it works.</li>
            <li>Love the moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, try coconut oil from the market or free-trade Argan oil - both without added fragrance - and both are able to penetrate hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be without it unless I find something else like this or better for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and would definitely use it again.</li>
            <li>For this price, the product should have a much better result.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this oil.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been better.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>This brand is pricier but definitely the best.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly I&#x27;m my bleached hair</li>
            <li>I love the smell and</li>
            <li>Used this product and it helps better than most others.</li>
            <li>Moroccan oil is better....</li>
            <li>Would just put a couple squirts in my hair after I shower and it would control the frizz, split end, and make it look so healthy.</li>
            <li>many months</li>
            <li>and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you start at your ends</li>
            <li>so your roots don&#x27;t get greasy or build up over time and rub the oil together in your palms before putting it in your hair for a more even coat.    </li>
            <li>it looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It conditions more than the BioSilk</li>
            <li>I bought this as a hair treatment, and for an occasional fix, it is excellent.  </li>
            <li>and I was really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>, my hair is 100% better</li>
            <li>Moraccainoil also doesn&#x27;t leave a slippery residue on my hands, it speeds the drying time, smooths out frizz, and my hair is also in much better condition since I started using it almost 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li>It is quite simply the best condition/anti-frizz/blowdry product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t ever want to be without it again!! :-)</li>
            <li>i love it .</li>
            <li>Love the scent (overpowering though...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Light version of this for a while and really liked it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the</li>
            <li>Always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Want shiny and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It can be too greasy if you apply more than 2 pumps on your hair</li>
            <li>The organix drugstore Moroccan oil smells way better than this.</li>
            <li>It also feels, for lack of a better explanation, like it gunks up my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it has lasted me over a year.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I will try the Moroccan hydrating mask, see if that helps a bit more with the frizz.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this product and it was cheaper on here than I could get it at beuty stores.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I can apply at any time and my hair looks healthy but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I had searched all over to get a better price.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil is simply the best.</li>
            <li>This seller is filling bottles with bogus moroccanoil, thats why so many people complain of it arriving leaking.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but there is nothing better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic if used correctly.</li>
            <li>Most of my split ends are gone.</li>
            <li>I love Moroccan oil</li>
            <li>Got it for a better price on Amazon than at the hair salon.</li>
            <li>I love Morrocanoil Treatment.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy any more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love</li>

            <li>love love the smell of this, makes your hair more manageable, as well as adding shine, and protecting your hair.</li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the Moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair moisturized, keeps my ends from splitting and smells divinely exotic.</li>
            <li>totally satisfied with results.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied, but I wish that it would reduce more the freeze.</li>
            <li>Many products that I used to use would never get rid of the frizz and condition my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I recommend trying out different amounts to find the best amount for you.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves to smell my hair :)</li>
            <li>Plenty of my friends have started to use it and love it as well.</li>
            <li>I WILL PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE COMPANIES ORDER</li>
            <li>i love moroccan oil products.</li>
            <li>im sure</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it coats the hair.  </li>
            <li>This Moroccan oil is great stuff compared to hair jell or moose,makes your hair silky soft but managable !!!</li>
            <li>This product came right away and is just awesome, my hair is COMPLETELY manageable now!!!  </li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think that adding oil to your hair right after you washed it would be a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Great product to use every day great results even bought the other Moroccan products to accompany it</li>
            <li>It makes your hair very soft and adds a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>, I think I would have surprise,I really like the smell!!!!</li>
            <li>Though I am sure that this oil will do great things for your hair, what is not mentioned is how HIGHLY scented this product is.</li>
            <li>My hair is more full and I has an amazing shine.</li>
            <li>Just glad that I purchased through Amazon and got a great deal (50% of the normal price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes it look great, smell great and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Two things do not make me so happy, that&#x27;s the high price of Moroccanoil, and that Amazon doesn&#x27;t always have it in stock.</li>
            <li>I got his oit and was very excited to try it, since the reviews were pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it is stronger, more healthy and shines more than it ever has.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil is a great product: smells good, keeps hair from being dry, adds shine.  </li>
            <li>Nothing makes my naturally wavy (yet easily straightened) hair look so incredible.</li>
            <li>It is the single most impressive hair product I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Best price I have found so far and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I have converted many friends to becoming moroccanoil fans.  </li>
            <li>A woman recomended that I start using Moroccan oil and loved it from the first day.</li>
            <li>An awesome product for long hair.</li>
            <li>The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot per application, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Good product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely soft and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>What a great hair product, absorbs quickly without feeling oily and makes your hair feel silky soft and look super shiny!!!</li>
            <li>This reduces the frizz in my hair significantly!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and keeps my hair looking healthy and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is perfect, keeps my hair from getting dry and split end to a minimum.</li>
            <li>The oil is ok, but the scent is just too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It arrived nicely packaged and quickly too.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for dry, processed and curly hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have ever used on my dry colored hair.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best product around for dry aging hair.</li>
            <li>Best stuff ever to help dry hair.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful styling product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a much more strong perfume like smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the best oil for dry and colored hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that without even using the product, my hair has been extremely easy to comb through and much more</li>
            <li>Works fabulously if you have oily hair and don&#x27;t tend to use conditioner because it simply doesn&#x27;t work out to your best advantage.</li>
            <li>Best thing ever so light and moisturizing AT THE SAME DAMN TIME ..</li>
            <li>Great product, makes my hair feel so soft and silky, and my hair look so healthy.</li>
            <li>Even my mother, who is critical (but loving) of me said my hair looked great and when she touched it she was amazed.</li>
            <li>Really helps with fly a ways and makes hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The oil smells beautiful, like a fresh flower and reminds me of a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>This is the SINGLE best purchase I have ever made in my life.</li>
            <li>It is great and makes the hair so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly and was nicely wrapped so the bottle wouldn&#x27;t accidentally open in transit, and it was in its original box and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Great product to tame fly away hair and polish it.  </li>
            <li>Hello clean lakes and rivers!</li>
            <li>I have curly, frizzy, fine hair that I prefer to straighten, and on top of that, I color my hair, including two panels that get bleached and re-dyed purple.</li>
            <li>A good flat iron helped a good bit, but still it would eventualy frizz, even with humidity protectants and sprays.</li>
            <li>A good thing, no doubt, as every time I&#x27;ve put pure oil in my hair to condition it, it&#x27;s (understandably) looked greasy.    </li>
            <li>the result was very good, sometimes this is the only product I use after washing my hair....</li>
            <li>Very good product to protect from sun, especially for colored hair.</li>
            <li>It smell great and makes my hair smooth, shiny, soft, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light and gives it a healthy looking shine, that I have never had with my borderline frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>(may be except for chests...) and thus one of the most important features in females.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I get fantastic shine and my hair never looked better.</li>
            <li>This product arrived faster than expected, and the cost was the best I&#x27;ve seen!  </li>
            <li>It allows my hair to look smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft, shine, bounce and smell great.</li>
            <li>It has SPF for your hair, smells great and makes your hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, smooth, and healthy.</li>
            <li>I still had a bunch of fly aways and it never felt soft.</li>
            <li>The price is better if you buy it in the largest bottle available.  </li>
            <li>This oil is great if you have yourself some wild hair going on.</li>
            <li>There are silicones in it which give a bit of a smooth finnish, but I can achieve that with cheap hair serum!</li>
            <li>Naturally, I gladly accepted since it was free.  </li>
            <li>This oil is a fabulous product to add a lovely sheen to the hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it makes your hair so smooth and make fly-aways go away.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is spicy, light, simply lovely.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel so healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I first tried the kind that you get at Target and was mildly satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it available on line, and will always return here to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I bought mine from Comely People and have no reason to believe it&#x27;s anything but authentic (comparing smell to Light and the shampoo).</li>
            <li>and my hair is static free.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the lovely hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my curly frizzy hair manageable, soft and smell great.  </li>
            <li>I love the smooth finish and glow.</li>
            <li>The light oil is better for straightened hair, but when I wear my hair curly I prefer the heavier oil.</li>
            <li>great shine, not heavy on hair</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth by using Moroccan oil :)</li>
            <li>Its great on  natural hair, permed hair, weave etc.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product at the Israel Duty Free Shop and loved it.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt as silky soft, been as frizz-free, or even smelled this great before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair smelling great and feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li>Always great for my natural hair</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>Better price than salon for fantastic oil.</li>
            <li>The liquid in this bottle smelled like grandma&#x27;s perfume, not like the light, jasmine-y scent of authentic Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>There really is nothing out there that makes my hair look this good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells good.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the good service.</li>
            <li>and I loved the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and I loved the smell of her hair so much I had to get it..</li>
            <li>That was a special surprise!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s certainly not the best product out there for what it does.  </li>
            <li>Great for right after shampooing, and also for touch-ups when you want extra moisture, shine, and just feel good about your hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it soaks right into my hair, never leaving it greasy looking.</li>
            <li>and I bought my own bottle right away.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, for far better price!!!</li>
            <li>This has made my hair so much shinier....love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>This is the best light weight non-greasy oil for dry hair!</li>
            <li>I like the original one more.  </li>
            <li>I bought morrocan oil before I left the states to come out here and let me tell you my hair feels so good!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about it!</li>
            <li>but figured perhaps the original would do even more.  </li>
            <li>In fact, if anyone uses paypal and wants to buy my barely used bottle, I would be more than happy to sell it!!</li>
            <li>Love Moroccan Oil, 100% authentic and works great for my long hair.</li>
            <li>You will be throwing out all the other gimmick hair products because you will realize you are now a part of one of the best</li>
            <li>A reviewer mentioned how it makes hair feel like silk which is so true!</li>
            <li>I also use Aveda Brilliant, damage control, protects from heat, this helps for the flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for replenishing your hair without that oily feeling you get from other products that can&#x27;t hold a candle to Moroccoanoil.</li>
            <li>So I was even more excited to find it on Amazon for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>the original seal across the top.</li>
            <li>Item arrived very quickly and just as described.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and lasts for days.$37 beats the $55</li>
            <li>I received this product very quickly from the seller without issue.  </li>
            <li>broke easy</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil is a great after-shower detangler and it makes my hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Lasts quite a while and has easy dispenser.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>Great for aging hair :)  but only on the ends!</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthier, silkier and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>For some reason, this product is easily counterfeited.  </li>
            <li>shiny,  easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Pay attention with the amount of product you use as it can easily make your hair too greasy.</li>
            <li>It applies easily and leaves no residue..  </li>
            <li>and you are easy to go.</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t like strong smells this would not be for you.</li>
            <li>The smell stays in your hair all day, but isn&#x27;t so strong that people around you can smell it&lt;br /&gt;smooths</li>
            <li>It helps promote strong hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is strong stuff, so</li>
            <li>Good service, good product as expected.</li>
            <li>This is the first product which made my hair look amazing and no grease.</li>
            <li>I loooooove this stuff because first it smells amazing...</li>
            <li>The first time I tried Moroccanoil I liked it.</li>
            <li>The smell of it is pretty nice</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good, everyone raves its the best thing ever, Im satisfied, but not going crazy with how good the results were.</li>
            <li>the oil smell good, but the result isn&#x27;t that good as other people saying..</li>
            <li>Yes it is natural and kind of nutty, but to me, the moroccanoil has a really nice scent that sort of stays with me lightly throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, kind of musky, its strong at first but mellows out quickly.</li>
            <li>While logically my favorite is the pure oil, let me state that if you are on a budget you should try the Organix Penetrating Moroccan Oil!!  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser tried this on my ultra fine, fly-away, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tends to be \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>every 6 weeks and my hair texture is baby fine</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair, and this product keeps my hair under control.  </li>
            <li>but when I did get relaxers, moisturizing was nothing and my hair held moisture just fine.  </li>
            <li>Fine hair needs the one for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have think fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and oily</li>
            <li>my hair is fine and</li>
            <li>so I bet you could end up using a bottle every 6 months and be fine.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product after 20 years of frizzies finally a product that really works and smells great to</li>
            <li>and I saw that the Moroccan oil helped my hair tremendously!</li>
            <li>I keep this on hand for quick fixes, when I&#x27;m going out and want my hair to look (and smell!)</li>
            <li>Shipping was uber quick too!</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the Moroccan Oil treatment and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>I personally find putting a good conditioner on my hair after washing it, when my hair is still damp, and then leaving it in and letting it air dry seems to work best.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, try the Morrocanoil Light.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff works fine, and if you compare it to John Frieda&#x27;s serums, Bumble &amp; Bumble Defrizz, Silk Therapy, etc., it is far superior.</li>
            <li>Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just a little on my hands and smooth over the hair is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product, it makes my hair smooth, shinning and looks very healthy , I have been using it for like a year now</li>
            <li>This is the BEST thing, hands down, I have run across, at this point, for your hair!</li>
            <li>My friends keep teasing because I can&#x27;t stop touching my own head because I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is.  </li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan or Moroccan Oil treatments.  </li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil hair treatment is great for my thin hair and great for my wifes hair.  </li>
            <li>It gives the beard a nice healthy shine and helps to keep the hair soft.</li>
            <li>my wife loves the fact it is still available.....</li>
            <li>Had Moroccan oil used in the salon and the stuff was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 4 years and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil is a wonderful product if you have frizzy hair or trouble with split ends.  </li>
            <li>Someone empied the bottle, filled it with some overly purfumed vegitable oil (that&#x27;s what it smells like), resealed the cap and shipped it off.   </li>
            <li>I find I can get by with just this oil and maybe a light heat spray for styling</li>
            <li>It really tames the frizzies and has nice smell.</li>
            <li>This is great for some extra conditioning.</li>
            <li>also I enjoy the musky scent.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I blow out my hair which this also is works great for..</li>
            <li>This is a great product for Carribean and mixed texture hair.</li>
            <li>This product, although not cheap, is the best hair product I have tried in 40 years!  </li>
            <li>Oh, and it has argan oil in it as well, in case that ingredient is important to you.</li>
            <li>I have also found White Sands brand Orchid Oil to be great.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate to find it on AMAZON.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to fork over even more money for this, but I think it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>but otherwise- fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely fabulous.</li>

            <li>It is just like any silicon-based hair product and the \\&quot;fantastic smell\\&quot; is not so fantastic.</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t smooth my hair well or make it shiny</li>
            <li>i had to pay important duty amounting to Eu18.00,on arrival,I had paid for transport and handling fees already,the oil came from the USA</li>
            <li>save $10 dollars off a 40 dollar purchase or just take free $5 no matter</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;People can&#x27;t believe my hair looks so heathy, considering the length.</li>

            <li>Given all of the wonderful reviews of Moroccanoil, and the fact that most of the negative reviews of Moroccanoil were from people who had received a counterfeit from Amazon, I almost wonder if the bottle I received from Amazon this month is a counterfeit also.  </li>

            <li>a good natural treatment for your hair</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it a full five stars is that the scent of the oil could be a bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li>and you may have to spend more for the right stuff.</li>
            <li>This product is surely an elixir..arrested hairfall right away..</li>
            <li>I am an older adult and this product works great to keep my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>It works way better than my other oil products and has a great smell.  </li>
            <li>But all I have to say is that this very worth it</li>
            <li>The scent is very fresh.</li>
            <li>Two drops on wet hair and good to go!</li>
            <li>Oil is great for flyaways from the flat iron.</li>
            <li>However, I work long hours and unless I get some free time, I&#x27;m going to keep using the DermOrganic argan oil treatment, since I&#x27;m really happy with that product and does everything that the reviewers describe of Moroccanoil.    </li>
            <li>They are trying to make some quick money and what better way than on the back of our beloved but way over</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and I received it very quickly.   </li>
            <li>I found that it&#x27;s easy to pour the product out too quickly.  </li>

            <li>I do love this product and the seller shipped it very fast</li>

            <li>best product ever&lt;br /&gt;you can use for curly, straight , dry hair.</li>
            <li>It smells great, absorbs fast, and leaves my hair very soft and decreases the frizz.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for the bottom portion of my long hair.</li>
            <li>First of all I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>This product gives me shine without weight and the very best thing, especially in winter, is that I&#x27;m not left with TONS of static cling in my hair after blow drying.</li>
            <li>Product is well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>My hair actually dries afterward (no &#x27;wet&#x27; look) and looks great - very healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too familiar with), I think it&#x27;d shatter and spill all over the floor.</li>
            <li>i wash my hair and it makes it smell pretty :)</li>
            <li>At first I wasnt sure if it was going to work and was also concerned if it was overpriced.  </li>
            <li>The Original Oil Treatment 100ml/3.4 fl oz]</li>
            <li>This stuff is the original</li>
            <li>Package arrived, safe and sound, earlier than promised, and the Moroccanoil it contained is doing nice things for my hair.</li>
            <li>I originally tried this at my hairdressers.</li>
            <li>All the claims are true- leaves my hair smooth and shiny, dries quicker, and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product as everyone is raving about it.</li>
            <li>My hair is 90% better and not only that, I love my moroccanoil now!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited, can you tell?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time... works great.</li>
            <li>My hands smell wonderful after I work a small dime size into my hair.  </li>
            <li>I got my original sample years ago from my pricey upscale salon.  </li>
            <li>a unique smell...</li>
            <li>This is the original....</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>If you want an alternative to this oil, Orofluido is much better, smells better and has more lasting results.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how much product is contained in this product size and am delighted that the gift will keep giving for many months.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I just love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using Moroccan oil, but I think I want to go to where I purchased originally.</li>
            <li>It is a rich conditioner and adds shine without making my hair feel oily.</li>
            <li>and I used a small amount on damp hair before blowdrying and my hair looks the best I&#x27;ve ever seen it.</li>
            <li>Not too oily and has a wonderfully unique smell.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to continue to use this product and see how the rest of the results turn out.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light weight product, that does not weigh your hair down, and smells good too, then this is it!  </li>
            <li>Bio Silk is honestly the closest, but not hardly comparable.</li>
            <li>It does smooth and soften my hair but doesn&#x27;t really make it shine or look healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly over a month and notice that my hair is much healthier and feels great.</li>
            <li>Great amount of oil to keep hair from getting dry.</li>
            <li>I dry out my hair which this also is works great for..</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t make my hair more oil, just soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Apply it to dry hair and it gives a  great shine.  </li>
            <li>so we need a product that tames our dry fly aways.  </li>
            <li>i also let my friend with wavy hair borrow it after she got done blow-drying her clean hair, which was way fly-away...</li>
            <li>It works great on my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I even have added it to my dry hair with great results.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry hair that is light,not greasy.</li>
            <li>it will look dry because it becomes frizzy, fly aways, etc.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair more silky and smooth and if I decide to straighten it, it makes that process much faster and easier too.</li>
            <li>Immediately, you see added shine, less frizz, and a whiff of the incredible scent meets your nose.</li>
            <li>Great product for overly processed  dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really care for the product; probably a good option for a person with wavy or straight hair</li>
            <li>I have thick long hair and this is the best product I have experienced to help comb through when my hair is damp and give shine to when dry, Smells great</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft and silky, and it looked shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li>Wow, I love that!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still silky and soft and shiny and I absolutely love it!      </li>
            <li>excellent oil for hair and only a small amount can let your hair look good.</li>
            <li>I have in the past purchased 100% argon oil that was organic, and I found that yes, it did work ok, but for whatever reasons or additives, this moroccanoil is really the best product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Moroccan Oil to anybody who wants to have soft, beautiful, sexy hair.</li>
            <li>GREAT product if you have dry hair in the desert!</li>
            <li>my husband (who never uses anything special on his hair) loves it too.</li>
            <li>I just received a large sample of Aquage&#x27;s Silkening Oil Treatment, and it is a contender for my favorite hair serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly deal with Salon and More again.</li>
            <li>Specially for a blond (damaged hair) .</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I pay special attention to my ends with this after I curl it</li>
            <li>Received product right away !</li>
            <li>This hair oil is great for very dry, overprocessed, over-straightened hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great and hydrates the ends of my hair which is very dry.</li>
            <li>I have hard to manage hair, and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for such a great product.</li>
            <li>After reading many of the great reviews about this product I purchased a small bottle at my salon.</li>
            <li>The price is higher than most products but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>It smooth&#x27;s my hair and gives it a beautiful shine without a heavy weight or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>, perhaps this one is formulated for hair only, but Aragan Oil in general can be used as a wonderful moisturizer on skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw search Aragan Oil on iherb site and see what options they have as well...  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I expected great things from this product</li>
            <li>This is the best thing I have found to manage my naturally curly long hair.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product several times from my hairdresser and have loved it.  </li>
            <li>Morrocan oil has a light fresh scent unlike oils for hair that have an overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>This price makes it very affordable for me to be able to use it daily so that I can keep my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this product gets such good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I sent an email to the seller requesting a full refund.  </li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s as good as L&#x27;Anza&#x27;s, and possibly even cheaper!</li>
            <li>As much as I love the scent, this product really didn&#x27;t do nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found yet to help with frizzy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I have also used it on my hair after blowdrying, and true to</li>
            <li>However there are many fakes out there that look almost 100% real.</li>
            <li>We chemically treat it to make it okay to shower with, so it smells like straight chlorine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very smoothing (hence the silcones at the top of the list of ingredients).  </li>
            <li>It made my hair healthy, shiny, and very managable.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil products, my hair is much healthier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t oily that is true because of the amount of silicones it contains.</li>
            <li>The sales success of this Moroccan Oil for hair (made in Israel) is well justified.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good</li>
            <li>put it on after her bath--shiny coat and sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I have always been really diligent in taking care of my hair, but this product has made them even better looking, shinier, softer and with virtually NO</li>
            <li>One of my best friends has thick curly hair and used it.</li>
            <li>so, perhaps straight haired people get a better deal...</li>
            <li>Buying it in your local salon they usually charge more and I am really happy to buy it online at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok, but for real results you should try SBS Divinity Effect.</li>
            <li>i thought after reading reviews that the oil worked best for thick curly hair but gave it a try anyway.</li>
            <li>I notice that my hair shaines more and since I start using it, my hair stylist notice a change in terms of straight.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product was the smell.</li>
            <li>Moracconoil is full of silicone, which coats your hair, preventing moisture from reaching your hair and making your hair drier.</li>

            <li>Really helps my hair :)</li>
            <li>I love it in my hair and the feel is very silky</li>
            <li>The scent is overwelming and sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be more cautious about how much I use, but I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li>Just need to make sure to not put too much otherwise the hair will get oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for thick, curly, or unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>It does even smell like the true Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft smell that I get complimented on.</li>
            <li>I love Morroccan Oil products too much to be giving up on them so fastout 5 days coming from the barbers.</li>
            <li>This stuffs really helps my hair, no frizz, and works better than conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I will ALWAYS give you an honest, educated and professional review.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the softness if gives my hair!the shine with out too much oil and</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>She said it really works for her healthy hair condition.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Moroccan Oil, and its makes my hair so soft and moisturized!!!  </li>
            <li>This works very good to restore shine to my very old white hair.  </li>
            <li>I love moroccan oil it is make hair so soft and easy to comb hair</li>
            <li>Amazing results, does exactly what it days it will and best of all won&#x27;t eventually dry out your hair like other products (biosilk) that smooth and shine.</li>
            <li>and she has thin fine hair like me and that works awesome for out hair type.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Wish it worked a little better on the frizz, but it is still a good product.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair very bright and soft.</li>
            <li>is high quality stuff that will make your hair feel and look amazing, it really repaired my hair and since I&#x27;ve tried other products that weren&#x27;t as good, I&#x27;m switching back to this because I realized just how great it was.</li>
            <li>The bottle did arrive quickly but the spilled concoction inside smelled of suntan oil and baby powder ?</li>
            <li>The product still works the same, just smells different, which was the best part.</li>
            <li>This turned out to be such a great surprise, this really works wonders.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use much, but it really adds a nice shine to my hair w/o taking all the body away.</li>
            <li>It get&#x27;s oily quickly and also seems to get split</li>
            <li>I love the produce for my hair but the main reason I buy it is for the horses.   </li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t completely fly-away free, but it is getting better.</li>
            <li>I must say it has worked tremendously.</li>
            <li>Also, my color does not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li>I received it so quickly.</li>
            <li>It soaks quickly into the hair without leaving residue.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail quickly.  </li>
            <li>El pelo se te ve saludable y mejor hidratado, super brilloso y sedoso.</li>
            <li>I have tried alot of products to make it smooth and frizz free, nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li>The smell sort of dissipated quickly, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super slippery &amp; shiny with no residue.</li>
            <li>the same magic elixer i&#x27;ve been buying in the salon for $10 more.</li>
            <li>It is light, love the smell, and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal Amazon customer</li>
            <li>It was shipped to me quite quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really excellent for African hair types especially with damage.</li>
            <li>If you have super frizzy hair like mine and would love soft, silky, smooth and straightened hair without the burnt smell...</li>
            <li>Since I had to begin coloring my hair to cover some of the grays, it had lost the youthful bounce and texture that I had, but the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment has helped tremendously in retaining that texture.</li>
            <li>It came quickly, it was at a decent price, and I love the product.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>And if you want &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; argan oil in this country, you&#x27;ll have to pay a tremendous amount for it.</li>
            <li>This may be good for people with hair that is dry or needs special treatment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many brands but this one delivers and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by me as an alternative to pouring chemicals on your scalp :-)</li>
            <li>I put one more pump on my hair after styling it if the humidity is high</li>
            <li>for best results mix it with few drops of olive oil to last longer and after a hot towel therapy wash it with nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a non greasy hair product that makes your hair feel very nice and does not require any other hair product.</li>
            <li>Sure they did a good job making it look authentic and professional but believe me when I tell you don&#x27;t put this stuff on your hands much less</li>
            <li>I notice a real difference from the Morrocan Oil, which seems unique in it&#x27;s ability to make my hair look smooth and camouflage my split ends.  </li>
            <li>Another good thing is this product is so light that after using, I can curl my normally straight hair and it WILL curl and the curls last just as if I didn&#x27;t use the product</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and shiny the first time I used it and everytime after that.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will definitely order from them again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can make your hair to soft, so maybe every other day usage is best.</li>
            <li>The most amazing thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this bottle, and this is normally a product I love.</li>
            <li>I am still able to style my hair just like i normally do.</li>
            <li>Best product to spray on hair prior to using a flat or curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost too, since I use one pump for a full head of curls.</li>
            <li>Product, I have used it for a long time, good price</li>
            <li>it is fluffy and beautiful and knot</li>
            <li>It helps my hair look more silky and makes it more manageable since I live in a high humidity state.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful product for a few years now- can&#x27;t live w/o it now!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product to keep down the frizzies and a way to manage wavy/curlie hair.</li>
            <li>It is great at moisturising my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Great product for protecting your hair without leaving it greasy or weighing it down...  </li>
            <li>Finally a great product for hair, does not make it greasy or weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product to control frizz without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li>I have the best results with this method, as my hair feels very soft and has less</li>
            <li>Not only were the sellers amazing and super sweet</li>
            <li>The SHINE is AMAZING and the compliments came left and right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, just a few drops in my hair after every shower, and my hair is shiny, soft, and healthy, and it smells really good too!</li>
            <li>There are plenty of other more reasonably priced products out there that do a good job.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for softening, silkening &amp; adding shine to my fine, partly bleach-damaged, dark blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>it is really amazing my hair looks so pretty  and soft  </li>
            <li>This oil also works good on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Also, with a good haircut you don&#x27;t even have to blow dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for long frizzy straight hair too.</li>
            <li>and before I blow dry to enhance my blowdry and make my hair look silky and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Super for calming hair but also great for little girl tangles.  </li>
            <li>I love Moroccan Oil - it makes my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>so I wasnt able to style it, but I did notice my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and it feels extremely healthy.</li>
            <li>I love my stylist, he is a creative genious, amazing person, and is one of the few that understands my super long, but super fine, wavy hair that I wear stick straight most of the time.  </li>
            <li>and it actually looks healthy!</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase love it!</li>
            <li>a friend noticed the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>I used this EXACTLY as directed with NO noticeable difference in my hair!  </li>
            <li>Like me, you&#x27;ll come back for more!</li>
            <li>I first purchased this at the salon, but since then have gotten it on Amazon - at a savings!  </li>
            <li>My hair is much more manageable and soft to touch!</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I have recently started a new hair care regimen and this product works great.</li>
            <li>I know this bottle will last a very long time. :D</li>
            <li>so I am thrilled that I am able to buy it at half the cost now.</li>
            <li>But after more than 2 months of use, the ends and the bottom third of the longest part of my hair (which is where I am applying the oil) is dried-out looking and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>It brings out blonde highlights wonderfully, and smoothes any dry ends.</li>
            <li>It made it so soft and look super healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will notice your hair is a lot shinier, not oily feeling at all, and very smooth and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works on my fine straight  hair and my son&#x27;s  curly hair.</li>
            <li>Absolute must for fine hair</li>
            <li>I think if you have healthy hair, it&#x27;ll make it look fabulous, but if it&#x27;s not so healthy, it won&#x27;t do anything to make it look or feel any softer (or less frizzy).  </li>
            <li>Pricey but good not live without it!</li>
            <li>They have 100% pure Argan oil available and it doubles as skin care.</li>
            <li>And also, never cheat on your stylist, even if the other one is cheap and looks good.  ; )</li>
            <li>This little bottle is also great for swimmers too.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Moroccan oil for the last 2 years,it is excellent for dry hair!  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many products on my fine but coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>After reading a lot of the negative reviews, as I placed my order before reading them, I was worried I was going to get a counterfeit product, but mine arrived in a nice new box covered in shrinkwrap plastic, a nice seal on the cap, and is the Moroccan Oil I am very familiar with.  </li>
            <li>I like to run just a little dab through my hair every morning to help calm any fly aways</li>
            <li>The products are really amazing!!!!!!I could hardly imagine that  Maroccan Oil and Mask are So Good!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Perfectly prevent ur hair from frizzy, dull looking start from the first ur first use.</li>
            <li>So far in my life I haven&#x27;t used an oil based product that vanishes so well, this really leaves no greasy residue whatsoever and the hair feels like spun silk, even my damaged ends feel more light and wispy</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and provides hair with deep treatment.</li>
            <li>it smelled like cheap perfumed oil- not like real Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair really shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really does add moisture and help smooth it out.</li>
            <li>much the important ingredient is Aragan Oil</li>
            <li>It makes my hair hair silky and smooth and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>make my hair very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy, smells great, and keeps my hair with a shine.</li>
            <li>and they had it for much cheaper plus free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I apply one pump to my hair after washing, primarily on the ends and very sparingly to the roots.  </li>
            <li>This product really changes the condition of your hair to smooth, silky, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells lovely and makes my hair soft and shiny without getting them greasy,</li>
            <li>its absorbed into hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love this product, makes your hair soooo soft.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>For me, this is a pricey purchase, but one that&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil is immediately absorbed and leaves my hair shiny &amp; glossy, never oily or feeling \\&quot;coated\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money if you want to splurge.</li>
            <li>There is no oiliness, so it apparently is absorbed immediately.  </li>
            <li>I promise this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It would be worth</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>Worth EVERY penny of the $40 price tag, and it lasts for months.</li>
            <li>I paid far more at the salon</li>
            <li>It was well worth it at the salon</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny bc</li>
            <li>When I apply it to my wet hair, it makes the curls more prominent.</li>
            <li>I love it more when applying on my wet hair.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s absolutely worth</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S WORTH</li>
            <li>I feel it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it, would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li>but my sister thought it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair soft, tangle free, smooth and smelling delicious!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and shiny and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>If not, it may be worth trying DermOrganic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the hype.</li>
            <li>My hair always looks shiny, but never dirty or oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth it to try it.  </li>
            <li>, it is NOTHING like this: it smells lovely and makes your hair feel silky soft and look superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product made my hair soft and silky, healthy looking and shiny, with one use.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>love how the product makes my hair feel soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but this product is really worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this for myself and my adult daughters who also love it.</li>
            <li>However, definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>That way you are sure you are getting the real product for the real price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for your hair than natural oil, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth buying from these people.     </li>
            <li>but they were not even worth the shipping I paid.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!Makes my hair smooth and moist,I have used this product for a few years and I am going to use it forever :)</li>
            <li>Now, I have been using the product for about 1-2 weeks and my hair looks healthy, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>That should be worth 5 stars in any husband&#x27;s book.</li>
            <li>Worth triple the price.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, the light feeling of the serum, and I use a pump of this daily.</li>
            <li>it is light not heavy and feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Worth every dime.</li>
            <li>I plan to just throw this bottle out and get a fresh bottle at a salon.</li>
            <li>It controls wisps and flyaway a and keeps my hair young and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>This oil is absorbed into the hair so the hair does not feel oily.</li>
            <li>It is completely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and fresh again.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair felt softer, more alive and healed after one use.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.  </li>
            <li>but this product is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>well worth the price...</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and soft, I get so many compliments.  </li>
            <li>and it looks so soft and shiny love it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>I love Morroccan Oil products too much to be giving up on them so fast</li>
            <li>I love how this has made my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li>well worth it extravagance.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair look healthy and took away the brittle/damaged look completely.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using this, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the skin issues.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair silky soft and frizz free!  </li>
            <li>but so far I like it better than coconut or jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product many times before and as usual I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I used this product in a sample bottle supplied by my hairdresser &amp; liked it so well, I got this bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li>BUT TRUST ME REGARDLESS OF THE PRICE, IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I did purchase more 100% argon oil, thinking about being more green, but decided to cancel the order and go back to moroccanoil as it really is such a great all purpose product for my hair!</li>
            <li>It was worth the money i spend.</li>
            <li>I makes my hair feel so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>worth the price you pay</li>
            <li>to get sleek look, use very hot blow dryer setting and large brush!</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d share what tips my AWESOME stylist ( st louis ) told me to take home to my regular colorist - first when you towel dry hair</li>
            <li>This bottle seems to feel like the oil is much thinner and the smell is not as strong as the first couple of bottles that I purchased.</li>
            <li>Flat ironing is quicker and the hair has a much more light, feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I put about a nickel size amount through to tame the fly aways.    </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>This is better than grease and light than oils natural chemicals and makes hair very soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best way to use it, would be semi dry your hair, and when it is about 60-70% dry, rub 2-3 drops to the ends of your hair, and finish drying it.</li>
            <li>I have basically straight, fine hair and live in Houston where humidity is a huge problem, so my hair tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and shampoo with Moroccan Oil in it but nothing works as good.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my daughter, who has the thick, gorgeous hair and she loves it!</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of Moroccan Oil, but nothing seems to be as good.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and I will probably order it again unless I find some really great new hair product in the next few months.</li>
            <li>She was so right.</li>
            <li>Comes in a glass bottle and the pump dispenses just the right amount of product each time.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m trying to find what salon sent it to me</li>
            <li>It may take a couple of times of using it to figure out just the right amount to put in your hair.</li>
            <li>I was leary once I saw the bottle seal had been tampered with and could tell right away that it was not what it claimed to be.  </li>
            <li>I use it right before I blow-dry my hair, and it makes my hair feel so silky.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be all the rage in beauty products right now</li>
            <li>The oil pours out about the consistency of war m honey and soaks right into your hair without leaving it feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Morrocanoil&#x27;s formula is JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li>just right for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an &#x27;oily&#x27; feel, but seems to melt right into the hair strands.</li>
            <li>I could tell right away that it would start building up.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I wash my hair</li>
            <li>but I trusted this would work right</li>
            <li>If you use the right amount it will soak right in and your hair won&#x27;t be greasy.</li>
            <li>The comb glides right through after applying Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so different &amp; makes my hair look very healthy without too much shine.</li>
            <li>I was expected a higher concentration of the Argan oil, but it&#x27;s 5th on the list of ingredients - a fair amount, but not for what you are paying.</li>
            <li>My hair is really dry and freaky because of my career as a fashion model most of the time my hair receives many chemical that can really harm my hair.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the more I use it though, the more my hair is weighed down.  </li>
            <li>It has a light scent (kind of like a vanilla, but lighter and not as cloying), does not weigh hair down</li>
            <li>I am 100% confident that this product had been tampered with based on these two major differences.</li>
            <li>I normally can&#x27;t use the really nice hair products because I&#x27;m allergic to soy and almonds, but I think this product is more than comparable to those other products.</li>
            <li>and I noticed great difference in the texture of my hair, before it was less managable and looks frizzy now its very different and beautiful, I will contenue to use this product like forever, it really worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of silicones in this particular product so people with fine hair or hair that needs weightless products should steer clear, and go with a product that&#x27;s more pure argan oil.</li>
            <li>Very pure oil.  </li>
            <li>This is very pure oil, with nothing added.</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the less product you need, because your hair stays permanently healthy.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, smells fabulous, absorbs instantly and leaves no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>When you have genuine Moroccan Oil, expect less frizz, nice shine and manageability without a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>This product has also helped my hair become more healthy, less breakage</li>
            <li>- I tested the older vrs newer product on each hand, and the older product was clearly more fragrant.</li>
            <li>The Oil is easy and quick ways to style my hair and made my frizzy and dry hair into a smooth.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil was exciting when it first launched at our industry trade show, Premiere, in Orlando, Fl.</li>
            <li>However, shipping a little glass bottle in the middle of winter in a cardboard box with just paper wrapping is not the best way to keep the product intact.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist had used this particular product on my hair, so I was already familiar with it.  </li>
            <li>As you pass the hair you already feel looser, thin and soft, and the delicious fragrance and smooth, not bored.</li>
            <li>I have tried hundreds of other treatments for my dry frizzy unruly hair, and I have to say, this is the best.</li>
            <li>You will feel the difference right at first use.</li>
            <li>You will feel the difference right at first use.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and will last a very long time as you don&#x27;t have to use much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>and it looks amazing whether I blowdry with a diffuser or just let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>great as heat protection with wet and dry hair , smells amazing and makes my hair soft plus the nurishment effect.</li>
            <li>I left not only with a great haircut</li>
            <li>Great for african american hair.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil helps your hair dry faster and leaves a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth spending a bit more up  front and buying the 3.4 ounce size, as it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>Hair dries super fast.</li>
            <li>I love it, it leaves your hair soft and ready to comb.</li>
            <li>The Western preference for hair that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; by products means that argan in the hair is more useful as a pre-shampoo treatment.</li>
            <li>Love the smells works wonders on my hair, and they even gave me a little extra with a nice note written on the bottom!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, it smells so good and a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair very soft and helps smooth it out  </li>
            <li>This not only works great to tame the wiry wave or curl, but dry hair greatly benefits, and the aroma is &amp;#34;out of this world&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It does not give off a high sheen like  the others I have used and smells so clean.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have been using this oil for several years and we love the way it provides the right moisture for our hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found both of these tame my frizzy hair and give it a lovely shine better than Moroccan oil does.</li>
            <li>This will truly clean your hair and you can use the Moroccan oil regularly and not have the problems other reviewers have mentioned, and get the great benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very very very Good~!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t take very much @</li>
            <li>and I can tell that it&#x27;s helped my hair and scalp very much.  </li>
            <li>Like it very much.  </li>
            <li>I have virgin naturally curly bi-racial hair with a fine texture (think R&amp;B singer Mya).  </li>
            <li>I also use this as moisturizer for my skin too, and it soaks in leaving skin so soft, no residue, and supposedly fights fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>And it makes my hair so soft and grow so quick!</li>
            <li>I saw \\&quot;moroccanoil\\&quot; on the bottle, the (at that time) positive reviews, and the price was right, so I didn&#x27;t bother to read the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I thought I even put too much in my hair the first time, so I was worried my hair would be oily, it wasn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down and looks sensational.</li>
            <li>This is a true shine but the price is too high.</li>
            <li>I have also used the Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask and it too is fabulous and makes my hair very soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>Eliminates static, makes hair feel silky, shiny, thicker and doesn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li>This is my third purchase and my hair never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I initially heard about it.</li>
            <li>I first saw this in a salon, where the stylist applied it to my hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li>For shorter hair, use a dime-sized amount everywhere but at the scalp, and you will find that healthy hair is even healthier, shinier, and fly-aways are tamed, which is especially helpful with the onset of winter.</li>
            <li>The product is expensive, but one bottle lasts almost a year, and is a great buy!</li>
            <li>so I suggest if your salon sells it to ask them for a sample just to try it out first before you buy.</li>
            <li>My hair sylist used this on my hair for the first time a couple of months ago</li>
            <li>My hair was damaged and the first day I used this product i could see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>Lets see how much this one lasts!</li>
            <li>It was BRUTALLY hot.</li>
            <li>Sure enough I found it cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li>of course - and sure enough - my Aunt uses it too, and loves it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try!!    </li>
            <li>But if you are using this, you are most likely already investing in your hair...</li>
            <li>First of all, it builds body in my (and my husband&#x27;s) hair by holding the moisture in our hair.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>I first was introduced to this by my hair stylist, 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>Only i love the smell and shine its not argan oil ..</li>
            <li>Really works well with my hair!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>go to a hair supply store and smell it first to see if it&#x27;s your cup</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I love how this oil makes my curly, coarse hair feel and smell.  </li>
            <li>The only notable difference is the smell (and the price).  </li>
            <li>but I am not sure I like the scent of the Moroccan Oil so much better that I would continue to pay quite a bit more for this brand.    </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommended it!</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper on amazon then ANYWHERE ELSE!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and so do several of my friends!</li>
            <li>w/ it the first time our hair stylist used it on us.</li>
            <li>If I get out of the shower, this is the first thing that goes in my hair.</li>
            <li>and today is my first day with out it</li>
            <li>Absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, and the ONLY downside I can see to this product is that my hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl as well as it used to before I used the product, but if I strip my hair, I&#x27;m sure it will still curl...</li>
            <li>I have used MoroccanOil before, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I use it every morning before I blowdry my hair and it helps my hair feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been dyed pretty consistently now for about two years.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchase Moroccanoil was from a salon.</li>
            <li>Still, memories of phenomenol Amazon reviews of Moroccanoil still danced in my head, so about three weeks ago when my samples ran out, I purchased and received my first bottle of Moroccanoil from Amazon.      </li>
            <li>If I had more time to look into it further, I would - just out of curiosity and principal at this point.  </li>
            <li>I am currently using Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and love the product</li>
            <li>The result was there was not a noticeable difference between the two sides, basically both sides of my hair were soft and frizz free.    </li>
            <li>The problem I have with Moroccanoil is most of the time it seems to work well only when combined with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and when I am able to finally get this product to work by itself</li>
            <li>and it really moisturizes my hair and not only leaves it feeling soft, but also smellin good too.</li>
            <li>After the first use my hair looked healthier.</li>
            <li>so soft and shiny it is a fabulous product</li>
            <li>and I told her I had used moroccan oil for the first time...</li>
            <li>The product comes with a pump, and is in a glass container, the oil was thick but smells great.</li>
            <li>I first used this in DC when a stylist there recommended it.</li>
            <li>I will look at reviews more carefully next time.</li>
            <li>I can see the change in my hair on the first time using it.</li>
            <li>At the first time I used I saw the diference in my hair and my skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be a bit oily when I first got it, but not at all.  </li>
            <li>It helps protect against heating treatments like hot curlers and hot irons.</li>
            <li>First of all, know this is not Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>the first time i tried it was as a reccomendation of my hair dresser</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the smell at first, but I like it now.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my damp hair so when I wake in the morning my hair is shiny, soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>and it works wonder under my scrub cap that I wear consistently with in surgery.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for several years and I love it.</li>
            <li>formula even though I&#x27;m naturally pretty greasy.</li>
            <li>Evidently it has become all the rage.</li>
            <li>Its spendy but very well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Even after the first use I noticed my hair to be softer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped!</li>
            <li>At first, we would like to choose lowest price.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Now I am still an avid buyer of moroccan oil</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to several of my friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t post the review before I finish the first bottle.</li>
            <li>Will only now pay more to get the real stuff!</li>
            <li>I really like it！！！it is really useful for my hair！！！</li>
            <li>This has always been a great product for my long, colored blonde hair.</li>
            <li>This oil makes my hair mor soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the same Moroccan  oil that I purchased at a salon for a lot more.</li>
            <li>My hairsytlist actually put this on my hair and recommended me the product thank goodness for magic oil</li>
            <li>All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]], and discovered after several months, that my eyelashes were longer and fuller, and my eyebrows were growing in better.  </li>
            <li>The oil is not the real thing!  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product several times at the salon and the price through Amazon is much better.</li>
            <li>From the first moment I felt it in my hands and smoothed it into my hair</li>
            <li>This is not the real product!</li>
            <li>This oil is exactly what my aging hair needs.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair silky soft and and smooth.</li>
            <li>Since starting to use this product my hair is so much better.  </li>
            <li>First time I use this Argan oil.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped my hair!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>The entire line is fantastic!</li>
            <li>A tiny dab was all I needed to control the frizzies all day, and it left a nice, non greasy, smooth, feeling to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of sweet smells, so I enjoy the vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>and I all broke out after using this product on our hair regularly for more than one week.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t damage cuticle - it drinks up the first thing u put in-</li>
            <li>This is Not my first time buying this product.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>and I still only need barely more than a dime-size on my fingers.</li>
            <li>It may not work the first time, it did for me, but it will make a difference.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this, not only for hair but also the skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product--when you can get it when it&#x27;s not a counterfeit or if the seller actually delivers!  </li>
            <li>Been using Moroccan Oil for awhile now and this is my first time ordering it online</li>
            <li>My hair used to be stringy and straw-like, but now it is just soft and smooth since I use this every day.</li>
            <li>Really helps my damaged hair smoother and shinier!</li>
            <li>It really does!</li>
            <li>This bottle will probably last me a year, or more.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product and use it almost on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this stuff but was selling it at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>i have used this product before many times but this time around the Moroccan oil was different.</li>
            <li>By now you know that I am not only a licensed Hair stylist and Makeup Artist to some of the biggest names, but I am one of the most trusted on product knowledge.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>; I just use a couple of pumps in the center of my palm, rub together to warm up, then run hands over damp hair.</li>
            <li>You can pretty much drown your locks with this golden syrup</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and was delivered fast!</li>
            <li>would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now - maybe about a year, and I absolutely cannot stop using it!</li>
            <li>this helps to bring back a healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I then use my regular styling products on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I love Moroccan oil hair products, and this is no different.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is exactly what is sounds like -- an OIL.</li>
            <li>Using it on the ends of the hair and shampooing the ends lightly will allow some of the oil to remain and will leave a soft finish there; using the oil as a scalp massage overnight and then washing well in the morning</li>
            <li>The weird thing is that when I apply it, my palm IS sticky as if I had dipped it into some kind of juice !!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, first impression, my hair is sooth and manageable using the oil</li>
            <li>haha!  </li>
            <li>I squeeze the smallest amount into the palms of my hands and work it through the ends of my damp hair post-shower first, then finger comb the rest through the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the price can be scary at first, it is a great investment!</li>
            <li>I believe this is the best product on the market for difficult to manage hair.  </li>
            <li>After a few months of use, though, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as awesome, and one thing I dislike about it is that it&#x27;s so easy to use too little or too much</li>
            <li>I have very fine, long, and slighty wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Seriously great product that last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>It also looks a lot healthier, which is great because the sun tends to dry mine out even while trying to protect it with a scarf or different \\&quot;leave-in treatment\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have coarse dry hair and from reading all the wonderful reviews about this product, I thought for sure that I would get a product that could tame my mane.  </li>
            <li>, it makes it so much easier to apply the right amount.  </li>
            <li>Got my first bottle as a gift, and tried other brands since, but none have the amazing scent, or manage to gloss my hair without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Best part is a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li>It smoothes, reduces frizz and works great on tightly curled natural hair.</li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower with damp hair and then more when my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>though... expect a ridiculous amount of compliments on how great your hair looks, because you really will look like you just came from a magazine shoot!</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong when you choose top of the line!!!</li>
            <li>I have curly/frizzy hair, but when I use a little Moroccanoil in my hair, the texture feels so healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is sleek and salon-smooth when I use it (without the super-expensive flat iron :-)</li>
            <li>Then I applied a bit more and then flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived leaking, the company sent a new one quickly.  </li>
            <li>Smells the same, does the right thing, what I received is just fine and dandy.</li>
            <li>the hair takes in all the oil especially when it is wet because the oil locks in the hydration...great great product</li>
            <li>Morrocan oil works very well to smooth and soften my wild frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>A stylist friend recommended this product and I finally bought it expecting to be wowed with super soft and healthy feeling curly hair.  </li>
            <li>wet or dry and its never greasy and its great on your skin to its way worth the price</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that my hair was greasy after using it, especially the next day, and the smell, though strong, was lovely when it was in your hair.</li>
            <li>He is nearly bald, but the hair on the side of his head looks so much more alive after he showers each day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the prompt service, would definitely do business with them again : )</li>
            <li>This product is average at best and not worth the money.</li>
            <li>You are better off going to a real salon in your area and physically purchasing the stuff yourself.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair si soft, gives ir a body and more natural shine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product only for short term use.</li>
            <li>It makes hair soft, manageable, and most of all, it made my dry-dead-hair look and feel alive again.</li>
            <li>this is the real deal makes my dry course hair feel super healthy silky soft!!!  </li>
            <li>My experience with Maroccan Oil is the most amazing treatment to use for wet or dry hair!  </li>
            <li>The best part is, it DOES NOT weigh hair down at all, even if you use the product generously--I&#x27;ve tried soo many products that make my hair feel heavy and gross.</li>
            <li>It is great to get rid of those little fly-away hairs and it leaves your hair really silky and soft.</li>
            <li>: if you don&#x27;t mind paying an arm and a leg for an argan oil product that contains very little argan oil, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I have super fine processed hair that I have to blow dry every time I wash it</li>
            <li>This product is the perfect protection for you hair if you blow dry it and straighten it almost everyday!</li>
            <li>I have very fine curly hair that can be very dry.  </li>
            <li>a positive note, they did refund my money ASAP.  </li>
            <li>Have loved this product for many years...but growing increasingly hard to find in local salons.</li>
            <li>My hair almost felt hydrated when dry, yet very smooth.      </li>
            <li>This oil does wonders for my dry scalp and it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>It smells GREAT and works well on dry hair or if used when you&#x27;re getting your hair dried professionally, but for my needs it&#x27;s just OKAY.  </li>
            <li>I should really be the Moroccanoil poster child I talk about it so much!</li>
            <li>I went through a phase where my hair was pretty much indistinguishable from armpit hair.</li>
            <li>It was a nightmare considering hair is pretty much the number one thing that sets us apart from guys</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, it worked really well, and I would have sworn by it.</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair every other day and this is great.</li>
            <li>But whenever I put on this product bam, it obsorbs the oil and later makes it soft, smells great, as if you just did a deep hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>I tried this first as a sample from my hairdresser and it really made my hair shine.  </li>
            <li>This product is not the real thing, buyers be aware.</li>
            <li>My hair thanks you so much!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the Moroccan Oil and one bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use more than about a nickel size, so a 3.4 oz bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Makes my thick and curly hair very shiny and smooth! :)</li>
            <li>It was good to find a deal on Amazon &amp; save a few bucks!</li>
            <li>It smells good, and makes your hair soft, but so do other cheaper products...</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair soft, manageable, and full of moisture.  </li>
            <li>It also removes tangles and smells good but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weight down my waves, it smells amazing and it makes my hair feel soft/look shiny.</li>
            <li>Secondly, my  hair looked and felt satiny smooth immediately after the first application.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft, shiny and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>If you have really dry hair you will absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A quick application of moroccanoil after I wash my hair has completely done away with the dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied it when my hair was damp and dry and love both results.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised how quick I received the product.</li>
            <li>However, I find that my hair is even more frizzy and dry than before I began using this product.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super shiny, soft, and a lot smoother.  </li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone with dry or damaged hair :)</li>
            <li>This product makes styling much easier and pretty much eliminates frizz.</li>
            <li>It makes all the dry ends look so healthy....</li>
            <li>Entirely smoother and easy to deal with and soft/shiny.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair feel super soft, even at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>After buying the moroccan oil from this seller, it was genuine and felt and behaved exactly like the prior purchases I&#x27;ve made from salons.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Nearly every effective conditioner, from Pantene to the most ridiculously overprices brands, depend on some version of silicates to effect the softness and &amp;#34;silkiness&amp;#34; Americans have come to expect from conditioners.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was so strong, I had to toss the bottle after only using it once.</li>
            <li>The oil texture is nice and one full pump (quarter size) can cover my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I live in the north where we have very dry air in the winter and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>but I finally broke down and decided to give Moroccanoil a try because of all the great reviews here and on the internet.     </li>
            <li>regret getting the large bottle.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used everything from the Joico color therapy serum which is the oil in it(about $20 a bottle), this product (about $40), Organix Penetrating  Moroccan Oil (around $7), and pure Moroccan Oil (anywhere from $20-40).  </li>
            <li>I have also ordered pure Argon Oil from Amazon, but can&#x27;t use that on my hair as it looks greasy.  </li>
            <li>My cousin recommended that I try pure Argon oil, which I can use on my skin as well as my hair.</li>
            <li>That has  pure argon oil which I can use on my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The box had a large spot of oil on it.  </li>
            <li>However, after I used this for a while, I started getting large pimples on my neck and jawline.</li>
            <li>Cant live with out it!!</li>
            <li>The top gets loose during shipping and it leaks.</li>
            <li>I use it more as a styling aide but treats the hair as it keeps my loose ends under control.  </li>
            <li>fragrance is different and it does not smell great like previous ones I orderd form Amazon that come with pump.</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and my hair is dry much faster.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money - makes hair silky smooth for course, dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly light; hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down at all, which really pleased me since most serums are so heavy.</li>
            <li>This is the same product I originally purchased at a salon for much for money!  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and naturally blonde.  </li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair</li>
            <li>~ I received only ONE while they replaced, w/o my permission the others with a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version for blondes with fine hair.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s also a pretty decent deal.    </li>
            <li>My first introduction to this particular product was when my hair stylist used it.  </li>
            <li>Gives a very high hydration to the hair.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it moisturized my very dry hair within leaving a greasy look on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought some to use at home because I have very dry hair in the winter (static, brittle ends, everything).</li>
            <li>My hair never felt better this product mad my hair soft, bouncy and just beautiful without having to put greese in it....</li>
            <li>Great for ALL hair types with or with out color... will not dry your hair out, gives your hair lots of shine and  for those  humid days and you need to tame your hair</li>
            <li>I have straight fine blonde hair and this stuff keeps me from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li>The Ingredients are on the box and not the container because they do not want the consumer to become aware the high level of toxins in the product.</li>
            <li>:) It is a little pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but the outcome is very different, its amazing and it conditions the hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li>but the outcome is very different, its amazing and it conditions the hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>Love love this product, if you mistreat your hair like most females do, this will spare you those bad hair days.</li>
            <li>it was real.</li>
            <li>I bought this before, and it was the real thing, but this time it was not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>That makes me think it is not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Very pleasing-</li>
            <li>It did not even smell like real moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t even close to the real thing.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>Plus, the scent is so refreshing;it is not overpowering for the whole planet to smell it.</li>
            <li>the hairdresser wants to charge .....</li>
            <li>I have coarse/color-processed, straight, shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this oil!</li>
            <li>This heavenly scented hair oil feels like a real luxury.  </li>
            <li>it will absorb fast and you see an immediate difference.</li>
            <li>however, this has made my hair much more manegable, quicker drying and smooths any rough texture.</li>
            <li>Use the intense conditioner and leave on 30 min.</li>
            <li>Very tropical musky scent.</li>
            <li>Since I started using Moroccan Oil, I have never had such smooth and shiny hair, and it stays that way even in damp weather.  </li>
            <li>really gives softness to the hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I really does work.  </li>
            <li>Very Dissapointing</li>
            <li>Very beachy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use a straight iron anymore.</li>
            <li>and I really think I found something to stick with.</li>
            <li>it considering how much this product works.</li>
            <li>This product does not smell or act like the real product.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve sprung for the real argon oil, and two drops of that makes my hair feel like silk.  </li>
            <li>and I know what the real Moroccanoil smells like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products to keep my coarse fly-away locks smooth and nothing else, regardless of price, has even come close.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much longer since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Pecan Valley Ranch</li>
            <li>It is a shame that there is no guarantee for a real product here.</li>
            <li>and I much prefer it to the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li>HELPS SO MUCH IN CONTROLLING AND SOFTENING MY HAIR.</li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, too.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to add that hasn&#x27;t already been written.</li>
            <li>and the styling is much easier.</li>
            <li>Really adds volume and shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much, your hair will be oily.  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li>Can be to scenty if you apply too much.</li>
            <li>I went by a local salon, and they said they did not sell it, but that they had a couple of DermOrganic Argan oil treatment free samples sizes for me to try.</li>
            <li>The fact I bought DermOrganic even though I still have so much of the MoroccanOil</li>
            <li>A small sized amount rubbed into your hair will leave it managable, shiny and very healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>It also doesnt make your hair greasy which I thought it really would do.  </li>
            <li>This makes my very unmanageable hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>This does work REALLY well and is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>The last test I tried was to use the Moroccanoil with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream together which resulted in my hair being frizz free, and not oily.       </li>
            <li>This is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my mom who loves it so much</li>
            <li>She said it was the real stuff</li>
            <li>This product contains too much silicones.</li>
            <li>it is better than i expected.</li>
            <li>Well, he fried my hair, not the whole hair, but parts of it, and ever since that happened I have been devastated.  </li>
            <li>The one I bought at the salon was the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Our whole household uses it and it lasts because you don&#x27;t use much per application.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference this has made.</li>
            <li>Well I wish I had known I could get it on Amazon for so much less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair stylist always uses it on my hair, and it makes it so much softer, shinier</li>
            <li>so much so that I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, shiny and silky and smells terrific!!  </li>
            <li>It really depends on what you&#x27;re trying to do with your hair.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the REAL brand of Moroccan Oil by moroccanoil.com.</li>
            <li>I have never had that happen with real Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this product.</li>
            <li>It really has transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>This product really makes your hair shine and look healthier.  </li>
            <li>buy the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It really helped me to improve the appearance &amp; health of my hair..and also smell very</li>
            <li>and I use maybe a dime size amount for my whole head of hair.  </li>
            <li>People think I&#x27;m a straight haired girl.  </li>
            <li>My whole family swears by this product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely try it out if you need something to brighten up, strengthen, and smooth you hair.</li>
            <li>It REALLY works.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair</li>
            <li>After using this, all I need is some hairspray to style and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>Also protects your hair from hair dryer heat damage; not so much from straightener heat though.</li>
            <li>i have very curly (read: frizzy) hair...</li>
            <li>My hair is going downhill fast.  </li>
            <li>This produces very silky hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff ever invented for frizzy crazy hair.</li>
            <li>The product itself works great...makes hair much easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>But thanks to Moroccan Hair treatment product, it protects my hair from damage from this harmful chemical like hair coloring and hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>This product really helps hair that has been styled a lot.  </li>
            <li>Also really helps with tangles.</li>
            <li>, I know what was sent was not the real Moroccanoil.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil for the hair</li>
            <li>I add it to my wet hair, mostly on my ends.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair very shiny but not greasy</li>
            <li>This stuff really made my hair silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair really gets frizzy in humidity, and this tames the beast.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is not the real moroccan oil</li>
            <li>It smells like baby oil rather than the stinky musky scent of real moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy, unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair as much, to get rid of frizz.</li>
            <li>but it a way, after asking thwy told me the real Oragan oil</li>
            <li>This product, Moroccan oil, works very well.  </li>
            <li>I regret buying this product so much.</li>
            <li>I really like how my hair looks,</li>
            <li>but I still have some frizz spots no matter how much oil I put.</li>
            <li>I  wish the others who claim to be 100% M oil were really like this $$$ one.</li>
            <li>and I really like the Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>I also rub a dime size amount through it before I wrap it and it smooths my ends...keeping me from having to use the heat as much.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>This is a very high-price item to give no noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I can also use it daily on my ends to keep them moisturized and tangle free.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF REALLY HELPS YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I use it, my hair is really soft,and never clutter;but my hair is oil type,so I had dandruff after use it,</li>
            <li>The real thing.</li>
            <li>A this point, this line is very well known</li>
            <li>This is the real deal moroccan oil, my sisters.</li>
            <li>is the real deal-</li>
            <li>And this smells fantastic, so that&#x27;s enough, but it does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing to help in humidity</li>
            <li>I PUT A TINY AMOUT ON FINGERS AND LIGHTLY TOUCH THE ENDS WITH IT</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH MAKES UR HAIR LOOK GREASY</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have been using CHI silk for years and decided to make the switch because my hair is much longer.  </li>
            <li>When I use this oil, it makes my hair straight, shiny and weightless.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would help with splits, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a change there.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend you to buy it without any issues!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>And I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses this oil.</li>
            <li>Moroccan oil has really helped.  </li>
            <li>I doubt this is really moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Applied to wet hair and corrected the dryness.works much better than the Moroccan hydrating styling cream.</li>
            <li>Not too much or it will get oily.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as straight as it was when I styled it.  </li>
            <li>Its really worked well for me</li>
            <li>My daughter always wake up in the morning with tangled hair, but after using this, it&#x27;s much easier to brush her hair now.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to get rid of frizz and stray hairs when I apply it.</li>
            <li>The real company does not sell online or is anyone suppose to.</li>
            <li>get you the real product.  </li>
            <li>It really tames my frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>Too much of it can make your hair oily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Please do not buy it, it contains very toxic ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the real oil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically much on hair care, but this is my one splurge.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t mind blowing my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Would highly recomment this product!</li>
            <li>Much too oily for my hair</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t apply too much depending on your hair texture of course.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very durable.  </li>
            <li>really recommend it</li>
            <li>the real salon quality did.</li>
            <li>I tried a bottle of the moroccan oil hair treatment and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it helps my hair yet</li>
            <li>My whole family uses this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s part of getting ready.</li>
            <li>It just so happens that her mother in law is a hairdresser and when she does her hair, she uses this very treatment to keep her hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>Not the real product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased Moroccan Oil from salon before and this seems like real deal.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky without too much greasy buildup.  </li>
            <li>very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My most recent purchase was for my young daughters, who both have very curly hair and are prone to tangles.</li>
            <li>Brushing their hair after a bath used to be a struggle, but the Moroccanoil makes this much easier.</li>
            <li>It really softens and makes your hair behave.  </li>
            <li>and I find that this product really helps with the frizz and with locking in some moisture.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for straight or curly styles.</li>
            <li>I would get the light treatment next time.</li>
            <li>I BROUGHT THE WHOLE LINE OF THIS PRODUCT AND MY GOSH</li>
            <li>and I believe this product works very well</li>
            <li>It really is non-greasy</li>
            <li>(I found the 100% argon oil to be a bit greasier and left more residue) and it does leave my hair so soft and shiny and really speeds up the drying time either air drying or blow drying.  </li>
            <li>This did not smell like real Moroccan oil and I have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>And the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>and it makes your hair very stretchy and doesn&#x27;t help repair it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Just what she wanted and showed up fast.</li>
            <li>I just returned from Morocco, where I hiked the Atlas Mountains and visited cooperatives of women who hand-press real argan oil from the seed of the argan tree after shelling each one.</li>
            <li>(Brands which are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and free of silicone produce a similar effect from alternative slippery ingredients).</li>
            <li>The item came in so fast</li>
            <li>very protective cover to convey the glass container.</li>
            <li>Since it is an oil, I don&#x27;t use a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>The oil is very aromatic</li>
            <li>I have been using Moroccan Oil for years and this is NOT the real stuff.</li>
            <li>And, while this glue is fun to play with, I don&#x27;t want it in, on, or near my hair</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The bottle was Drenched in oil, the seal was barely on yet the bottle was full.</li>
            <li>The package arrived in good condition and earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li>I run a warm wash cloth over my face and the Moroccan Oil removes all of my make-up without harsh soaps or chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had complete strangers stop me and tell me how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li>It smells really good though (although there will be someone that will say it stinks:)  </li>
            <li>I think I will order more in near future.</li>
            <li>I have a naturally white beard, and this product has helped it to stay soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair which is naturally course feel incredibly smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I only put it on the ends, not up top by my scalp, because I have naturally oily hair and figure</li>
            <li>It may be more expensive than some of the others, but I am confident that I am getting the right product and will not have to deal with the hassle of returning it.     </li>
            <li>The product that I received in the mail today, while claiming to be Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment, was most certainly NOT Moroccan</li>
            <li>But with this my hair stayed soft and styled!!!</li>
            <li>size is not so big but pumping is very useful.</li>
            <li>After using Moroccan oil for awhile and finding the right amount to use after shampooing, my hair is truly soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>It was really great to tame frizz after blowing dry and using a hot iron.</li>
            <li>It does not smell strong or strange and its not as greasy as I had assumed.</li>
            <li>My hair becomes very bushy and frizzy in humid weather, and Moroccan oil has helped me to keep it under control better than any other product I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li>It helps tame frizzy ends and gives a nice finish to hair</li>
            <li>&quot; However, it contains very little real argan oil and mostly just the same inexpensive ingredients (they are listed on the box) that are found in most hair serums.</li>
            <li>As much as I like to use products that are as stripped down and natural/organic, I really like this product much better than straight argon oil.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because it does have a very very strong smell , it smells different once you put it in your hair than it smells in the bottle.</li>
            <li>both love the product, and got other people in our family to use</li>
            <li>Also it tended to be a LOT thicker than the original and had a different smell.</li>
            <li>I have tried generic moroccan oils but nothing compares to the original.</li>
            <li>It smelled completely different than the original I had purchased at a salon.</li>
            <li>All in all, I hope other buyers have better experiences than I.  </li>
            <li>Sort of like Biosilk or many other smoothing agents, but with nourishing properties, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair quite as shiny</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works better with other hair textures.</li>
            <li>Better than any other oils that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got it on the mail and decided to try it the same day.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products with Argan oil</li>
            <li>and it did nothing more than other Moroccan oil treatments.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really love this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Had medical issues and lost my hair, then took medication that hindered the new growth, this oil really helped me get my hair looking and feeling great again, my hairdresser recommended it</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>I have very long straight hair, fine hair - but lots of it.</li>
            <li>For the record, I have long, fine, smooth/straight/shiny, colored hair, and an oily scalp.</li>
            <li>You only have to use a small amount of the oil and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product,  you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>This product has been wonderful for my long thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I let my cheap side get the best of me and purchased a less expensive brand than this.</li>
            <li>This so far has been the best product for my hair, I have tried similar products from other brands, but since I tend to have dry hair</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to have and keep the softest, silkiest, healthiest hair of anyone you know.</li>
            <li>Love Moroccanoil, allows my curly hair to dry naturally faster without blowdryer frizz.  </li>
            <li>THE BEST oil for dry, thin, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very light on your hair and soaks in quickly never leaving an oily layer.</li>
            <li>Different scent than the small bottle I was using, but very nice.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be rather dry and fine, and she explained that the oil would help to make it softer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and color treated so it can get really dry.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase a full size after the sample runs out.</li>
            <li>My mom was sweet enough to give this to me as a gift</li>
            <li>So sweet will definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li>Now do NOT get me wrong, these products work WONDERFUL when your hairstylist is putting her hands to your hair and has all of the proper tools to get your hair bone straight and ultra glossy</li>
            <li>professional first used it on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I gave the full bottle away to a relative after trying it twice.</li>
            <li>It really surprised me the first time it happened.</li>
            <li>I like natural ingredients, and if you say a product is Moroccan oil, than that should be the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Nice small.</li>
            <li>I have course hair, and the first time I used this, my hair completely changed.  </li>
            <li>I use it on wet or dry hair and even on my little girls hair, amazing stuff, worth the price:)</li>
            <li>I use it on my dry hair to tame and correct split ends and fly aways.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>Most products leave my hair greasy feeling and weighed down</li>
            <li>This product did not weigh my hair down the way most products do.</li>
            <li>I love this product it calms my hair down</li>
            <li>Morroccan Oil makes your hair silky smooth, rids snarly fine hair, tames thick curls, and never leaves a greasy look.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li>Rich in vitamin E, carotene, phenolic acid and essential fatty acids, argan oil is one of the rarest but most valuable cosmetic ingredients.</li>
            <li>But Moroccan Oil gives me hair I can live with and really addresses those problems.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth and shiny after a blow dry.</li>
            <li>Love the product and couldn&#x27;t get it for any less through my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use it more often if it had less of a patchouli/musky scent.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with keeping my dry hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>Different labels, no seal on the cap and on top of that it smells like perfume and is totally gross.</li>
            <li>Start with a tiny tiny drop and work through your ends, adding more if you need.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy especially since I not only color but also perm.</li>
            <li>I have just sent back my most recent purchase after being assured</li>
            <li>On the back the most obvious is the fact that the counterfeit Moroccanoil doesn&#x27;t have the Registered Trademark and Patent on it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, i am african american</li>
            <li>/&gt;i reccommend trying their product.as stated above, it is better than my initial rating of it.</li>
            <li>this mainly feeds and moisturizes my hair)  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to prevent the annoying static and to soften hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it fixed my split ends, but it does leave hair feeling much healthier.</li>
            <li>After using several times, my hair is not only softer and more shiny but feels thicker.  </li>
            <li>Recently I bought more, again at the same salon.  </li>
            <li>This particular seller sent this oil in a well protected package.</li>
            <li>This product is great for thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li>My fancy main line hair salon uses it</li>
            <li>as well all with a decent price.</li>
            <li>I probably don&#x27;t need to, but I use it everyday, simply because it smells so good and makes my hair</li>
            <li>The transaction was processed quickly and was received the same day ordered as promised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant to be used very sparingly and will, after a minute or two, be absorbed, to an extent determined by the exterior dryness of the hair or skin,  by the upper layers of&lt;br /</li>
            <li>they wouldnt be so soft straight and very supple without it</li>
            <li>Further, it came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to style, nor use a flat iron unless I am going to a special event, dinner, etc.</li>
            <li>i was a little wory about this because the price and not sure it was going to work for my hair, but is really good and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Moroccan oil helps me tame my curls and gives me a smooth straight look!!</li>
            <li>The only problem is that if you use too much, your hair gets VERY greasy very fast.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, long blonde hair that is prone to breakage and this has been my savior.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it lasts forever because I only use one small dab on wet hair.</li>
            <li>You use only a small amount for smooth, shinny and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>Very soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>My hair was usually dry and brittle, but this product has really provided moisture- without being greasy!!!</li>
            <li>The real thing comes in a brown bottle with the product name in raised letters right ON the glass-- as part of the actual bottle.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants results right away.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have long hair which often gets dry on the ends, and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>PLEASE save your money and don&#x27;t waste it on products like this which essentially exploit the &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; quality of a product from a third-world culture but in fact sell nothing more than cheap, readily available (though highly effective, and the EXACT SAME whether in expensive or drugstore products) chemicals produced by the millions of gallons in factories here and abroad.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve been using the MoroccanOil product for 3 weeks now and I am not in the least bit impressed, and surprised by my disappointment.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recomment it.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li>Even with high humidity my hair did not frizz</li>
            <li>highly recommend .</li>
            <li>I would have given it a 5 star if the price is not so high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for smoothing and control</li>
            <li>I have highly textured hair ( my stylist calls it)  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>does wonders for my hair , and it smells heavenly!!i highly recommend this ,</li>
            <li>and they were too heavy, too light or just seemed to make my hair feel more dry than it already is.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments, especially when I flat iron after.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and easily into the hair with hardly any residue on the hands.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle of Moroccanoil about a month ago after much debate because the concept of adding oil to keep my hair soft and frizz free is not new to me.</li>
            <li>bottle of pure argan oil (which in its&#x27; natural state is cloudy and must be shaken before use) for the equivalent of 30 US dollars.</li>
            <li>My hair usually breaks off on the ends very easily</li>
            <li>I saw that it was a little more money and didn&#x27;t mind because I realize that the price of things go up at times</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair so soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li>Hope that helps a little:)</li>
            <li>and I can see how there would be people who have fine hair who might find it too heavy of a product and the smell is pretty heady</li>
            <li>Between old age, menopause and cancer, it is dry, crinkly, breaks easily and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>You could get better results with pure organic coconut oil (used in small amounts).</li>
            <li>Also, after a time, my very sensitive skin starting reacting to it causing some mild allergic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>The shine means that dry time is significantly longer.  </li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment was originally recommended to me by my hairdresser because of the dry weather here in Northern Nevada.  </li>
            <li>I always get compliments on how good my hair smells and feels after applying it, and a little goes a long way....</li>
            <li>A little product goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a good investment in the health and beauty of your hair.</li>
            <li>I have used it regularly for several months and the bottle is still very full.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed the older bottle states, &#x27;made in Canada&#x27; - and the new states, &#x27;made in Israel&#x27; ...</li>
            <li>I bought my Moroccanoil from a salon, and it&#x27;s clear to me that it&#x27;s the \\&quot;real deal.\\</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair which has a tendency to either be frizzy when styled in waves or when straightened... and it is very susceptible to humidity.  </li>
            <li>It seems a bit expensive but you don&#x27;t use a lot, Try it you will be happy.</li>
            <li>Your hair will be shiny, soft and very  manageable.  </li>
            <li>This oil seems to be one of the few products that will really make it smooth and shiny and this it does really well.</li>
            <li>The smell/consistency on the newer was just off, not thick and creamy as before.</li>
            <li>With just this one product my hair was so much smoother and felt so soft and looks shinier than it has since i was child.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is much cheaper and natural than this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of different products and treatments just to calm the frizz.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair very shiny and soft and doesn&#x27;t at all make my hair greasy</li>
            <li>&amp; thought that this was what was needed for my three textured head of hair (naturally curly, straight &amp; with a birds nest).  </li>
            <li>It has some natural curl/wave in it and seems to go where ever it wants.  </li>
            <li>product might seem expensive, but I assure you it lasts a great deal of time.</li>
            <li>The hair torn soft and very shine.</li>
            <li>It works wonders and really does leave your hair feeling soft and looking shiny.  </li>
            <li>I think this product makes your hair really really soft, but it doesn&#x27;t help much for styling.</li>
            <li>Even my fiance was astounded and kept giving me compliments on how straight, shiny, and soft my hair was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all and keeps my hair looking fresh, and I now only shampoo once a week or so.</li>
            <li>The safety seal/tag that is normally over the top of the lid was missing.  </li>
            <li>I bought the big bottle it was worth</li>
            <li>My salon sells a bottle this size (maybe even smaller) for almost $50, so while it&#x27;s not a huge savings, it&#x27;s a great deal for someone who uses this product daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got solid white, funky, old guy hair and the combination of these two after I shower makes my hair look much more in control, softer, and thicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a penny pincher, and normally I would just finish the product I have to save money.  </li>
            <li>Just have to be carefully not to use too much because your hair can get very oily</li>
            <li>not sure whether or not it is a real product in this bottle, but also I wonder about the added chemicals even in the authentic bottle...</li>
            <li>My hair used to never be greasy and I could go a few days between washes but when using this I have to shampoo more often.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a product that is going to over time repair long term damage more of a short term solution.</li>
            <li>mostly it just makes my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what it would do for normal hair.  </li>
            <li>Itnjust takes a few drops to  create a lovely, non greasy shine to my gray hair.</li>
            <li>Normally, my hair would have a ton by now.</li>
            <li>I love this product and definitely recommend it you want something that isn&#x27;t full of harsh chemicals and leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it - it only takes the amount about the size of a pea, and you apply it right after you shampoo.</li>
            <li>Everyone, including the new hair dresser, highly recommended Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is fine.</li>
            <li>It is sold just about everywhere now - so it is not hard to come by.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair super soft and kept me from having to use a conditioner or detangler in my hair for several days.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist was trying to sell me this product for around $70.00 at my salon, and I was so tempted to get it because the product left my hair super soft and shiny without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>and it is healthy for your hair especially if you blow dry or use a curling/flat iron.</li>
            <li>I mean... the reviews don&#x27;t lie - this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It works best if you put it in when your hair is wet, and you really only need to use a very small amount of it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny (under the right lighting conditions) but not oily, though I do have to shampoo every couple of days especially if I work out.</li>
            <li>(Same positive comments others have described - that&#x27;s why I bought it!)</li>
            <li>It started off great, and then somehow it actually started to dry out my hair over time while making my hair get an odd sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and frizzy and top that off with putting highlights in my hair, it can look a mess.  </li>
            <li>Recently I have had the Brazilian Blow Out treatment done to my hair which has left my hair straight, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>, he hugged me (how forgiving lol) and told me don&#x27;t worry wash your hair a couple of times with clarifying shampoo, use a deep conditioning mask, and take this bottle of moroccanoil treatment, use a tiny bit of moroccan oil on your wet hair before styling and a tiny bit after.  </li>
            <li>Also, this stuff is ridiculously expensive but it is very popular because it works so well.  </li>
            <li>It does hydrate a bit, and it works pretty good as a tamer for those especially unruly hair days, but not significantly better than some of the others out there such as Chi or Rusk Serums.</li>
            <li>I have used so many products over the years because I have very dry, coarse, frizzy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Plus it smells nice and you only need a little bit of product, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>old stuff was pretty thick, and had an exotic wood/spice smell.  </li>
            <li>The price is high, but worth it because while it works, it also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My new perm reacted with the hair color</li>
            <li>I discovered Moroccanoil on a visit to a new hair salon during my internship this summer.  </li>
            <li>But, after I was introduced to Moroccanoil, I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Living in new england</li>
            <li>I had read about Moroccan Oil in New Beauty and In Style Magazine.</li>
            <li>My bottle (which was a gift) arrived leaking, and since it&#x27;s a liquid I can&#x27;t exchange it for a new bottle.    </li>
            <li>but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I live and breathe by this product.</li>
            <li>Also, it will take a bit longer to ship if you live on my side of the country.     </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>Helps to minimize new damage.</li>
            <li>I cant live without it.</li>
            <li>When I went to a new beauty shop the stylist used this on my hair.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>Live on this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use conditioner also, but I attribute the new softness of my hair to this leave in product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it now.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment.</li>
            <li>she said she would just keep it and buy me a new bottle.</li>
            <li>Easy does it - you bet - this product is half price on amazon.com compared to buying it in the salon</li>
            <li>Just a pump or two on wet hair is all that&#x27;s needed to keep your hair soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>It has also helps keep my hair manageable and very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Very professional.  </li>
            <li>This Moroccan Oil I do like because it has made my hair very soft</li>
            <li>It makes it feel very soft and adds shine.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li>Without making your hair greasy, it makes it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Being that she lives very far away</li>
            <li>Need only a small amount of Moroccanoil distributed through clean, damp hair and then maybe a light touch after drying and styling.</li>
            <li>Be sure to carefully look at your product as I originally was sent some styling cream that had the blue label and is totally NOT the same.</li>
            <li>new stuff smells like generic perfume and is pretty watery.  </li>
            <li>The first time I purchased Moroccan oil I was in an expensive salon, I felt that the oil was so much thicker and the aroma was very strong</li>
            <li>My hair is dry, so it did help with that, but that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, easy to style and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>My girls can no more think about living without using Moroccan oil on their hair :)</li>
            <li>Used after the hair is very smooth,and not rough.</li>
            <li>This is the first product Ive used that actually controls frizzy hair during the humid Chicago summers.  </li>
            <li>Third, it keeps my curls really neat!</li>
            <li>I believe that the oil was not the same as the first order from another salon.</li>
            <li>and I was like WOW!</li>
            <li>The packaging was the exact same</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, shiny and feels stronger!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny now that I use this!</li>
            <li>A small portion in your palm will work magic.</li>
            <li>Not heavy!  </li>
            <li>Even after I washed it, it still felt more conditioned than usual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what came in this bottle, but I&#x27;m QUITE sure it was NOT Moroccan Oil.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by my hairdresser, and I must say - WOW!</li>
            <li>This is a complete life saver for my hair!</li>
            <li>She said she could tell it looked more shiny than usual.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>&quot; my palms on the ends and squeezing the ends in my fists.&lt;br /&gt;I flip my hair back and use another dime sized amount - first to the ends again and evenly through the rest of the hair with the remainder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this as a last resort (after so many purchases of other products) and it works.  </li>
            <li>i even put it in my two-year old&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>EXACT same thing.</li>
            <li>It took a long time getting here, but my daughter loves the product so it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Wow, changed the texture of my color treated hair!</li>
            <li>This is my second time to try and leave feedback as this seller removed the first one.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re hesitant buy the smaller bottle first and then work your way up</li>
            <li>Looks like this is the last time I&#x27;ll be splurging on the product and replacing the money spent with something more natural</li>
            <li>Do not need to use alot at one time so it lasts a long time and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They said it would arrive no later than 4/8, and it arrived on exactly 4/8.</li>
            <li>The great thing too is that you only need a small amount and the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>But, I noticed even on the first day a BIG difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the first time I ever purchased a bigger bottle, and I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with it for some reason.</li>
            <li>Completely weightless - all of their products are!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not the same product.  </li>
            <li>better use in fall and winter and just a small portion will be sufficient.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feel so shine and soft!</li>
            <li>It requires a very small amount to achieve good results,so that helps with the only con--</li>
            <li>It still makes my hair shine, but the perfume is a little strong.</li>
            <li>FYI, the scent is a little rather strong.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, wavy hair (to my back bra strap).</li>
            <li>They simply have used to much product for there particular hair type.  </li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>light weight oil-doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down</li>
            <li>This Moroccan oil is light so hair is not weighed down.</li>
            <li>I can put it in wet hair and air dry for a sexy beachy wavy look or I can put it in after a blow dry to make my straight hair a little more sleek and tame down those fly away</li>
            <li>I bought a small bottle at a local salon first to see if I liked it and then ordered the larger bottle on-line.  </li>
            <li>I use it a few times a week, very little dollop, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>The bottle had clearly been opened and re-glued, as evidenced by the stringy, booger-like glue that you find when you peel a brand new credit card off the mailer that it came in.</li>
            <li>and I am always trying new creams to make my hair soft,</li>
            <li>and I am always trying new creams to make my hair soft,</li>
            <li>Live by this stuff, use it every time i straighten my naturally curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>well worth the money, and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>i got chapped elbows every winter until i started using this and not a single dry patch all winter last year:-)</li>
            <li>Age and chemicals have caused my hair to be less than smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Genuine products &#x3D; Long lasting products!  </li>
            <li>But before I asked him, I tried finding it on my own, by going to several beauty supply stores, only to find an imitation called argan oil.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I spent the whole day going around saying to people \\&quot;feel</li>
            <li>Just a little bit of Moroccanoil makes my hair soft and shiney and easy to manage without an oily feel.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a little fine</li>
            <li>This is the best skin care - slow change over a couple of months, but after about a week, your skin isn&#x27;t dry, and stays moisturized, after a couple of months, your skin is soft, lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>One other note, if you blow dry or hot iron your hair straight, it helps with shine a bit, but if you&#x27;re trying not to damage your hair with all that heat, tug, etc,  then just putting it in your hair and letting it dry naturally won&#x27;t help it look better.  </li>
            <li>Since I have been using this product my hair curls together into smooth curls instead of the frizzy mess</li>
            <li>I have the small bottle of this oil and love the smell of it so much I decided to buy the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>I do my ends first and work my way up to the crown, then blow dry as normal.</li>
            <li>Better on wet hair than dry.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this oil on either dry or wet hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li>and my hair is back to being healthy looking in less than a month.  </li>
            <li>As someone with fine hair, dry hair, and a frequently oily scalp, it is one of the only things I&#x27;ve found that offers conditioning for the hair without making my scalp oilier.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the original might weigh it down</li>
            <li>I have somewhat dry, coarse, color treated hair and Moroccan Oil makes it soft, smooth, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>, I use 5 pumps on towel dried hair, put my hair back up in towel while doing makeup etc, once I take it down its very easy to comb through, dries as quickly as if nothing is on it and does NOT make hair greasy.</li>
            <li>At the price of this stuff I&#x27;d rather use pure argan oil, which is all argan oil &amp; none of the additives that leave my face, neck and scalp red and prone to break outs....</li>
            <li>so I can try a different (perhaps pure) Argan oil product.</li>
            <li>I did buy some at Sallys Beauty Supply Outlet thinking it was the same, but it certainly was not</li>
            <li>The thick, cloudy liquid in this bottle looked more like honey, and less like the clear, light, medium-viscosity Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>makes hair a little too smooth when you do</li>
            <li>A little Moroccan oil after a hair wash keeps my hair smooth and satin in appearance.  </li>
            <li>One only needs a little to restore hair to more youthful flexibility.</li>
            <li>If only it were a little cheaper I would buy it more often.</li>
            <li>The product contains less than 5-10% of the original oil in the formula.</li>
            <li>Love this.. use only a little or it will make your hair oily feeling</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure.  </li>
            <li>this oil if i use a little makes my hair feel soft and healthy and it stays that way until the next wash.   </li>
            <li>I work it through my wet hair prior to drying it straight and then smooth a little over the finished style to calm any flyaways.</li>
            <li>Not only are the frizzies gone but this amazing oil cuts drying time of my hair, whether by air or hairdryer, by at least two-thirds the time.</li>
            <li>It comes in a huge box and feels heavy</li>
            <li>I dis not give it a good chance, for the bad smile it have thats why i decid to</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, especially if you put it on while hair is still damp, plus it really controls frizz and flyaways.</li>
            <li>and I just use a pea sized amount on towel dried hair just before I blow dry/flat iron...and it leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Naturally I have very curly, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair feeling soft, keeps the frizzies away, and lets my natural waves look soft.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to anyone and repurchase this product,  because clearly i am almost out.</li>
            <li>I knew it was different from anything else I had tried, my hair feld light weight and bouncy even though it was still wet.  </li>
            <li>It really provides deep conditioning to my hair and keeps it soft and shiny even after coloring and blow drying.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks totally different from real Morrocian oil.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural  </li>
            <li>The color is lighter and it does not make my hair feel as soft.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how soft my hair was when the stylist used this oil on my hair, without being oily or stringy.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair sooo soft</li>
            <li>It left my hair greasy and didn&#x27;t smell anything like the real product.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It keeps it soft and silky and never oily</li>
            <li>I color my hair and it is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>It makes the frizziest hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li>This oil makes my curly hair have soft bouncy curls and when I straighten it, it&#x27;s soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>After drying, I straighten my hair and it looks and feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and it still wasn&#x27;t soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>If you have stick straight hair already you likely don&#x27;t need this product -</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>They last a long time as she says that she only needs a small amount to get great hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped to maintain the overall condition of my hair through processing and dye jobs.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil makes my hair soft, frizzfree...</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I do use the product frequently</li>
            <li>If I had to pick one singular beauty product that has completely changed my life</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product was recommended to me</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed that it has such a powerfull scent.  </li>
            <li>it actually makes blowdrying soo much faster.  </li>
            <li>This along with Paul Mitchell Skinny and Paul Mitchell Taming Spray keeps my hair feeling soft and holds the curls.</li>
            <li>First of all let me start by saying that I am a man with long hair.</li>
            <li>my hair feels so soft after using it.</li>
            <li>My hair also tends to get brittle and this product keeps my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Just soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>As a faux-blonde I rely on my Moroccan Oil to keep my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am in my forties and color my hair frequently</li>
            <li>We use the hydrading mask, intense curl cream, shine spray, and of course the actual moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>but the oil treatment made my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>(not affiliated-just a lover of natural products)</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your time buying this product unless you have the time, money, and patience to deal with your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is NOT the product to use just a \\&quot;dime sized amount\\&quot; with when transitioning from relaxed to natural.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had  never wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy and can frizz in damp weather.</li>
            <li>No heavy oiliness...</li>
            <li>It makes it soft, shiny and smell</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>The Moroccanoil purchased from Amazon was totally off the M on the front had an outline which the real bottle does not.</li>
            <li>My curls are defined and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>so far.      </li>
            <li>it feels really soft.  </li>
            <li>So if you sensitive to smell, skip it.</li>
            <li>(Which is colored quite frequently)  </li>
            <li>This hair oil makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally soft, but senior year I decided to get highlights on my hair.</li>
            <li>I really think it makes a difference in the condition of my hair when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li>The product far exceeded her expectations.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really soft like silk, no tangle, no fizzy.</li>
            <li>, it leaves my hair shiny and soft curls.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>So -- I recommend you go to the Moroccan Oil website and order from them directly.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t find it any different than a biolage or biosilk hair tamer/smoother oil.  </li>
            <li>And my hair shined and was so soft.</li>
            <li>My old colorist told me not to</li>
            <li>Moroccan oil is the only thing that really works well.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humid weather.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy ( on my hair).</li>
            <li>My hair moist and soft.</li>
            <li>This is the one to use if you want natural looking hair.  </li>
            <li>It prevents it from drying out and keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have blond hair with natural wave which in the winter I tend to straighten a lot which has caused my hair to become damaged with a straw-like texture.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser picked me up a bottle from a hair show, and I could tell it was actually the real stuff in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Keeps her hair soft, hydrated, &amp; feels lightweight.</li>
            <li>it makes your hair so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that has become considerably smoother with this serum.</li>
            <li>I use it to keep my hair soft and protect it from the heat of my styling irons.</li>
            <li>Her hair shined and was so soft.</li>
            <li>how soft my hair is!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft</li>
            <li>It also has some out of control wave/curl action and frizz that get magnified when it&#x27;s humid</li>
            <li>so it gets straight ironed regularly</li>
            <li>I have natural  curly hair thats colored</li>
            <li>My boyfriend likes the smell, so that goes to show the smell is really just a personal preference.</li>
            <li>Wow~</li>
            <li>I also note that my old bottle has an expiration and this does not.</li>
            <li>but I have no way to know how old it</li>
            <li>It actually makes it appear as if my hair is much thicker again.  </li>
            <li>and now they are soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually trying to use up the bottle as fast as I can</li>
            <li>My hair feels much smoother after putting this regularly.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil Hair treatment makes my hair feel fuller and yet soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Moroccan oil.it leaves my hair so soft and frizz</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves hair softer and much shinier.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a product that would help control the frizz of my naturally curly hair as well as protect from blow-drying.  </li>
            <li>Can spend any amount to get my hair and skin fixed.  </li>
            <li>I have used it on my 4.5 year old son who had no body to his hair.</li>
            <li>but now all have started complimenting my sons hair as soft, bouncy and shiny for his age.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s making  my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>The product was old and expired.</li>
            <li>and I do achieve soft, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair shine and soft.  </li>
            <li>It turns my permed color treated hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>be applied to your scalp for additional moisture and will not make your hair appear oily if you put it directly on your scalp&lt;br /&gt;Adds</li>
            <li>Definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this.  </li>
            <li>and I also know it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but in my case it keeps the hair smoother, shinier and with its natural volume.</li>
            <li>And it feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your time with this company and go out to a salon for your purchase.</li>

            <li>and there is no heavy feel to it.  </li>

            <li>Hair soft,  </li>
            <li>She is 80 years old.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li>so far i like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried off brands and they absolutely are not the same.  </li>
            <li>Not a heavy feeling either</li>
            <li>My hairdresser started using this on my hair and made it so soft after a blow out.  </li>
            <li>I got the same results at home as if I came straight from the salon.  </li>
            <li>I becomes soft, manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li>my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>I used the oil to help tame my fine and curly hair.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling silky soft, not oily.  </li>
            <li>After applying it to my hair/scalp weekly I rub the rest into my hands as it makes  them soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>It does make my hair soft and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humid weather.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft without being oily</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>The production of real argan oil is labor-intensive and the product, even in Morroccan dirhans (the counrty&#x27;s currency) is relatively costly.</li>
            <li>This oil has completely revived my hair and i have never stopped buying it since my 1st use.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and protects it from breaking.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair baby soft and shiny....</li>
            <li>It took on a soft and shiny feel.</li>
            <li>I think this bottle will last me a long time - I&#x27;ve had it for a month and the bottle is still almost full.</li>
            <li>Worth every $$$ and last and last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries by itself and although I see 10% frizz, the hair looks so thick and healthy</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair like me, be careful not to use to much oil because I did that the other day</li>
            <li>It works pretty good as far as reducing frizz and making hair easy to comb through, but the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t purchase this item due to the large amount of folks saying it was not the real product.  </li>
            <li>it is good for winter skin, dry nails, and a few drops go a long way, leaving no oily feeling at all.  </li>
            <li>A new, full bottle would have seemed the correct solution(the oil is not cheap).</li>
            <li>work it through, THEN comb through ( I&#x27;ve heard similarly to put  conditioner in hair right after wetting PrIOR to going in ocean salt</li>
            <li>Every single time, my hair stylist says &amp;#34;Wait - HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE I SAW YOU LAST?!?!&amp;#34; She can never believe it&#x27;s been 6 months to a year since I&#x27;ve last seen her because my hair is so healthy.</li>
            <li>in all, it Will suffice for a quick fix for minor frizz, but definitely not a &#x27;treatment&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of Moroccanoil and I absolutely love it, along with several other products from them.</li>
            <li>hair is back to normal color!</li>
            <li>I use just a dab after I get out of the shower, while still a bit wet, and the comb goes right through the hair.</li>
            <li>I put two pumps on my wet hair right after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>The directions recommend less but because I love it soo much, I have used less</li>
            <li>I have tried lots and lots of stuff to tame, smooth, and make it shine.  </li>
            <li>I rarely have to use other products to get soft shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and it really helps control frizziness.  </li>
            <li>did not  make my hair shine immediately, but as I use it more, my hair seems to look less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Great for people with dry, damaged or permed hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I use this product pretty much every day and have been for a little over the year</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and this is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair, especially when it gets wet, i.e first get out of shower.</li>
            <li>If you have hair that is a bit dry, or simply want to add a nice aroma to your hair, in addition to giving your hair a little protection from drying out, this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Just a little bit seems to put a nice sheen and shine to your hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is good for fine thin straight hair, might make it greasy or weigh it down..</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is good for fine thin straight hair, might make it greasy or weigh it down..</li>
            <li>My hair is about 2 inches past my shoulders, fine and curly with medium sized curls.</li>
            <li>I also love the oil&#x27;s subtle scent on my daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>but a few drops comes a long way :)</li>
            <li>The aroma is slightly musky but not overpowering and wears off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Found it quickly and ordered it for much less than in salons.  </li>
            <li>No more hair conditioners (either wash out or leave in) as the oil makes my hair glisten wonderfully in natural light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a fake bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have had Moroccan Oil before and the bottle I recently purchased does not feel like the first bottle I purchased from a local shop.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s all, no other ingredients, all natural.  </li>
            <li>I am otherwise super lo-fi in terms of hair styling and maintenance - I never blow dry, flat iron, curl, etc.</li>
            <li>Well, after the hype surrounding this product, I had high hopes for my coarse curly hair and it being a match made in heaven.      </li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product as well as the accompanying deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Would highly recomend it for people with the same hair problems as me.</li>
            <li>Ove tried a lot of high end brands and keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li>I SO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE MOROCCAN OIL LINE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not entirely sure what Moroccan Oil is specifically supposed to achieve (in terms of growth or hair repair etc.), but it smells nice and adds light moisture and shine that I can use a few times a week without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>Let me say right away that men and women can both use it, its not something that only half of us can enjoy, I think my friend Danny who&#x27;s also a hair product fanatic will really like this!    </li>
            <li>Sometimes if your hair is really dry it will sit on top for a few minutes</li>
            <li>I apply it to my wet hair midshaft to ends and my hair is soft, and stays super soft, all day long.</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely, it doesn&#x27;t drag down my hair and while the ends are a bit dry, this really seems to nourish my hair.  </li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way, and my hair feels soft and frizz free all day!</li>
            <li>After a shower I put a small amount on my fingers and start at the ends and lightly through my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is relatively straight, long with a medium texture</li>
            <li>After a shower I put a small amount on my fingers and start at the ends and lightly through my hair.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair and use maybe a nickel-sized dollop of it at any one time - too much and your hair can start looking greasy.</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap flowers and feels like an oil slick.</li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The product was also a different color than what I normally purchase.  </li>
            <li>And, lastly, but not least, my husband has not had problems with dandruff since using the Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li>With this oil conditioner was not needed, I´d just washed with shampoo and applyed three drops of oil in the hair still wet and ready!</li>
            <li>It \\&quot;calms\\&quot; frizzies better than other products and though it&#x27;s more expensive than silicone-based shine and anti-frizz solutions, you only need a wee bit</li>
            <li>The effect on my hair was OK, but it was expensive compared to other products that have the same or better effect.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products, cheaper and more expensive, but I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than what was in stores and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>While I am a true lover of Moroccan Oil, I am also just like every other girl who has damage done to her hair on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not speaking for ALL women but mostly for those w/ thick, coarse hair AND for those who are in the relaxed to natural transitioning phase.  </li>
            <li>Regular serums are too heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The package looks the same but the consistency is thinner, the smell isn&#x27;t right and the way it leaves my hair is definitely not the same.  </li>
            <li>first time I used it, I applied about two pumps worth to my towel dried hair and then let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier and the product has more application options, in my opinion, than other products I&#x27;ve tried previously.  </li>
            <li>My split ends are still there, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones coming back.</li>
            <li>when it started running low, I went to my orders, clicked purchase again and ordered a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>I live in a beach resort on the east coast, and I am constantly fighting the humidity during the summer months.</li>
            <li>She has very long straight hair and loves how it feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>hair is very curly and can get quite dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>I prefer to blow dry it straight and this product makes it smoother and silkier and tends to help the puffiness.</li>
            <li>but once hair is completely dry you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>I have curly dry hair and in just a week my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>would recommend this if you have dry hair or curly hair, it really moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It really tames my curly hair that is dry from color treatment.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair, but it is chemically treated and can be dry.  </li>
            <li>My ends tend to get dry, no matter how much I condition, and this helps to extend the time between visits to the salon for a trim to shape them up</li>
            <li>- I also think it makes my hair dry much faster</li>
            <li>The easiest check is that on the real product, above the L on the white Moroccanoil writing on the bottle, has a (R)- for registered trademark.</li>
            <li>I have the real oil and it smelled differently and worked differently.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair nearly as shiny and soft as the DermOrganic Argan Oil samples from the local salon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently bought the restorative mask and conditioner too, which do the same thing and don&#x27;t require me to use the oil much.</li>
            <li>My former hairdresser suggested this product a few years ago and it has worked fabulously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the real Moroccan Oil for quite a few years now and this stuff is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and long layered and when I use this, 2 pumps worth on 3/4 of lower length of hair</li>
            <li>I use a touch more on my daughter&#x27;s thick waist length hair with similar results.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for naturally curly thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Next morning, I felt my hair became very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have tried it a few times to give it a chance and because of the high price and money wasted and each time I dislike it even more.</li>
            <li>I put it in right before I blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li>If you use a curling iron you may have to spray a little hair spray first since the hair is very soft</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this supposedly healing oil to anyone with very kinky unpermed or not fine hair but rather the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>In general my hair feel regenerated in all ways, scalp to splitendless tip!</li>
            <li>This stuff is like no other oil.</li>
            <li>So not sure if its original.</li>
            <li>The result was some of my hair was frizzy, other parts were oily looking and yet other parts were soft and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>As some oils are considered hot oils, just due to the spice they are derived from.</li>
            <li>I have long, thin, straight hair who is prone to having static.</li>
            <li>Still not sure if this is the original oil that I have bought at the salon.</li>
            <li>There is no other product of this type that works as well on your hair.</li>
            <li>split ends like no other product&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>hair is coarse with natural curl which can become frizzy and out of control!</li>
            <li>In my current attempt to go \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot;, my hair is a giant sponge and this product does not and WILL not do anything luxurious for the new growth that is coming in like wild fire.  </li>
            <li>so when I take a shower and damp some on my wet hair and let it air dry, it makes such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I can see the shine on dry hair if I have a pulled back &#x27;do, but if my curly hair is just running wild, I need a whole lot of it to see a difference.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly thick but baby fine.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, if the cap was loose in the first place somebody was messing with the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy but worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but, in my opinion, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little obnoxious, but still worth it.</li>
            <li>but I wouldnt say it&#x27;s any better than the Silkease I have used for years which is less than half the price.</li>
            <li>It also makes your hair shiny and soft, holds down frizz and static, and can be used on either wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try something new with my hair because my long hair always got dry and took me time to fix it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied a very small amount (which isn&#x27;t always easy to do since there is no pump) and it made my hair feel like there was product in it.</li>
            <li>It breaks less and has more shine and bounce than with the Bio Silk, which has alcohol in it, which can dry out african american hair.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if the formula was somehow \\&quot;improved\\&quot; or changed but when I open the little bottle that is almost empty, it smells great.</li>
            <li>Also, it makes my hair super, duper soft - not even kidding you, I can use a wide tooth comb and comb through it as if it&#x27;s not even wet!</li>
            <li>I live in southern Arizona where it&#x27;s exceptionally arid, and my hair suffers.</li>
            <li>I put this on my hair daily and never have to roll my long hair as this puts so much body in it.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine hair that tangles and frizzed like crazy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it in place of lotion on my face and noticed a marked improvement under my eyes and overall texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m that girl with natural blonde hair....</li>
            <li>And naturally, I sweat, and my hair is a giant frizz ball.</li>
            <li>The oil offers some protection from the heat and keeps the hair hydrated enough that it doesn&#x27;t frizz out of control.</li>
            <li>The result was soft silky feeling hair, especially at the tips of the hair, where i am prone to split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>some of the back will have a natural wave to it.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by someone who processes her hair often, by dying her hair different colors frequently.</li>
            <li>I have short, naturally curly and soft mixed race hair.  </li>
            <li>I use Redkin All Soft cream conditioner (i use a tiny bit and leave it in after i am completely done shampooing and conditioning with a different product)</li>
            <li>I decided to repeat this test again later in the week under the assumption that I perhaps I used too much oil or didn&#x27;t spread it out enough but the ended up with the same results.    </li>
            <li>It is not even real argan oil, argan oil is a minimal part of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>The Moroccanoil is the only product that I have used so far that does not leave a sticky residue and tames my frizz.</li>
            <li>Obviously, bieng in the water frequently can take a toll on your hair.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s young but I always believe that hair reflects your personality and some bit of work begins from childhood itself as my mother did the same for me.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone; especially people with naturally curly or course hair.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I thought that one day I&#x27;d stop using it.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it actually does anything to actually treat the hair but overall have been using it for a while and love it</li>
            <li>My hairstylist first recommended it a few years ago, and this product--along with the Morrocanoil Shampoo and Conditioner, are all I need to keep my hair soft, shiny, and literally looking like celebrity hair.</li>
            <li>Smells and works completely differently from the way the actual product normally does.</li>
            <li>I figured this would leave my hair heavy and opaque when first tried it, but it surprised me.</li>
            <li>I am addicted to coloring, curling and abusing my hair and after I step out of the shower and feel better about it, ha.</li>
            <li>I put it on towel dried freshly washed hair before I roller set it and sit under the dryer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I was kind of skeptical.</li>
            <li>FOR MY THIN AND MOST OF THE TIME FRIZZY HAIR.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a few weeks, but I&#x27;m a true believer.</li>
            <li>This product worked ok for me, but not great.  </li>
            <li>I also just purchased the \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version which is even better if you have thin hair.    </li>
            <li>If you have crazy cavewoman fly-way frizzies like i do, this stuff makes your &#x27;do look as good as a blow out on wash-n-wear hair.</li>
            <li>- not really sure if that is true or not,</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nice and silly.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is kind of useless when I have it.</li>
            <li>Pricy but worth it for manageable hair everyday.</li>
            <li>YOU SAVE BY NOT PURCHASING THESE FAKE PRODUCTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION OF YOUR CHOICE THAT ASSISTS THIRD-WORLD CITIZENS IN BETTERING THEIR LIVES.</li>
            <li>Perhaps there is not as much argan oil as one would expect, but I can&#x27;t slather pure oil on my hair since that would just make it stick together in one ugly clump, so less oil in this product is a good thing for me.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and I feel like it really weighs it down when I wear it in my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it really keeps the frizz down on my natural curls.</li>
            <li>It perfumes your hair in a subtle &#x27;Arabian Nights&#x27; kind of way that I haven&#x27;t found in any other shine product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfumes due to allergies but this is a nice subtle tone that does not affect me.</li>
            <li>I flip my head upside down and apply to ends first alternating \\&quot;tapping\\</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works with no greasy feeling (and I use 3-5 pumps) or weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product before from other sites, i like the oil I purchased before, but this one from amazon was a little different, the scent in it has more perfume that I do not like.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with a \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot; problem.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry hair.  </li>
            <li>And a little goes a long way, so it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>My sister, who has the same type of hair, was using a spray in gel product that is available in most stores, and it was drying up her ends and breaking her hair off, in addition to being a hot mess after sleeping, forcing her to wash it every day if she wanted to avoid a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li>It is far better than the other oils and creams you are accustomed to, and you only need to apply a small amount.  </li>
            <li>but I was trying to finish up some of my other hair products before getting yet another thing that would add to my large collection of cosmetics and potions.</li>
            <li>She directed me to other brands that are pure and have no color.</li>
            <li>I have really damaged, coarse and dry hair that is always frizzy and unruly.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews, I will see if I can get my money back for what is the equivalent of $2 worth of yellow baby oil.</li>
            <li>I used to use Nubian Silk Hair Oil, which is a viscous oil formula with a heavy scent, but now I use the right product, that will improve my hair.  </li>
            <li>Adds just the right amount of shine without making hair look greasy or feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li>have dry, coarse hair so for me, having soft hair is a new sensation, and I am obsessed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, my first and previous bottle lasted 11 months.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products that claim to do the same thing but leaves your hair greasy or smell funny.</li>
            <li>I really did not notice a difference between this product and other hair serums.</li>
            <li>And since you only use a dime sized dollop on your hair after you wash it, it really does last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Then I usually brush my hair back in a smooth, low ponytail while I put on my make-up.</li>
            <li>I straighten my naturally wavy hair, so I need a product to control the frizz, and also protect against blow drying/ flat iron damage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also way lighter than any of the other frizz serums which tend to flatten and make my hair look oily if I use to much.  </li>
            <li>So it really does last for a long time even with multiple users.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is when I don&#x27;t wash my hair the next day, the texture feels funny when I wet it.</li>
            <li>I use Moroccan oil in the summertime to help smooth my VERY thick, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d previously purchased this  product online from a different seller, after using it many times from a salon, I was displeased with it&#x27;s authenticity, and it was obviously watered down.  </li>
            <li>I live in sandy soil and the mains and tails are dry and with out shine.</li>
            <li>This is an exciting new (to me, at least) product made from the oil of a plant that is only found growing native to Morocco.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it but this time around it had a bad smell and was very watery.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair (bleached blonde), and it makes my hair feel smoft, smooth and shiney without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>If you are an African American woman (or any ethnic woman) who has had RELAXERS and are going through the RELAXED to NATURAL transition?</li>
            <li>Because of the glass bottle, you also have to be extra careful to spill any oil and touch the bottle, very slippery.</li>
            <li>and now I wasted more than a half left of it.</li>
            <li>I am African American with type 3c hair and this product leaves my hair frizzy and does not define my natural curl.</li>
            <li>I spent too much money on this product because I though this is going to be different</li>
            <li>It is also naturally curly, and even though I straighten it daily, the southern humidity can cause it to frizz.  </li>
            <li>second, it&#x27;s soft texture and feel actually works to repair some of the damage I have on my ends.</li>
            <li>Plus since my hair is not dry its growing ..</li>
            <li>Great for thin or thick hair.</li>
            <li>and if I use Moroccan Oil, my hair does not dry out.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse thick hair and becomes easily frizzy, this product helps with all the above</li>
            <li>; line is, like almost all available &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; products, a complete rip-off.</li>
            <li>This winter my normally oily hair decided to stay oily at the scalp but become very dry and lifeless on the ends.</li>
            <li>It may seem a little expensive, but the bottle will last forever, plus you will probably be able to get rid of many of your other hair products.</li>
            <li>No other similar products like it!</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a little more expensive than I&#x27;d like to pay, it&#x27;s been worth every penny for me.</li>
            <li>This product is the exact same as what I have purchased previously at hair salon.</li>
            <li>After about 1 year and a half I love this product, the end of my hair, where the highlights are, has become less dry.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t process my hair that much, but it is very curly and difficult to keep from kinking up in humidity when I&#x27;ve styled it straight.</li>
            <li>I used it when I flat ironed my hair and it left my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>Need to be careful not to use too much or your hair will lay flat.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey compared to other oils, but investing into a product that is going to give you long lasting results such as shine, body and bounce, is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>There is no long term benefits from using this product.</li>
            <li>I have always heard that caucasian and african american hair are very different but to make the review complete</li>
            <li>, it usually goes away once it is absorbed into my hair.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I bought and got in within a few days of buying it.</li>
            <li>Umm I mean it&#x27;s just oil , nothing special about it , I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s the fuss is all about</li>
            <li>I used less than half, and even though it was cheap, I threw it out.  </li>
            <li>I spent the first 25 years of my life living in Atlanta, now I&#x27;m in New York City, so I know a few things about both damaged hair AND humidity.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I previously purchased in salons!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says as far as absorbing into the hair, making it very slick and managable (due to the fact I hear there are silocones in it)</li>
            <li>My last bottle (3.4 oz) was used from the end of November, 2008 until the first week in October, 2009 because it only takes a small amount in the palm of your hand to completely coat your hair.</li>
            <li>(The argan used for the face and body is uncooked; there is another version of the oil, roasted and darker, used for cooking and high in mono-unsaturates, like olive oil, that is equally costly).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I noticed right away that there are no more split ends.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and dry and this oil is the only thing That really works.</li>
            <li>(like I said, it&#x27;s very long and fairly thick) and made sure to blow it dry.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to work great in my hair, until my stylist mentioned that my hair was inexplicably getting dark on the ends.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, at first I was doubtful about it.</li>
            <li>At 59 my hair, once soft and lustrous, had become rather dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I use a Lush Seanik shampoo bar and Aubrey organics moisturizing conditioner then hop out of the shower, comb my hair and put in my Redken blow dry protectant and then use a dime sized amount of the Moroccanoil, concentrating on the ends,</li>
            <li>My hair was bleached and it was dry, and always had to use a lot of conditioner and masks to stay soft.</li>
            <li>I leave mine to dry naturally.</li>
            <li>But maybe that&#x27;s because I have dry, color-treated, curly, wavy (wild) hair and have been struggling for a couple of years now with an age-related or stress-related frizzing problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my friends and I use it and all of us thought it is effecient --- making our dry hair soft and glossy.</li>
            <li>I have dry, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and it makes her normally dry hair shimmer naturally.</li>
            <li>-generally I need only about a dime size amount for my short hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally wavy, color-treated blonde hair and this oil</li>
            <li>Pretty expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li>I got my first bottle in Christmas 2013 and just  had to order my second bottle a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER THICK (everyone comments on it)</li>
            <li>I also live in a very dry climate in western Colorado which also contributes to the dryness of my hair.  </li>
            <li>i have very thick, curly and frizzy dry hair; this product helps me handle my dry ends and keeps my hair healthy, soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>On my second bottle (first one lasted a year and a half!).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone with any type of hair, especially dry, unruly, or frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have very thick but fine hair, which means -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 years old and notice my hair was starting to become dry.  </li>
            <li>I use it after my hair is dry to make extra soft.</li>
            <li>Use it with the hair masque and your dry, coarse hair is soft.</li>
            <li>The next morning my hair is soft and no longer dry.</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t usually just let my hair dry by itself and expect it to look full and</li>
            <li>i used one small squirt of this oil junk on my very straight soft brown hair after my shower on damp locks and then blow dry it.</li>
            <li>Just be careful with the glass amber bottle it comes in, I dropped mine and broke it the first time the glass got slick from the oil in the product, so now I just pour it into another container as soon as I get a new bottle, and problem solved.</li>
            <li>And I want to warn everyone that this product is not true, is any oil, but is not the MOCORRANOIL therefore do not have the texture, smell and even the same power as the real has.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I have oily and thin baby fine hair that I have to wash and blowdry every day.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty full bottle of the stuff that I haven&#x27;t been able to use because it makes my hair dry and smells horrible.</li>
            <li>nothing special and the worst part is that the wonderful smell I have smelled on other moroccan oils was MISSING.  </li>
            <li>I only lost a few drops of oil but the mess was huge since it&#x27;s an oil-based product.</li>
            <li>I would like to try the Intense Curl Creme because there are time when I like a little curl, but under control.</li>
            <li>First i towel dry my hair and then comb it, then put a dime size amount in my hand, rub hands together and work into the ends of my hair (bottom half).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried similar products they sell at make-up stores, but they made my hair greasy, of course, I have really fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>My sister has fine hair and she finds that this product is too heavy and makes her hair limp and greasy</li>
            <li>For me, Moroccanoil is just so-so and not worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li>Moroccanoil has given my hair an amazing shine without weighing it down or having any negative effects of other \\&quot;shine enhancers\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>He has pretty coarse hair and since using this after every wash, his hair is softer and less dry looking.</li>
            <li>I use this on my curly hair and I really like it, you only need a little bit</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way :) Frizzy hair no more.</li>
            <li>I blow dry and use a flat iron every day and my hair feels silky soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, it slightly weighed down my curl and made them a bit less ringlet like and more wavy.  </li>
            <li>It becomes huge with uncontrollable volume and stubborn waves that are NOT attractive.</li>
            <li>I have been using the oil for approximately a week and have noticed a HUGE difference in the health of my hair.</li>

            <li> so that was nice.</li>
            <li> As the day went on I realized that though the product does shine my hair up nicely, it was the smell I was hooked on.</li>

            <li> Love, Love, Love this product!</li>
            <li> My first impression was I loved the scent, and then once my hair was done, I loved the silky feel and healthy look of my hair.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at my hair salon for $48 and loved it.</li>
            <li> but this really helps it feel wonderful and smooth.  </li>
            <li> although it would be much more handy if it came in a \\&quot;squirt\\&quot; type bottle :)</li>
            <li> It has a very attractive light scent and my hair is incredibly soft and shiny after an application.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> one teeny bit got her hair picture perfect and shiny and glamorous for her date...with NO other products.  </li>
            <li> First it has a great smell yet light, works great at keeping my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Oh yea - this is the perfect travel size of this great product that really supports healthy hair - I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> At first it worked great</li>
            <li> It became evident to me then that the Morrocan Oil was extremely of great</li>
            <li> The hair is much softer, and the oil smells beautiful....</li>
            <li> If the price is too good to be true then it is.</li>
            <li> very light and airy..  feels as if nothing is on my hair</li>
            <li> Not greasy, very light, smoothing, and exotically fragrant.</li>
            <li> the bottle was oily, the pump didn&#x27;t work well (and was very cheap feeling)</li>
            <li> The Moroccon oil is very smooth and improves the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Wish they could claim it was all natural/organic, as that&#x27;s very important to me, but I won&#x27;t argue with results.  </li>
            <li> It makes my long hair look great, not just smell great.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells nice and lingers without being too musky or strong.</li>
            <li> Works wonders along with smelling super good.</li>
            <li> It is a good product but nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is fantastic for treating hair and keeping it healthy and shiney!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had friends try it who have shiney, smooth hair, and it does not work for them, but I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> amazing product, for my blond and dry hair is perfect!!!</li>

            <li> Its better than almond oil etc.</li>
            <li> It is great and really helping.</li>
            <li> I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> My family just LOVE Moroccan oil .</li>

            <li> My hairdresser always comments about how healthy my hair is with no breakage.</li>
            <li> but I found it on Amazon for $27.50 plus free shipping!</li>
            <li> The product is okay.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I keep touching it all day.</li>

            <li> I love Moroccanoil, but will not purchase from this vendor (THE VALUE BAY) again.  </li>
            <li> Liek many others, I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> so I use more than most people stated.</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil, and so will you.</li>
            <li> OK, so it&#x27;s a hair product:  </li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> I love Morroccanoil, use it every day.  </li>
            <li> This smells lovely and works well; depending on hair length and thickness, you may need to use more than the suggested quarter size.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs instantly on damp hair, and smells great too!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> it just moisturizes and creates a healthy look and feel.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels like it has more substance and has more body.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I can take better care of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t use a lot, Try it you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> The texture of my hair is better without it.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my salon suggested it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This has worked for me even in the most humid weather.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> the price is steep but ordering through amazon I was able to get it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> Amazon  A Satisfied Customer :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> , sometimes I feel like I cant stop touching my hair, to someone who doesn&#x27;t know how well this works I might appear to have a disorder where my arm flies up to my hair all the time....    </li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> and I love how my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> My hair has become so healthy I cannot believe it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> love the oil.</li>
            <li> However, if you want a product that makes your hair a bit healthier-looking and has more healing ingredients, and you want to get way more bang for your buck, try L&#x27;anza.</li>
            <li> I took away another star because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look as awesome as L&#x27;anza&#x27;s , which I&#x27;ve set as the gold standard.</li>
            <li> As for this product, I love it to death.</li>
            <li> This product is the reason I am able to wear my hair wavy/curly rather than having to do through the torturous process of straightening it every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite thing about this oil.     </li>
            <li> It made my hair softer for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 more now.</li>
            <li> My hair is so healthy</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent and the lightweight feel.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I do still heat style my hair, but the results are so much better.</li>
            <li> and I have used this product for months and love it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people rave about this as I&#x27;ve seen and used better stuff that exist out there and thats cheaper.</li>
            <li> The real Moroccanoil is great.</li>
            <li> But, when I am using Moroccan Oil, I get compliments from complete strangers on how wonderful, silky smooth my hair is.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I have bought so many, many oils</li>
            <li> This stuff is unreal....absolutely phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, our hair has a wonderful shine to it now.</li>
            <li> So some people might be able to stretch the bottle a bit more.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser talked me in to investing in Moroccanoil and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My hairdresser tells me I have the most challenging hair she has ever seen.  </li>
            <li> Save your money for better moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many product from Frederic Fekkai glossy cream to Frize Ease, none have worked for me like this product.</li>
            <li> I have puchased this oil many times and will again.</li>
            <li> Love the product,but the bottle was leaking and the solution was to take $4 off the purchase price.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> of course you go to a salon and think whatever they used you have to get to recreate the magic.  </li>
            <li> So, i&#x27;ll keep trying it and hope to fall in love.</li>
            <li> Love Morocco oil, for my curly hair</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I find it works much better if I rub a quarter sized dollop into my hair after a wash and condition it while it&#x27;s damp.</li>
            <li> At these prices, I&#x27;d rather not use a whole lot of it - LOL.</li>
            <li> I love smell.</li>
            <li> and I have never gotten so many compliments on my shiny hair :-)</li>
            <li> Brazilian consumer :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure you can use with a volumizing product and it wouldn&#x27;t make your hair yucky.</li>
            <li> She has tried many different Argon oil based products but has found this one to be the best.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> it was authentic  </li>
            <li> I remain sure it in fact is not.</li>
            <li> Understandably it would have a screw cap top for shipping, options, etc.  </li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> LOVE WHAT THIS DOES</li>
            <li> I would not say it helps at all with static though.</li>
            <li> I never thought my hair would look so healthy after what I put it through.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and could not find a better price than amazon.</li>
            <li> In addition, I am currently serving in Afghanistan and as you can imagine the water I bathe in is not the best.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> you can get better products for this price.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to put a lot more.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice my hair to be any easier to style or more bouncy or softer in texture and that is why I&#x27;m not giving it five stars.</li>
            <li> It seems to work more on the surface/appearance of my hair rather than penetrating the strands and changing the body or softness from within if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> My sister &amp; I fell in love</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and lightly fragrant in time for a great night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> But this one is the one I use the most.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> I tried to many products to make my hair shine, but they all made it oily looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried the garnier oil treatment and wasnt sure what to expect .</li>
            <li> I love Garnier and didnt know what to expect because it was a oil .</li>
            <li> (the top 5 ingredients of any item are basically what make the product)</li>
            <li> I read about this making hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li> With it, my hair dries faster, and is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks nothing like the sleek, shiny, and healthy hair that I have when I walk out of the salon after using this product.  </li>
            <li> You may wanna find a better oil moisturizer that is truly going to help you through the transition :)</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Even my mother who is allergic to most smelly lotions, hair products and perfumes loooooves this oil.</li>
            <li> I always love buying Moroccan Oil from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I had to use a lot more to see a difference</li>
            <li> Many times no need for anything else.</li>
            <li> I always compare with an authentic product before I buy online</li>
            <li> Love this product,  use it every day...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> my hair has never been this healthy.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the smell.  </li>
            <li> Glad that I found it here instead.</li>
            <li> I mix some of the Moroccanoil Oil Treatment with the Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream and apply to my hair after I shower making sure to brush it through.  </li>
            <li> shine spray to top it off...</li>
            <li> Enjoy the product!</li>
            <li> Love the smell more than anything.</li>
            <li> Nice and light oil</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I get compliments often on how shiny and healthy it looks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in love with it</li>
            <li> and my husband loves it:)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and more manageable and now with the pump that comes with it</li>
            <li> I love how luxurious my hair looks and feels when I use this.  </li>
            <li> :]</li>
            <li> pleased.  </li>
            <li> Ok this is my story.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product since it arrived safely and its been months</li>
            <li> and I love how it smells :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love Marvelous Oil Deep Nourish!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this bottle, and it is much more perfumed than the sample.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a month, my hair looks 100 times better.</li>
            <li> I love this hair treatment.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried it; I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> extra work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and great job!</li>
            <li> I love it and we&#x27;ve bought over $100 of it.</li>
            <li> I never used more than a dime sized amount when I applied it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> This is seriously my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> and they charged me $49 before taxes-- which is 10% more than what the Moroccan oil website charges.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This product makes it easier to brush after washing, and keeps it a lot smoother and more hydrated.    </li>
            <li> My hair now is not only silky and shines, but this oil smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This one is just OK...</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I am glad that my friend recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brandname hair products that simulate moisture and advertise prevention of fly-away hair, but none works as well as Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> and i fell in love.</li>
            <li> Organix makes my hair feel much better for 1/4 the price.</li>

            <li> my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> and I love the pump that came with it.</li>
            <li> I use it most every night after I shower.</li>
            <li> but it will looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed the benefits of THIS brand of Moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite products.  </li>
            <li> Great value much cheaper than in my salon.</li>
            <li> and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I have found another way to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>

            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m confident with the quality, I can give gals a recommendation.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The more heat you put on your hair the better it works.</li>
            <li> Love the moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, try coconut oil from the market or free-trade Argan oil - both without added fragrance - and both are able to penetrate hair.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be without it unless I find something else like this or better for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and would definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> For this price, the product should have a much better result.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this oil.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been better.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> This brand is pricier but definitely the best.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly I&#x27;m my bleached hair</li>
            <li> I love the smell and</li>
            <li> Used this product and it helps better than most others.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil is better....</li>
            <li> Would just put a couple squirts in my hair after I shower and it would control the frizz, split end, and make it look so healthy.</li>
            <li> many months</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you start at your ends</li>
            <li> so your roots don&#x27;t get greasy or build up over time and rub the oil together in your palms before putting it in your hair for a more even coat.    </li>
            <li> it looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It conditions more than the BioSilk</li>
            <li> I bought this as a hair treatment, and for an occasional fix, it is excellent.  </li>
            <li> and I was really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> , my hair is 100% better</li>
            <li> Moraccainoil also doesn&#x27;t leave a slippery residue on my hands, it speeds the drying time, smooths out frizz, and my hair is also in much better condition since I started using it almost 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li> It is quite simply the best condition/anti-frizz/blowdry product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t ever want to be without it again!! :-)</li>
            <li> i love it .</li>
            <li> Love the scent (overpowering though...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Light version of this for a while and really liked it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the</li>
            <li> Always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Want shiny and healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It can be too greasy if you apply more than 2 pumps on your hair</li>
            <li> The organix drugstore Moroccan oil smells way better than this.</li>
            <li> It also feels, for lack of a better explanation, like it gunks up my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it has lasted me over a year.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will try the Moroccan hydrating mask, see if that helps a bit more with the frizz.</li>

            <li> I can apply at any time and my hair looks healthy but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I had searched all over to get a better price.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is simply the best.</li>
            <li> This seller is filling bottles with bogus moroccanoil, thats why so many people complain of it arriving leaking.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but there is nothing better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic if used correctly.</li>
            <li> Most of my split ends are gone.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan oil</li>
            <li> Got it for a better price on Amazon than at the hair salon.</li>

            <li> This Moroccan oil is great stuff compared to hair jell or moose,makes your hair silky soft but managable !!!</li>
            <li> This product came right away and is just awesome, my hair is COMPLETELY manageable now!!!  </li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think that adding oil to your hair right after you washed it would be a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Great product to use every day great results even bought the other Moroccan products to accompany it</li>
            <li> It makes your hair very soft and adds a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> , I think I would have surprise,I really like the smell!!!!</li>
            <li> Though I am sure that this oil will do great things for your hair, what is not mentioned is how HIGHLY scented this product is.</li>
            <li> My hair is more full and I has an amazing shine.</li>
            <li> Just glad that I purchased through Amazon and got a great deal (50% of the normal price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes it look great, smell great and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Two things do not make me so happy, that&#x27;s the high price of Moroccanoil, and that Amazon doesn&#x27;t always have it in stock.</li>
            <li> I got his oit and was very excited to try it, since the reviews were pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it is stronger, more healthy and shines more than it ever has.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is a great product: smells good, keeps hair from being dry, adds shine.  </li>
            <li> Nothing makes my naturally wavy (yet easily straightened) hair look so incredible.</li>
            <li> It is the single most impressive hair product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Best price I have found so far and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have converted many friends to becoming moroccanoil fans.  </li>
            <li> A woman recomended that I start using Moroccan oil and loved it from the first day.</li>
            <li> An awesome product for long hair.</li>
            <li> The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot per application, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely soft and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> What a great hair product, absorbs quickly without feeling oily and makes your hair feel silky soft and look super shiny!!!</li>
            <li> This reduces the frizz in my hair significantly!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and keeps my hair looking healthy and fresh.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect, keeps my hair from getting dry and split end to a minimum.</li>
            <li> The oil is ok, but the scent is just too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It arrived nicely packaged and quickly too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for dry, processed and curly hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used on my dry colored hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product around for dry aging hair.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever to help dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful styling product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a much more strong perfume like smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the best oil for dry and colored hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that without even using the product, my hair has been extremely easy to comb through and much more</li>
            <li> Works fabulously if you have oily hair and don&#x27;t tend to use conditioner because it simply doesn&#x27;t work out to your best advantage.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever so light and moisturizing AT THE SAME DAMN TIME ..</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair feel so soft and silky, and my hair look so healthy.</li>
            <li> Even my mother, who is critical (but loving) of me said my hair looked great and when she touched it she was amazed.</li>
            <li> Really helps with fly a ways and makes hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The oil smells beautiful, like a fresh flower and reminds me of a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> This is the SINGLE best purchase I have ever made in my life.</li>
            <li> It is great and makes the hair so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly and was nicely wrapped so the bottle wouldn&#x27;t accidentally open in transit, and it was in its original box and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Great product to tame fly away hair and polish it.  </li>
            <li> Hello clean lakes and rivers!</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy, fine hair that I prefer to straighten, and on top of that, I color my hair, including two panels that get bleached and re-dyed purple.</li>
            <li> A good flat iron helped a good bit, but still it would eventualy frizz, even with humidity protectants and sprays.</li>
            <li> A good thing, no doubt, as every time I&#x27;ve put pure oil in my hair to condition it, it&#x27;s (understandably) looked greasy.    </li>
            <li> the result was very good, sometimes this is the only product I use after washing my hair....</li>
            <li> Very good product to protect from sun, especially for colored hair.</li>
            <li> It smell great and makes my hair smooth, shiny, soft, and healthy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so light and gives it a healthy looking shine, that I have never had with my borderline frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> (may be except for chests...) and thus one of the most important features in females.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I get fantastic shine and my hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> This product arrived faster than expected, and the cost was the best I&#x27;ve seen!  </li>
            <li> It allows my hair to look smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft, shine, bounce and smell great.</li>
            <li> It has SPF for your hair, smells great and makes your hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, smooth, and healthy.</li>
            <li> I still had a bunch of fly aways and it never felt soft.</li>
            <li> The price is better if you buy it in the largest bottle available.  </li>
            <li> This oil is great if you have yourself some wild hair going on.</li>
            <li> There are silicones in it which give a bit of a smooth finnish, but I can achieve that with cheap hair serum!</li>
            <li> Naturally, I gladly accepted since it was free.  </li>
            <li> This oil is a fabulous product to add a lovely sheen to the hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes your hair so smooth and make fly-aways go away.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is spicy, light, simply lovely.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel so healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I first tried the kind that you get at Target and was mildly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it available on line, and will always return here to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine from Comely People and have no reason to believe it&#x27;s anything but authentic (comparing smell to Light and the shampoo).</li>
            <li> and my hair is static free.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the lovely hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my curly frizzy hair manageable, soft and smell great.  </li>
            <li> I love the smooth finish and glow.</li>
            <li> The light oil is better for straightened hair, but when I wear my hair curly I prefer the heavier oil.</li>
            <li> great shine, not heavy on hair</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth by using Moroccan oil :)</li>
            <li> Its great on  natural hair, permed hair, weave etc.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at the Israel Duty Free Shop and loved it.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt as silky soft, been as frizz-free, or even smelled this great before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling great and feeling silky soft.</li>
            <li> Always great for my natural hair</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my hair feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> Better price than salon for fantastic oil.</li>
            <li> The liquid in this bottle smelled like grandma&#x27;s perfume, not like the light, jasmine-y scent of authentic Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> There really is nothing out there that makes my hair look this good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells good.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the good service.</li>
            <li> and I loved the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and I loved the smell of her hair so much I had to get it..</li>
            <li> That was a special surprise!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly not the best product out there for what it does.  </li>
            <li> Great for right after shampooing, and also for touch-ups when you want extra moisture, shine, and just feel good about your hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and it soaks right into my hair, never leaving it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> and I bought my own bottle right away.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, for far better price!!!</li>
            <li> This has made my hair so much shinier....love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best light weight non-greasy oil for dry hair!</li>
            <li> I like the original one more.  </li>
            <li> I bought morrocan oil before I left the states to come out here and let me tell you my hair feels so good!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about it!</li>
            <li> but figured perhaps the original would do even more.  </li>
            <li> In fact, if anyone uses paypal and wants to buy my barely used bottle, I would be more than happy to sell it!!</li>
            <li> Love Moroccan Oil, 100% authentic and works great for my long hair.</li>
            <li> You will be throwing out all the other gimmick hair products because you will realize you are now a part of one of the best</li>
            <li> A reviewer mentioned how it makes hair feel like silk which is so true!</li>
            <li> I also use Aveda Brilliant, damage control, protects from heat, this helps for the flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for replenishing your hair without that oily feeling you get from other products that can&#x27;t hold a candle to Moroccoanoil.</li>
            <li> So I was even more excited to find it on Amazon for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> the original seal across the top.</li>
            <li> Item arrived very quickly and just as described.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and lasts for days.$37 beats the $55</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly from the seller without issue.  </li>
            <li> broke easy</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is a great after-shower detangler and it makes my hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Lasts quite a while and has easy dispenser.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> Great for aging hair :)  but only on the ends!</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthier, silkier and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this product is easily counterfeited.  </li>
            <li> shiny,  easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Pay attention with the amount of product you use as it can easily make your hair too greasy.</li>
            <li> It applies easily and leaves no residue..  </li>
            <li> and you are easy to go.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t like strong smells this would not be for you.</li>
            <li> The smell stays in your hair all day, but isn&#x27;t so strong that people around you can smell it&lt;br /&gt;smooths</li>
            <li> It helps promote strong hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is strong stuff, so</li>
            <li> Good service, good product as expected.</li>
            <li> This is the first product which made my hair look amazing and no grease.</li>
            <li> I loooooove this stuff because first it smells amazing...</li>
            <li> The first time I tried Moroccanoil I liked it.</li>
            <li> The smell of it is pretty nice</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, everyone raves its the best thing ever, Im satisfied, but not going crazy with how good the results were.</li>
            <li> the oil smell good, but the result isn&#x27;t that good as other people saying..</li>
            <li> Yes it is natural and kind of nutty, but to me, the moroccanoil has a really nice scent that sort of stays with me lightly throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, kind of musky, its strong at first but mellows out quickly.</li>
            <li> While logically my favorite is the pure oil, let me state that if you are on a budget you should try the Organix Penetrating Moroccan Oil!!  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser tried this on my ultra fine, fly-away, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and tends to be \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> every 6 weeks and my hair texture is baby fine</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair, and this product keeps my hair under control.  </li>
            <li> but when I did get relaxers, moisturizing was nothing and my hair held moisture just fine.  </li>
            <li> Fine hair needs the one for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have think fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and oily</li>
            <li> my hair is fine and</li>
            <li> so I bet you could end up using a bottle every 6 months and be fine.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this product after 20 years of frizzies finally a product that really works and smells great to</li>
            <li> and I saw that the Moroccan oil helped my hair tremendously!</li>
            <li> I keep this on hand for quick fixes, when I&#x27;m going out and want my hair to look (and smell!)</li>
            <li> Shipping was uber quick too!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the Moroccan Oil treatment and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> I personally find putting a good conditioner on my hair after washing it, when my hair is still damp, and then leaving it in and letting it air dry seems to work best.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, try the Morrocanoil Light.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this stuff works fine, and if you compare it to John Frieda&#x27;s serums, Bumble &amp; Bumble Defrizz, Silk Therapy, etc., it is far superior.</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just a little on my hands and smooth over the hair is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product, it makes my hair smooth, shinning and looks very healthy , I have been using it for like a year now</li>
            <li> This is the BEST thing, hands down, I have run across, at this point, for your hair!</li>
            <li> My friends keep teasing because I can&#x27;t stop touching my own head because I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan or Moroccan Oil treatments.  </li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil hair treatment is great for my thin hair and great for my wifes hair.  </li>
            <li> It gives the beard a nice healthy shine and helps to keep the hair soft.</li>
            <li> my wife loves the fact it is still available.....</li>
            <li> Had Moroccan oil used in the salon and the stuff was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 4 years and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is a wonderful product if you have frizzy hair or trouble with split ends.  </li>
            <li> Someone empied the bottle, filled it with some overly purfumed vegitable oil (that&#x27;s what it smells like), resealed the cap and shipped it off.   </li>
            <li> I find I can get by with just this oil and maybe a light heat spray for styling</li>
            <li> It really tames the frizzies and has nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is great for some extra conditioning.</li>
            <li> also I enjoy the musky scent.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I blow out my hair which this also is works great for..</li>
            <li> This is a great product for Carribean and mixed texture hair.</li>
            <li> This product, although not cheap, is the best hair product I have tried in 40 years!  </li>
            <li> Oh, and it has argan oil in it as well, in case that ingredient is important to you.</li>
            <li> I have also found White Sands brand Orchid Oil to be great.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate to find it on AMAZON.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to fork over even more money for this, but I think it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> but otherwise- fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> on time and in great condition.i will come back.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re both great products, I will simply switch up using them.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair look so silky and smooth, too.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it was available in a body spray</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil my hair looks fantastic - no frizz or flyaways.</li>
            <li> the hair feels hydrated, smooth and shinny....</li>
            <li> It also smells fantastic, which is just an added bonus.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair nice and shiny and my hair seems to finish blow drying much quicker when I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my hair and this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I felt smooth on my hair when I used it.</li>
            <li> My sister has great hair and she only uses 1 drop.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and does make your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells fantastic . .</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair smooth again,</li>
            <li> just smooth, silky hair.</li>
            <li> There are many different brands of argan oil out there, but this by far is the best one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell that my boyfriend and I love.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well with a flatiron if you want straight hair.</li>
            <li> It is just like any silicon-based hair product and the \\&quot;fantastic smell\\&quot; is not so fantastic.</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t smooth my hair well or make it shiny</li>
            <li> i had to pay important duty amounting to Eu18.00,on arrival,I had paid for transport and handling fees already,the oil came from the USA</li>
            <li> save $10 dollars off a 40 dollar purchase or just take free $5 no matter</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;People can&#x27;t believe my hair looks so heathy, considering the length.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic and</li>
            <li> It has a great aroma and overall hair experience.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, and I&#x27;m done looking for anything better.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is a light smelling oil that you do not notice once it is on your hair.</li>
            <li> Worth the price for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product - this is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is a great hair prodcut for daily use.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using your Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment.</li>
            <li> but it is a great body oil and facial cleanser too.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product when I saw all the fabulous reviews.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable... goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a smooth, glossy finish.  </li>
            <li> It keeps it hydrated and shiny and smooth without being greasy.</li>
            <li> The moroccanoil arrived leaking with the scent of stinky cheap cologne all over it.</li>
            <li> I was exposed to this product via my fabulous hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product and would recommend to anyone who uses a straightener or heated tools on a daily basis.  </li>

            <li> Given all of the wonderful reviews of Moroccanoil, and the fact that most of the negative reviews of Moroccanoil were from people who had received a counterfeit from Amazon, I almost wonder if the bottle I received from Amazon this month is a counterfeit also.  </li>

            <li> a good natural treatment for your hair</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it a full five stars is that the scent of the oil could be a bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li> and you may have to spend more for the right stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is surely an elixir..arrested hairfall right away..</li>
            <li> I am an older adult and this product works great to keep my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> It works way better than my other oil products and has a great smell.  </li>
            <li> But all I have to say is that this very worth it</li>
            <li> The scent is very fresh.</li>
            <li> Two drops on wet hair and good to go!</li>
            <li> Oil is great for flyaways from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> However, I work long hours and unless I get some free time, I&#x27;m going to keep using the DermOrganic argan oil treatment, since I&#x27;m really happy with that product and does everything that the reviewers describe of Moroccanoil.    </li>
            <li> They are trying to make some quick money and what better way than on the back of our beloved but way over</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and I received it very quickly.   </li>
            <li> I found that it&#x27;s easy to pour the product out too quickly.  </li>

            <li> I do love this product and the seller shipped it very fast</li>

            <li> It smells amazing and makes the ends as soft , shiny, and strong as the root.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awesome for dry hair, and you don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li> best product ever&lt;br /&gt;you can use for curly, straight , dry hair.</li>
            <li> It smells great, absorbs fast, and leaves my hair very soft and decreases the frizz.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for the bottom portion of my long hair.</li>
            <li> First of all I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> This product gives me shine without weight and the very best thing, especially in winter, is that I&#x27;m not left with TONS of static cling in my hair after blow drying.</li>
            <li> Product is well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> My hair actually dries afterward (no &#x27;wet&#x27; look) and looks great - very healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too familiar with), I think it&#x27;d shatter and spill all over the floor.</li>
            <li> i wash my hair and it makes it smell pretty :)</li>
            <li> At first I wasnt sure if it was going to work and was also concerned if it was overpriced.  </li>
            <li> The Original Oil Treatment 100ml/3.4 fl oz]</li>
            <li> This stuff is the original</li>
            <li> Package arrived, safe and sound, earlier than promised, and the Moroccanoil it contained is doing nice things for my hair.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this at my hairdressers.</li>
            <li> All the claims are true- leaves my hair smooth and shiny, dries quicker, and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product as everyone is raving about it.</li>
            <li> My hair is 90% better and not only that, I love my moroccanoil now!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited, can you tell?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time... works great.</li>
            <li> My hands smell wonderful after I work a small dime size into my hair.  </li>
            <li> I got my original sample years ago from my pricey upscale salon.  </li>
            <li> a unique smell...</li>
            <li> This is the original....</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> If you want an alternative to this oil, Orofluido is much better, smells better and has more lasting results.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how much product is contained in this product size and am delighted that the gift will keep giving for many months.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I just love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using Moroccan oil, but I think I want to go to where I purchased originally.</li>
            <li> It is a rich conditioner and adds shine without making my hair feel oily.</li>
            <li> and I used a small amount on damp hair before blowdrying and my hair looks the best I&#x27;ve ever seen it.</li>
            <li> Not too oily and has a wonderfully unique smell.</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to continue to use this product and see how the rest of the results turn out.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a light weight product, that does not weigh your hair down, and smells good too, then this is it!  </li>
            <li> Bio Silk is honestly the closest, but not hardly comparable.</li>
            <li> It does smooth and soften my hair but doesn&#x27;t really make it shine or look healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly over a month and notice that my hair is much healthier and feels great.</li>
            <li> Great amount of oil to keep hair from getting dry.</li>
            <li> I dry out my hair which this also is works great for..</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make my hair more oil, just soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Apply it to dry hair and it gives a  great shine.  </li>
            <li> so we need a product that tames our dry fly aways.  </li>
            <li> i also let my friend with wavy hair borrow it after she got done blow-drying her clean hair, which was way fly-away...</li>
            <li> It works great on my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I even have added it to my dry hair with great results.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry hair that is light,not greasy.</li>
            <li> it will look dry because it becomes frizzy, fly aways, etc.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair more silky and smooth and if I decide to straighten it, it makes that process much faster and easier too.</li>
            <li> Immediately, you see added shine, less frizz, and a whiff of the incredible scent meets your nose.</li>
            <li> Great product for overly processed  dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really care for the product; probably a good option for a person with wavy or straight hair</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and this is the best product I have experienced to help comb through when my hair is damp and give shine to when dry, Smells great</li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft and silky, and it looked shiny and healthy!</li>
            <li> Wow, I love that!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still silky and soft and shiny and I absolutely love it!      </li>
            <li> excellent oil for hair and only a small amount can let your hair look good.</li>
            <li> I have in the past purchased 100% argon oil that was organic, and I found that yes, it did work ok, but for whatever reasons or additives, this moroccanoil is really the best product for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Moroccan Oil to anybody who wants to have soft, beautiful, sexy hair.</li>
            <li> GREAT product if you have dry hair in the desert!</li>
            <li> my husband (who never uses anything special on his hair) loves it too.</li>
            <li> I just received a large sample of Aquage&#x27;s Silkening Oil Treatment, and it is a contender for my favorite hair serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly deal with Salon and More again.</li>
            <li> Specially for a blond (damaged hair) .</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I pay special attention to my ends with this after I curl it</li>
            <li> Received product right away !</li>
            <li> This hair oil is great for very dry, overprocessed, over-straightened hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great and hydrates the ends of my hair which is very dry.</li>
            <li> I have hard to manage hair, and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for such a great product.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the great reviews about this product I purchased a small bottle at my salon.</li>
            <li> The price is higher than most products but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It smooth&#x27;s my hair and gives it a beautiful shine without a heavy weight or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> , perhaps this one is formulated for hair only, but Aragan Oil in general can be used as a wonderful moisturizer on skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw search Aragan Oil on iherb site and see what options they have as well...  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I expected great things from this product</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have found to manage my naturally curly long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times from my hairdresser and have loved it.  </li>
            <li> Morrocan oil has a light fresh scent unlike oils for hair that have an overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li> This price makes it very affordable for me to be able to use it daily so that I can keep my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product gets such good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I sent an email to the seller requesting a full refund.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s as good as L&#x27;Anza&#x27;s, and possibly even cheaper!</li>
            <li> As much as I love the scent, this product really didn&#x27;t do nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found yet to help with frizzy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on my hair after blowdrying, and true to</li>
            <li> However there are many fakes out there that look almost 100% real.</li>
            <li> We chemically treat it to make it okay to shower with, so it smells like straight chlorine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very smoothing (hence the silcones at the top of the list of ingredients).  </li>
            <li> It made my hair healthy, shiny, and very managable.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil products, my hair is much healthier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily that is true because of the amount of silicones it contains.</li>
            <li> The sales success of this Moroccan Oil for hair (made in Israel) is well justified.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good</li>
            <li> put it on after her bath--shiny coat and sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I have always been really diligent in taking care of my hair, but this product has made them even better looking, shinier, softer and with virtually NO</li>
            <li> One of my best friends has thick curly hair and used it.</li>
            <li> so, perhaps straight haired people get a better deal...</li>
            <li> Buying it in your local salon they usually charge more and I am really happy to buy it online at a fair price.  </li>
            <li> This product is ok, but for real results you should try SBS Divinity Effect.</li>
            <li> i thought after reading reviews that the oil worked best for thick curly hair but gave it a try anyway.</li>
            <li> I notice that my hair shaines more and since I start using it, my hair stylist notice a change in terms of straight.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product was the smell.</li>
            <li> Moracconoil is full of silicone, which coats your hair, preventing moisture from reaching your hair and making your hair drier.</li>
            <li> Very well pleased.</li>
            <li> Support Argan oil co-ops in Morocco and buy the real thing, which is better for your hair anyway.</li>
            <li> no frizz, healthy and very shiny.</li>
            <li> i didnt know it costed this much i have to say i love the stuff i can put it in my hair</li>
            <li> Love the whole line..</li>
            <li> Real Moroccanoil is sealed, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Really helps my hair :)</li>
            <li> I love it in my hair and the feel is very silky</li>
            <li> The scent is overwelming and sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be more cautious about how much I use, but I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Just need to make sure to not put too much otherwise the hair will get oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful for thick, curly, or unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> It does even smell like the true Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> It has a nice soft smell that I get complimented on.</li>
            <li> I love Morroccan Oil products too much to be giving up on them so fastout 5 days coming from the barbers.</li>
            <li> This stuffs really helps my hair, no frizz, and works better than conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I will ALWAYS give you an honest, educated and professional review.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the softness if gives my hair!the shine with out too much oil and</li>
            <li> It is fair enough.</li>
            <li> She said it really works for her healthy hair condition.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Moroccan Oil, and its makes my hair so soft and moisturized!!!  </li>
            <li> This works very good to restore shine to my very old white hair.  </li>
            <li> I love moroccan oil it is make hair so soft and easy to comb hair</li>
            <li> Amazing results, does exactly what it days it will and best of all won&#x27;t eventually dry out your hair like other products (biosilk) that smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> and she has thin fine hair like me and that works awesome for out hair type.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Wish it worked a little better on the frizz, but it is still a good product.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair very bright and soft.</li>
            <li> is high quality stuff that will make your hair feel and look amazing, it really repaired my hair and since I&#x27;ve tried other products that weren&#x27;t as good, I&#x27;m switching back to this because I realized just how great it was.</li>
            <li> The bottle did arrive quickly but the spilled concoction inside smelled of suntan oil and baby powder ?</li>
            <li> The product still works the same, just smells different, which was the best part.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be such a great surprise, this really works wonders.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use much, but it really adds a nice shine to my hair w/o taking all the body away.</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s oily quickly and also seems to get split</li>
            <li> I love the produce for my hair but the main reason I buy it is for the horses.   </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t completely fly-away free, but it is getting better.</li>
            <li> I must say it has worked tremendously.</li>
            <li> Also, my color does not fade as quickly.</li>
            <li> I received it so quickly.</li>
            <li> It soaks quickly into the hair without leaving residue.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quickly.  </li>
            <li> El pelo se te ve saludable y mejor hidratado, super brilloso y sedoso.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of products to make it smooth and frizz free, nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li> The smell sort of dissipated quickly, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super slippery &amp; shiny with no residue.</li>
            <li> the same magic elixer i&#x27;ve been buying in the salon for $10 more.</li>
            <li> It is light, love the smell, and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal Amazon customer</li>
            <li> It was shipped to me quite quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really excellent for African hair types especially with damage.</li>
            <li> If you have super frizzy hair like mine and would love soft, silky, smooth and straightened hair without the burnt smell...</li>
            <li> Since I had to begin coloring my hair to cover some of the grays, it had lost the youthful bounce and texture that I had, but the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment has helped tremendously in retaining that texture.</li>
            <li> It came quickly, it was at a decent price, and I love the product.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> And if you want &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; argan oil in this country, you&#x27;ll have to pay a tremendous amount for it.</li>
            <li> This may be good for people with hair that is dry or needs special treatment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands but this one delivers and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by me as an alternative to pouring chemicals on your scalp :-)</li>
            <li> I put one more pump on my hair after styling it if the humidity is high</li>
            <li> for best results mix it with few drops of olive oil to last longer and after a hot towel therapy wash it with nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a non greasy hair product that makes your hair feel very nice and does not require any other hair product.</li>
            <li> Sure they did a good job making it look authentic and professional but believe me when I tell you don&#x27;t put this stuff on your hands much less</li>
            <li> I notice a real difference from the Morrocan Oil, which seems unique in it&#x27;s ability to make my hair look smooth and camouflage my split ends.  </li>
            <li> Another good thing is this product is so light that after using, I can curl my normally straight hair and it WILL curl and the curls last just as if I didn&#x27;t use the product</li>
            <li> My hair was smooth and shiny the first time I used it and everytime after that.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will definitely order from them again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can make your hair to soft, so maybe every other day usage is best.</li>
            <li> The most amazing thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this bottle, and this is normally a product I love.</li>
            <li> I am still able to style my hair just like i normally do.</li>
            <li> Best product to spray on hair prior to using a flat or curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the cost too, since I use one pump for a full head of curls.</li>
            <li> Product, I have used it for a long time, good price</li>
            <li> it is fluffy and beautiful and knot</li>
            <li> It helps my hair look more silky and makes it more manageable since I live in a high humidity state.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful product for a few years now- can&#x27;t live w/o it now!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep down the frizzies and a way to manage wavy/curlie hair.</li>
            <li> It is great at moisturising my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Great product for protecting your hair without leaving it greasy or weighing it down...  </li>
            <li> Finally a great product for hair, does not make it greasy or weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product to control frizz without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> I have the best results with this method, as my hair feels very soft and has less</li>
            <li> Not only were the sellers amazing and super sweet</li>
            <li> The SHINE is AMAZING and the compliments came left and right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, just a few drops in my hair after every shower, and my hair is shiny, soft, and healthy, and it smells really good too!</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other more reasonably priced products out there that do a good job.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for softening, silkening &amp; adding shine to my fine, partly bleach-damaged, dark blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> it is really amazing my hair looks so pretty  and soft  </li>
            <li> This oil also works good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also, with a good haircut you don&#x27;t even have to blow dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for long frizzy straight hair too.</li>
            <li> and before I blow dry to enhance my blowdry and make my hair look silky and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Super for calming hair but also great for little girl tangles.  </li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil - it makes my hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> so I wasnt able to style it, but I did notice my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft and it feels extremely healthy.</li>
            <li> I love my stylist, he is a creative genious, amazing person, and is one of the few that understands my super long, but super fine, wavy hair that I wear stick straight most of the time.  </li>
            <li> and it actually looks healthy!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase love it!</li>
            <li> a friend noticed the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> I used this EXACTLY as directed with NO noticeable difference in my hair!  </li>
            <li> Like me, you&#x27;ll come back for more!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this at the salon, but since then have gotten it on Amazon - at a savings!  </li>
            <li> My hair is much more manageable and soft to touch!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I have recently started a new hair care regimen and this product works great.</li>
            <li> I know this bottle will last a very long time. :D</li>
            <li> so I am thrilled that I am able to buy it at half the cost now.</li>
            <li> But after more than 2 months of use, the ends and the bottom third of the longest part of my hair (which is where I am applying the oil) is dried-out looking and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> It brings out blonde highlights wonderfully, and smoothes any dry ends.</li>
            <li> It made it so soft and look super healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will notice your hair is a lot shinier, not oily feeling at all, and very smooth and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works on my fine straight  hair and my son&#x27;s  curly hair.</li>
            <li> Absolute must for fine hair</li>
            <li> I think if you have healthy hair, it&#x27;ll make it look fabulous, but if it&#x27;s not so healthy, it won&#x27;t do anything to make it look or feel any softer (or less frizzy).  </li>
            <li> Pricey but good not live without it!</li>
            <li> They have 100% pure Argan oil available and it doubles as skin care.</li>
            <li> And also, never cheat on your stylist, even if the other one is cheap and looks good.  ; )</li>
            <li> This little bottle is also great for swimmers too.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan oil for the last 2 years,it is excellent for dry hair!  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many products on my fine but coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> After reading a lot of the negative reviews, as I placed my order before reading them, I was worried I was going to get a counterfeit product, but mine arrived in a nice new box covered in shrinkwrap plastic, a nice seal on the cap, and is the Moroccan Oil I am very familiar with.  </li>
            <li> I like to run just a little dab through my hair every morning to help calm any fly aways</li>
            <li> The products are really amazing!!!!!!I could hardly imagine that  Maroccan Oil and Mask are So Good!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfectly prevent ur hair from frizzy, dull looking start from the first ur first use.</li>
            <li> So far in my life I haven&#x27;t used an oil based product that vanishes so well, this really leaves no greasy residue whatsoever and the hair feels like spun silk, even my damaged ends feel more light and wispy</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and provides hair with deep treatment.</li>
            <li> it smelled like cheap perfumed oil- not like real Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair really shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really does add moisture and help smooth it out.</li>
            <li> much the important ingredient is Aragan Oil</li>
            <li> It makes my hair hair silky and smooth and very shiny.  </li>
            <li> make my hair very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy, smells great, and keeps my hair with a shine.</li>
            <li> and they had it for much cheaper plus free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I apply one pump to my hair after washing, primarily on the ends and very sparingly to the roots.  </li>
            <li> This product really changes the condition of your hair to smooth, silky, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells lovely and makes my hair soft and shiny without getting them greasy,</li>
            <li> its absorbed into hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this product, makes your hair soooo soft.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> For me, this is a pricey purchase, but one that&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is immediately absorbed and leaves my hair shiny &amp; glossy, never oily or feeling \\&quot;coated\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money if you want to splurge.</li>
            <li> There is no oiliness, so it apparently is absorbed immediately.  </li>
            <li> I promise this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It would be worth</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this</li>
            <li> Worth EVERY penny of the $40 price tag, and it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I paid far more at the salon</li>
            <li> It was well worth it at the salon</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny bc</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my wet hair, it makes the curls more prominent.</li>
            <li> I love it more when applying on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s absolutely worth</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S WORTH</li>
            <li> I feel it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it, would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> but my sister thought it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my hair soft, tangle free, smooth and smelling delicious!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy and shiny and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> If not, it may be worth trying DermOrganic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the hype.</li>
            <li> My hair always looks shiny, but never dirty or oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth it to try it.  </li>
            <li> , it is NOTHING like this: it smells lovely and makes your hair feel silky soft and look superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soft and silky, healthy looking and shiny, with one use.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> love how the product makes my hair feel soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this product is really worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this for myself and my adult daughters who also love it.</li>
            <li> However, definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> That way you are sure you are getting the real product for the real price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for your hair than natural oil, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth buying from these people.     </li>
            <li> but they were not even worth the shipping I paid.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!Makes my hair smooth and moist,I have used this product for a few years and I am going to use it forever :)</li>
            <li> Now, I have been using the product for about 1-2 weeks and my hair looks healthy, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> That should be worth 5 stars in any husband&#x27;s book.</li>
            <li> Worth triple the price.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, the light feeling of the serum, and I use a pump of this daily.</li>
            <li> it is light not heavy and feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Worth every dime.</li>
            <li> I plan to just throw this bottle out and get a fresh bottle at a salon.</li>
            <li> It controls wisps and flyaway a and keeps my hair young and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> This oil is absorbed into the hair so the hair does not feel oily.</li>
            <li> It is completely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and fresh again.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair felt softer, more alive and healed after one use.</li>
            <li> It is worth it.  </li>
            <li> but this product is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> well worth the price...</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny and soft, I get so many compliments.  </li>
            <li> and it looks so soft and shiny love it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> I love Morroccan Oil products too much to be giving up on them so fast</li>
            <li> I love how this has made my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li> well worth it extravagance.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair look healthy and took away the brittle/damaged look completely.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the skin issues.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair silky soft and frizz free!  </li>
            <li> but so far I like it better than coconut or jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times before and as usual I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I used this product in a sample bottle supplied by my hairdresser &amp; liked it so well, I got this bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li> BUT TRUST ME REGARDLESS OF THE PRICE, IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I did purchase more 100% argon oil, thinking about being more green, but decided to cancel the order and go back to moroccanoil as it really is such a great all purpose product for my hair!</li>
            <li> It was worth the money i spend.</li>
            <li> I makes my hair feel so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> worth the price you pay</li>
            <li> to get sleek look, use very hot blow dryer setting and large brush!</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d share what tips my AWESOME stylist ( st louis ) told me to take home to my regular colorist - first when you towel dry hair</li>
            <li> This bottle seems to feel like the oil is much thinner and the smell is not as strong as the first couple of bottles that I purchased.</li>
            <li> Flat ironing is quicker and the hair has a much more light, feel to it.  </li>
            <li> I put about a nickel size amount through to tame the fly aways.    </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> This is better than grease and light than oils natural chemicals and makes hair very soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The best way to use it, would be semi dry your hair, and when it is about 60-70% dry, rub 2-3 drops to the ends of your hair, and finish drying it.</li>
            <li> I have basically straight, fine hair and live in Houston where humidity is a huge problem, so my hair tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and shampoo with Moroccan Oil in it but nothing works as good.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter, who has the thick, gorgeous hair and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of Moroccan Oil, but nothing seems to be as good.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and I will probably order it again unless I find some really great new hair product in the next few months.</li>
            <li> She was so right.</li>
            <li> Comes in a glass bottle and the pump dispenses just the right amount of product each time.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m trying to find what salon sent it to me</li>
            <li> It may take a couple of times of using it to figure out just the right amount to put in your hair.</li>
            <li> I was leary once I saw the bottle seal had been tampered with and could tell right away that it was not what it claimed to be.  </li>
            <li> I use it right before I blow-dry my hair, and it makes my hair feel so silky.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be all the rage in beauty products right now</li>
            <li> The oil pours out about the consistency of war m honey and soaks right into your hair without leaving it feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Morrocanoil&#x27;s formula is JUST RIGHT.</li>
            <li> just right for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an &#x27;oily&#x27; feel, but seems to melt right into the hair strands.</li>
            <li> I could tell right away that it would start building up.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after I wash my hair</li>
            <li> but I trusted this would work right</li>
            <li> If you use the right amount it will soak right in and your hair won&#x27;t be greasy.</li>
            <li> The comb glides right through after applying Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so different &amp; makes my hair look very healthy without too much shine.</li>
            <li> I was expected a higher concentration of the Argan oil, but it&#x27;s 5th on the list of ingredients - a fair amount, but not for what you are paying.</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry and freaky because of my career as a fashion model most of the time my hair receives many chemical that can really harm my hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the more I use it though, the more my hair is weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It has a light scent (kind of like a vanilla, but lighter and not as cloying), does not weigh hair down</li>
            <li> I am 100% confident that this product had been tampered with based on these two major differences.</li>
            <li> I normally can&#x27;t use the really nice hair products because I&#x27;m allergic to soy and almonds, but I think this product is more than comparable to those other products.</li>
            <li> and I noticed great difference in the texture of my hair, before it was less managable and looks frizzy now its very different and beautiful, I will contenue to use this product like forever, it really worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of silicones in this particular product so people with fine hair or hair that needs weightless products should steer clear, and go with a product that&#x27;s more pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> Very pure oil.  </li>
            <li> This is very pure oil, with nothing added.</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the less product you need, because your hair stays permanently healthy.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, smells fabulous, absorbs instantly and leaves no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> When you have genuine Moroccan Oil, expect less frizz, nice shine and manageability without a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> This product has also helped my hair become more healthy, less breakage</li>
            <li> - I tested the older vrs newer product on each hand, and the older product was clearly more fragrant.</li>
            <li> The Oil is easy and quick ways to style my hair and made my frizzy and dry hair into a smooth.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil was exciting when it first launched at our industry trade show, Premiere, in Orlando, Fl.</li>
            <li> However, shipping a little glass bottle in the middle of winter in a cardboard box with just paper wrapping is not the best way to keep the product intact.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist had used this particular product on my hair, so I was already familiar with it.  </li>
            <li> As you pass the hair you already feel looser, thin and soft, and the delicious fragrance and smooth, not bored.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of other treatments for my dry frizzy unruly hair, and I have to say, this is the best.</li>
            <li> You will feel the difference right at first use.</li>
            <li> You will feel the difference right at first use.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and will last a very long time as you don&#x27;t have to use much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> and it looks amazing whether I blowdry with a diffuser or just let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> great as heat protection with wet and dry hair , smells amazing and makes my hair soft plus the nurishment effect.</li>
            <li> I left not only with a great haircut</li>
            <li> Great for african american hair.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil helps your hair dry faster and leaves a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth spending a bit more up  front and buying the 3.4 ounce size, as it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Hair dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I love it, it leaves your hair soft and ready to comb.</li>
            <li> The Western preference for hair that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; by products means that argan in the hair is more useful as a pre-shampoo treatment.</li>
            <li> Love the smells works wonders on my hair, and they even gave me a little extra with a nice note written on the bottom!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it smells so good and a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft and helps smooth it out  </li>
            <li> This not only works great to tame the wiry wave or curl, but dry hair greatly benefits, and the aroma is &amp;#34;out of this world&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It does not give off a high sheen like  the others I have used and smells so clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this oil for several years and we love the way it provides the right moisture for our hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found both of these tame my frizzy hair and give it a lovely shine better than Moroccan oil does.</li>
            <li> This will truly clean your hair and you can use the Moroccan oil regularly and not have the problems other reviewers have mentioned, and get the great benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li> Like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very very very Good~!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t take very much @</li>
            <li> and I can tell that it&#x27;s helped my hair and scalp very much.  </li>
            <li> Like it very much.  </li>
            <li> I have virgin naturally curly bi-racial hair with a fine texture (think R&amp;B singer Mya).  </li>
            <li> I also use this as moisturizer for my skin too, and it soaks in leaving skin so soft, no residue, and supposedly fights fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> And it makes my hair so soft and grow so quick!</li>
            <li> I saw \\&quot;moroccanoil\\&quot; on the bottle, the (at that time) positive reviews, and the price was right, so I didn&#x27;t bother to read the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I thought I even put too much in my hair the first time, so I was worried my hair would be oily, it wasn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down and looks sensational.</li>
            <li> This is a true shine but the price is too high.</li>
            <li> I have also used the Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask and it too is fabulous and makes my hair very soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> Eliminates static, makes hair feel silky, shiny, thicker and doesn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase and my hair never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I initially heard about it.</li>
            <li> I first saw this in a salon, where the stylist applied it to my hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li> For shorter hair, use a dime-sized amount everywhere but at the scalp, and you will find that healthy hair is even healthier, shinier, and fly-aways are tamed, which is especially helpful with the onset of winter.</li>
            <li> The product is expensive, but one bottle lasts almost a year, and is a great buy!</li>
            <li> so I suggest if your salon sells it to ask them for a sample just to try it out first before you buy.</li>
            <li> My hair sylist used this on my hair for the first time a couple of months ago</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged and the first day I used this product i could see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Lets see how much this one lasts!</li>
            <li> It was BRUTALLY hot.</li>
            <li> Sure enough I found it cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> of course - and sure enough - my Aunt uses it too, and loves it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving it a try!!    </li>
            <li> But if you are using this, you are most likely already investing in your hair...</li>
            <li> First of all, it builds body in my (and my husband&#x27;s) hair by holding the moisture in our hair.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to this by my hair stylist, 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Only i love the smell and shine its not argan oil ..</li>
            <li> Really works well with my hair!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> go to a hair supply store and smell it first to see if it&#x27;s your cup</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love how this oil makes my curly, coarse hair feel and smell.  </li>
            <li> The only notable difference is the smell (and the price).  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure I like the scent of the Moroccan Oil so much better that I would continue to pay quite a bit more for this brand.    </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommended it!</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper on amazon then ANYWHERE ELSE!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and so do several of my friends!</li>
            <li> w/ it the first time our hair stylist used it on us.</li>
            <li> If I get out of the shower, this is the first thing that goes in my hair.</li>
            <li> and today is my first day with out it</li>
            <li> Absolutely a must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, and the ONLY downside I can see to this product is that my hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl as well as it used to before I used the product, but if I strip my hair, I&#x27;m sure it will still curl...</li>
            <li> I have used MoroccanOil before, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I use it every morning before I blowdry my hair and it helps my hair feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been dyed pretty consistently now for about two years.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchase Moroccanoil was from a salon.</li>
            <li> Still, memories of phenomenol Amazon reviews of Moroccanoil still danced in my head, so about three weeks ago when my samples ran out, I purchased and received my first bottle of Moroccanoil from Amazon.      </li>
            <li> If I had more time to look into it further, I would - just out of curiosity and principal at this point.  </li>
            <li> I am currently using Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and love the product</li>
            <li> The result was there was not a noticeable difference between the two sides, basically both sides of my hair were soft and frizz free.    </li>
            <li> The problem I have with Moroccanoil is most of the time it seems to work well only when combined with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and when I am able to finally get this product to work by itself</li>
            <li> and it really moisturizes my hair and not only leaves it feeling soft, but also smellin good too.</li>
            <li> After the first use my hair looked healthier.</li>
            <li> so soft and shiny it is a fabulous product</li>
            <li> and I told her I had used moroccan oil for the first time...</li>
            <li> The product comes with a pump, and is in a glass container, the oil was thick but smells great.</li>
            <li> I first used this in DC when a stylist there recommended it.</li>
            <li> I will look at reviews more carefully next time.</li>
            <li> I can see the change in my hair on the first time using it.</li>
            <li> At the first time I used I saw the diference in my hair and my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a bit oily when I first got it, but not at all.  </li>
            <li> It helps protect against heating treatments like hot curlers and hot irons.</li>
            <li> First of all, know this is not Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> the first time i tried it was as a reccomendation of my hair dresser</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell at first, but I like it now.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my damp hair so when I wake in the morning my hair is shiny, soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> and it works wonder under my scrub cap that I wear consistently with in surgery.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years and I love it.</li>
            <li> formula even though I&#x27;m naturally pretty greasy.</li>
            <li> Evidently it has become all the rage.</li>
            <li> Its spendy but very well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use I noticed my hair to be softer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped!</li>
            <li> At first, we would like to choose lowest price.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Now I am still an avid buyer of moroccan oil</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to several of my friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t post the review before I finish the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Will only now pay more to get the real stuff!</li>
            <li> I really like it！！！it is really useful for my hair！！！</li>
            <li> This has always been a great product for my long, colored blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hair mor soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the same Moroccan  oil that I purchased at a salon for a lot more.</li>
            <li> My hairsytlist actually put this on my hair and recommended me the product thank goodness for magic oil</li>
            <li> All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]], and discovered after several months, that my eyelashes were longer and fuller, and my eyebrows were growing in better.  </li>
            <li> The oil is not the real thing!  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times at the salon and the price through Amazon is much better.</li>
            <li> From the first moment I felt it in my hands and smoothed it into my hair</li>
            <li> This is not the real product!</li>
            <li> This oil is exactly what my aging hair needs.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair silky soft and and smooth.</li>
            <li> Since starting to use this product my hair is so much better.  </li>
            <li> First time I use this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my hair!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> The entire line is fantastic!</li>
            <li> A tiny dab was all I needed to control the frizzies all day, and it left a nice, non greasy, smooth, feeling to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of sweet smells, so I enjoy the vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> and I all broke out after using this product on our hair regularly for more than one week.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t damage cuticle - it drinks up the first thing u put in-</li>
            <li> This is Not my first time buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> and I still only need barely more than a dime-size on my fingers.</li>
            <li> It may not work the first time, it did for me, but it will make a difference.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, not only for hair but also the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product--when you can get it when it&#x27;s not a counterfeit or if the seller actually delivers!  </li>
            <li> Been using Moroccan Oil for awhile now and this is my first time ordering it online</li>
            <li> My hair used to be stringy and straw-like, but now it is just soft and smooth since I use this every day.</li>
            <li> Really helps my damaged hair smoother and shinier!</li>
            <li> It really does!</li>
            <li> This bottle will probably last me a year, or more.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and use it almost on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this stuff but was selling it at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i have used this product before many times but this time around the Moroccan oil was different.</li>
            <li> By now you know that I am not only a licensed Hair stylist and Makeup Artist to some of the biggest names, but I am one of the most trusted on product knowledge.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> ; I just use a couple of pumps in the center of my palm, rub together to warm up, then run hands over damp hair.</li>
            <li> You can pretty much drown your locks with this golden syrup</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and was delivered fast!</li>
            <li> would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now - maybe about a year, and I absolutely cannot stop using it!</li>
            <li> this helps to bring back a healthy shine.</li>
            <li> I then use my regular styling products on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I love Moroccan oil hair products, and this is no different.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is exactly what is sounds like -- an OIL.</li>
            <li> Using it on the ends of the hair and shampooing the ends lightly will allow some of the oil to remain and will leave a soft finish there; using the oil as a scalp massage overnight and then washing well in the morning</li>
            <li> The weird thing is that when I apply it, my palm IS sticky as if I had dipped it into some kind of juice !!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, first impression, my hair is sooth and manageable using the oil</li>
            <li> haha!  </li>
            <li> I squeeze the smallest amount into the palms of my hands and work it through the ends of my damp hair post-shower first, then finger comb the rest through the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the price can be scary at first, it is a great investment!</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best product on the market for difficult to manage hair.  </li>
            <li> After a few months of use, though, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as awesome, and one thing I dislike about it is that it&#x27;s so easy to use too little or too much</li>
            <li> I have very fine, long, and slighty wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Seriously great product that last for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It also looks a lot healthier, which is great because the sun tends to dry mine out even while trying to protect it with a scarf or different \\&quot;leave-in treatment\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have coarse dry hair and from reading all the wonderful reviews about this product, I thought for sure that I would get a product that could tame my mane.  </li>
            <li> , it makes it so much easier to apply the right amount.  </li>
            <li> Got my first bottle as a gift, and tried other brands since, but none have the amazing scent, or manage to gloss my hair without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Best part is a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> It smoothes, reduces frizz and works great on tightly curled natural hair.</li>
            <li> I use it right out of the shower with damp hair and then more when my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> though... expect a ridiculous amount of compliments on how great your hair looks, because you really will look like you just came from a magazine shoot!</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong when you choose top of the line!!!</li>
            <li> I have curly/frizzy hair, but when I use a little Moroccanoil in my hair, the texture feels so healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair is sleek and salon-smooth when I use it (without the super-expensive flat iron :-)</li>
            <li> Then I applied a bit more and then flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived leaking, the company sent a new one quickly.  </li>
            <li> Smells the same, does the right thing, what I received is just fine and dandy.</li>
            <li> the hair takes in all the oil especially when it is wet because the oil locks in the hydration...great great product</li>
            <li> Morrocan oil works very well to smooth and soften my wild frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> A stylist friend recommended this product and I finally bought it expecting to be wowed with super soft and healthy feeling curly hair.  </li>
            <li> wet or dry and its never greasy and its great on your skin to its way worth the price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel that my hair was greasy after using it, especially the next day, and the smell, though strong, was lovely when it was in your hair.</li>
            <li> He is nearly bald, but the hair on the side of his head looks so much more alive after he showers each day.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the prompt service, would definitely do business with them again : )</li>
            <li> This product is average at best and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> You are better off going to a real salon in your area and physically purchasing the stuff yourself.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair si soft, gives ir a body and more natural shine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product only for short term use.</li>
            <li> It makes hair soft, manageable, and most of all, it made my dry-dead-hair look and feel alive again.</li>
            <li> this is the real deal makes my dry course hair feel super healthy silky soft!!!  </li>
            <li> My experience with Maroccan Oil is the most amazing treatment to use for wet or dry hair!  </li>
            <li> The best part is, it DOES NOT weigh hair down at all, even if you use the product generously--I&#x27;ve tried soo many products that make my hair feel heavy and gross.</li>
            <li> It is great to get rid of those little fly-away hairs and it leaves your hair really silky and soft.</li>
            <li> : if you don&#x27;t mind paying an arm and a leg for an argan oil product that contains very little argan oil, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I have super fine processed hair that I have to blow dry every time I wash it</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect protection for you hair if you blow dry it and straighten it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> I have very fine curly hair that can be very dry.  </li>
            <li> a positive note, they did refund my money ASAP.  </li>
            <li> Have loved this product for many years...but growing increasingly hard to find in local salons.</li>
            <li> My hair almost felt hydrated when dry, yet very smooth.      </li>
            <li> This oil does wonders for my dry scalp and it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> It smells GREAT and works well on dry hair or if used when you&#x27;re getting your hair dried professionally, but for my needs it&#x27;s just OKAY.  </li>
            <li> I should really be the Moroccanoil poster child I talk about it so much!</li>
            <li> I went through a phase where my hair was pretty much indistinguishable from armpit hair.</li>
            <li> It was a nightmare considering hair is pretty much the number one thing that sets us apart from guys</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, it worked really well, and I would have sworn by it.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every other day and this is great.</li>
            <li> But whenever I put on this product bam, it obsorbs the oil and later makes it soft, smells great, as if you just did a deep hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I tried this first as a sample from my hairdresser and it really made my hair shine.  </li>
            <li> This product is not the real thing, buyers be aware.</li>
            <li> My hair thanks you so much!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Moroccan Oil and one bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use more than about a nickel size, so a 3.4 oz bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Makes my thick and curly hair very shiny and smooth! :)</li>
            <li> It was good to find a deal on Amazon &amp; save a few bucks!</li>
            <li> It smells good, and makes your hair soft, but so do other cheaper products...</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair soft, manageable, and full of moisture.  </li>
            <li> It also removes tangles and smells good but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight down my waves, it smells amazing and it makes my hair feel soft/look shiny.</li>
            <li> Secondly, my  hair looked and felt satiny smooth immediately after the first application.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super soft, shiny and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> If you have really dry hair you will absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A quick application of moroccanoil after I wash my hair has completely done away with the dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it when my hair was damp and dry and love both results.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised how quick I received the product.</li>
            <li> However, I find that my hair is even more frizzy and dry than before I began using this product.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super shiny, soft, and a lot smoother.  </li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone with dry or damaged hair :)</li>
            <li> This product makes styling much easier and pretty much eliminates frizz.</li>
            <li> It makes all the dry ends look so healthy....</li>
            <li> Entirely smoother and easy to deal with and soft/shiny.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair feel super soft, even at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> After buying the moroccan oil from this seller, it was genuine and felt and behaved exactly like the prior purchases I&#x27;ve made from salons.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Nearly every effective conditioner, from Pantene to the most ridiculously overprices brands, depend on some version of silicates to effect the softness and &amp;#34;silkiness&amp;#34; Americans have come to expect from conditioners.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was so strong, I had to toss the bottle after only using it once.</li>
            <li> The oil texture is nice and one full pump (quarter size) can cover my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I live in the north where we have very dry air in the winter and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> but I finally broke down and decided to give Moroccanoil a try because of all the great reviews here and on the internet.     </li>
            <li> regret getting the large bottle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used everything from the Joico color therapy serum which is the oil in it(about $20 a bottle), this product (about $40), Organix Penetrating  Moroccan Oil (around $7), and pure Moroccan Oil (anywhere from $20-40).  </li>
            <li> I have also ordered pure Argon Oil from Amazon, but can&#x27;t use that on my hair as it looks greasy.  </li>
            <li> My cousin recommended that I try pure Argon oil, which I can use on my skin as well as my hair.</li>
            <li> That has  pure argon oil which I can use on my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The box had a large spot of oil on it.  </li>
            <li> However, after I used this for a while, I started getting large pimples on my neck and jawline.</li>
            <li> Cant live with out it!!</li>
            <li> The top gets loose during shipping and it leaks.</li>
            <li> I use it more as a styling aide but treats the hair as it keeps my loose ends under control.  </li>
            <li> fragrance is different and it does not smell great like previous ones I orderd form Amazon that come with pump.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and my hair is dry much faster.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money - makes hair silky smooth for course, dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly light; hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down at all, which really pleased me since most serums are so heavy.</li>
            <li> This is the same product I originally purchased at a salon for much for money!  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and naturally blonde.  </li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair</li>
            <li> ~ I received only ONE while they replaced, w/o my permission the others with a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version for blondes with fine hair.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s also a pretty decent deal.    </li>
            <li> My first introduction to this particular product was when my hair stylist used it.  </li>
            <li> Gives a very high hydration to the hair.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it moisturized my very dry hair within leaving a greasy look on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought some to use at home because I have very dry hair in the winter (static, brittle ends, everything).</li>
            <li> My hair never felt better this product mad my hair soft, bouncy and just beautiful without having to put greese in it....</li>
            <li> Great for ALL hair types with or with out color... will not dry your hair out, gives your hair lots of shine and  for those  humid days and you need to tame your hair</li>
            <li> I have straight fine blonde hair and this stuff keeps me from getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> The Ingredients are on the box and not the container because they do not want the consumer to become aware the high level of toxins in the product.</li>
            <li> :) It is a little pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but the outcome is very different, its amazing and it conditions the hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> but the outcome is very different, its amazing and it conditions the hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> Love love this product, if you mistreat your hair like most females do, this will spare you those bad hair days.</li>
            <li> it was real.</li>
            <li> I bought this before, and it was the real thing, but this time it was not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> That makes me think it is not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Very pleasing-</li>
            <li> It did not even smell like real moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even close to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> Plus, the scent is so refreshing;it is not overpowering for the whole planet to smell it.</li>
            <li> the hairdresser wants to charge .....</li>
            <li> I have coarse/color-processed, straight, shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> This heavenly scented hair oil feels like a real luxury.  </li>
            <li> it will absorb fast and you see an immediate difference.</li>
            <li> however, this has made my hair much more manegable, quicker drying and smooths any rough texture.</li>
            <li> Use the intense conditioner and leave on 30 min.</li>
            <li> Very tropical musky scent.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Moroccan Oil, I have never had such smooth and shiny hair, and it stays that way even in damp weather.  </li>
            <li> really gives softness to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I really does work.  </li>
            <li> Very Dissapointing</li>
            <li> Very beachy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use a straight iron anymore.</li>
            <li> and I really think I found something to stick with.</li>
            <li> it considering how much this product works.</li>
            <li> This product does not smell or act like the real product.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve sprung for the real argon oil, and two drops of that makes my hair feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> and I know what the real Moroccanoil smells like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products to keep my coarse fly-away locks smooth and nothing else, regardless of price, has even come close.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much longer since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Pecan Valley Ranch</li>
            <li> It is a shame that there is no guarantee for a real product here.</li>
            <li> and I much prefer it to the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version.</li>
            <li> HELPS SO MUCH IN CONTROLLING AND SOFTENING MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> The price was reasonable, too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to add that hasn&#x27;t already been written.</li>
            <li> and the styling is much easier.</li>
            <li> Really adds volume and shine to your hair.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much, your hair will be oily.  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li> Can be to scenty if you apply too much.</li>
            <li> I went by a local salon, and they said they did not sell it, but that they had a couple of DermOrganic Argan oil treatment free samples sizes for me to try.</li>
            <li> The fact I bought DermOrganic even though I still have so much of the MoroccanOil</li>
            <li> A small sized amount rubbed into your hair will leave it managable, shiny and very healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> It also doesnt make your hair greasy which I thought it really would do.  </li>
            <li> This makes my very unmanageable hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> This does work REALLY well and is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> The last test I tried was to use the Moroccanoil with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream together which resulted in my hair being frizz free, and not oily.       </li>
            <li> This is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom who loves it so much</li>
            <li> She said it was the real stuff</li>
            <li> This product contains too much silicones.</li>
            <li> it is better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Well, he fried my hair, not the whole hair, but parts of it, and ever since that happened I have been devastated.  </li>
            <li> The one I bought at the salon was the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Our whole household uses it and it lasts because you don&#x27;t use much per application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference this has made.</li>
            <li> Well I wish I had known I could get it on Amazon for so much less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair stylist always uses it on my hair, and it makes it so much softer, shinier</li>
            <li> so much so that I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, shiny and silky and smells terrific!!  </li>
            <li> It really depends on what you&#x27;re trying to do with your hair.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the REAL brand of Moroccan Oil by moroccanoil.com.</li>
            <li> I have never had that happen with real Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this product.</li>
            <li> It really has transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> This product really makes your hair shine and look healthier.  </li>
            <li> buy the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It really helped me to improve the appearance &amp; health of my hair..and also smell very</li>
            <li> and I use maybe a dime size amount for my whole head of hair.  </li>
            <li> People think I&#x27;m a straight haired girl.  </li>
            <li> My whole family swears by this product.  </li>
            <li> Definitely try it out if you need something to brighten up, strengthen, and smooth you hair.</li>
            <li> It REALLY works.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair</li>
            <li> After using this, all I need is some hairspray to style and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> Also protects your hair from hair dryer heat damage; not so much from straightener heat though.</li>
            <li> i have very curly (read: frizzy) hair...</li>
            <li> My hair is going downhill fast.  </li>
            <li> This produces very silky hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever invented for frizzy crazy hair.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great...makes hair much easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> But thanks to Moroccan Hair treatment product, it protects my hair from damage from this harmful chemical like hair coloring and hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> This product really helps hair that has been styled a lot.  </li>
            <li> Also really helps with tangles.</li>
            <li> , I know what was sent was not the real Moroccanoil.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil for the hair</li>
            <li> I add it to my wet hair, mostly on my ends.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair very shiny but not greasy</li>
            <li> This stuff really made my hair silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair really gets frizzy in humidity, and this tames the beast.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is not the real moroccan oil</li>
            <li> It smells like baby oil rather than the stinky musky scent of real moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair as much, to get rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> but it a way, after asking thwy told me the real Oragan oil</li>
            <li> This product, Moroccan oil, works very well.  </li>
            <li> I regret buying this product so much.</li>
            <li> I really like how my hair looks,</li>
            <li> but I still have some frizz spots no matter how much oil I put.</li>
            <li> I  wish the others who claim to be 100% M oil were really like this $$$ one.</li>
            <li> and I really like the Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> I also rub a dime size amount through it before I wrap it and it smooths my ends...keeping me from having to use the heat as much.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> This is a very high-price item to give no noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I can also use it daily on my ends to keep them moisturized and tangle free.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF REALLY HELPS YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I use it, my hair is really soft,and never clutter;but my hair is oil type,so I had dandruff after use it,</li>
            <li> The real thing.</li>
            <li> A this point, this line is very well known</li>
            <li> This is the real deal moroccan oil, my sisters.</li>
            <li> is the real deal-</li>
            <li> And this smells fantastic, so that&#x27;s enough, but it does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing to help in humidity</li>
            <li> I PUT A TINY AMOUT ON FINGERS AND LIGHTLY TOUCH THE ENDS WITH IT</li>
            <li> TOO MUCH MAKES UR HAIR LOOK GREASY</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using CHI silk for years and decided to make the switch because my hair is much longer.  </li>
            <li> When I use this oil, it makes my hair straight, shiny and weightless.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would help with splits, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a change there.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend you to buy it without any issues!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> And I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this oil.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil has really helped.  </li>
            <li> I doubt this is really moroccan oil.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Applied to wet hair and corrected the dryness.works much better than the Moroccan hydrating styling cream.</li>
            <li> Not too much or it will get oily.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as straight as it was when I styled it.  </li>
            <li> Its really worked well for me</li>
            <li> My daughter always wake up in the morning with tangled hair, but after using this, it&#x27;s much easier to brush her hair now.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to get rid of frizz and stray hairs when I apply it.</li>
            <li> The real company does not sell online or is anyone suppose to.</li>
            <li> get you the real product.  </li>
            <li> It really tames my frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> Too much of it can make your hair oily.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Please do not buy it, it contains very toxic ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the real oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically much on hair care, but this is my one splurge.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t mind blowing my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Would highly recomment this product!</li>
            <li> Much too oily for my hair</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t apply too much depending on your hair texture of course.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very durable.  </li>
            <li> really recommend it</li>
            <li> the real salon quality did.</li>
            <li> I tried a bottle of the moroccan oil hair treatment and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it helps my hair yet</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of getting ready.</li>
            <li> It just so happens that her mother in law is a hairdresser and when she does her hair, she uses this very treatment to keep her hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Not the real product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Moroccan Oil from salon before and this seems like real deal.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky without too much greasy buildup.  </li>
            <li> very quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My most recent purchase was for my young daughters, who both have very curly hair and are prone to tangles.</li>
            <li> Brushing their hair after a bath used to be a struggle, but the Moroccanoil makes this much easier.</li>
            <li> It really softens and makes your hair behave.  </li>
            <li> and I find that this product really helps with the frizz and with locking in some moisture.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for straight or curly styles.</li>
            <li> I would get the light treatment next time.</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT THE WHOLE LINE OF THIS PRODUCT AND MY GOSH</li>
            <li> and I believe this product works very well</li>
            <li> It really is non-greasy</li>
            <li> (I found the 100% argon oil to be a bit greasier and left more residue) and it does leave my hair so soft and shiny and really speeds up the drying time either air drying or blow drying.  </li>
            <li> This did not smell like real Moroccan oil and I have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> And the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> and it makes your hair very stretchy and doesn&#x27;t help repair it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted and showed up fast.</li>
            <li> I just returned from Morocco, where I hiked the Atlas Mountains and visited cooperatives of women who hand-press real argan oil from the seed of the argan tree after shelling each one.</li>
            <li> (Brands which are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and free of silicone produce a similar effect from alternative slippery ingredients).</li>
            <li> The item came in so fast</li>
            <li> very protective cover to convey the glass container.</li>
            <li> Since it is an oil, I don&#x27;t use a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> The oil is very aromatic</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil for years and this is NOT the real stuff.</li>
            <li> And, while this glue is fun to play with, I don&#x27;t want it in, on, or near my hair</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The bottle was Drenched in oil, the seal was barely on yet the bottle was full.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in good condition and earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I run a warm wash cloth over my face and the Moroccan Oil removes all of my make-up without harsh soaps or chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had complete strangers stop me and tell me how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li> It smells really good though (although there will be someone that will say it stinks:)  </li>
            <li> I think I will order more in near future.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally white beard, and this product has helped it to stay soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair which is naturally course feel incredibly smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I only put it on the ends, not up top by my scalp, because I have naturally oily hair and figure</li>
            <li> It may be more expensive than some of the others, but I am confident that I am getting the right product and will not have to deal with the hassle of returning it.     </li>
            <li> The product that I received in the mail today, while claiming to be Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment, was most certainly NOT Moroccan</li>
            <li> But with this my hair stayed soft and styled!!!</li>
            <li> size is not so big but pumping is very useful.</li>
            <li> After using Moroccan oil for awhile and finding the right amount to use after shampooing, my hair is truly soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> It was really great to tame frizz after blowing dry and using a hot iron.</li>
            <li> It does not smell strong or strange and its not as greasy as I had assumed.</li>
            <li> My hair becomes very bushy and frizzy in humid weather, and Moroccan oil has helped me to keep it under control better than any other product I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li> It helps tame frizzy ends and gives a nice finish to hair</li>
            <li> &quot; However, it contains very little real argan oil and mostly just the same inexpensive ingredients (they are listed on the box) that are found in most hair serums.</li>
            <li> As much as I like to use products that are as stripped down and natural/organic, I really like this product much better than straight argon oil.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because it does have a very very strong smell , it smells different once you put it in your hair than it smells in the bottle.</li>
            <li> both love the product, and got other people in our family to use</li>
            <li> Also it tended to be a LOT thicker than the original and had a different smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried generic moroccan oils but nothing compares to the original.</li>
            <li> It smelled completely different than the original I had purchased at a salon.</li>
            <li> All in all, I hope other buyers have better experiences than I.  </li>
            <li> Sort of like Biosilk or many other smoothing agents, but with nourishing properties, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair quite as shiny</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works better with other hair textures.</li>
            <li> Better than any other oils that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it on the mail and decided to try it the same day.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products with Argan oil</li>
            <li> and it did nothing more than other Moroccan oil treatments.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really love this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Had medical issues and lost my hair, then took medication that hindered the new growth, this oil really helped me get my hair looking and feeling great again, my hairdresser recommended it</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> I have very long straight hair, fine hair - but lots of it.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have long, fine, smooth/straight/shiny, colored hair, and an oily scalp.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount of the oil and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product,  you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> This product has been wonderful for my long thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I let my cheap side get the best of me and purchased a less expensive brand than this.</li>
            <li> This so far has been the best product for my hair, I have tried similar products from other brands, but since I tend to have dry hair</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to have and keep the softest, silkiest, healthiest hair of anyone you know.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccanoil, allows my curly hair to dry naturally faster without blowdryer frizz.  </li>
            <li> THE BEST oil for dry, thin, brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very light on your hair and soaks in quickly never leaving an oily layer.</li>
            <li> Different scent than the small bottle I was using, but very nice.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be rather dry and fine, and she explained that the oil would help to make it softer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and color treated so it can get really dry.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase a full size after the sample runs out.</li>
            <li> My mom was sweet enough to give this to me as a gift</li>
            <li> So sweet will definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li> Now do NOT get me wrong, these products work WONDERFUL when your hairstylist is putting her hands to your hair and has all of the proper tools to get your hair bone straight and ultra glossy</li>
            <li> professional first used it on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I gave the full bottle away to a relative after trying it twice.</li>
            <li> It really surprised me the first time it happened.</li>
            <li> I like natural ingredients, and if you say a product is Moroccan oil, than that should be the first ingredient.  </li>
            <li> Nice small.</li>
            <li> I have course hair, and the first time I used this, my hair completely changed.  </li>
            <li> I use it on wet or dry hair and even on my little girls hair, amazing stuff, worth the price:)</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry hair to tame and correct split ends and fly aways.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Most products leave my hair greasy feeling and weighed down</li>
            <li> This product did not weigh my hair down the way most products do.</li>
            <li> I love this product it calms my hair down</li>
            <li> Morroccan Oil makes your hair silky smooth, rids snarly fine hair, tames thick curls, and never leaves a greasy look.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> Rich in vitamin E, carotene, phenolic acid and essential fatty acids, argan oil is one of the rarest but most valuable cosmetic ingredients.</li>
            <li> But Moroccan Oil gives me hair I can live with and really addresses those problems.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth and shiny after a blow dry.</li>
            <li> Love the product and couldn&#x27;t get it for any less through my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use it more often if it had less of a patchouli/musky scent.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with keeping my dry hair smooth.  </li>
            <li> Different labels, no seal on the cap and on top of that it smells like perfume and is totally gross.</li>
            <li> Start with a tiny tiny drop and work through your ends, adding more if you need.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair healthy especially since I not only color but also perm.</li>
            <li> I have just sent back my most recent purchase after being assured</li>
            <li> On the back the most obvious is the fact that the counterfeit Moroccanoil doesn&#x27;t have the Registered Trademark and Patent on it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, i am african american</li>
            <li> /&gt;i reccommend trying their product.as stated above, it is better than my initial rating of it.</li>
            <li> this mainly feeds and moisturizes my hair)  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to prevent the annoying static and to soften hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it fixed my split ends, but it does leave hair feeling much healthier.</li>
            <li> After using several times, my hair is not only softer and more shiny but feels thicker.  </li>
            <li> Recently I bought more, again at the same salon.  </li>
            <li> This particular seller sent this oil in a well protected package.</li>
            <li> This product is great for thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> My fancy main line hair salon uses it</li>
            <li> as well all with a decent price.</li>
            <li> I probably don&#x27;t need to, but I use it everyday, simply because it smells so good and makes my hair</li>
            <li> The transaction was processed quickly and was received the same day ordered as promised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant to be used very sparingly and will, after a minute or two, be absorbed, to an extent determined by the exterior dryness of the hair or skin,  by the upper layers of&lt;br /</li>
            <li> they wouldnt be so soft straight and very supple without it</li>
            <li> Further, it came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to style, nor use a flat iron unless I am going to a special event, dinner, etc.</li>
            <li> i was a little wory about this because the price and not sure it was going to work for my hair, but is really good and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil helps me tame my curls and gives me a smooth straight look!!</li>
            <li> The only problem is that if you use too much, your hair gets VERY greasy very fast.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, long blonde hair that is prone to breakage and this has been my savior.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it lasts forever because I only use one small dab on wet hair.</li>
            <li> You use only a small amount for smooth, shinny and healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> Very soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> My hair was usually dry and brittle, but this product has really provided moisture- without being greasy!!!</li>
            <li> The real thing comes in a brown bottle with the product name in raised letters right ON the glass-- as part of the actual bottle.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants results right away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair which often gets dry on the ends, and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> PLEASE save your money and don&#x27;t waste it on products like this which essentially exploit the &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; quality of a product from a third-world culture but in fact sell nothing more than cheap, readily available (though highly effective, and the EXACT SAME whether in expensive or drugstore products) chemicals produced by the millions of gallons in factories here and abroad.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve been using the MoroccanOil product for 3 weeks now and I am not in the least bit impressed, and surprised by my disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> i highly recommend it for blond&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li> Her son is a stylist in a high end salon.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and the Hair Mask that goes with it to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Using a high end shampoo and conditioner along  Moroccan oil will keep your hair from breaking and splitting....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li> Even with high humidity my hair did not frizz</li>
            <li> highly recommend .</li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5 star if the price is not so high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for smoothing and control</li>
            <li> I have highly textured hair ( my stylist calls it)  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> does wonders for my hair , and it smells heavenly!!i highly recommend this ,</li>
            <li> and they were too heavy, too light or just seemed to make my hair feel more dry than it already is.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments, especially when I flat iron after.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and easily into the hair with hardly any residue on the hands.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Moroccanoil about a month ago after much debate because the concept of adding oil to keep my hair soft and frizz free is not new to me.</li>
            <li> bottle of pure argan oil (which in its&#x27; natural state is cloudy and must be shaken before use) for the equivalent of 30 US dollars.</li>
            <li> My hair usually breaks off on the ends very easily</li>
            <li> I saw that it was a little more money and didn&#x27;t mind because I realize that the price of things go up at times</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair so soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> Hope that helps a little:)</li>
            <li> and I can see how there would be people who have fine hair who might find it too heavy of a product and the smell is pretty heady</li>
            <li> Between old age, menopause and cancer, it is dry, crinkly, breaks easily and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> You could get better results with pure organic coconut oil (used in small amounts).</li>
            <li> Also, after a time, my very sensitive skin starting reacting to it causing some mild allergic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> The shine means that dry time is significantly longer.  </li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment was originally recommended to me by my hairdresser because of the dry weather here in Northern Nevada.  </li>
            <li> I always get compliments on how good my hair smells and feels after applying it, and a little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a good investment in the health and beauty of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it regularly for several months and the bottle is still very full.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed the older bottle states, &#x27;made in Canada&#x27; - and the new states, &#x27;made in Israel&#x27; ...</li>
            <li> I bought my Moroccanoil from a salon, and it&#x27;s clear to me that it&#x27;s the \\&quot;real deal.\\</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair which has a tendency to either be frizzy when styled in waves or when straightened... and it is very susceptible to humidity.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit expensive but you don&#x27;t use a lot, Try it you will be happy.</li>
            <li> Your hair will be shiny, soft and very  manageable.  </li>
            <li> This oil seems to be one of the few products that will really make it smooth and shiny and this it does really well.</li>
            <li> The smell/consistency on the newer was just off, not thick and creamy as before.</li>
            <li> With just this one product my hair was so much smoother and felt so soft and looks shinier than it has since i was child.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is much cheaper and natural than this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of different products and treatments just to calm the frizz.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very shiny and soft and doesn&#x27;t at all make my hair greasy</li>
            <li> &amp; thought that this was what was needed for my three textured head of hair (naturally curly, straight &amp; with a birds nest).  </li>
            <li> It has some natural curl/wave in it and seems to go where ever it wants.  </li>
            <li> product might seem expensive, but I assure you it lasts a great deal of time.</li>
            <li> The hair torn soft and very shine.</li>
            <li> It works wonders and really does leave your hair feeling soft and looking shiny.  </li>
            <li> I think this product makes your hair really really soft, but it doesn&#x27;t help much for styling.</li>
            <li> Even my fiance was astounded and kept giving me compliments on how straight, shiny, and soft my hair was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy at all and keeps my hair looking fresh, and I now only shampoo once a week or so.</li>
            <li> The safety seal/tag that is normally over the top of the lid was missing.  </li>
            <li> I bought the big bottle it was worth</li>
            <li> My salon sells a bottle this size (maybe even smaller) for almost $50, so while it&#x27;s not a huge savings, it&#x27;s a great deal for someone who uses this product daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got solid white, funky, old guy hair and the combination of these two after I shower makes my hair look much more in control, softer, and thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a penny pincher, and normally I would just finish the product I have to save money.  </li>
            <li> Just have to be carefully not to use too much because your hair can get very oily</li>
            <li> not sure whether or not it is a real product in this bottle, but also I wonder about the added chemicals even in the authentic bottle...</li>
            <li> My hair used to never be greasy and I could go a few days between washes but when using this I have to shampoo more often.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a product that is going to over time repair long term damage more of a short term solution.</li>
            <li> mostly it just makes my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what it would do for normal hair.  </li>
            <li> Itnjust takes a few drops to  create a lovely, non greasy shine to my gray hair.</li>
            <li> Normally, my hair would have a ton by now.</li>
            <li> I love this product and definitely recommend it you want something that isn&#x27;t full of harsh chemicals and leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it - it only takes the amount about the size of a pea, and you apply it right after you shampoo.</li>
            <li> Everyone, including the new hair dresser, highly recommended Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is fine.</li>
            <li> It is sold just about everywhere now - so it is not hard to come by.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair super soft and kept me from having to use a conditioner or detangler in my hair for several days.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist was trying to sell me this product for around $70.00 at my salon, and I was so tempted to get it because the product left my hair super soft and shiny without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> and it is healthy for your hair especially if you blow dry or use a curling/flat iron.</li>
            <li> I mean... the reviews don&#x27;t lie - this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It works best if you put it in when your hair is wet, and you really only need to use a very small amount of it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny (under the right lighting conditions) but not oily, though I do have to shampoo every couple of days especially if I work out.</li>
            <li> (Same positive comments others have described - that&#x27;s why I bought it!)</li>
            <li> It started off great, and then somehow it actually started to dry out my hair over time while making my hair get an odd sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and frizzy and top that off with putting highlights in my hair, it can look a mess.  </li>
            <li> Recently I have had the Brazilian Blow Out treatment done to my hair which has left my hair straight, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> , he hugged me (how forgiving lol) and told me don&#x27;t worry wash your hair a couple of times with clarifying shampoo, use a deep conditioning mask, and take this bottle of moroccanoil treatment, use a tiny bit of moroccan oil on your wet hair before styling and a tiny bit after.  </li>
            <li> Also, this stuff is ridiculously expensive but it is very popular because it works so well.  </li>
            <li> It does hydrate a bit, and it works pretty good as a tamer for those especially unruly hair days, but not significantly better than some of the others out there such as Chi or Rusk Serums.</li>
            <li> I have used so many products over the years because I have very dry, coarse, frizzy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus it smells nice and you only need a little bit of product, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> old stuff was pretty thick, and had an exotic wood/spice smell.  </li>
            <li> The price is high, but worth it because while it works, it also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My new perm reacted with the hair color</li>
            <li> I discovered Moroccanoil on a visit to a new hair salon during my internship this summer.  </li>
            <li> But, after I was introduced to Moroccanoil, I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> Living in new england</li>
            <li> I had read about Moroccan Oil in New Beauty and In Style Magazine.</li>
            <li> My bottle (which was a gift) arrived leaking, and since it&#x27;s a liquid I can&#x27;t exchange it for a new bottle.    </li>
            <li> but I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I live and breathe by this product.</li>
            <li> Also, it will take a bit longer to ship if you live on my side of the country.     </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> Helps to minimize new damage.</li>
            <li> I cant live without it.</li>
            <li> When I went to a new beauty shop the stylist used this on my hair.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Live on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use conditioner also, but I attribute the new softness of my hair to this leave in product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it now.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment.</li>
            <li> she said she would just keep it and buy me a new bottle.</li>
            <li> Easy does it - you bet - this product is half price on amazon.com compared to buying it in the salon</li>
            <li> Just a pump or two on wet hair is all that&#x27;s needed to keep your hair soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It has also helps keep my hair manageable and very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Very professional.  </li>
            <li> This Moroccan Oil I do like because it has made my hair very soft</li>
            <li> It makes it feel very soft and adds shine.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li> Without making your hair greasy, it makes it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Being that she lives very far away</li>
            <li> Need only a small amount of Moroccanoil distributed through clean, damp hair and then maybe a light touch after drying and styling.</li>
            <li> Be sure to carefully look at your product as I originally was sent some styling cream that had the blue label and is totally NOT the same.</li>
            <li> new stuff smells like generic perfume and is pretty watery.  </li>
            <li> The first time I purchased Moroccan oil I was in an expensive salon, I felt that the oil was so much thicker and the aroma was very strong</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, so it did help with that, but that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, easy to style and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My girls can no more think about living without using Moroccan oil on their hair :)</li>
            <li> Used after the hair is very smooth,and not rough.</li>
            <li> This is the first product Ive used that actually controls frizzy hair during the humid Chicago summers.  </li>
            <li> Third, it keeps my curls really neat!</li>
            <li> I believe that the oil was not the same as the first order from another salon.</li>
            <li> and I was like WOW!</li>
            <li> The packaging was the exact same</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, shiny and feels stronger!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny now that I use this!</li>
            <li> A small portion in your palm will work magic.</li>
            <li> Not heavy!  </li>
            <li> Even after I washed it, it still felt more conditioned than usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what came in this bottle, but I&#x27;m QUITE sure it was NOT Moroccan Oil.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my hairdresser, and I must say - WOW!</li>
            <li> This is a complete life saver for my hair!</li>
            <li> She said she could tell it looked more shiny than usual.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> &quot; my palms on the ends and squeezing the ends in my fists.&lt;br /&gt;I flip my hair back and use another dime sized amount - first to the ends again and evenly through the rest of the hair with the remainder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last resort (after so many purchases of other products) and it works.  </li>
            <li> i even put it in my two-year old&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> EXACT same thing.</li>
            <li> It took a long time getting here, but my daughter loves the product so it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Wow, changed the texture of my color treated hair!</li>
            <li> This is my second time to try and leave feedback as this seller removed the first one.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hesitant buy the smaller bottle first and then work your way up</li>
            <li> Looks like this is the last time I&#x27;ll be splurging on the product and replacing the money spent with something more natural</li>
            <li> Do not need to use alot at one time so it lasts a long time and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They said it would arrive no later than 4/8, and it arrived on exactly 4/8.</li>
            <li> The great thing too is that you only need a small amount and the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> But, I noticed even on the first day a BIG difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the first time I ever purchased a bigger bottle, and I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with it for some reason.</li>
            <li> Completely weightless - all of their products are!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not the same product.  </li>
            <li> better use in fall and winter and just a small portion will be sufficient.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feel so shine and soft!</li>
            <li> It requires a very small amount to achieve good results,so that helps with the only con--</li>
            <li> It still makes my hair shine, but the perfume is a little strong.</li>
            <li> FYI, the scent is a little rather strong.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, wavy hair (to my back bra strap).</li>
            <li> They simply have used to much product for there particular hair type.  </li>
            <li> It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> light weight oil-doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down</li>
            <li> This Moroccan oil is light so hair is not weighed down.</li>
            <li> I can put it in wet hair and air dry for a sexy beachy wavy look or I can put it in after a blow dry to make my straight hair a little more sleek and tame down those fly away</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle at a local salon first to see if I liked it and then ordered the larger bottle on-line.  </li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week, very little dollop, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> The bottle had clearly been opened and re-glued, as evidenced by the stringy, booger-like glue that you find when you peel a brand new credit card off the mailer that it came in.</li>
            <li> and I am always trying new creams to make my hair soft,</li>
            <li> and I am always trying new creams to make my hair soft,</li>
            <li> Live by this stuff, use it every time i straighten my naturally curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> well worth the money, and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> i got chapped elbows every winter until i started using this and not a single dry patch all winter last year:-)</li>
            <li> Age and chemicals have caused my hair to be less than smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Genuine products &#x3D; Long lasting products!  </li>
            <li> But before I asked him, I tried finding it on my own, by going to several beauty supply stores, only to find an imitation called argan oil.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I spent the whole day going around saying to people \\&quot;feel</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of Moroccanoil makes my hair soft and shiney and easy to manage without an oily feel.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a little fine</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care - slow change over a couple of months, but after about a week, your skin isn&#x27;t dry, and stays moisturized, after a couple of months, your skin is soft, lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> One other note, if you blow dry or hot iron your hair straight, it helps with shine a bit, but if you&#x27;re trying not to damage your hair with all that heat, tug, etc,  then just putting it in your hair and letting it dry naturally won&#x27;t help it look better.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product my hair curls together into smooth curls instead of the frizzy mess</li>
            <li> I have the small bottle of this oil and love the smell of it so much I decided to buy the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I do my ends first and work my way up to the crown, then blow dry as normal.</li>
            <li> Better on wet hair than dry.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this oil on either dry or wet hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> and my hair is back to being healthy looking in less than a month.  </li>
            <li> As someone with fine hair, dry hair, and a frequently oily scalp, it is one of the only things I&#x27;ve found that offers conditioning for the hair without making my scalp oilier.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the original might weigh it down</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry, coarse, color treated hair and Moroccan Oil makes it soft, smooth, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> , I use 5 pumps on towel dried hair, put my hair back up in towel while doing makeup etc, once I take it down its very easy to comb through, dries as quickly as if nothing is on it and does NOT make hair greasy.</li>
            <li> At the price of this stuff I&#x27;d rather use pure argan oil, which is all argan oil &amp; none of the additives that leave my face, neck and scalp red and prone to break outs....</li>
            <li> so I can try a different (perhaps pure) Argan oil product.</li>
            <li> I did buy some at Sallys Beauty Supply Outlet thinking it was the same, but it certainly was not</li>
            <li> The thick, cloudy liquid in this bottle looked more like honey, and less like the clear, light, medium-viscosity Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> makes hair a little too smooth when you do</li>
            <li> A little Moroccan oil after a hair wash keeps my hair smooth and satin in appearance.  </li>
            <li> One only needs a little to restore hair to more youthful flexibility.</li>
            <li> If only it were a little cheaper I would buy it more often.</li>
            <li> The product contains less than 5-10% of the original oil in the formula.</li>
            <li> Love this.. use only a little or it will make your hair oily feeling</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure.  </li>
            <li> this oil if i use a little makes my hair feel soft and healthy and it stays that way until the next wash.   </li>
            <li> I work it through my wet hair prior to drying it straight and then smooth a little over the finished style to calm any flyaways.</li>
            <li> Not only are the frizzies gone but this amazing oil cuts drying time of my hair, whether by air or hairdryer, by at least two-thirds the time.</li>
            <li> It comes in a huge box and feels heavy</li>
            <li> I dis not give it a good chance, for the bad smile it have thats why i decid to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, especially if you put it on while hair is still damp, plus it really controls frizz and flyaways.</li>
            <li> and I just use a pea sized amount on towel dried hair just before I blow dry/flat iron...and it leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Naturally I have very curly, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair feeling soft, keeps the frizzies away, and lets my natural waves look soft.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to anyone and repurchase this product,  because clearly i am almost out.</li>
            <li> I knew it was different from anything else I had tried, my hair feld light weight and bouncy even though it was still wet.  </li>
            <li> It really provides deep conditioning to my hair and keeps it soft and shiny even after coloring and blow drying.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks totally different from real Morrocian oil.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural  </li>
            <li> The color is lighter and it does not make my hair feel as soft.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soft my hair was when the stylist used this oil on my hair, without being oily or stringy.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair sooo soft</li>
            <li> It left my hair greasy and didn&#x27;t smell anything like the real product.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It keeps it soft and silky and never oily</li>
            <li> I color my hair and it is naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> It makes the frizziest hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my curly hair have soft bouncy curls and when I straighten it, it&#x27;s soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> After drying, I straighten my hair and it looks and feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> and it still wasn&#x27;t soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> If you have stick straight hair already you likely don&#x27;t need this product -</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time as she says that she only needs a small amount to get great hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped to maintain the overall condition of my hair through processing and dye jobs.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil makes my hair soft, frizzfree...</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I do use the product frequently</li>
            <li> If I had to pick one singular beauty product that has completely changed my life</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product was recommended to me</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed that it has such a powerfull scent.  </li>
            <li> it actually makes blowdrying soo much faster.  </li>
            <li> This along with Paul Mitchell Skinny and Paul Mitchell Taming Spray keeps my hair feeling soft and holds the curls.</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying that I am a man with long hair.</li>
            <li> my hair feels so soft after using it.</li>
            <li> My hair also tends to get brittle and this product keeps my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Just soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> As a faux-blonde I rely on my Moroccan Oil to keep my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am in my forties and color my hair frequently</li>
            <li> We use the hydrading mask, intense curl cream, shine spray, and of course the actual moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> but the oil treatment made my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> (not affiliated-just a lover of natural products)</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your time buying this product unless you have the time, money, and patience to deal with your hair.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT the product to use just a \\&quot;dime sized amount\\&quot; with when transitioning from relaxed to natural.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had  never wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and can frizz in damp weather.</li>
            <li> No heavy oiliness...</li>
            <li> It makes it soft, shiny and smell</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> The Moroccanoil purchased from Amazon was totally off the M on the front had an outline which the real bottle does not.</li>
            <li> My curls are defined and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> so far.      </li>
            <li> it feels really soft.  </li>
            <li> So if you sensitive to smell, skip it.</li>
            <li> (Which is colored quite frequently)  </li>
            <li> This hair oil makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally soft, but senior year I decided to get highlights on my hair.</li>
            <li> I really think it makes a difference in the condition of my hair when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> The product far exceeded her expectations.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really soft like silk, no tangle, no fizzy.</li>
            <li> , it leaves my hair shiny and soft curls.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li> So -- I recommend you go to the Moroccan Oil website and order from them directly.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t find it any different than a biolage or biosilk hair tamer/smoother oil.  </li>
            <li> And my hair shined and was so soft.</li>
            <li> My old colorist told me not to</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil is the only thing that really works well.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humid weather.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy ( on my hair).</li>
            <li> My hair moist and soft.</li>
            <li> This is the one to use if you want natural looking hair.  </li>
            <li> It prevents it from drying out and keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have blond hair with natural wave which in the winter I tend to straighten a lot which has caused my hair to become damaged with a straw-like texture.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser picked me up a bottle from a hair show, and I could tell it was actually the real stuff in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Keeps her hair soft, hydrated, &amp; feels lightweight.</li>
            <li> it makes your hair so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that has become considerably smoother with this serum.</li>
            <li> I use it to keep my hair soft and protect it from the heat of my styling irons.</li>
            <li> Her hair shined and was so soft.</li>
            <li> how soft my hair is!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft</li>
            <li> It also has some out of control wave/curl action and frizz that get magnified when it&#x27;s humid</li>
            <li> so it gets straight ironed regularly</li>
            <li> I have natural  curly hair thats colored</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes the smell, so that goes to show the smell is really just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Wow~</li>
            <li> I also note that my old bottle has an expiration and this does not.</li>
            <li> but I have no way to know how old it</li>
            <li> It actually makes it appear as if my hair is much thicker again.  </li>
            <li> and now they are soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually trying to use up the bottle as fast as I can</li>
            <li> My hair feels much smoother after putting this regularly.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hair treatment makes my hair feel fuller and yet soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil.it leaves my hair so soft and frizz</li>
            <li> It definitely leaves hair softer and much shinier.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a product that would help control the frizz of my naturally curly hair as well as protect from blow-drying.  </li>
            <li> Can spend any amount to get my hair and skin fixed.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on my 4.5 year old son who had no body to his hair.</li>
            <li> but now all have started complimenting my sons hair as soft, bouncy and shiny for his age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making  my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> The product was old and expired.</li>
            <li> and I do achieve soft, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shine and soft.  </li>
            <li> It turns my permed color treated hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> be applied to your scalp for additional moisture and will not make your hair appear oily if you put it directly on your scalp&lt;br /&gt;Adds</li>
            <li> Definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this.  </li>
            <li> and I also know it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but in my case it keeps the hair smoother, shinier and with its natural volume.</li>

            <li> She is 80 years old.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li> so far i like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried off brands and they absolutely are not the same.  </li>
            <li> Not a heavy feeling either</li>
            <li> My hairdresser started using this on my hair and made it so soft after a blow out.  </li>
            <li> I got the same results at home as if I came straight from the salon.  </li>
            <li> I becomes soft, manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> I used the oil to help tame my fine and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling silky soft, not oily.  </li>
            <li> After applying it to my hair/scalp weekly I rub the rest into my hands as it makes  them soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> It does make my hair soft and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft without being oily</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> The production of real argan oil is labor-intensive and the product, even in Morroccan dirhans (the counrty&#x27;s currency) is relatively costly.</li>
            <li> This oil has completely revived my hair and i have never stopped buying it since my 1st use.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and protects it from breaking.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair baby soft and shiny....</li>
            <li> It took on a soft and shiny feel.</li>
            <li> I think this bottle will last me a long time - I&#x27;ve had it for a month and the bottle is still almost full.</li>
            <li> Worth every $$$ and last and last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries by itself and although I see 10% frizz, the hair looks so thick and healthy</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like me, be careful not to use to much oil because I did that the other day</li>
            <li> It works pretty good as far as reducing frizz and making hair easy to comb through, but the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t purchase this item due to the large amount of folks saying it was not the real product.  </li>
            <li> it is good for winter skin, dry nails, and a few drops go a long way, leaving no oily feeling at all.  </li>
            <li> A new, full bottle would have seemed the correct solution(the oil is not cheap).</li>
            <li> work it through, THEN comb through ( I&#x27;ve heard similarly to put  conditioner in hair right after wetting PrIOR to going in ocean salt</li>
            <li> Every single time, my hair stylist says &amp;#34;Wait - HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE I SAW YOU LAST?!?!&amp;#34; She can never believe it&#x27;s been 6 months to a year since I&#x27;ve last seen her because my hair is so healthy.</li>
            <li> in all, it Will suffice for a quick fix for minor frizz, but definitely not a &#x27;treatment&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Moroccanoil and I absolutely love it, along with several other products from them.</li>
            <li> hair is back to normal color!</li>
            <li> I use just a dab after I get out of the shower, while still a bit wet, and the comb goes right through the hair.</li>
            <li> I put two pumps on my wet hair right after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> The directions recommend less but because I love it soo much, I have used less</li>
            <li> I have tried lots and lots of stuff to tame, smooth, and make it shine.  </li>
            <li> I rarely have to use other products to get soft shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and it really helps control frizziness.  </li>
            <li> did not  make my hair shine immediately, but as I use it more, my hair seems to look less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Great for people with dry, damaged or permed hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this product pretty much every day and have been for a little over the year</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair, especially when it gets wet, i.e first get out of shower.</li>
            <li> If you have hair that is a bit dry, or simply want to add a nice aroma to your hair, in addition to giving your hair a little protection from drying out, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit seems to put a nice sheen and shine to your hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is good for fine thin straight hair, might make it greasy or weigh it down..</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is good for fine thin straight hair, might make it greasy or weigh it down..</li>
            <li> My hair is about 2 inches past my shoulders, fine and curly with medium sized curls.</li>
            <li> I also love the oil&#x27;s subtle scent on my daughters&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> but a few drops comes a long way :)</li>
            <li> The aroma is slightly musky but not overpowering and wears off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Found it quickly and ordered it for much less than in salons.  </li>
            <li> No more hair conditioners (either wash out or leave in) as the oil makes my hair glisten wonderfully in natural light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a fake bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have had Moroccan Oil before and the bottle I recently purchased does not feel like the first bottle I purchased from a local shop.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all, no other ingredients, all natural.  </li>
            <li> I am otherwise super lo-fi in terms of hair styling and maintenance - I never blow dry, flat iron, curl, etc.</li>
            <li> Well, after the hype surrounding this product, I had high hopes for my coarse curly hair and it being a match made in heaven.      </li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product as well as the accompanying deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Would highly recomend it for people with the same hair problems as me.</li>
            <li> Ove tried a lot of high end brands and keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> I SO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE MOROCCAN OIL LINE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not entirely sure what Moroccan Oil is specifically supposed to achieve (in terms of growth or hair repair etc.), but it smells nice and adds light moisture and shine that I can use a few times a week without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Let me say right away that men and women can both use it, its not something that only half of us can enjoy, I think my friend Danny who&#x27;s also a hair product fanatic will really like this!    </li>
            <li> Sometimes if your hair is really dry it will sit on top for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I apply it to my wet hair midshaft to ends and my hair is soft, and stays super soft, all day long.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely, it doesn&#x27;t drag down my hair and while the ends are a bit dry, this really seems to nourish my hair.  </li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, and my hair feels soft and frizz free all day!</li>
            <li> After a shower I put a small amount on my fingers and start at the ends and lightly through my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is relatively straight, long with a medium texture</li>
            <li> After a shower I put a small amount on my fingers and start at the ends and lightly through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and use maybe a nickel-sized dollop of it at any one time - too much and your hair can start looking greasy.</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap flowers and feels like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> It also smells fantastic but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The product was also a different color than what I normally purchase.  </li>
            <li> And, lastly, but not least, my husband has not had problems with dandruff since using the Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> With this oil conditioner was not needed, I´d just washed with shampoo and applyed three drops of oil in the hair still wet and ready!</li>
            <li> It \\&quot;calms\\&quot; frizzies better than other products and though it&#x27;s more expensive than silicone-based shine and anti-frizz solutions, you only need a wee bit</li>
            <li> The effect on my hair was OK, but it was expensive compared to other products that have the same or better effect.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products, cheaper and more expensive, but I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than what was in stores and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> While I am a true lover of Moroccan Oil, I am also just like every other girl who has damage done to her hair on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not speaking for ALL women but mostly for those w/ thick, coarse hair AND for those who are in the relaxed to natural transitioning phase.  </li>
            <li> Regular serums are too heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The package looks the same but the consistency is thinner, the smell isn&#x27;t right and the way it leaves my hair is definitely not the same.  </li>
            <li> first time I used it, I applied about two pumps worth to my towel dried hair and then let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier and the product has more application options, in my opinion, than other products I&#x27;ve tried previously.  </li>
            <li> My split ends are still there, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones coming back.</li>
            <li> when it started running low, I went to my orders, clicked purchase again and ordered a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> I live in a beach resort on the east coast, and I am constantly fighting the humidity during the summer months.</li>
            <li> She has very long straight hair and loves how it feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> hair is very curly and can get quite dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I prefer to blow dry it straight and this product makes it smoother and silkier and tends to help the puffiness.</li>
            <li> but once hair is completely dry you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair and in just a week my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> would recommend this if you have dry hair or curly hair, it really moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It really tames my curly hair that is dry from color treatment.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, but it is chemically treated and can be dry.  </li>
            <li> My ends tend to get dry, no matter how much I condition, and this helps to extend the time between visits to the salon for a trim to shape them up</li>
            <li> - I also think it makes my hair dry much faster</li>
            <li> The easiest check is that on the real product, above the L on the white Moroccanoil writing on the bottle, has a (R)- for registered trademark.</li>
            <li> I have the real oil and it smelled differently and worked differently.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair nearly as shiny and soft as the DermOrganic Argan Oil samples from the local salon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently bought the restorative mask and conditioner too, which do the same thing and don&#x27;t require me to use the oil much.</li>
            <li> My former hairdresser suggested this product a few years ago and it has worked fabulously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the real Moroccan Oil for quite a few years now and this stuff is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and long layered and when I use this, 2 pumps worth on 3/4 of lower length of hair</li>
            <li> I use a touch more on my daughter&#x27;s thick waist length hair with similar results.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic for naturally curly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Next morning, I felt my hair became very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have tried it a few times to give it a chance and because of the high price and money wasted and each time I dislike it even more.</li>
            <li> I put it in right before I blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> If you use a curling iron you may have to spray a little hair spray first since the hair is very soft</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this supposedly healing oil to anyone with very kinky unpermed or not fine hair but rather the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> In general my hair feel regenerated in all ways, scalp to splitendless tip!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like no other oil.</li>
            <li> So not sure if its original.</li>
            <li> The result was some of my hair was frizzy, other parts were oily looking and yet other parts were soft and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> As some oils are considered hot oils, just due to the spice they are derived from.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, straight hair who is prone to having static.</li>
            <li> Still not sure if this is the original oil that I have bought at the salon.</li>
            <li> There is no other product of this type that works as well on your hair.</li>
            <li> split ends like no other product&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> hair is coarse with natural curl which can become frizzy and out of control!</li>
            <li> In my current attempt to go \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot;, my hair is a giant sponge and this product does not and WILL not do anything luxurious for the new growth that is coming in like wild fire.  </li>
            <li> so when I take a shower and damp some on my wet hair and let it air dry, it makes such a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I can see the shine on dry hair if I have a pulled back &#x27;do, but if my curly hair is just running wild, I need a whole lot of it to see a difference.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick but baby fine.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, if the cap was loose in the first place somebody was messing with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy but worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but, in my opinion, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little obnoxious, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> but I wouldnt say it&#x27;s any better than the Silkease I have used for years which is less than half the price.</li>
            <li> It also makes your hair shiny and soft, holds down frizz and static, and can be used on either wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try something new with my hair because my long hair always got dry and took me time to fix it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied a very small amount (which isn&#x27;t always easy to do since there is no pump) and it made my hair feel like there was product in it.</li>
            <li> It breaks less and has more shine and bounce than with the Bio Silk, which has alcohol in it, which can dry out african american hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the formula was somehow \\&quot;improved\\&quot; or changed but when I open the little bottle that is almost empty, it smells great.</li>
            <li> Also, it makes my hair super, duper soft - not even kidding you, I can use a wide tooth comb and comb through it as if it&#x27;s not even wet!</li>
            <li> I live in southern Arizona where it&#x27;s exceptionally arid, and my hair suffers.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair daily and never have to roll my long hair as this puts so much body in it.  </li>
            <li> I have super fine hair that tangles and frizzed like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it in place of lotion on my face and noticed a marked improvement under my eyes and overall texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m that girl with natural blonde hair....</li>
            <li> And naturally, I sweat, and my hair is a giant frizz ball.</li>
            <li> The oil offers some protection from the heat and keeps the hair hydrated enough that it doesn&#x27;t frizz out of control.</li>
            <li> The result was soft silky feeling hair, especially at the tips of the hair, where i am prone to split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> some of the back will have a natural wave to it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by someone who processes her hair often, by dying her hair different colors frequently.</li>
            <li> I have short, naturally curly and soft mixed race hair.  </li>
            <li> I use Redkin All Soft cream conditioner (i use a tiny bit and leave it in after i am completely done shampooing and conditioning with a different product)</li>
            <li> I decided to repeat this test again later in the week under the assumption that I perhaps I used too much oil or didn&#x27;t spread it out enough but the ended up with the same results.    </li>
            <li> It is not even real argan oil, argan oil is a minimal part of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The Moroccanoil is the only product that I have used so far that does not leave a sticky residue and tames my frizz.</li>
            <li> Obviously, bieng in the water frequently can take a toll on your hair.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s young but I always believe that hair reflects your personality and some bit of work begins from childhood itself as my mother did the same for me.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone; especially people with naturally curly or course hair.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I thought that one day I&#x27;d stop using it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it actually does anything to actually treat the hair but overall have been using it for a while and love it</li>
            <li> My hairstylist first recommended it a few years ago, and this product--along with the Morrocanoil Shampoo and Conditioner, are all I need to keep my hair soft, shiny, and literally looking like celebrity hair.</li>
            <li> Smells and works completely differently from the way the actual product normally does.</li>
            <li> I figured this would leave my hair heavy and opaque when first tried it, but it surprised me.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to coloring, curling and abusing my hair and after I step out of the shower and feel better about it, ha.</li>
            <li> I put it on towel dried freshly washed hair before I roller set it and sit under the dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I was kind of skeptical.</li>
            <li> FOR MY THIN AND MOST OF THE TIME FRIZZY HAIR.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks, but I&#x27;m a true believer.</li>
            <li> This product worked ok for me, but not great.  </li>
            <li> I also just purchased the \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version which is even better if you have thin hair.    </li>
            <li> If you have crazy cavewoman fly-way frizzies like i do, this stuff makes your &#x27;do look as good as a blow out on wash-n-wear hair.</li>
            <li> - not really sure if that is true or not,</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nice and silly.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is kind of useless when I have it.</li>
            <li> Pricy but worth it for manageable hair everyday.</li>
            <li> YOU SAVE BY NOT PURCHASING THESE FAKE PRODUCTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION OF YOUR CHOICE THAT ASSISTS THIRD-WORLD CITIZENS IN BETTERING THEIR LIVES.</li>
            <li> Perhaps there is not as much argan oil as one would expect, but I can&#x27;t slather pure oil on my hair since that would just make it stick together in one ugly clump, so less oil in this product is a good thing for me.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I feel like it really weighs it down when I wear it in my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it really keeps the frizz down on my natural curls.</li>
            <li> It perfumes your hair in a subtle &#x27;Arabian Nights&#x27; kind of way that I haven&#x27;t found in any other shine product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfumes due to allergies but this is a nice subtle tone that does not affect me.</li>
            <li> I flip my head upside down and apply to ends first alternating \\&quot;tapping\\</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works with no greasy feeling (and I use 3-5 pumps) or weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before from other sites, i like the oil I purchased before, but this one from amazon was a little different, the scent in it has more perfume that I do not like.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with a \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot; problem.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry hair.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way, so it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My sister, who has the same type of hair, was using a spray in gel product that is available in most stores, and it was drying up her ends and breaking her hair off, in addition to being a hot mess after sleeping, forcing her to wash it every day if she wanted to avoid a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li> It is far better than the other oils and creams you are accustomed to, and you only need to apply a small amount.  </li>
            <li> but I was trying to finish up some of my other hair products before getting yet another thing that would add to my large collection of cosmetics and potions.</li>
            <li> She directed me to other brands that are pure and have no color.</li>
            <li> I have really damaged, coarse and dry hair that is always frizzy and unruly.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I will see if I can get my money back for what is the equivalent of $2 worth of yellow baby oil.</li>
            <li> I used to use Nubian Silk Hair Oil, which is a viscous oil formula with a heavy scent, but now I use the right product, that will improve my hair.  </li>
            <li> Adds just the right amount of shine without making hair look greasy or feel too heavy.  </li>
            <li> have dry, coarse hair so for me, having soft hair is a new sensation, and I am obsessed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, my first and previous bottle lasted 11 months.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that claim to do the same thing but leaves your hair greasy or smell funny.</li>
            <li> I really did not notice a difference between this product and other hair serums.</li>
            <li> And since you only use a dime sized dollop on your hair after you wash it, it really does last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Then I usually brush my hair back in a smooth, low ponytail while I put on my make-up.</li>
            <li> I straighten my naturally wavy hair, so I need a product to control the frizz, and also protect against blow drying/ flat iron damage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also way lighter than any of the other frizz serums which tend to flatten and make my hair look oily if I use to much.  </li>
            <li> So it really does last for a long time even with multiple users.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is when I don&#x27;t wash my hair the next day, the texture feels funny when I wet it.</li>
            <li> I use Moroccan oil in the summertime to help smooth my VERY thick, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously purchased this  product online from a different seller, after using it many times from a salon, I was displeased with it&#x27;s authenticity, and it was obviously watered down.  </li>
            <li> I live in sandy soil and the mains and tails are dry and with out shine.</li>
            <li> This is an exciting new (to me, at least) product made from the oil of a plant that is only found growing native to Morocco.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it but this time around it had a bad smell and was very watery.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair (bleached blonde), and it makes my hair feel smoft, smooth and shiney without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> If you are an African American woman (or any ethnic woman) who has had RELAXERS and are going through the RELAXED to NATURAL transition?</li>
            <li> Because of the glass bottle, you also have to be extra careful to spill any oil and touch the bottle, very slippery.</li>
            <li> and now I wasted more than a half left of it.</li>
            <li> I am African American with type 3c hair and this product leaves my hair frizzy and does not define my natural curl.</li>
            <li> I spent too much money on this product because I though this is going to be different</li>
            <li> It is also naturally curly, and even though I straighten it daily, the southern humidity can cause it to frizz.  </li>
            <li> second, it&#x27;s soft texture and feel actually works to repair some of the damage I have on my ends.</li>
            <li> Plus since my hair is not dry its growing ..</li>
            <li> Great for thin or thick hair.</li>
            <li> and if I use Moroccan Oil, my hair does not dry out.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair and becomes easily frizzy, this product helps with all the above</li>
            <li> ; line is, like almost all available &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; products, a complete rip-off.</li>
            <li> This winter my normally oily hair decided to stay oily at the scalp but become very dry and lifeless on the ends.</li>
            <li> It may seem a little expensive, but the bottle will last forever, plus you will probably be able to get rid of many of your other hair products.</li>
            <li> No other similar products like it!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little more expensive than I&#x27;d like to pay, it&#x27;s been worth every penny for me.</li>
            <li> This product is the exact same as what I have purchased previously at hair salon.</li>
            <li> After about 1 year and a half I love this product, the end of my hair, where the highlights are, has become less dry.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t process my hair that much, but it is very curly and difficult to keep from kinking up in humidity when I&#x27;ve styled it straight.</li>
            <li> I used it when I flat ironed my hair and it left my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> Need to be careful not to use too much or your hair will lay flat.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey compared to other oils, but investing into a product that is going to give you long lasting results such as shine, body and bounce, is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> There is no long term benefits from using this product.</li>
            <li> I have always heard that caucasian and african american hair are very different but to make the review complete</li>
            <li> , it usually goes away once it is absorbed into my hair.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I bought and got in within a few days of buying it.</li>
            <li> Umm I mean it&#x27;s just oil , nothing special about it , I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s the fuss is all about</li>
            <li> I used less than half, and even though it was cheap, I threw it out.  </li>
            <li> I spent the first 25 years of my life living in Atlanta, now I&#x27;m in New York City, so I know a few things about both damaged hair AND humidity.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I previously purchased in salons!  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says as far as absorbing into the hair, making it very slick and managable (due to the fact I hear there are silocones in it)</li>
            <li> My last bottle (3.4 oz) was used from the end of November, 2008 until the first week in October, 2009 because it only takes a small amount in the palm of your hand to completely coat your hair.</li>
            <li> (The argan used for the face and body is uncooked; there is another version of the oil, roasted and darker, used for cooking and high in mono-unsaturates, like olive oil, that is equally costly).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I noticed right away that there are no more split ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and dry and this oil is the only thing That really works.</li>
            <li> (like I said, it&#x27;s very long and fairly thick) and made sure to blow it dry.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to work great in my hair, until my stylist mentioned that my hair was inexplicably getting dark on the ends.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, at first I was doubtful about it.</li>
            <li> At 59 my hair, once soft and lustrous, had become rather dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I use a Lush Seanik shampoo bar and Aubrey organics moisturizing conditioner then hop out of the shower, comb my hair and put in my Redken blow dry protectant and then use a dime sized amount of the Moroccanoil, concentrating on the ends,</li>
            <li> My hair was bleached and it was dry, and always had to use a lot of conditioner and masks to stay soft.</li>
            <li> I leave mine to dry naturally.</li>
            <li> But maybe that&#x27;s because I have dry, color-treated, curly, wavy (wild) hair and have been struggling for a couple of years now with an age-related or stress-related frizzing problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my friends and I use it and all of us thought it is effecient --- making our dry hair soft and glossy.</li>
            <li> I have dry, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it makes her normally dry hair shimmer naturally.</li>
            <li> -generally I need only about a dime size amount for my short hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally wavy, color-treated blonde hair and this oil</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle in Christmas 2013 and just  had to order my second bottle a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER THICK (everyone comments on it)</li>
            <li> I also live in a very dry climate in western Colorado which also contributes to the dryness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> i have very thick, curly and frizzy dry hair; this product helps me handle my dry ends and keeps my hair healthy, soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle (first one lasted a year and a half!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone with any type of hair, especially dry, unruly, or frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick but fine hair, which means -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 years old and notice my hair was starting to become dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it after my hair is dry to make extra soft.</li>
            <li> Use it with the hair masque and your dry, coarse hair is soft.</li>
            <li> The next morning my hair is soft and no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t usually just let my hair dry by itself and expect it to look full and</li>
            <li> i used one small squirt of this oil junk on my very straight soft brown hair after my shower on damp locks and then blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the glass amber bottle it comes in, I dropped mine and broke it the first time the glass got slick from the oil in the product, so now I just pour it into another container as soon as I get a new bottle, and problem solved.</li>
            <li> And I want to warn everyone that this product is not true, is any oil, but is not the MOCORRANOIL therefore do not have the texture, smell and even the same power as the real has.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have oily and thin baby fine hair that I have to wash and blowdry every day.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty full bottle of the stuff that I haven&#x27;t been able to use because it makes my hair dry and smells horrible.</li>
            <li> nothing special and the worst part is that the wonderful smell I have smelled on other moroccan oils was MISSING.  </li>
            <li> I only lost a few drops of oil but the mess was huge since it&#x27;s an oil-based product.</li>
            <li> I would like to try the Intense Curl Creme because there are time when I like a little curl, but under control.</li>
            <li> First i towel dry my hair and then comb it, then put a dime size amount in my hand, rub hands together and work into the ends of my hair (bottom half).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar products they sell at make-up stores, but they made my hair greasy, of course, I have really fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> My sister has fine hair and she finds that this product is too heavy and makes her hair limp and greasy</li>
            <li> For me, Moroccanoil is just so-so and not worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil has given my hair an amazing shine without weighing it down or having any negative effects of other \\&quot;shine enhancers\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> He has pretty coarse hair and since using this after every wash, his hair is softer and less dry looking.</li>
            <li> I use this on my curly hair and I really like it, you only need a little bit</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way :) Frizzy hair no more.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and use a flat iron every day and my hair feels silky soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, it slightly weighed down my curl and made them a bit less ringlet like and more wavy.  </li>
            <li> It becomes huge with uncontrollable volume and stubborn waves that are NOT attractive.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil for approximately a week and have noticed a HUGE difference in the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> few weeks ago, I went to the hairdresser and she told me that 6 months of not cutting my hair had led to so much damage that unless I wanted a bob, I had to use this stuff just to keep the split ends manageable and to keep my split ends from splitting further up the follicle, and then I have to go in every 6 weeks where she&#x27;ll slowly cut off my damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also use it as a base with my Essential Oils from young living it dilutes them for my fair skin</li>
            <li> , the oil is thick but does not have your hair oily, it has a high smell which i can live with, but some may think otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, color-treated hair, and Moroccan Oil makes it shiny and lay flat.</li>
            <li> After using a flat iron daily and the frequent coloring my hair was very dry and brittle</li>
            <li> Not too thick, just right.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really explain why, but I swear it made my hair feel dry, but at the same time, there was less frizz.</li>
            <li> It really helps to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> The quality was poor, so I compared it with original one.&lt;br /&gt;The front and backside levels were similar, but different.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use too much of it will weigh your hair down a little or make it too soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair dry in half the time AND holds my style all day without too much product.</li>
            <li> I always setting my hair( my hair is black and thick, but easy to damaged.), and always use this oil, can protect my hair.</li>
            <li> this product is one that works really well, a little bit goes a long way, lasts practically forever</li>
            <li> I tried other products but nothing made my hair feel as soft as the Moroccan Oil.  </li>
            <li> Tried to experiment with other oils (i.e josie maron, macadamia natural oil)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron to get the same results.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron and this definitely helps.</li>
            <li> A must buy especially if you color or flat iron your hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my wife&#x27;s long hair shine, she no long has the frizzie look.</li>
            <li> it gets extremely dry in the winter which can really make a mess out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh your hair down and makes it feel so soft!</li>
            <li> One bottle lasted that long, and I recently just bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair straight, soft and sleek (with a little help from an iron) without heaviness and even a little resistant to humidity frizz.</li>
            <li> My stylist applies it before the blow-dryer and flat iron, and I have used a small amount at home on the ends of my dry hair to smooth down the frizzy ends.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this stuff but disliked it immediately.</li>
            <li> Argan oil has become such a faddish Western craze that even in Morocco, the cities&#x27; medinas (central squares where merchants gather to sell their wares, in the case of argan essentially to tourists) are full of fake argan oil sellers, whose products are actually vegetable oil with perhaps a touch of argan.</li>
            <li> Especially for those women with natural (black) hair that need to oil their hair.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I applied the product, let my hair dry overnight, and straightened it the next morning.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy for your hair ...apply it to your hair wet or dry ....</li>
            <li> After seeing this product in multiple beauty magazines and reading all the reviews online, I was starting to feel like I could not live without this product.</li>
            <li> I have dry long hair (mixed regular and coarse curly and beaded) which I iron and color</li>
            <li> very well - small price to pay.  </li>
            <li> I was going to try and find something else until I saw the negative reviews and then ordered from the first supplier that I used.</li>
            <li> My Hair;  Long 5-7\\&quot; Past Sholders  Semi-Wavy, gets frizzy brushed without a straight iron  Med.</li>
            <li> Very oily (like cooking oil), use small amount, put it on at bedtime and your hair is softer and healthier in weeks.</li>
            <li> Keeps split ends away even though I use hot tools on my hair at least four times a week</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended for conditioning/protecting long hair.  </li>
            <li> so the bottle does last a long time for me.</li>
            <li> (or else it would smell like burning after i flat iron it)  </li>
            <li> It is an oil, so a tiny dab goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I did NOT need a flat iron on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and even when I flat iron it</li>
            <li> hair was oily and flat.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist turned me on to Moroccan Oil because I flat iron my hair almost every day.  </li>
            <li> Gloss after flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and i have long hair, we use dryers and curling irons constantly</li>
            <li> This product restores moisture and shine to my extra long locks without making my hair oily.</li>
            <li> bottle will last a long time.   </li>
            <li> One bottle will last a long time..</li>
            <li> I just this on the ends of my hair where I flat irion and curl.</li>
            <li> I use as a finishing oil once I have flat ironed or blow dryed my hair.</li>
            <li> I rub a quarter size amount between my hands and rub through my hair before I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> Also while I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> With this product, I put it in before drying and before styling with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This size bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It also heat protects when using a curling iron or flat</li>
            <li> I have really thick, naturally curly, coarse hair and it makes my hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Once my hair is dry, I apply a little more to tame down the fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put this near the crown or if can weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and soft without weighing it down or making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> It protects it from the heat, and makes hair soft and shiny, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It was very dry and damage and now it feels like it actually has life back!</li>
            <li> Very heavy compared to the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair or style it with a straightener/curling iron frequently, but have always had long, coarse, thick strands with a natural wave/curl.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and other products just don&#x27;t provide the richness that this product does.</li>
            <li> But have found a new salon and Michael has helped me realize that the Moroccan oil is too heavy.</li>
            <li> The only very minor downside is that, once you get it on your hands (which you&#x27;ll need to do to apply it), it takes some washing and wiping to get it off your hands.  </li>
            <li> The shine doesn&#x27;t last very long on the hair.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and the last thing I need is a torched head.</li>
            <li> You only need a drop so it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde hair (I can sit on it) and this softens my hair</li>
            <li> so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific for dry, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I swim and blow dry my hair on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> It was nappy, coarse, and of course, dry from a hair coating job.</li>
            <li> also, it&#x27;s terrific in the winter to rub excess oil on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My coarse, dry hair loves this oil.</li>
            <li> I have hypothyroidism which has caused my hair to become dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> My hair is fragile, dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> At my age, that&#x27;s a real bonus because I like to wear my hair a bit long (past shoulder length) but don&#x27;t want to look like a witch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and would recommend it to anyone with dry scalp and unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I am Black with naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is damp prior to styling, and I touch up my hair with it after its dry.</li>
            <li> This product helped immensely with my dry, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I straighten and blow dry daily, so there&#x27;s a bit of heat damage.</li>
            <li> Next you can blow dry and style as you would normally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I can put in my hair and just let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I put several pumps on my dry hair and sleep with it on.  </li>
            <li> Can also be used on dry hair, especially if you&#x27;ve been out all day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been tangling and it&#x27;s so dry and coarse</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the oily consistancy or the fact you only need about a dime size for normal hair falling past the shoulders.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me a long long time.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it tends to get oily quick, not with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse and extremely curly hair, and live in a very humid climate.</li>
            <li> The one-time use benefit - to me - was not deserving of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I tried it several times hair wet, hair dry, small amount, meduim amount, large amount, and it does nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I spray that one all over my hair after the Moroccan Oil is brushed through, then brush again and blow dry, then wa la!</li>
            <li> I tried other, even more expensive oil products, and they just don&#x27;t compare to this.  </li>
            <li> My hair was highlighted blonde and was very dry.</li>
            <li> Also, cannot use on dry hair, no matter how little I use or what other people say; it leaves it waxy and makes it ratty like it wants to start dreading.</li>
            <li> I got my haircut,blown dry and styled (flat iron).</li>
            <li> and I blow dry it and use a flat iron every day.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit so this bottle will last several months.  </li>
            <li> Only use a TINY, TINY bit; a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but you use such a tiny amount that the bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Due to daily blow-drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li> I have dark curly, relaxed African American hair.  </li>
            <li> I went to the salon to get my long hair cut off trying to regain a bit of a youthful look.</li>
            <li> Second, there is absolutely no crunch, just softness.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (almost waist</li>
            <li> I have long hair with split ends and the oil softens my hair and improves the ends.</li>
            <li> Before Moroccanoil I did this same routine minus the MO and my hair looked frizzy as soon as I stepped out the door into the humid Mississippi heat.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that when I dont use it my hair feels coarse and rough.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, I use 3 pumps.  </li>
            <li> if you consider how long it lasts, I bought a 3.4 oz bottle and its been 10 months</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all I use to keep a natural effortless curly (messy) look.</li>
            <li> thus, one bottle goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> I have a long haired dog that</li>
            <li> Will order again as long as they are competitive.</li>
            <li> It just took a long time to get it</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday before blow drying and it leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it on my long locks and it keeps my hair moisturized and helps with tangles after showers.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> he uses is almost everyday, keeps his hair soft</li>
            <li> I have long (mid-back) virgin hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is highlighted.  </li>
            <li> pump goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> prior to that but not much if you strip it w/ combing) put 2 pumps or 2 dime size into hair</li>
            <li> I have medium long hair</li>
            <li> Pricy but one bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I started to take notice that my hair has had its natural glow.</li>
            <li> I use this on my long haired dogs and their coats are so silky.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> hair is thin/fine, long, and prone to oil and dandruff.</li>
            <li> And, that means this bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair feels greasy even with just a drop, and the smell is not nearly as strong.&lt;br /&gt;Almost has a watery consistency to it.</li>
            <li> It lasts me a long time also.</li>
            <li> but for my hair which is long and wavy it feels like its coating it and not penetrating the hair shaft</li>
            <li> I have 2 daughters with long curly hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that is very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair</li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s hair is thick and it work really well.</li>
            <li> This oil works on thick hair not thin.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly but can get a little frizzy if iti gets too dry.  </li>
            <li> I too have used several different products, tried all the rage in shampoos/conditioners but when it comes down to it, nothing else will compare.  </li>
            <li> I only put it on my scalp occasionally, as that will sometimes weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have very long straight dark Italian hair and used WEN in the past....</li>
            <li> The ingredients of this Moroccan Oil product and the Organix product are nearly identical but the Organix oil is over 30 dollars less!    </li>
            <li> The product smells completely different and does not work as well as previous purchases of the same product.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount, even less than the &amp;#34;dime size&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that takes forever to blow dry, even when drying in layers, but this product has really helped to reduce the drying time.  </li>
            <li> This really helps my thick, dry (colored) hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair improves with every use, i have tried many expensive highly rated hair improvers and usually find them too heavy</li>
            <li> It was delivered very quickly and is less expensive that the local stores.</li>
            <li> I put it in my wet hair before I blow dry, in dry hair to brush out hair spray and in combination with a deep conditioner treatment overnight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, wavy, and tends to dry and frizzy at the ends.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry for a long while no matter what shampoo and hair conditioner I used.  </li>
            <li> Something weird-- NOT the familiar scent of MorrocanOil.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I tried 2 other Argan type oil treatments thinking I would get the same effect for less...not even close!  </li>
            <li> For the record, if I couldn&#x27;t get L&#x27;anza or if they doubled the price of their product, then I would DEFINITELY opt to use Moroccanoil over any other product out there.    </li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed to open the box and only find the bottle of oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basic serum mixed with a little bit of argan oil and a rat poison preservative...</li>
            <li> In other words, DO NO BUY THIS PRODUCT from Above ALL BEAUTY!</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt this silky or stayed frizz-free for so long!  </li>
            <li> When I straighten it, it works the same as any other hair oil/tamer.  </li>
            <li> we selected middle rating due to quality concern of this product.</li>
            <li> Since you only need a little the bottle last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I totally am stoked to use this with my other oils for my hair.</li>
            <li> Pricey enough that I moved onto other products</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle lasts a long time if you just use one or two pumps per use!</li>
            <li> And I have long hair and need it in sunny Florida!  </li>
            <li> Josie Maran and a couple other cosmetic purveyors offer actual argan oil at the cost of about 89 dollars for 1.7 ounces.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair while wet and again on dry hair, after I flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it helps to calm it down some!</li>
            <li> my daughter and I both have very long hair.</li>
            <li> Although it may seem a bit pricey, it lasts a very long time.  </li>

            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair every day as well.</li>

            <li> I can not live without this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new in using this product I&amp;#34;ve</li>
            <li> yes its pretty tough for me to deal with my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes along way espcially prior to flat ironning.</li>
            <li> I cant not use for a single day.</li>
            <li> It lasts me about 6 months (not using it every single day, but close to it).  </li>
            <li> I bought it online before and hated it; the smell was very strong and the texture was thick and full of silicone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;tamer\\&quot; type products in the past but they seem geared only towards those with naturally curly, coarse type hair or something and weigh my baby locks down.</li>
            <li> but, only use a little teeny bit it will go a long way for even long hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair that I bleache/tone/highlight platinum blonde.  </li>
            <li> This turns hair into silk, few small drops is all I need in the morning on freshly washed hair that&#x27;s still wet or damp, and it vanished instantly, never making my hair greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Not worth $42 for a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> It takes a small dab in the hand to create a soft, silky, feel to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but this is very expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I put a very small amount in my wet hair and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> When I let it loose after 10 minutes or so, it is even smoother.</li>
            <li> you only need a very little ..it will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> but I will probably use a little less so as not to weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li> in fact it&#x27;s possible it could just weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Finally, an oil treatment that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or leave that greasy feeling when you run your hand through it.</li>
            <li> Hair felt softer and did not get weighed down even after multiple uses in a row.</li>
            <li> This is a little pricey but the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It last a long time, just a little dab will do.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it also helps to cut back on the drying time!</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way, so one pump ONLY!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but because you really only need one squirt of it, the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I use about a quarter of it after the shower; i have hair half way down my back, shorter hair needs only a nickel size or dime..  </li>
            <li> Everyone with dry hair needs this!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for oily or dry hair!</li>
            <li> If you want an antidote to dry frizzy hair, this is it!  </li>
            <li> My hair is a bit on the dry side, but this oil beats the frizzies!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how dry my hair is!  </li>

            <li> Could be used on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> I am prone to frizz, and I use this out of the shower on wet hair, and then as a styling aid on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair that soaks up this type of product like a sponge and still feels dry a few hours later.  </li>
            <li> The slight musky aroma only hints that it is present.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works on wet or dry hair and my beautician uses it before she colors my hair which helps the color hold longer and stay shiny.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a small pea size daily on my medium-length hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is wet and again when it&#x27;s dry and styled.</li>
            <li> this is not the same product, not sure if the formula is different for the &amp;#34;middle east&amp;#34; version.  </li>
            <li> Because you put it on when hair is still wet, it blends into the hair as you blow dry and keeps it in place.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot to get the same control and leaves a slightly greasy feel to my hair.  </li>
            <li> You definitely see less breakage.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, unpredictable hair</li>
            <li> I use it for the ends of my hair when my hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a few drops, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I also like that I can use it on wet hair when I come out of the shower, not blow dry, and it&#x27;s still perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not seem to matter if i put it on wet hair or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I had to return this as the Moroccanoil scent was different than all my previous purchases from a salon.</li>
            <li> I will definitely try some of the other products that other reviewers are taking about.  </li>
            <li> You can do this on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> find it expensive considering that the starting materials&lt;br /&gt;are not difficult to find, But after all I imagine we pay for the&lt;br /&gt;novelty.</li>
            <li> Can use on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> and you can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I applied the Moroccan oil when my hair was wet and then blew it dry.</li>
            <li> The bottle last for quite awhile because only a small amount is used each time.</li>
            <li> it will damage your hair and will make it break less but only because it puts a plastic layer in your hair</li>
            <li> May be used while wet or dry and makes untangling a breeze.</li>

            <li> I purchased the argan oil for my daughter who has very dry hair.</li>
            <li> it is also very dry hair...  </li>
            <li> if you have a very dry hair or damaged hair, just try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of high-end hair products out there, in addition to a lot of drug store lines, and Moroccan Oil is the only thing that makes a truly noticeable difference in both my hair&#x27;s texture and humidity resistance without making it a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> Dimethicone and other silicone-derived products were found long ago to enhance hairs&#x27; pliability, softness, silkiness and combability.</li>
            <li> A little goes a real long way on the hair so this will last forever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday so it will last a very long time..</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that I blow dry, flat iron, highlight and curl constantly.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it to anyone with dry or limp hair.</li>
            <li> I washed and towel dried my hair, applied only the Moroccanoil and then allowed my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> I only use a dime size amount probably less than that into wet hair.</li>
            <li> In NO WAY does it weigh down your hair or makes it flat.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued my whole life with a struggle to tame my long, thick, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Since the 2 years, my hair has grown at least 2 feet, I get it cut frequently and loose about 4 inches every quarter,</li>
            <li> Other products that I have tried that also contain argan oil seem to weigh my hair down with a coating that makes it feel like it needs to be washed the next day.</li>
            <li> As they say on some commercial \\&quot;a little drop will do you\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You really only need a little every time you use it.</li>
            <li> and it was open and spilled a little bit.</li>
            <li> You only need a little in your palm, place it on damp hair and work it through.</li>
            <li> I put a little bit in my hair, massaged it in, and the next day my hair was noticeably shinier.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m going to try next is to add a little to my hair before I color it.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s the only product that I use now besides a little hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Well, just apply a little of this [tiny amount] in the palm of your hands and apply to hair.  </li>
            <li> I use only a little bit (the size of a nickel)</li>
            <li> so you only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> I might as well have just flushed the money down the toilet.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> That is a hard thing to do because I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Breakouts are sometimes hard to diagnose but we did scientific experiments with several of us and wherever hair treated with this product came into regular contact with our skin it caused acne.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few other brands that were less expensive because I do love the oil.</li>
            <li> I was very annoyed to buy the product from this seller, because the product is not true, it&#x27;s a cheap falsification.</li>
            <li> I have damaged hair from 7 years of dying my hair dark, and then going from dark brown hair to blonde.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too, as you only need a small amount, about the size of a dime.</li>
            <li> I WILL ALWAY USE THE WHOLE ENTIRE LINE, I JUST WISH IT WASNT SO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> Used sparingly on wet hair before styling it gives a suppleness and shine that is not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so hopefully my hair will improve with time.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I use it on towel dried hair before combing and then follow with my regular routine</li>
            <li> My stylist pulled out this cream a few years back.</li>
            <li> Finally, my hair never feels sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> And it prevents my hair getting worse when I had done so much to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt look rough or unpolished</li>
            <li> I said, I apply while wet and heat style.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken on this product and it was not the real moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> He put this oil on my hair while it was wet still combed the oil thru my hair, then blew it out.</li>
            <li> However, only after trying this product I realized I don&#x27;t have to flatiron my hair everyday before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> I put some in my hair when wet before I leave to go to work and by the time I get to work</li>
            <li> I also use this product on wet hair and it controls my frizz.  </li>
            <li> I NEVER get my hair wet without putting this in my hair, either before or after.</li>
            <li> Its expensive, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I could drink it (not really</li>
            <li> I use it when drying my hair to protect from heat damage and again a few days later for some added sheen.</li>
            <li> Since I already had an almost empty bottle that I bought from a legit salon I started to compare labels.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no point in risking putting unknown chemicals into your hair.</li>
            <li> It is not real.</li>
            <li> so please be careful if buying this product online.  </li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> She has even seen blondes get a pink tint from using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a trim in over six weeks and my split-ends are minimal.</li>
            <li> Put it in when your hair is wet</li>
            <li> Once it was gone, I had trouble finding it anywhere locally.  </li>
            <li> I kept going back to an expensive hair dresser because everytime I left my hair felt so buttery soft</li>
            <li> I put the oil in my hair wet and use about .75tsp</li>
            <li> Obviously, this is all a recipe for damaged and dried out hair.  </li>
            <li> This phenomenon happened the next time I blow dried and curled it as well.</li>
            <li> This leaves absolutely no residue.</li>
            <li> I could not beat it even with the minimal shipping and handeling</li>
            <li> Worth the expensive price.</li>
            <li> The product came a lot faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> It instantly restores shine and manageability to the hair without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about $45, which SEEMS expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every dime</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on wet hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> However it came partially opened</li>
            <li> Makes thick curly hair manageable and so soft.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re concerned about the price of the product, keep in mind the 3.4 ox bottle will last you several months unless you have extremely thick</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this product leaves my hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> For a hair product the price is scary, but the product is super concentrated so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried my different hair products that claims to help but they dont usually make any difference to my hair, but this product actually tones down the puffiness and frizz and makes it look and feels silky.</li>
            <li> but I just wanted to let everyone know that there is a similar product out there for much less!</li>
            <li> i live in hawaii where it is usually pretty humid, which makes for a lot of bad hair days.</li>
            <li> I use about a dime size blob of this on my wet, dark brown color processed wavy hair, rub it in my hands, pull it thru my hair  then blow dry.</li>
            <li> I use daily a small drop to my dry hair and it helps it from getting tangled and knotted though out the day.  </li>
            <li> Due to heat tools, the ends of my hair have become extremely brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> Once styling product is applied, however, the scent is not that noticeable and certainly not a deterrent to using MoroccanOil.</li>
            <li> So this product is not pure Argon (Moroccan) Oil, but there is a reason for that.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but it lasts forever if you use just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> like to use a lot, plus my hair is long, you might want to try using less until you figure out what works for you)....</li>
            <li> You only need to use a very small amount on damp hair so one bottle does last quite a while!</li>
            <li> It is quite expensive, but since a little bit goes a long way, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The results are similar to a product I currently already use (Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream), is not a better price, is harder to use and is not readily available for purchase.     </li>
            <li> I have tried other oils and it weighs my long hair down and it looks greasy immediately.  </li>
            <li> I had really dry and frizzy hair but after using this product daily for the past few months my hair is soft and no more frizzies.</li>
            <li> then after it is dried and styled(usually flat ironed)</li>
            <li> Apply a little (goes a long way) to wet hair</li>
            <li> Since you only need a small amount following each shampoo, a small bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Hair feels less dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> This makes me wonder if I unknownly bought a fake when I tried it the first time.  </li>
            <li> but since it reduces drying time, I can fully dry it and style in less time.</li>
            <li> I blow dry until my hair is slightly damp...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t realize that it was going to take so long to receive it.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and I concentrate on my ends and work my way up.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, depending on the thickness and length of your hair.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> rubbed between your hands, warms and causes this &#x27;little bit&#x27; to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab goes a long ways</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One word of caution is, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way-and my hair looks shinier and healthier-without being \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; like some other oils can make it.</li>
            <li> Little did I know, until late, that the registered trademark symbol, which is located on all REAL Moroccanoil products was missing off the box of my product.     </li>
            <li> Use a very little amount or your hair will be oily by the next day.  </li>
            <li> A little annoying to only be able to buy it online.  </li>
            <li> and you only need very little for your hair.</li>
            <li> You only need very little to do the job.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it when my hair is almost dry, but not completely.</li>
            <li> My mom in her 50&#x27;s complained about how a handful of hair fell out when she showered, but also noticed far less hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply to wet towel dried hair before I blow dry it</li>
            <li> Put some Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment in your palms and rub together, (not much is needed)!</li>
            <li> A few drops goes a long way to increase shine and healthiness of hair.</li>
            <li> I compared it to other bottles I have</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but as some other reviews state, it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The other oils just do not absorb like Moroccan does.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of oil goes a long way!</li>
            <li> it..also use it as a treatment,especially due to swimmingpoolexposure</li>
            <li> You only use a small amount of the Moroccan oil &amp; it takes care of the problem.  </li>
            <li> It just feels softer - even with other products on my hair.</li>
            <li> and I cannot say that about any other \\&quot;tamer\\&quot; type product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know a lot of other people have mentioned this too</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair essence recommended by friends, but they didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I would say beware of other brands (argon oil, merrakesh oil) because they will feel NOTHING like what Moroccan Oil feels like in your hair.</li>
            <li> AFTER you&#x27;ve applied the oil, use your regular styling products and finish as usual.</li>
            <li> I did try it once, and it gave my hair that brittle acrylic look that my other polymers and co-polymers did.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using it and trying other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I have used both the Moroccan Oil and the other brand sold through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I use every other day...</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I use it after every shampoo and it helps to keep my long hair from getting dried out.</li>
            <li> Usually on Amazon, you can view the back of the bottle to read the ingredients and here you cannot.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey but you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Looking at the comments of other people, it appears that they are aware that this company has been selling this fake product and yet they refuse to do anything about it.</li>
            <li> This product is full of artificial colourings and brought me up in spots.</li>
            <li> one thing to keep in mind-- only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I divided my hair into two pig tails and used the Moroccanoil on one side and Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream on the other side.</li>
            <li> Other disadvantages I have found with Moroccanoil is the glass jar and the control factor when you pour out the oil.  </li>
            <li> Also the Moroccanoil is not something I have found for sale other than on the internet.     </li>
            <li> have tried other cheaper brands, and it isnt the same.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I no longer use any other treatments.  </li>
            <li> I have only used jojoba oil in the past.</li>
            <li> I suspect I got a bit of an itchy scalp when I used it, but could have been other stuff.</li>
            <li> i still need to use my other \\&quot;control\\&quot; products--</li>
            <li> Compared to all the products I used to buy this is a bargain since you only need a small amout per use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m due to place another.  </li>
            <li> and it only takes a small amount to work.  </li>
            <li> My other daughter bought this</li>
            <li> but I like to use both rotating every other day.</li>
            <li> work it into the ends of wet hair before blowdrying!  </li>
            <li> Turns out it&#x27;s made in Israel and Argan oil is like the 5th ingredient along with a number of other additives.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for 3.4oz.</li>
            <li> so I only use a small amount on my fingers and spread it through all of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product, along with other items in this line, time and time again.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the price went up :(</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is extremely strict about its retailing.</li>
            <li> I bought Frizz-ease and Argan oil and hundreds of other products.</li>
            <li> There are other products out there</li>
            <li> Over Do It like you can with other hair moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> got.&lt;br /&gt;You need to be careful!</li>
            <li> I know longer have to wash my hair daily just rub some oil on the ends and curl as usual</li>
            <li> This product does not make my hair feel like a grease ball as other ones have.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure &#x27;why&#x27; this product i received is of lesser quality?  </li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount of product.  </li>
            <li> but it took only a small amt (dime size).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Moroccan Oil is being sold here as other reviewers have commented.</li>
            <li> you only need a small amount</li>
            <li> But use sparingly, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> But I have to use it every other wash...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other oils</li>
            <li> Use this every other day...</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of this product daily.</li>
            <li> , the other thing I did not like about the 100% argon oil is the smell.  </li>
            <li> recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t fall for this or any other &amp;#34;Moroccan Argan OIl&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I finally received a small bottle of the Moroccan Oil, after voicing my dissatisfaction with all the other hair softening serums, from a friend.  </li>
            <li> Just a little dab (maybe the size of a dime), do it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to be a little dry at times from coloring and once the color starts to fade</li>
            <li> and it can be a little dry and brittle at times.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, medium thick hair, which is why it is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t flatten my hait.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been five months since my last haircut, and I have very few split ends.</li>
            <li> , it will not make your hair heavy and greasy, but it does not seem to do anything else other than that while my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> When my hair is dry I can scrunch in a very small amount and it further helps the situation.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair but just use a few dabs.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone, especially dry, chemically treated hair for protection.</li>
            <li> If my hair is especially dry</li>
            <li> I typically apply about a quarter-sized amount of it to my wet hair and just work it through, avoiding my scalp.</li>
            <li> I guess when they get tired of refunding back the money through their A to Z Guarantee claim, then they will do something about this company who is obviously a joke.     </li>
            <li> It really helps me with the cold weather frizz that my hair is going through; especially living in Boston, Massachusetts.</li>
            <li> I think this actually says for &#x27;blonde and thin&#x27; hair on the packaging that I have</li>
            <li> I usually straighten it though with a chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> Her only objection is that the pump is difficult to regulate, and at this price, you really don&#x27;t want to waste any!</li>
            <li> My bad habit, though, is forgetting to get hair cuts until I realize that my hair is SUPER long.</li>
            <li> I like to apply a small amount to wet hair and blow dry.</li>
            <li> BUT I do blow dry my hair after showers since my hair is so thick and takes a long time drying.  </li>
            <li> Though a little on the expensive side, it&#x27;s worth the investment as the previous bottle I had lasted several months and my hair is long and thick!</li>
            <li> The bottle had a fake label that was similar to the real thing but poorly printed and designed differently.</li>
            <li> Other products weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long brunette hair, which has become dull and dry since moving to a location with untreated water.</li>
            <li> Only negative is &#x27;other&#x27; ingredients in this product besides the oil itself.  </li>
            <li> There was NO smell at all and the color was not right.</li>
            <li> Saved a few bucks from the retail price and recommend for very dry, colored hair.  </li>
            <li> I always apply a little to my wet just washed hair.  </li>
            <li> My 8 yr old loves the scent too and we use it on her very thick hair.</li>
            <li> The other brand Morroccan oil had less odor.  </li>
            <li> So hard to know where that middle line lies.</li>
            <li> I only use it   when my hair has a dull look.  </li>
            <li> I resisted a lot to make my first purchase because the price is a little exaggerated in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my first bad experience with 3rd party merchandise bought on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The stylist who never has done my hair before which btw I&#x27;m real reluctant to go into a blind appointment and not know who I&#x27;m dealing with.</li>
            <li> This stuff will last me at least two years at the rate I am using it.</li>
            <li> This one bottle should last me at least 5 months.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that some of the oil spilled out before I received it.</li>
            <li> I have tried some imitation brands that are half the price.</li>
            <li> I complained to Amazon and only received another bottle of the imposter.  </li>
            <li> Be wary, however, if you have thinner hair not to use too much</li>
            <li> It is not worth the savings...</li>
            <li> This seller will not refund my money and also removed my last feedback because it was negative.....</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I personally have thick hair to begin</li>
            <li> For my thick somewhat frizzy hair this is the only product I will use forever!</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair</li>
            <li> he has thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I use it as a base for my mineral blusher, it gives my skin a really healthy look.  </li>
            <li> I have a curly, frizzy, coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to be expensive, but it&#x27;s not really, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with my hair like was exhausted ,dry .i did open the Amazon web-site</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t have weighed down greasy hair with this</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil does not weigh my hair down, nor does it leave any residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> AND the size went down.  </li>
            <li> It weighs hair down without making it greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I was concerned that it would weigh my hair down or make it greasy</li>
            <li> Help keeps my hair from drying out and the friz down.</li>
            <li> so my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down.  </li>
            <li> This product has never let me down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it oily.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a step down from BioSilk</li>
            <li> It will not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I have since been wearing my hair down a lot instead of pulling it into a bun every day.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> It keeps the frizz down and helps with styling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> and I have hair down to my waist!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Adds sheen, makes hair silky without the feeling of build-up or weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> BUT THE PRICE THAT&#x27;S THE DOWN FALL</li>
            <li> then and it does not wait it down</li>
            <li> This oil gives your hair softness, shine and moisture it needs without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make it oily or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I started using this and use three pumps each time and it has made my hair shiny, straighter, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it feel greasy or look oily.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> It has replaced all of my other hair products and one bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> A small drop goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> and it shipped way faster then expected!!  </li>
            <li> Other people will tell you that this brand works and that brand works, but Nothing compares to Moroccan oil, I&#x27;ve tried all the others, and I know what I&#x27;m talking about!</li>
            <li> All you need is a small drop worked into damp or already dry hair.</li>
            <li> I then allowed my hair to air dry (as I usually do) and compared the results.      </li>
            <li> However, I would let u know dat, no more worries, just wash your hair, apply it before blow dry, then your hair is going to shine.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it in after my hair is dry after a shower and leave it in overnight.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned because she used only this product and my curly, dry, frizzy, heat damaged hair usually needs at least three-</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and and it can be a little dry especially after a relaxer.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount</li>
            <li> Trick is to only use a very small amount (like a dime in your palm) at a time and rub it on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other oil products that made my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the bottle leaked a little.  </li>
            <li> Within a half hour of using a very small amount, I had such a headache from the scent, that I had to wash it out.</li>
            <li> The bottle may seem expensive, but you only need a tiny amount each time.</li>
            <li> I tried putting less and less on my hair to keep this from happening, but it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The price was way less.</li>
            <li> I had to have another one shipped because half of it had leaked throught the box.    </li>
            <li> The Amazon price is $11 less than what my salon was selling it for</li>
            <li> Costs less here than she paid for it where she bought it.  </li>
            <li> I still typically blowdry</li>
            <li> The previous bottle was 4.6 Oz and this one is 3.4 Oz.  </li>
            <li> and I see less split ends when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> When the product arrived, half of the contents had spilled.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair, I&#x27;ve noticed less hair falls out.</li>
            <li> , it is less sticky than Moroccan oil</li>
            <li> I found it here for 50% less than in her salon.  </li>
            <li> Almost half the price its sold for in salons.</li>
            <li> After using Moroccan oil, my hair feels softer, and looks much less frizzy and damaged.</li>
            <li> When I received the Moroccanoil, half of it spilled in the box.</li>
            <li> it also smells like baby oil slightly.</li>
            <li> I will say that it makes it immediately shinier and less prone to frizz</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had suggested it and it was $40 at her shop-much less here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> my ends are managing to stay in tact resulting in having to get a trim less often.</li>
            <li> And to add, it is not your typical hair oil, which is why you will not find it in beauty supply stores.    </li>
            <li> This makes my hair so bouncy, shiny and the hair color is lasting way past the usual 6 week mark.</li>
            <li> so I spend half the time</li>
            <li> purchased mine from Amazon and paid a lot less for it than my friend did.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s much less of it as I age.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because it has a slight fragrance</li>
            <li> Hair looks healthier and less split ends.</li>
            <li> Also, you will notice less breakage and your hair will become stronger over time.</li>
            <li> this price is great-much less than my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $20 less than what I would&#x27;ve paid if I bought it where she originially bought hers.</li>
            <li> So I think I could have gotten this at a slightly lower price</li>
            <li> then all I do is use the flatiron with half the amount of time it used to take before I found this oil.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s over half a bottle</li>
            <li> No more dry ends!  </li>
            <li> They say you get what you pay for, in this case you pay less and get less (quality).</li>
            <li> see some older reviews where people think they got fake bottles.  </li>
            <li> and when you are honest, you know you get what you pay for, and you wont be disappointed I promise!</li>
            <li> The only bad part is you can&#x27;t use too much or it will weigh your hair down!</li>
            <li> A small amount of this product goes a long way even on the thickest of hair like mine!!!  </li>
            <li> HUGE disappointment!  </li>
            <li> not a good option for my mixed heritage hair....</li>
            <li> Just rub a a small drop together in your hands and apply all thru&#x27; wet hair.</li>
            <li> but it was just a mess when she got it.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair -</li>
            <li> Obviously, scotch tape and oil don&#x27;t work together as the oil breaks down the weak tape.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that even though I do have lots of hair, a little less than a dime sized amount is plenty to get the results I want</li>
            <li> As I researched this product and its ingredients a little deeper, I discovered that it is only a subtle, temporary fix for giving a little smoothing effect to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have tight curly hair that needs a lot of moisture.  </li>
            <li> No special treatment regimen but</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Threw out the generic crap, bought the real thing, a voila!  </li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t made my hair feel crazy soft for long periods of time like everyone else</li>
            <li> My hair is problem hair; curly, frizzy, thick and dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair actually looks a little dull!  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and dry hair due to years of flat ironing and coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> Too little and my curls are undefined and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little longer than shoulder length</li>
            <li> If I still have a little frizz</li>
            <li> I will mention though it is a little cheaper at the salon than it is on here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a bunch of polymers and other chemicals, plus a small amount of Moroccan oil to give it an illusion of class.  </li>
            <li> only disgruntlement about this product is that it is quite expensive for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> , so I use a little of each now.</li>
            <li> Just dab a little on the ends after each wash.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> We both have long hair and just a very small amount of the product</li>
            <li> I purchased this from her for $31, so Amazon is a little cheaper-</li>
            <li> but without hair conditioner and mask it makes little sense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the little container</li>
            <li> A little goes a loong way since I have hair that goes to my elbows</li>
            <li> upon opening the bottle, I put a little bit on my hand to feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I wash my hair and any time I need a little livening up.  </li>
            <li> They had demo&#x27;s on the spot, and handed out mini sample bottles to everyone with their grubby little hands out, mine included.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;sa little pricey, but if your like me, you will go to extremes to keep your hair manageable.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I mix a little with the hydration product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is a fake or if was produced differently for the Spanish market.  </li>
            <li> This was suggested to me and I have now been using it for a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> Apply a small amount to damp hair after shampooing (don&#x27;t use any conditioner) and style as usual - blow dry or not.</li>
            <li> My hair, that I&#x27;ve never dyed before, is so very dry and dull without this product.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s also processed, it gets very dull and frizzy and so I don&#x27;t wash it daily.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged, thin, and weak.</li>
            <li> Fake, Fake, Fake!!!I would like to nicely let the Amazon Customers know that this product does not smell like the one that I buy in the hair salon for the past 5 years, the texture is not the same and this product is fake.</li>
            <li> It seriously took several hand washes with soap and a brislted nail brish to get the oil slick off.</li>
            <li> The  oil does not weigh your hair down at all!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and coarse, but this product does help in terms of softness.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I am an African-American female with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse wavy hair that loves to frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> it bad smile</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry and damaged, I would seriously recommend giving this hair oil a chance.</li>
            <li> But, don&#x27;t use too much at a time or your hair will look dirty.</li>
            <li> It nurishes my hair with out being greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> My hair was heavy and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> seriously a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This works well for the frizz and does make my hair shiny and silky without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make your hair heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> It provides the moisture without making hair heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts me about 6 months using a quarter size amount everyday.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use it everyday-</li>
            <li> but when I used at home, I was getting limp looking locks after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> came a heavy perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccanoil for 3 years and my ends stay healthier longer with this product, even after using a hair dryer and a curling iron almost everyday.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> APPLIED TO TOWEL DRIED HAIR</li>
            <li> So, I switch this product with another every few weeks</li>
            <li> It is getting healthier everyday.  </li>
            <li> weightless, smooths &amp; protects the hair, and can be used everyday.  </li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t waste my monet again</li>
            <li> I bought this oil a few months ago</li>
            <li> purchased the shampoo, conditioner, and oil a few months ago at a salon - smells like heaven, so indulgent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> We use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> never feels greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or heavy;</li>
            <li> Years of bleaching, color, stress, poor diet and daily pharmacuetical medications have taken their toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> products are too heavy.  </li>
            <li> (according to the salesperson), and withing a few weeks, my hair had an undeniable green tinge to it.  </li>
            <li> It was introduced to me by my stylist few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this for a few years</li>
            <li> I also shampoo everyday and have tried everything</li>
            <li> I use it year round.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> waste of moneey</li>
            <li> dont waste your money....</li>
            <li> i use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It was waste of my money</li>
            <li> JUST WASTE IT</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t wash her hair everyday so sometimes</li>
            <li> I rub this through my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and can&#x27;t d without  it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this because of the reviews that said it was not genuine ...</li>
            <li> and I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday on my beard.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I remember reading a few reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have processed hair and wanted a treatment that wasnt messy and could use overnight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it has changed my hair.</li>
            <li> i dont use it everyday  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> Between the sun, chemicals, and styling tools, my hair over the years has become damaged and brittle in a few places.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t waste any time in ordering it</li>
            <li> It is heavy</li>
            <li> It is NOT oily &amp; heavy like some hair oils can be.  </li>
            <li> You can see my full review on my blog:[...]</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair everyday after I shower.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is too heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> Just a few drops is all that&#x27;s needed for my below shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets colored about every 4-6 weeks and is blow dried and straightened every day.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it doesn&#x27;t build up or make my hair look oily at all.</li>
            <li> If you read that this product is to heavy and leaves hair greasy don&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> The secret is to only use a few drops, spread it into your palms, and work well into the hair.  </li>
            <li> I only use a very small amount now--about the size of a dime!</li>
            <li> Just a small amount in the hair before blowdrying and it cuts the drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> Drying my hair takes half the time!  </li>
            <li> I usually buy it from a salon but found it here for maybe a couple dollars less.</li>
            <li> I have tried other, less expensive products that claimed to have similar properties, but I was never satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> purchased the same items at the same salon today - smells/feels like completely different products with hardly any fragrance :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair by the way!</li>
            <li> I have thick Curly/ Wavy hair, it needs oil on the ends and other places as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have thin, flat hair and this stuff makes a world of difference.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally thin hair and hate that most products always seem to weigh it down - not this one.</li>
            <li> If you got a plain brown bottle--</li>
            <li> Anyone who knocks this is just plain nuts.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every product under the sun to help tame my hair and nothing has ever helped the way this stuff has.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing has gotten worse and I find myself needing to moisturize TWICE a day and use more product than I have ever used :(</li>
            <li> I tried everything to tame my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> some shine as well as tame the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> and I have very thick long hair.</li>
            <li> A small dime size lasts even all of my hair, just past my lower back and very thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark, thick, processed, getting coarser by the year hair, with unruly wave that it seems to help with too.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive in comparison with similar products in the market</li>
            <li> but the bottle is just thick glass to hold less oil.</li>
            <li> My hair condition has slowly improved so that I do use less of the product now.  </li>
            <li> Dries my thick, curly hair in half the time.  </li>
            <li> and it sucks out my wave and/or curl and leaves it a bushy frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> It may be a little on the expensive side, but a little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> Have to use a very small amount or hair will weigh down</li>
            <li> All other products made my hair look greasy and dirty by the next day, but Morrocanoil doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> it gets dull after a few mins.</li>
            <li> The leave in conditioners leave the hair heavy, dull and lank.</li>
            <li> that is to blame, not so much that the product is bad all together and won&#x27;t work for anyone.   </li>
            <li> This is a total fake.  </li>
            <li> Put a small amount to the ends every night.  </li>
            <li> My daughter lives in Hawaii and her hair get dried out, Moroccan Oil saves the day!</li>
            <li> Comb through hair and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the company changed their product.</li>
            <li> I got a small bottle of the oil as a sample</li>
            <li> Anybody who knows me knows that I don&#x27;t usually spend a lot on hair products; I tend to use coupons and get what&#x27;s on sale.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> I usually use TIGI Bed Head.  </li>
            <li> Usually curl creams</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product that works on my daughter&#x27;s hair for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> After using Moroccanoil on my damp hair and then styling as usual</li>
            <li> Just a small drop enhances the shine and adds to the smoothness.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still a small investment even at the $27 price point</li>
            <li> only downside to this product is that it is somewhat expensive</li>
            <li> Just pour a small amount in your hand, rub your palms together and apply to your hair.</li>
            <li> I usually use this after blow drying.</li>
            <li> tried to apply small amount of oil on my hair at night.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy it because of the price, but went ahead and bought a small bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get to the only store in the area who sales it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just use a small drop, and sometimes about a nickel size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if it has made a difference.  </li>
            <li> Mair hair is usually so ruined after being outdoors for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I usually wear my hair curly - wash n&#x27; go.</li>
            <li> and usually I pour out a dime-size amount into my palm, rub it together in my hands and spread it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive compared to similar products</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil for the past year</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> and I notice that I dont break out from using these products, but the mask can be heavy, so I wear my hair up at night and wash my hair at least 2x/wk.</li>
            <li> I have probably gone through about 4 bottles in the past 2 years-</li>
            <li> For anyone with complaints about possibly getting fake Moroccan Oil online - my guess is it&#x27;s factory related.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is extremely small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used over the counter \\&quot;frizzy hair\\&quot; oils in the past</li>
            <li> I have been using it on &amp; off for the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in Amazon for continuing to allow this item to sell on here as I see other complaints by other people saying the same thing.</li>
            <li> Adds moisture and reduces frizz before and/or after blow drying hair - use small amount so your hair doesn&#x27;t get oily.</li>
            <li> No more conditioners, gels, sprays, that don&#x27;t work anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought a small sample bottle from her (.85 oz), and tried it for about a month.  </li>
            <li> I have been an avid fan of moroccan oil for years and still have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the  &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; or knock off versions, that don&#x27;t compare, and wasted alot of money in the process!</li>
            <li> No more gels or mousse for me.</li>
            <li> No more hairspray because Moroccanoil holds my hair in place</li>
            <li> I gave myself an oil treatment on my hair with it, just to try it out let sit for 15 minutes and then shampooed as usual, and my hair was noticeably softer.  </li>
            <li> This amount usually lasts me four months.  </li>
            <li> Only certified salons can sell Moroccanoil products, so anything Moroccanoil sold online will virtually be a fake product.</li>
            <li> And you can use your usual styling products with it if you like.</li>
            <li> After trying this a few years ago I got hooked!  </li>
            <li> I know 3.4 oz seems small</li>
            <li> This product is so toxic that it can cause excessive skin dryness, hives, irritate and inflame eczema on contact with your hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was what u have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> I use this almost daily despite the expensive cost.</li>
            <li> After months of using this,  I think the product must be a fake because it is definitely is not working like</li>
            <li> usually oil products build up horrendously</li>
            <li> Protect hair from excessive heat.</li>
            <li> Was going to return it but got lazy so dealt with the loss.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t make your hair oily, again if you use a small amount.</li>
            <li> and so is my palm :/</li>
            <li> I had to get extra hair cut off at my last hair appointment and was extremely disappointed in the shape of my hair -</li>
            <li> I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive...</li>
            <li> Not too oily and helps manage those hard to tame hairs.</li>
            <li> My hair is real thick and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this product helps to tame it.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is very heavy and does nothing to make my hair feel conditioned.</li>
            <li> I put a very small amount  on my towel dried hair and immediately the texture of my hair improves.  </li>
            <li> The difference ultimately is in the oil itself the fake stuff is not as thick and lighter in color</li>
            <li> So 5 star product, but it loses 3 for terrible shipping and not being able to exchange a leaking product.</li>
            <li> I used the Moroccan Oil last night and was shocked to see that it actually made my wild crazy hair even wilder and frizzier and drier than before!  </li>
            <li> I hope someone else can use it since I paid so much. :(</li>
            <li> I am very upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am an African American make growing out my hair and no longer cutting it because it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Whoever says this product does not help their hair may be using too much of it or are crazy!  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s near impossible to find products for my hair that will work without making my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical because of previous reviews stating it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li> If you had a hair service gone wrong or have dry hair or color your hair, therefore drying it out, this is a must have product!  </li>
            <li> sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get.</li>
            <li> Overrated and hardly any &#x27;moroccan&#x27; oil in it.  </li>
            <li> so it often appears dull.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to explain</li>
            <li> I find when I don&#x27;t use it my hair becomes dull and damaged.</li>
            <li> My hair has been looking dull for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> now it is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> She has Celiac disease and her hair had gotten somewhat dull and lifeless...</li>
            <li> my hair is dry, curly and very thin, this oil defines my curls and takes away the frizz ...</li>
            <li> The stylist told me drier hair is common as one ages and used the oil on my hair.</li>
            <li> (At least not going through the transitioning phase).  </li>
            <li> I woke up late</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 6 yrs.  </li>
            <li> it loses shine.  </li>
            <li> Lately I have been using the Moroccan oil Glisten and spraying it on, too at the end of styling.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the least bit \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feeling</li>
            <li> oh well at least my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair as my title states.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and had been curled, dyed and straigtened in 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have always had a thick head of hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle I bought at the salon had a softer smell and it was not as thick and greasy as the one I bought online</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and it was a bit heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> I do have thick hair that is relaxed.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, wavy hair that is prone to frizziness.</li>
            <li> I thought: I have thick and curly hair, how will this work?</li>
            <li> With course, thick hair I need something to maintain the frizz and this product does it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that tends to be quite frizzy when I don&#x27;t style it.</li>
            <li> Smooths and softens my thick course hair</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> no better/no worse than products that cost less!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used moroccan oil every time I have washed my hair for the past 5 years!  </li>
            <li> and my hair feels flat and dirty at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I take away a star, because, like other reviewers, I&#x27;m not impressed with the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that it&#x27;s way too expensive -- it does the job.  </li>
            <li> No more Moroccan anything for me!</li>
            <li> so I can be lazy some days and just let me hair be!</li>
            <li> Although this product is extremely over priced, it seems to be expensive everywhere</li>
            <li> no more frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> I use a VERY small amount of the Moroccanoil and then hairspray.</li>
            <li> You take just a very small amount and spread it on your palms.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why it is less expensive.  </li>
            <li> It seriously treats your hair.</li>
            <li> on the front of the bottle/box is a darker orange and slightly grainy on the fake, where it should be lighter orange and smoother in appearance.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong one but will use it anyway, just less of it.</li>
            <li> Subtle.  </li>
            <li> but I seriously doubt that.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> I do wish it was a bit less expensive</li>
            <li> Little expensive though.</li>
            <li> was super disappointed because the product is so expensive!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try to save myself some money, but this was not a wise choice.</li>
            <li> NOT good.</li>
            <li> The product is expensive and I do not want any wasted.  </li>
            <li> Very sad that I spent $35</li>
            <li> It is very hard to ship this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing as the fragrance is not the same.</li>
            <li> I have chin length, very thick hair and do this twice.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy &amp; very thick.  </li>
            <li> I have very very thick hair and living in the south with the humidity</li>
            <li> I have alot of very thick, wavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> I have very, very thick hair</li>
            <li> I had to learn the hard way, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> When I received this in the mail, the seal was not intact and despite looking like the actual oil, it smelled horrible and I had to wash my hands a few times to get rid of the cologne-like stench.</li>
            <li> I received this item and the seal was broken and taped shut with scotch tape.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Even worse, what was inside the bottle had been tampered with.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment and waste of money.    </li>
            <li> My hairdresser calls it my secret &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so I asked what her secret was</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so addicted in it.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is not great; it has a 1970s hair product aroma, so sort of a chemical undertone.  </li>
            <li> i have oily, thin hair</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is expensive, but it is thick for an oil</li>
            <li> Literally became addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> have unnaturally thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair but a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> feel that this product is worse and overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have problematic, thin, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Alas, my newest stylist recommended this to me.</li>
            <li> but I have not experienced that.</li>
            <li> Why Amazon is allowing merchants to sell fake stuff is beyond me and they have yet to give any satisfactory response to my complaint.  </li>
            <li> Worse hair oil ever.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still frizzy as ever; as a matter of fact, I think it&#x27;s been looking worse and frizzier than before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging, however.</li>
            <li> Now that my income has been decreased</li>
            <li> The pump is broken when I got it</li>
            <li> Since my hair is thin, this product didn&#x27;t work so well for me, since I need body added to my hair.  </li>
            <li> feel like addicted to it</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the way it works.  </li>
            <li> and I was instantly addicted.</li>
            <li> A must have beauty secret.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I need to return the product - not happy 😞</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been addicted ever since.  </li>
            <li> False advertising.</li>
            <li> That other stylist saw that I had a little bit of frizz and suggested one of those brazilian anti frizz treatments and told him to go ahead, I mean, what was the worst that could happen?  </li>
            <li> I would seriously die without it!</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with using it if you are just looking for a subtle and temporary fix and don&#x27;t mind spending the money.</li>
            <li> I can tell a dramatic difference from the times I do use it compared to the times I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had been brutal to my hair, and it was starting to show.</li>
            <li> BUT...I have buckets of thick hair and have a horrible time getting a comb through it when it&#x27;s wet if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I have tried to be a cheap-skate and sub knock-off products for Moroccan Oil only to be extremely disappointed!  </li>
            <li> it is very hard to control in the summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, or if it was a bad batch or what.  </li>
            <li> Fake.  </li>
            <li> Scent all wrong.  </li>
            <li> I am just sad that I didn&#x27;t buy this product sooner.</li>
            <li> Yes...a bit expensive</li>
            <li> i think its fake product</li>
            <li> If all the hype is making you skeptical, take a leap of faith and you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting an oil on my baby-fine curly hair but my daughter recommended this to get rid of my frizzies.</li>
            <li> I just have 2 wishes: that it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive and that it came in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> There was definitely something wrong with the product, it had a terrible smell and made my hair feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive and does not work.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it leaked a bit during delivery, but otherwise, I&#x27;m please.  </li>
            <li> absolutely obsessed</li>
            <li> However as reviewers have posted there is a fake Moroccanoil out there.</li>
            <li> When I received it I was a bit skeptical because some of the liquid had leaked from the bottle.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive.</li>
            <li> you get it colored/treated, you buy expensive shampoo and conditioner..</li>
            <li> The consistency of it was wrong too.</li>
            <li> YES IT MAY BE ALITTLE EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone else commented that this product is like an expensive Frizz-Ease, however I will have to disagree.</li>
            <li> If I go swimming, Ill put this in my hair and it protects it from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> Its not even that expensive</li>
            <li> I would suggest you share a bottle with someone because it is expensive.</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m unable to read it online, I do not buy it.</li>
            <li> When I received my Moroccanoil from Amazon something was definitely wrong.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon, but they failed to address the issue.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get in Thailand and my wife prefers it to anything else.</li>
            <li> It is like a secret people have been keeping!</li>
            <li> The product I received was a fake, I returned it.  </li>
            <li> and I saw him a couple of days ago, I told him I was sorry</li>
            <li> And it feels weird putting oil on my hair.</li>
            <li> I wondered what was wrong with it when I opened it...</li>
            <li> (it actually made it fuzzy), and the SMELL was just AWFUL!</li>
            <li> , something weird is happening.</li>
            <li> So Ricky&#x27;s is ripping people off on an already expensive product.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount in my hair each day to help restore shine and strength to my stressed hair and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s oil it isn&#x27;t greasy or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with fake morracan oil.  </li>
            <li> Some folks say the stuff bought on line is a fake.  </li>
            <li> Well, sorry that isn&#x27;t so.  </li>
            <li> It smelled weird when i bought it.  </li>
            <li> It has a weird baby oil smell to it.</li>
            <li> sad</li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> I ordered with trepidation after seeing all those reviews about how this stuff was fake, but rest assured: the moroccan oil</li>
            <li> It is on the expensive side</li>
            <li> I wish I could say you could substitute this expensive product for those</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment it is difficult to locate any split ends.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is way too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> will see if there is anything I am doing wrong before switching.</li>
            <li> will see if there is anything I am doing wrong before switching.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, that was an expensive purchase to use as lotion because it was nothing like this brand</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t scream fake because I have no clue.</li>
            <li> The worst part though was that it didn&#x27;t look or feel the same as stuff I get at my stylist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad</li>
            <li> Well, I have used this oil and put it in gift baskets for friends for years and this product is fake.</li>
            <li> All fake.</li>
            <li> My hair is oily, and I was afraid this would make it worse.</li>
            <li> Just with it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive.  </li>
            <li> ADDITIONALLY, WHEN I HAVE TRIED TO TRACK THIS ITEM--NOTATION REPEATEDLY STATES UNABLE TO TRACK IT.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS FAKE</li>
            <li> I have found that sellers and retailers charge all kinds of crazy prices ripping customers off and a lot of reviewers say they receive fake product.   </li>
            <li> I am VERY unhappy with the inability to return a false product.</li>
            <li> I am so afraid of dropping it in my tile bathroom.</li>
            <li> I wish they could make this product without the artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was debating on cutting of a couple inches just to try and make it look healthier.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would look oily and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> cost cutting measures  by the company  create an unacceptable product.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and its one of those products that doesn&#x27;t appear on flash deal sites or go on crazy markdowns elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Fake!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this moroccan oil for years and ill keep on buyin that product!</li>
            <li> This is a FAKE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally fake!</li>
            <li> (sorry, Grant)!  </li>
            <li> It was very expensive</li>
            <li> I am completely appalled that this company has the nerve to sell fake Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> I was very sorry to have purchased this product from him.</li>
            <li> However, The Value Bay sold me bad product.</li>
            <li> I did not throw away the bad bottle</li>
            <li> The smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li> It also gave me really bad allergies (</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product-</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> After a while, the breakage was getting really bad becuase</li>
            <li> Buy this product,it&#x27;s very unlikely that you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair is still shedding like mad after putting a stupid curl texturizer in which I wish I never did</li>
            <li> Summer weddings are really tragic for me for this reason.</li>
            <li> I just disappointed why it doesn&#x27;t consist of 100% moroccan</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> :(.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> well this stuff smells bad, bad, bad!  </li>
            <li> , I literally  had to glue it together, and is very inconvenient to use, I just through the pump away</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive in the stores!!</li>
            <li> Yes, stupid, I know.  </li>
            <li> Smells horrible, it has artificial ingredients and fragrances.</li>
            <li> Becauseit&#x27;s liquid oil (unlike oil in a cream base)</li>
            <li> Hate to be a naysayer, but I don&#x27;t see what the hype on this product is.  </li>
            <li> I hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> I hate the feel of conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed :-(</li>
            <li> But a bad one!</li>
            <li> I brutally torture my hair with bleach, color, and lots of heat styling.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed by both the retailer and Amazon.  </li>
            <li> FAKE!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Horrible to spend $30 plus dollars to find out that this is unusable and non returnable to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I always look terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst part is that this can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an awful smell</li>
            <li> This smells terrible and the box is so phony!</li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;t, it looks awful.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, the price is also outrageous.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the mask at my salon in St Louis ( visiting) and my hair was in awful shape from processing, etc!</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair feel horrible.</li>
            <li> It smells TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It helps not waking up with the worst tangles in that area, even after a night sweat.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible experience where the hair stylist that I went to almost 1.5 years ago</li>
            <li> Disgusted.</li>
            <li> The awful, awful smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fake.  I have used this Moroccan Oil for several years and knew something was off when I opened this.  Scent all wrong.  Very heavy compared to the real thing.  Returned.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it makes my hair look very healthy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without this product - it is a MUST HAVE - I use it in the morning after shaving, and apply to face before going to bed.</li>
            <li> This is a total fake.  The bottle looks totally different from real Morrocian oil. Different labels, no seal on the cap and on top of that it smells like perfume and is totally gross. Unexpectedly,there is a hair in the sealed packing bag .I did some research and Moroccianoil only sells to salons to prevent imposters like this.</li>
            <li> my wife loves the fact it is still available.....</li>
            <li> Love this product to keep frizz manageable!</li>
            <li> This is really good. It makes my hair style better!!!</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil is the best thing ever.</li>
            <li> I do not use anything else on my hair since I discovered this products. It smells lovely and makes my hair soft and shiny without getting them greasy,</li>
            <li> It is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Smells great and so far seems to work great.</li>
            <li> The oil is great, it provides the look . I&#x27;m looking for and  I love the body it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought the low price was fishy but crossed my fingers it was real. No such luck. The bottle did arrive quickly but the spilled concoction inside smelled of suntan oil and baby powder ? Something weird-- NOT the familiar scent of MorrocanOil. The bottle had a fake label that was similar to the real thing but poorly printed and designed differently. The big give away is the bottle though. The real thing comes in a brown bottle with the product name in raised letters right ON the glass-- as part of the actual bottle. If you got a plain brown bottle-- you got had.&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, they did refund my money ASAP.  So whatever... They are trying to make some quick money and what better way than on the back of our beloved but way over priced M Oil! Good luck.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to a friend and she loved it.  Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> My hair is still frizzy in rainy weather.</li>
            <li> Had Moroccan oil used in the salon and the stuff was fantastic. Made my hair super soft and kept me from having to use a conditioner or detangler in my hair for several days. Don&#x27;t know if they used a different version but this stuff is very heavy and does nothing to make my hair feel conditioned. Does give it a nice shine though.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Especially for those women with natural (black) hair that need to oil their hair. Its better than almond oil etc. if only it could be cheaper?</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it! fragrance is different and it does not smell great like previous ones I orderd form Amazon that come with pump.</li>
            <li> My new perm reacted with the hair color I&#x27;d already put in days earlier. Everyone, including the new hair dresser, highly recommended Moroccan Oil. It is great and really helping. I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair once a week.  Put a small amount to the ends every night.  Next morning its absorbed into hair.  I swear my hair is getting thicker every week :)!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this product, makes your hair soooo soft.  My daughter lives in Hawaii and her hair get dried out, Moroccan Oil saves the day!</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!!!!  I bought this before, and it was the real thing, but this time it was not the real thing.  The scent was off!  It was from another country.  Do not buy from the seller &amp;#34;stock novelties llc&amp;#34; unless you want some mystery garbage.</li>
            <li> Put some Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment in your palms and rub together, (not much is needed)! Comb through hair and style as usual.  It smells so good, and does wonders for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 4 years and it works great. I have long thick hair that is very prone to frizz. Using the product in the morning or after a shower helps a lot and I would reccomend it to all with frizz issues or troublesome hair.</li>
            <li> This is an investment in my hair.  A few drops goes a long way to increase shine and healthiness of hair.</li>
            <li> I am in a committed relationship with this product.My hair is curly when wet and wavy when dry.Due to daily blow-drying and flat ironing my hair felt brittle, and I have a million split ends.After  using this product for a week I have to say that my hair feels  and looks healthier and softer.My split ends are still there, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones coming back.This product smells amazing, and i love how I can wash my hair put on 2 drops of this product and voilà.Now all that I have to do is blow dry my hair, ​and I don&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron to get the same results.I am just sad that I didn&#x27;t buy this product sooner.</li>
            <li> My family just LOVE Moroccan oil . My girls can no more think about living without using Moroccan oil on their hair :)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. Yes...a bit expensive and that&#x27;s what keeps it from being 5 stars. Otherwise, it is fantastic for treating hair and keeping it healthy and shiney!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and is something that I purchase over and over again.  My hair has never been so shiny and manageable. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural  i used this product when i need to blow dry my hair. I keep my hair silky</li>
            <li> This product is good.,not greasy, taste is also very good. Used after the hair is very smooth,and not rough.My aunt said she loves it ,and she will buy it again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like the picture and it&#x27;s made on Israel ! not Morocco Do not buy it i think its fake product</li>
            <li> Without question this is one of the best products I have ever added to my beauty routine. If all the hype is making you skeptical, take a leap of faith and you will not regret it. Adds great shine and control.</li>
            <li> I notice a real difference from the Morrocan Oil, which seems unique in it&#x27;s ability to make my hair look smooth and camouflage my split ends.  The only very minor downside is that, once you get it on your hands (which you&#x27;ll need to do to apply it), it takes some washing and wiping to get it off your hands.  The product has a distinctive but very pleasant musky smell. My stylist applies it before the blow-dryer and flat iron, and I have used a small amount at home on the ends of my dry hair to smooth down the frizzy ends.  The bottle may seem expensive, but you only need a tiny amount each time.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have long, thick, curly hair that I blow dry, flat iron, highlight and curl constantly.  It nurishes my hair with out being greasy or heavy.  I put it in my wet hair before I blow dry, in dry hair to brush out hair spray and in combination with a deep conditioner treatment overnight.  My hairdresser always comments about how healthy my hair is with no breakage.</li>
            <li> The Moroccan Oil is a must have!!! Just a small amount in the hair before blowdrying and it cuts the drying time in half.  It helps keep my colored hair healthy and looking good.  I dont ever want to be without it.</li>
            <li> This is the best new hair product I have every tried.  It has replaced all of my other hair products and one bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> The products are really amazing!!!!!!I could hardly imagine that  Maroccan Oil and Mask are So Good!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair was heavy and lifeless.  I tried putting less and less on my hair to keep this from happening, but it didn&#x27;t work.  Just washing my hands after applications should have told me how greasy the product is.  It took two washings to get the oil off my hands.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser tried this on my ultra fine, fly-away, color-treated hair. My first impression was I loved the scent, and then once my hair was done, I loved the silky feel and healthy look of my hair. Perhaps there is not as much argan oil as one would expect, but I can&#x27;t slather pure oil on my hair since that would just make it stick together in one ugly clump, so less oil in this product is a good thing for me. Two things do not make me so happy, that&#x27;s the high price of Moroccanoil, and that Amazon doesn&#x27;t always have it in stock.</li>
            <li> After years of abuse to my hair, wind, sun, sun-in and of course age my hair was damaged and very dry.  When styling I had to always fight the frizz factor.    I having been using this oil since july 8th and I don&#x27;t miss a day. My hair looks and feels great not too mention smells wonderful.      I would also recommend the shampoo and conditioner coupled with the oil my hair looks healthier these days.    I never travel without it.  And now my life partner is hooked as well.  Last time I ordered from Amazon I had to get two bottles!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before (purchased from a salon) the one I purchased from this site doesn&#x27;t seem as good. The color is lighter and it does not make my hair feel as soft. That makes me think it is not the real stuff. The price was way less.</li>
            <li> This is an exciting new (to me, at least) product made from the oil of a plant that is only found growing native to Morocco. At 59 my hair, once soft and lustrous, had become rather dry and frizzy. I went to the salon to get my long hair cut off trying to regain a bit of a youthful look. I left not only with a great haircut but I also learned about MoroccanOil. The stylist told me drier hair is common as one ages and used the oil on my hair. I was very pleased with the results. Used sparingly on wet hair before styling it gives a suppleness and shine that is not oily or greasy at all. The salon sells the oil for $30 something but I found it on Amazon for $27.50 plus free shipping! Seems the price on Amazon has gone up to just over $30 as I write this but it&#x27;s still a wonderful product, to me well worth the cost and I&#x27;m not one to spend a lot on beauty products at all. The only reason I did not give it a full five stars is that the scent of the oil could be a bit more pleasant. I&#x27;d say it resembles the smell of chocolate a bit. Once styling product is applied, however, the scent is not that noticeable and certainly not a deterrent to using MoroccanOil.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair and I&#x27;ve been buying it from her at twice the price. Great product, makes hair soft,shiny and frizz free and it smells so nice!!As always great service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> not oily...the hair takes in all the oil especially when it is wet because the oil locks in the hydration...great great product</li>
            <li> I have super fine processed hair that I have to blow dry every time I wash it and this stuff is saving my hair! Even though its an oil it does not leave your hair greasy at all. Start with a tiny tiny drop and work through your ends, adding more if you need. My hair is so smooth and shiny after a blow dry. I love the smell, kind of musky, its strong at first but mellows out quickly. Definitely not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to ship this product. The top gets loose during shipping and it leaks. I had to have another one shipped because half of it had leaked throught the box.    The product is okay. I really did not notice a difference between this product and other hair serums.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is the smell.  Very pleasing- I love opening the bottle!  My hair is very thick and coarse, but this product does help in terms of softness.  Wish it worked a little better on the frizz, but it is still a good product.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so hopefully my hair will improve with time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before from other sites, i like the oil I purchased before, but this one from amazon was a little different, the scent in it has more perfume that I do not like.  I like the original one more.  Not sure if the company changed their product.</li>
            <li> I discovered Moroccanoil on a visit to a new hair salon during my internship this summer.  I was amazed at how soft my hair was when the stylist used this oil on my hair, without being oily or stringy.  A small amount goes a long way, and my hair feels soft and frizz free all day!</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect, keeps my hair from getting dry and split end to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting an oil on my baby-fine curly hair but my daughter recommended this to get rid of my frizzies. She was so right. Not only are the frizzies gone but this amazing oil cuts drying time of my hair, whether by air or hairdryer, by at least two-thirds the time. It leaves my hair shiny soft and bouncy. I just have 2 wishes: that it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive and that it came in a plastic bottle. I am so afraid of dropping it in my tile bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Well worth the price.  My husband uses it as well.  He is nearly bald, but the hair on the side of his head looks so much more alive after he showers each day.  As they say on some commercial \\&quot;a little drop will do you\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> As expected. It was so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair silky.</li>
            <li> I got a small bottle of the oil as a sample and I love it. I use it on towel dried hair before combing and then follow with my regular routine: gel all over and volume spray just at the roots. It makes my hair sooo soft I keep touching it all day. If you use a curling iron you may have to spray a little hair spray first since the hair is very soft it may not hold the curls very well - small price to pay.  Will definitely purchase a full size after the sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair. Heard about Moroccan oil from a friend...My hair is now more manageable, softer and easier to style..Love it.  :)</li>
            <li> I ordered Moroccan oil and it was not what they said it was.  It left my hair greasy and didn&#x27;t smell anything like the real product.  Would not order from this company ever.....</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil. It smells so wonderful and makes my hair so soft.  I use it daily on my dry curly hair. I ordered this product and opened it up. The product smells completely different and does not work as well as previous purchases of the same product. I am 100% confident that this product had been tampered with based on these two major differences. Very sad that I spent $35+. I recommend this product. Just be sure to buy it in a salon so if you are unsatisfied with it you can return it!</li>
            <li> Anybody who knows me knows that I don&#x27;t usually spend a lot on hair products; I tend to use coupons and get what&#x27;s on sale.  But, after I was introduced to Moroccanoil, I can&#x27;t live without it.  For me, this is a pricey purchase, but one that&#x27;s well worth the money.  And since you only use a dime sized dollop on your hair after you wash it, it really does last a long time.  I get so many hair compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks, so that&#x27;s just an added bonus!</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil - it makes my hair very soft and silky. I can get build-up if I use it too many days in a row, but a day without and a good shampoo is all it takes.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil, but will not purchase from this vendor (THE VALUE BAY) again.  There was definitely something wrong with the product, it had a terrible smell and made my hair feel greasy.  Moroccanoil is a wonderful product if you have frizzy hair or trouble with split ends.  Makes hair soft and manageable.  However, The Value Bay sold me bad product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used to keep extensions from drying out. It&#x27;s not heavy, especially if you put it on while hair is still damp, plus it really controls frizz and flyaways. Smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Liek many others, I was ripped off. This is not even moroccanoil. The bottle was Drenched in oil, the seal was barely on yet the bottle was full. It did not even smell like real moroccan oil. The texture wasn&#x27;t even correct. I compared it to other bottles I have and it wasn&#x27;t even close to the real thing. Someone empied the bottle, filled it with some overly purfumed vegitable oil (that&#x27;s what it smells like), resealed the cap and shipped it off.   This seller is a rip off. I will be filing a claim with amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Item arrived very quickly and just as described.  Thanks for the prompt service, would definitely do business with them again : )</li>
            <li> works as well as olive oil...seriously a waste of money.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but boy this product is over hyped.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair that I bleache/tone/highlight platinum blonde.  I have tried lots and lots of stuff to tame, smooth, and make it shine.  I usually use TIGI Bed Head.  It does smooth and soften my hair but doesn&#x27;t really make it shine or look healthy.  I am so happy to have tried Moroccan Oil!  It works wonders for my hair. I towel dry my hair and then apply.  I have thick hair so I use more than most people stated. It smell great and makes my hair smooth, shiny, soft, and healthy.  I will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> Love this product... This is my third purchase and my hair never looked better.  I have been plagued my whole life with a struggle to tame my long, thick, frizzy hair. Straightening irons smoothed the waves but frizz still prevailed.  Need only a small amount of Moroccanoil distributed through clean, damp hair and then maybe a light touch after drying and styling. Then I usually brush my hair back in a smooth, low ponytail while I put on my make-up. When I let it loose after 10 minutes or so, it is even smoother. I have even gone out in damp and humid weather and it still looks good.  Other products that I have tried that also contain argan oil seem to weigh my hair down with a coating that makes it feel like it needs to be washed the next day. I wish I knew about this product 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Nu beauty, or whomever they are, charged me for this product over a week ago and it is nowhere in sight.      I don&#x27;t see anyone else charging until the product ships.    Great item, but don&#x27;t order from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil! My stylist has been recommending it to me for a while, and I finally splurged and bought it. It is pricey, but as some other reviews state, it lasts forever. I straighten my naturally wavy hair, so I need a product to control the frizz, and also protect against blow drying/ flat iron damage. Moroccan Oil does that, and it smells great too. This is the first product Ive used that actually controls frizzy hair during the humid Chicago summers.  I love Moroccan Oil, and so will you. Get it now!</li>
            <li> I tried 2 other Argan type oil treatments thinking I would get the same effect for less...not even close!  I looked like I had not washed my hair in a week.  The other oils just do not absorb like Moroccan does.  I find I can get by with just this oil and maybe a light heat spray for styling and I&#x27;m good to go! I have dark, thick, processed, getting coarser by the year hair, with unruly wave that it seems to help with too.</li>
            <li> It is not dispensing after 2nd time of use. Other than that the product is fine. I love the fact that it moisturized my very dry hair within leaving a greasy look on the scalp. MAY buy again!</li>
            <li> I love love this hair oil! The way it makes my hair feel and look, is just amazing. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Product does as advertised. I have used it for several years. A little pricey but it works well.I highly recomment it. Always purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted/ordered. If I could afford it, i&#x27;d buy in bulk! So happy to see a pump in the box.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I initially heard about it. I was told it was great and I must try it. I waited until I got it as a gift and now I use it a couple times a week. This stuff is great for the bottom portion of my long hair. I am addicted to coloring, curling and abusing my hair and after I step out of the shower and feel better about it, ha. It does not smell strong or strange and its not as greasy as I had assumed. Good stuff :)</li>
            <li> This product has been wonderful for my long thin hair.  It really tames the frizzies and has nice smell. Can use it on wet or dry hair.  Comes in a glass bottle and the pump dispenses just the right amount of product each time.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the great reviews about this product I purchased a small bottle at my salon. First of all I love the smell.  Secondly, my  hair looked and felt satiny smooth immediately after the first application. But after more than 2 months of use, the ends and the bottom third of the longest part of my hair (which is where I am applying the oil) is dried-out looking and tangles easily. I didn&#x27;t have that problem prior to using Moroccan Oil. I&#x27;m going to try some of the suggestions I&#x27;ve read here for products that are 100% argan oil.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair as my title states. I&#x27;ve always used gel to keep the curls neat and control frizz. However, it&#x27;s always been a balancing act. Too little and my curls are undefined and frizzy. Too much and it&#x27;s crunchy. So hard to know where that middle line lies. My stylist pulled out this cream a few years back. I was super skeptical. Usually curl creams are too wimpy to manage my hair, and they just end up making it greasy.  Well, I haven&#x27;t used anything else in several years now.  First, it smells awesome. Not too strong, but pleasant. Second, there is absolutely no crunch, just softness.  Third, it keeps my curls really neat! Unbelievable. Finally, my hair never feels sticky or heavy. If I could design the perfect feel and effective cream it would be this cream.  Totally worth the cost too, since I use one pump for a full head of curls.</li>
            <li> I swear by this oil! This is a little pricey but the bottle will last a long time. A little bit of oil goes a long way! The smell is amazing and the oil doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. I use a dime sized amounts on the end of my hair after straightening. I have long, thick hair by the way!</li>
            <li> Like it very much. My hair is thick and had been curled, dyed and straigtened in 3 months. I use this every time when I blow my hair. And it prevents my hair getting worse when I had done so much to it.</li>
            <li> OK, so it&#x27;s a hair product:  no better/no worse than products that cost less!</li>
            <li> suggested by my hairdresser and he used it on me..love it..have curly frizzy hair at timesand conditions it..also use it as a treatment,especially due to swimmingpoolexposure</li>
            <li> I love Morroccanoil, use it every day.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and keeps my hair looking fresh, and I now only shampoo once a week or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil for about 3 years now and can&#x27;t leave without it. It makes my hair look very healthy and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> This smells lovely and works well; depending on hair length and thickness, you may need to use more than the suggested quarter size.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful!  It has a nice musky kind of fragrance. I&#x27;ve even used it in place of lotion on my face and noticed a marked improvement under my eyes and overall texture of my skin.  My hair stays healthier for longer periods in between trims and feels wonderful!  Definitely recommended for conditioning/protecting long hair.  In the evening, try applying some extra and then braiding your hair, leaving it in over night. This is great for some extra conditioning.</li>
            <li> a miracle worker for course dry hair.  Absorbs instantly on damp hair, and smells great too!  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> my daughter and I both have very long hair. Living in new england it gets extremely dry in the winter which can really make a mess out of your hair. This stuff is like no other oil. It keeps it soft and silky and never oily</li>
            <li> I received this item and the seal was broken and taped shut with scotch tape. Obviously, scotch tape and oil don&#x27;t work together as the oil breaks down the weak tape. Horrible to spend $30 plus dollars to find out that this is unusable and non returnable to Amazon. So dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times from my hairdresser and have loved it.  The product I received when purchasing on-line was leaking when I received it. The safety seal/tag that is normally over the top of the lid was missing.  It made me wonder if I was getting what I ordered.  The product was also a different color than what I normally purchase.  There have been no adverse reactions or effects from the product received.  It controls the friz as noted.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Moroccan Oil for some time and am devoted to it. My hair is fine and tends to be \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot;. Moroccan Oil is immediately absorbed and leaves my hair shiny &amp; glossy, never oily or feeling \\&quot;coated\\&quot;. This stuff is great &amp; my husband (who never uses anything special on his hair) loves it too. And did I mention the scent? Heavenly!</li>
            <li> Oil on my hair?  Never feels greasy, smells wonderful, and makes hair so healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It smoothes, reduces frizz and works great on tightly curled natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair dresser got me hooked but I did not like her price so I bought from Amazon.  This stuff is great for damaged hair.  I color my hair and it is naturally curly.  After using a flat iron daily and the frequent coloring my hair was very dry and brittle but this really helps it feel wonderful and smooth.  I also love the smell of it.  It last a long time, just a little dab will do.  Just be careful with the glass amber bottle it comes in, I dropped mine and broke it the first time the glass got slick from the oil in the product, so now I just pour it into another container as soon as I get a new bottle, and problem solved.</li>
            <li> This is the same product I originally purchased at a salon for much for money!  It works beautifully and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily - it just moisturizes and creates a healthy look and feel.  I highly recommend it to anyone with a \\&quot;dry hair\\&quot; problem.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to me.  Even though I have dry hair, I did not think I wanted to use an oil on my hair.  I changed my mind when I used it.  It is very remarkable what it does--changes the hair texture and has a very refreshing smell.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has dry hair.  It&#x27;s a great product.  My hair feels like it has more substance and has more body.</li>
            <li> This product adds shine without leaving your hair greasy. It makes the frizziest hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li> This oil is not short of excellence;it is excellence.  I have been using this oil for one year now and have found it to be the best oil for hair on the market.  The  oil does not weigh your hair down at all!  It brings out the life of your hair when used as directed.  Plus, the scent is so refreshing;it is not overpowering for the whole planet to smell it. Morrocan oil has a light fresh scent unlike oils for hair that have an overpowering scent.  I used to use Nubian Silk Hair Oil, which is a viscous oil formula with a heavy scent, but now I use the right product, that will improve my hair.  This oil is a must have!</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a warm/dry climate &amp; the dryness has taken a toll on my hair.  You only use a small amount of the Moroccan oil &amp; it takes care of the problem.  This price makes it very affordable for me to be able to use it daily so that I can keep my hair in good condition.Love it.</li>
            <li> This oil works wonders. It&#x27;s the best conditioning oil I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my hair super soft, shiny and conditioned.  It&#x27;s how you wished your hair would feel after you used conditioner in the shower. It helps with some frizz, but if you have curly or course hair, you&#x27;re going to need an additional product to combat that problem.  Your hair will feel super healthy and clean.  Everyone with dry hair needs this!</li>
            <li> I first saw this in a salon, where the stylist applied it to my hair after washing it.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have basically straight, fine hair and live in Houston where humidity is a huge problem, so my hair tends to frizz.  Regular serums are too heavy for my fine hair.  This works well for the frizz and does make my hair shiny and silky without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific for dry, frizzy hair.  Best price I found on the internet is at Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about this product as a great humidity fighter for all types of hair, and it&#x27;s 100% true.  My hair is sleek and salon-smooth when I use it (without the super-expensive flat iron :-)</li>
            <li> Truly the best hair repair/oil/smoother ever. Goes on easy and lasts for days.$37 beats the $55 the hairdresser wants to charge .....</li>
            <li> Love my shinny hair!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product that works on my daughter&#x27;s hair for the past 3 years.  Moroccanoil is it!  It smells good, keeps her hair from getting frizzy and also helps with tangles.  I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> The moroccaniol instanly help the sheading and damage to my hair like on the 2nd day of use. I have been using this product for nearly over a month and notice that my hair is much healthier and feels great. I&#x27;m an african american women and I always seem to damage my hair with over heat and chemicals. I was looking for somthing to help with that so I can take better care of my hair. THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!!! The only problem I had was when I order from one salon off of Amazon. I believe that the oil was not the same as the first order from another salon. Right now I&#x27;m trying to find what salon sent it to me so I can call them up . I tose the info away as soon as I got my oil. But again, I advise anyone having problems with thier hair to try this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good make my hair more soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, thick hair.  After using Moroccanoil on my damp hair and then styling as usual I notice such a difference in the texture and bounce-factor.  It just feels softer - even with other products on my hair.</li>
            <li> Though I am sure that this oil will do great things for your hair, what is not mentioned is how HIGHLY scented this product is. Within a half hour of using a very small amount, I had such a headache from the scent, that I had to wash it out. I wish they could make this product without the artificial fragrance. Ick!</li>
            <li> The product has a different scent than Moroccan Oil I have bought from local Salons.  I&#x27;m not sure why, or if it was a bad batch or what.  Maybe that&#x27;s why it is less expensive.  The product still works the same, just smells different, which was the best part.</li>
            <li> This product really is amazing - I have very healthy hair and try not to use any products in it, and now use this all the time!  For shorter hair, use a dime-sized amount everywhere but at the scalp, and you will find that healthy hair is even healthier, shinier, and fly-aways are tamed, which is especially helpful with the onset of winter. This product is like a leave-in conditioner and won&#x27;t make your hair oily.  Warning though... expect a ridiculous amount of compliments on how great your hair looks, because you really will look like you just came from a magazine shoot!</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product. It is cheaper to buy here rather than at a salon. It has made a difference in my short cut. Just a small drop enhances the shine and adds to the smoothness. I have gotten many compliments. also I enjoy the musky scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used to use Bio Silk and I will never go back to that product.  After using Morrocan oil I notice a drastic change in the healthiness of my hair.  I am a mix of African American and White, and this product has actually changed the feel of my hair.  It breaks less and has more shine and bounce than with the Bio Silk, which has alcohol in it, which can dry out african american hair.  I personally like the smell of Morrocan oil, but I can see how some people might not like it.  The product is expensive, but one bottle lasts almost a year, and is a great buy! LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> If you have really dry hair you will absolutely love this product.  My hairdresser recommended it to me and I have since ordered it several times as Amazon has it for less.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and I am always trying new creams to make my hair soft, curly with no frizz..This product does that. After a shower I put a small amount on my fingers and start at the ends and lightly through my hair. I still use my curling cream with it but the outcome is very different, its amazing and it conditions the hair at the same time.  It smells great also.  Occasionally I blow out my hair which this also is works great for..It seems pricey but you don&#x27;t use a lot, Try it you will be pleased. Not sure if this is good for fine thin straight hair, might make it greasy or weigh it down..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product gets such good reviews.  It is expensive and does not work.  My hair is thin and frizzy.  I tried it several times hair wet, hair dry, small amount, meduim amount, large amount, and it does nothing for me.  My hair still frizzes.  The texture of my hair is better without it.</li>
            <li> Excellent leave in conditioner. Smells really nice and gives the hair a nice shrine after sitting under the dryer. Great for african american hair.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love it.  I have coarse/color-processed, straight, shoulder length hair and I just use a pea sized amount on towel dried hair just before I blow dry/flat iron...and it leaves my hair soft and smooth.  I use a touch more on my daughter&#x27;s thick waist length hair with similar results.  I&#x27;m glad my salon suggested it.  The Amazon price is $11 less than what my salon was selling it for so it&#x27;s also a pretty decent deal.    However, it&#x27;s still a small investment even at the $27 price point and I can see how there would be people who have fine hair who might find it too heavy of a product and the smell is pretty heady (the reviewer who said it was musky is correct, with a warm spicy undertone) so I suggest if your salon sells it to ask them for a sample just to try it out first before you buy.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (almost waist length)that is foil wrapped (highlighted) every 6 weeks and my hair texture is baby fine but lots of it so blow drying without frying it can be a challenge. I&#x27;ve used other \\&quot;tamer\\&quot; type products in the past but they seem geared only towards those with naturally curly, coarse type hair or something and weigh my baby locks down. This product gives me shine without weight and the very best thing, especially in winter, is that I&#x27;m not left with TONS of static cling in my hair after blow drying. It also seems to protect my hair from the heat of the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has worked for me even in the most humid weather. Another good thing is this product is so light that after using, I can curl my normally straight hair and it WILL curl and the curls last just as if I didn&#x27;t use the product and I cannot say that about any other \\&quot;tamer\\&quot; type product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that it is somewhat expensive but I&#x27;ve found that even though I do have lots of hair, a little less than a dime sized amount is plenty to get the results I want so the bottle does last a long time for me. Just pour a small amount in your hand, rub your palms together and apply to your hair. I do my ends first and work my way up to the crown, then blow dry as normal.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s best friend loaned me some of her Moroccan Oil to see if I liked it, and it truly changed the look of my hair. I have thin, fine, color-treated hair, and Moroccan Oil makes it shiny and lay flat. It may take a couple of times of using it to figure out just the right amount to put in your hair. I put it in right before I blow dry and flat iron my hair. Several of my friends even told me my hair looks thicker. I&#x27;m a teacher, and I loaned some of my Moroccan Oil to a co-worker, and she loved it. She&#x27;s going to order a bottle for herself and one each for her two daughters. It may seem a little expensive, but the bottle will last forever, plus you will probably be able to get rid of many of your other hair products. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. It moisturizes the hair and penetrates the cuticle. you won&#x27;t have weighed down greasy hair with this and you will have incredible shine. I recommend this product highly. the price is steep but ordering through amazon I was able to get it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  I have long hair with split ends and the oil softens my hair and improves the ends.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep down the frizzies and a way to manage wavy/curlie hair. My beautician charges triple in the salon. So I am ever so happy to find this site to purchase all my moroccanoil needs!  Thanks Amazon  A Satisfied Customer :)</li>
            <li> I soooo love this product!!  I have very thick hair and and it can be a little dry especially after a relaxer.  I started using this product a month ago and now I refuse to be without it.  As the bottle states, it moisturizes your hair without making it oily.  I put it on towel dried freshly washed hair before I roller set it and sit under the dryer.  I absolutely love the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on this product for a while now but I was trying to finish up some of my other hair products before getting yet another thing that would add to my large collection of cosmetics and potions. My mom was sweet enough to give this to me as a gift so of course I had to use is asap, there was no way I was going to wait while it sat on my shelf! This turned out to be such a great surprise, this really works wonders. Let me say right away that men and women can both use it, its not something that only half of us can enjoy, I think my friend Danny who&#x27;s also a hair product fanatic will really like this!    Rich in vitamin E, carotene, phenolic acid and essential fatty acids, argan oil is one of the rarest but most valuable cosmetic ingredients. This turns hair into silk, few small drops is all I need in the morning on freshly washed hair that&#x27;s still wet or damp, and it vanished instantly, never making my hair greasy or heavy. When I wash it the next day I can still feel the extra softness but it&#x27;s so marvelous that I tend to use it every day. So far in my life I haven&#x27;t used an oil based product that vanishes so well, this really leaves no greasy residue whatsoever and the hair feels like spun silk, even my damaged ends feel more light and wispy, sometimes I feel like I cant stop touching my hair, to someone who doesn&#x27;t know how well this works I might appear to have a disorder where my arm flies up to my hair all the time....    - Kasia S.</li>
            <li> My hair sylist used this on my hair for the first time a couple of months ago and I bought my own bottle right away.  This oil makes my curly hair have soft bouncy curls and when I straighten it, it&#x27;s soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve never been happier with my hair then I have since I discovered this hair oil.  It won&#x27;t make your hair heavy or greasy it&#x27;s so light and gives it a healthy looking shine, that I have never had with my borderline frizzy hair.  You only need a very small amount so the 3.5 oz lasts quite awhile, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the product but for the amount of hair that I have, I need to use a lot, otherwise it&#x27;s frizzy.  If you have thinner hair, than I think it would work great!</li>
            <li> I swim and blow dry my hair on a regular basis.  This product helps my frizzies like u would not believe.</li>
            <li> best product and smell great</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged and the first day I used this product i could see and feel the difference. I thought I even put too much in my hair the first time, so I was worried my hair would be oily, it wasn&#x27;t! My hair felt so soft and silky, and it looked shiny and healthy! I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday and it was obvious that the bottle had been tampered with - seal was sliced open.  Even worse, what was inside the bottle had been tampered with.  It was not Moroccanoil - does not smell or feel like it.  I was leary once I saw the bottle seal had been tampered with and could tell right away that it was not what it claimed to be.  I sent an email to the seller requesting a full refund.  Will post outcome once I hear back from them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Moroccan hair oil! This will be one product I will buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Product is well worth the money!  I received it well within lead time and well-packaged. Very pleased.  Would order from here again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m that girl with natural blonde hair....The kind that is FRIZZZZZZZZZY, brittle, looks like straw no matter what I use.. I have tried almost every product under the sun to help tame my hair and nothing has ever helped the way this stuff has. I have been a longtime user of biosilk which i like but never \\&quot;loved\\&quot;...This stuff is freaking AMAZING!!! It smoothes my hair out, tames fly aways and it actually looks healthy! A little goes a long way and I concentrate on my ends and work my way up. Don&#x27;t put this near the crown or if can weigh your hair down. Highly recommend this oil!</li>
            <li> This heavenly scented hair oil feels like a real luxury.  And it actually nourishes the hair.  Worth the money if you want to splurge.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I love the smell and I love how my hair feels after I use it. I usually apply it when my hair is almost dry, but not completely. The results are really good. I&#x27;ll keep buying it. Also, my first and previous bottle lasted 11 months. Lets see how much this one lasts!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just under a month and I feel it is the best hair product I have ever used. I put a very small amount  on my towel dried hair and immediately the texture of my hair improves.  The scent is awesome too.  Drying my hair takes half the time!  After drying, I straighten my hair and it looks and feels so soft and silky. My hair has become so healthy I cannot believe it.  Worth every penny!  Play aroung with the amount you use.  My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and I use approx. a dime sized amount.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for Carribean and mixed texture hair. It provides the moisture without making hair heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It makes my hair shiny and soft without weighing it down or making it look greasy. It works best if you put it in when your hair is wet, and you really only need to use a very small amount of it. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I had heard about Moroccanoil from my stylist, she raved about it.  My hair was dried out and damaged from years of bleaching, and I&#x27;d been trying protein conditioners, heat protectants, the whole nine yards and it still wasn&#x27;t soft to the touch.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, just a few drops in my hair after every shower, and my hair is shiny, soft, and healthy, and it smells really good too! My friends keep teasing because I can&#x27;t stop touching my own head because I can&#x27;t believe how soft it is.  I should really be the Moroccanoil poster child I talk about it so much!</li>
            <li> What great about this oil is when you apply it to your hair it will absorb fast and you see an immediate difference.I usually use this after blow drying.</li>
            <li> My hari stylist used this on me at my last visit.  She recommended it highly,but she does not sell products in her shop so I came to Amazon to buy it.  Costs less here than she paid for it where she bought it.  You don&#x27;t use much, but it really adds a nice shine to my hair w/o taking all the body away. I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is seriosuly the best hair product i have ever purchased and used.  My hair is relatively straight, long with a medium texture and I was worried about using an oil in my hair however, this has made my hair much more manegable, quicker drying and smooths any rough texture. I now feel like I can air dry my hair and it doesnt look rough or unpolished (I am a habitual blowdryer... I still typically blowdry but I dont have to make my hair look presentable).  I recommend to any/everyone!</li>
            <li> love the oil. I have thick Curly/ Wavy hair, it needs oil on the ends and other places as well.&lt;br /&gt;I regret getting the large bottle. I use on dry and wet hair. it holds in moisture, and the hair does not get gooky or oily looking.</li>
            <li> This product, although not cheap, is the best hair product I have tried in 40 years!  It makes my hair shine and makes it very easy to manage.  My hair looks like silk!</li>
            <li> I bought my Moroccanoil from a salon, and it&#x27;s clear to me that it&#x27;s the \\&quot;real deal.\\&quot; However, it contains very little real argan oil and mostly just the same inexpensive ingredients (they are listed on the box) that are found in most hair serums. A good thing, no doubt, as every time I&#x27;ve put pure oil in my hair to condition it, it&#x27;s (understandably) looked greasy.    Anyway, this stuff works fine, and if you compare it to John Frieda&#x27;s serums, Bumble &amp; Bumble Defrizz, Silk Therapy, etc., it is far superior. Personally, I find L&#x27;anza&#x27;s Healing Moisture to make my hair appear healthier and shinier, and it \\&quot;weightlessly disappears\\&quot; into my hair just as well as does Moroccanoil. It also smells good, though Moroccanoil smells a bit more heavenly.    Bottom line: if you don&#x27;t mind paying an arm and a leg for an argan oil product that contains very little argan oil, it&#x27;s good. It will also last you forever. However, if you want a product that makes your hair a bit healthier-looking and has more healing ingredients, and you want to get way more bang for your buck, try L&#x27;anza. For the record, if I couldn&#x27;t get L&#x27;anza or if they doubled the price of their product, then I would DEFINITELY opt to use Moroccanoil over any other product out there.    I took away 1 star because it is overpriced relative to the ingredients it contains. I took away another star because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look as awesome as L&#x27;anza&#x27;s , which I&#x27;ve set as the gold standard. For the record, I have long, fine, smooth/straight/shiny, colored hair, and an oily scalp. Moroccanoil does not weigh my hair down, nor does it leave any residue on my hair. It really is a nice product; it&#x27;s just not the best.    UPDATE: I just received a large sample of Aquage&#x27;s Silkening Oil Treatment, and it is a contender for my favorite hair serum--it&#x27;s as good as L&#x27;Anza&#x27;s, and possibly even cheaper! Oh, and it has argan oil in it as well, in case that ingredient is important to you.</li>
            <li> As for this product, I love it to death. I am concerned though, when I read the manufacturer&#x27;s website [...] and discover they consider Amazon an unauthorized dealer. They don&#x27;t protect product by warranty if it is purchased here and insist they want to sell through salons only to maintain quality. Anyone else concerned about that?</li>
            <li> I like the product but don&#x27;t like the fact that the price went up AND the size went down.  I bought this product a year ago and when it started running low, I went to my orders, clicked purchase again and ordered a new bottle.  I saw that it was a little more money and didn&#x27;t mind because I realize that the price of things go up at times but I didn&#x27;t realize that the size of the bottle was so much smaller until I received it in the mail today.  The previous bottle was 4.6 Oz and this one is 3.4 Oz.  I guess that is how they get you.  Partly my fault for not looking closer, I guess.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and my hair is dry much faster.  There is no oiliness, so it apparently is absorbed immediately.  I think this bottle will last me for years.  Unfortunately, it leaked a bit during delivery, but otherwise, I&#x27;m please.  It was delivered very quickly and is less expensive that the local stores.</li>
            <li> This product is the reason I am able to wear my hair wavy/curly rather than having to do through the torturous process of straightening it every day. I typically apply about a quarter-sized amount of it to my wet hair and just work it through, avoiding my scalp. My hair actually dries afterward (no &#x27;wet&#x27; look) and looks great - very healthy and shiny. It smells great too, which is a huge plus. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with frizzy hair or wavy hair. If you have stick straight hair already you likely don&#x27;t need this product - in fact it&#x27;s possible it could just weigh your hair down. All in all - love it!</li>
            <li> I have dark curly, relaxed African American hair.  If I could give Moraccan oil 10 stars I would.  I washed my hair, put in a dime sized amount on both sides of the hair and worked it into the strands. Then used a blow dryer to dry.  My hair was shiny and soft.  My hair has only looked like this when done at the hair dressers.  LOVE THIS STUFF !!!!  Use the intense conditioner and leave on 30 min. It is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> Its great for your hair.  Moroccan Oil helps your hair dry faster and leaves a nice shine.  Use a very little amount or your hair will be oily by the next day.  I like this product and it was recommended to me by my hair dresser.  A little annoying to only be able to buy it online.  I have also found White Sands brand Orchid Oil to be great.  Try that as well!</li>
            <li> This is the third bottle I&#x27;ve purchased for my wife.  They last a long time as she says that she only needs a small amount to get great hair. (year per bottle?).  After trying it several years ago, she won&#x27;t do without it now.  Her hair looks great.</li>
            <li> This oil helps with frizzy, unruly, and curly hair.  I use it right before I blow-dry my hair, and it makes my hair feel so silky.  I have seen an improvement to my hair and I see less split ends when I use this product.  This is a must try!</li>
            <li> I read great reviews of the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment. I really wanted to try something new with my hair because my long hair always got dry and took me time to fix it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to apply small amount of oil on my hair at night. Next morning, I felt my hair became very soft and silky. The Oil is easy and quick ways to style my hair and made my frizzy and dry hair into a smooth.</li>
            <li> I have always had a thick head of hair this product tames all the dryness and tangles.  This is my second purchase love it!</li>
            <li> Great product to help moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 2 inches past my shoulders, fine and curly with medium sized curls. I usually straighten it though with a chi flat iron. I went to a salon last weekend and the girl who cut my hair used this on it. I had heard that it was a great product but never tried it. She finished styling my hair and I was like WOW! I told her I was really impressed with how non frizzy it was and she said it was probably the Morrocanoil. I was hesitant to buy it because of the price, but went ahead and bought a small bottle. I have used it every day since and its AMAZING. I use a Lush Seanik shampoo bar and Aubrey organics moisturizing conditioner then hop out of the shower, comb my hair and put in my Redken blow dry protectant and then use a dime sized amount of the Moroccanoil, concentrating on the ends, Blow dry then straighten. It turns out perfect every time. If I still have a little frizz I use a VERY small amount of the Moroccanoil and then hairspray. It looks perfect all day. Before Moroccanoil I did this same routine minus the MO and my hair looked frizzy as soon as I stepped out the door into the humid Mississippi heat. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair when its worn curly yet but I will probably use a little less so as not to weigh it down too much. I know a lot of other people have mentioned this too but I cant stress this enough THE SMELL omg is amazing! I would wear this as perfume. Very tropical musky scent. I love it and will continue to buy it! I will mention though it is a little cheaper at the salon than it is on here so I wont be ordering it online.</li>
            <li> This oil is just what I was looking for to give my hair a bit of shine and moisture with no oiliness.</li>
            <li> I cant not use for a single day. absolutely obsessed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil for years. It&#x27;s a wonderful product. When we moved to Germany, I ordered it on Amazon through this seller. When the product arrived, half of the contents had spilled. I immediately notified the seller and they IMMEDIATELY sent me a replacement. So thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I use Moroccan Oil on my hair every time I wash my hair. My beautician introduced me to it, and I would be lost without it.  I have fine, curly hair, and this product keeps my hair under control.  Since I started using Moroccan Oil, I have never had such smooth and shiny hair, and it stays that way even in damp weather.  I was fortunate to find it on AMAZON.  I went to a local beauty supply store where I had bought it before, and they no longer carried it. \\&quot;OH NO!\\&quot;  I always keep a spare bottle on hand, so thank you AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I went through a phase where my hair was pretty much indistinguishable from armpit hair. It was nappy, coarse, and of course, dry from a hair coating job. It was a nightmare considering hair is pretty much the number one thing that sets us apart from guys (may be except for chests...) and thus one of the most important features in females.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I was kind of skeptical. I have tried other hair essence recommended by friends, but they didn&#x27;t do anything. I might as well have just flushed the money down the toilet. I was hesitant to fork over even more money for this, but I think it was well worth it. My hair only feels softer, but it looks silky. When I wash my hair, I&#x27;ve noticed less hair falls out. My mom in her 50&#x27;s complained about how a handful of hair fell out when she showered, but also noticed far less hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both love the product, and got other people in our family to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is its packaging (glass). If I were to drop it (a scene I&#x27;m too familiar with), I think it&#x27;d shatter and spill all over the floor.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and it helps my processed hair retain some moisture instead of feeling so dry</li>
            <li> I say \\&quot;mmmmm\\&quot; because the smell is amazing. It&#x27;s my favorite thing about this oil.     When I first started using it, it worked really well, and I would have sworn by it. It made my hair softer for sure. After a few months of use, though, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as awesome, and one thing I dislike about it is that it&#x27;s so easy to use too little or too much--a pump would have been nice. I use It&#x27;s a 10 more now.</li>
            <li> My hair becomes very bushy and frizzy in humid weather, and Moroccan oil has helped me to keep it under control better than any other product I have tried over the years. I have color treated hair and it does not seem to affect the color.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a hint: the bodyshop sells \\&quot;frizz ease\\&quot; for about $16 for 75ml, it is less sticky than Moroccan oil and I prefer it. Also if you ever go to Thailand you can get a similar product for 100 Thai Baht (about $3) in the Boots chemists that are everywhere. They have Brazil nut oil and lots of variations. I&#x27;ve found both of these tame my frizzy hair and give it a lovely shine better than Moroccan oil does. Can&#x27;t believe what a chump I was to pay all that money for it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years now and I love it!  My hair is fine and naturally blonde.  It get&#x27;s oily quickly and also seems to get split ends way too soon after a salon visit.  Since Moroccanoil that has changed.  My hair is so healthy and I don&#x27;t have to get my trim up as often as I used to.  I LOVE the scent and the lightweight feel.  I have converted many friends to becoming moroccanoil fans.  I promise this product is worth the money. It lasts me up to 6 months with the 3 ounce bottle and I use it almost every day.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Moroccanoil and I absolutely love it, along with several other products from them. I have coarse overworked and over dyed hair and I recommend this to anyone with the same conditions. The bottle lasts me about 6 months using a quarter size amount everyday. I apply to wet towel dried hair before I blow dry it or I&#x27;ll put it in along with the styling cream and let it air dry for a wavy look. It&#x27;s really helped to maintain the overall condition of my hair through processing and dye jobs. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product is my miracle in a bottle! I apply it to my wet hair midshaft to ends and my hair is soft, and stays super soft, all day long. I do still heat style my hair, but the results are so much better. Moroccan Oil makes my hair soft, frizzfree... it&#x27;s the best. It arrived in perfect packaging and was just what I was expecting. It&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had my hair cut and styled at a salon last summer on a 100+ degree day. It was BRUTALLY hot. And naturally, I sweat, and my hair is a giant frizz ball. My hair always turns into a giant frizzball. Summer weddings are really tragic for me for this reason. I always look terrible. But with this my hair stayed soft and styled!!! Which for me is UNHEARD of. Of course I wanted to know what they used in my hair. It would be worth it&#x27;s weight in gold to me. They told me it was Morrocanoil and of course wanted me to buy it from them. It was very expensive and I thought I would price compare. Sure enough I found it cheaper on amazon. I bought some for myself and my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I apply while wet and heat style. But the style holds. The oil offers some protection from the heat and keeps the hair hydrated enough that it doesn&#x27;t frizz out of control. I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A side note: I bragged about this stuff to friends &amp; fam. of course - and sure enough - my Aunt uses it too, and loves it!</li>
            <li> It is what it says and more! really gives softness to the hair. Absolutely a must have! You will feel the difference right at first use.</li>
            <li> Over Priced ! It was a gift request.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves your hair soft, healthy, easy to style and it is not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> Love this product, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and I have used this product for months and love it.  It helps stop the split ends and protects my hair from product use.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair was smooth and shiny the first time I used it and everytime after that. Will definately purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is okay but not the best. This doesn&#x27;t do anything for silkiness. The shine doesn&#x27;t last very long on the hair. it gets dull after a few mins. I don&#x27;t know why people rave about this as I&#x27;ve seen and used better stuff that exist out there and thats cheaper.</li>
            <li> I use this everytime i wash my hair and it makes it smell pretty :) (or else it would smell like burning after i flat iron it)  First i towel dry my hair and then comb it, then put a dime size amount in my hand, rub hands together and work into the ends of my hair (bottom half).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful product for a few years now- can&#x27;t live w/o it now!  the smell is amazing- plus it does wonders for my hair-  can&#x27;t use it everyday- makes hair a little too smooth when you do that- but otherwise- fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing Moroccanoil for about a year now through amazon. It&#x27;s difficult to get to the only store in the area who sales it. The real Moroccanoil is great. You do not need to use a lot (so the bottle lasts for sometime) and it improves the texture of my hair. My hair was usually dry and brittle, but this product has really provided moisture- without being greasy!!! It also speeds the drying time too somehow. I highly recommend giving it a try!!    However as reviewers have posted there is a fake Moroccanoil out there. I happened to receive it around May of this year, and did not realize until I was reordering last week. When I received it I was a bit skeptical because some of the liquid had leaked from the bottle. Also it tended to be a LOT thicker than the original and had a different smell. I thought they had changed their formula (which I didn&#x27;t like). I was going to try and find something else until I saw the negative reviews and then ordered from the first supplier that I used. I did not throw away the bad bottle so I compared it to my recent purchase. There are noticable differences. The easiest check is that on the real product, above the L on the white Moroccanoil writing on the bottle, has a (R)- for registered trademark. The supplier that I know has the good stuff (who I will continue to buy from) is BeautyClicks. It may be more expensive than some of the others, but I am confident that I am getting the right product and will not have to deal with the hassle of returning it.     SO.. in conclusion.. The Real Moroccanoil is wonderful!!! But be warned there are fakes and you may have to spend more for the right stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I too have used several different products, tried all the rage in shampoos/conditioners but when it comes down to it, nothing else will compare.  I wash my hair EVERY day, and color my hair every 6 weeks. I blow dry and straighten my hair every day as well. But, when I am using Moroccan Oil, I get compliments from complete strangers on how wonderful, silky smooth my hair is. I would say beware of other brands (argon oil, merrakesh oil) because they will feel NOTHING like what Moroccan Oil feels like in your hair. Bio Silk is honestly the closest, but not hardly comparable. Yes, it is expensive. But if you are using this, you are most likely already investing in your hair... you get it colored/treated, you buy expensive shampoo and conditioner..and when you are honest, you know you get what you pay for, and you wont be disappointed I promise!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps my hair healthy especially since I not only color but also perm. I use it after every shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have tried generic moroccan oils but nothing compares to the original. it leaves your hair so shiny and soft. I love it</li>
            <li> I used this product after having my hair done with a brazilian treatment. It smells absolutely fabulous. It is an oil, so a tiny dab goes a LONG way. My hair did not feel greasy when applied. It was really great to tame frizz after blowing dry and using a hot iron. It did seem to wash out, so it is needed to be reapplied. It smoothes the hair and leaves it silky. I do use the product frequently and i do not think it changed my hair quality as it does wash out.</li>
            <li> not a good option for my mixed heritage hair....didn&#x27;t really care for the product; probably a good option for a person with wavy or straight hair</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  I have bought so many, many oils and they were too heavy, too light or just seemed to make my hair feel more dry than it already is.  This one is absolutely Perfect!  I really does work.  My hair never feels oily or itchy.</li>
            <li> The product received was not the same product I have used before.  The packaging was the exact same BUT the product does not smell or work the same.  Very Dissapointing</li>
            <li> I can never be without Morrocan Oil. My hair is super thick and other products just don&#x27;t provide the richness that this product does. I always but 2 -since sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is a great product: smells good, keeps hair from being dry, adds shine.  One bottle lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> If I had to pick one singular beauty product that has completely changed my life and I couldn&#x27;t be paid to give up, it&#x27;s Morrocanoil. This stuff is unreal....absolutely phenomenal. The way it&#x27;s transformed my hair is amazing...I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it. My hairstylist first recommended it a few years ago, and this product--along with the Morrocanoil Shampoo and Conditioner, are all I need to keep my hair soft, shiny, and literally looking like celebrity hair. I don&#x27;t color my hair or style it with a straightener/curling iron frequently, but have always had long, coarse, thick strands with a natural wave/curl. This stuff rocks, I can literally put the Morrocanoil in after a shower (I use it all over---roots to ends--) and it looks amazing whether I blowdry with a diffuser or just let my hair air dry. The dry, sometimes-dull texture of my hair has done a 180 since using this product. It&#x27;s literally miraculous! Worth EVERY penny of the $40 price tag, and it lasts for months. The best part is, it DOES NOT weigh hair down at all, even if you use the product generously--I&#x27;ve tried soo many products that make my hair feel heavy and gross. If I could give it 20 stars I would!</li>
            <li> Naturally I have very curly, coarse hair.  Recently I have had the Brazilian Blow Out treatment done to my hair which has left my hair straight, smooth and soft. As recommended by my stylist, moroccanoil is the only product I use before blow drying my hair.  Moroccanoil has given my hair an amazing shine without weighing it down or having any negative effects of other \\&quot;shine enhancers\\&quot;.  It is the single most impressive hair product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product was recommended to me (I bought it from my salon).  As much as I love the scent, this product really didn&#x27;t do nothing for me.  It caused frizz and ended up drying out my hair.  It also left product residue in my hair.  It might work for some but as for me, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I got his oit and was very excited to try it, since the reviews were pretty good.  I was very dissapointed that it has such a powerfull scent.  I tried adding a couple of drops of my vanilla oil, but it was still very strong.  I used less than half, and even though it was cheap, I threw it out.  I couldn&#x27;t deal with scent any longer.  The oil is ok, but the scent is just too strong for me.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. First of all, it builds body in my (and my husband&#x27;s) hair by holding the moisture in our hair. Secondly, it smells fabulous! Thirdly, our hair has a wonderful shine to it now. And, lastly, but not least, my husband has not had problems with dandruff since using the Moroccan Oil. Enclosed with the Moriccan Oil was a pump, which measures out the correct amount of oil per use. That was a special surprise!</li>
            <li> I first was introduced to this by my hair stylist, 2 years ago. She used about 2-3 drops mid-drying my hair before blow-drying it. The result was soft silky feeling hair, especially at the tips of the hair, where i am prone to split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use it, would be semi dry your hair, and when it is about 60-70% dry, rub 2-3 drops to the ends of your hair, and finish drying it. It smells great too! Very beachy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle lasts me about 3-3 1/2 months. But then again i wash my hair daily. So some people might be able to stretch the bottle a bit more.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I don&#x27;t have to use a straight iron anymore. It&#x27;s not greasy, makes your hair shine. Best product ever.</li>
            <li> Love the smells works wonders on my hair, and they even gave me a little extra with a nice note written on the bottom! So sweet will definitely order from them again!</li>
            <li> I love this oil for my hair,keeps the coor nice and rich looking and is wonderful for any type of hair.I am very happy with this order,thank you so much. on time and in great condition.i will come back.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser talked me in to investing in Moroccanoil and I absolutely love it. I paid far more at the salon then it would have cost me ordering online. It was well worth it at the salon so I am thrilled that I am able to buy it at half the cost now. I even use it on my arms!!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my stylist.  I love it but when I used at home, I was getting limp looking locks after a few hours.  The secret is to only use a few drops, spread it into your palms, and work well into the hair.  It only takes a little bit!  AFTER you&#x27;ve applied the oil, use your regular styling products and finish as usual. Now I get fantastic shine and my hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> I had really dry and frizzy hair but after using this product daily for the past few months my hair is soft and no more frizzies. Well worth the price. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing results by using moroccanoil, my hair is perfect, I usally use before dry my hair and the result is perfect. The seller was perfect. Delivered the product before the informed deadline.</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment for years.  It is expensive, but lasts a very long time.  The package arrived in good condition and earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I tried this product since it seemed to be doing wonders for my daughters&#x27; relaxed hair adding shine and subtleness, especially in an arid climate. However, I did notice some build up on my locs. Also, after a time, my very sensitive skin starting reacting to it causing some mild allergic dermatitis. I have had to discontinue using it. My daughters use has continued.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found yet to help with frizzy, thick hair.  It helps my hair look more silky and makes it more manageable since I live in a high humidity state.  When I use this product, I don&#x27;t have to use anything else in addition to it!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser tells me I have the most challenging hair she has ever seen.  She has been a styling hair for over 20 years.  I have thick, frizzy hair.  It is naturally curly, but the curl is uneven and wild.  A little Moroccan oil after a hair wash keeps my hair smooth and satin in appearance.  I wished I discovered it earlier!</li>
            <li> Nothing like this product compares. Not even Davines Oil.</li>
            <li> extremely fast delivery and absoloutely perfect product.  a 3 oz bottle last a year.    d</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended Moroccanoil, but it was way out of my budget.  I found it here for 50% less than in her salon.  This is a great product for curly/frizzy hair.  It weighs hair down without making it greasy.  It smells wonderful.  I think this bottle will last me a long time - I&#x27;ve had it for a month and the bottle is still almost full.</li>
            <li> Is arrived before the preview day and the results of the product is amazing</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, it has artificial ingredients and fragrances.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil!  This product arrived faster than expected, and the cost was the best I&#x27;ve seen!  I will definitly order this again!</li>
            <li> Only i love the smell and shine its not argan oil ..coz argan is smell too way diffrent but its very nice serum</li>
            <li> Overrated and hardly any &#x27;moroccan&#x27; oil in it.  Save your money for better moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Super for calming hair but also great for little girl tangles.  Worth every penny bc it lasts a long time...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken on this product and it was not the real moroccan oil. I have the real oil and it smelled differently and worked differently. Don&#x27;t buy! Worst part is that this can&#x27;t be returned. I am VERY unhappy with the inability to return a false product. I was ripped off!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price! Almost half the price its sold for in salons. Great amount of oil to keep hair from getting dry.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Moroccan oil in place of Carol&#x27;s Daughter Lisa&#x27;s Hair Elixir. When I apply it to my wet hair, it makes the curls more prominent. Wow, I love that! Also, it makes my hair super, duper soft - not even kidding you, I can use a wide tooth comb and comb through it as if it&#x27;s not even wet! I have also used it on my hair after blowdrying, and true to it&#x27;s word, it will not make your hair heavy and greasy, but it does not seem to do anything else other than that while my hair is dry. I love it more when applying on my wet hair. I have also used the Moroccan Oil Intense Hydrating Mask and it too is fabulous and makes my hair very soft and manageable! I will not replace these products with my Carol&#x27;s Daughter b/c I think they&#x27;re both great products, I will simply switch up using them. This Moroccan oil is definitely a keeper and I don&#x27;t have to order it online anymore b/c I saw it in TJ Maxx last week - oh yeah!</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product and I was impressed with her shine so I decided to try it also.  It does all it says it will.</li>
            <li> This oil is really good. It smells great, feels great on you hair, and is not oily. I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended and used this product on my hair.  This is my 2nd bottle of Moroccanoil and I never shampoo without it.  It allows my hair to look smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> My mom and I went to do a beauty day one weekend. I got my haircut,blown dry and styled (flat iron). I have thick straight hair some of the back will have a natural wave to it. The stylist who never has done my hair before which btw I&#x27;m real reluctant to go into a blind appointment and not know who I&#x27;m dealing with. He put this oil on my hair while it was wet still combed the oil thru my hair, then blew it out. I did NOT need a flat iron on my hair at all. The SHINE is AMAZING and the compliments came left and right! It is a great product...but, only use a little teeny bit it will go a long way for even long hair. I bought the big bottle it was worth every penny.[[ASIN:B001RQOSBS Moroccanoil MOROCCANOIL (.85oz)]]You have no frizz and you can apply it dry too.</li>
            <li> The best hair oil ever, cannot live without! Leaves hair soft, shiny and feels stronger! I also got the mask which is also amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft, shine, bounce and smell great. it does amazing job on damaged hair from excess coloring.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of stuff on my hair through the years and I really think I found something to stick with. It has SPF for your hair, smells great and makes your hair feel soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair, especially when it gets wet, i.e first get out of shower. It becomes huge with uncontrollable volume and stubborn waves that are NOT attractive. However, only after trying this product I realized I don&#x27;t have to flatiron my hair everyday before leaving the house. It actually gives it controlled waves like I purposely had a perm. I&#x27;ve tried many many product from Frederic Fekkai glossy cream to Frize Ease, none have worked for me like this product. Great for outdoors or a day on the beach or even to tie into a ponytail at the office.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great- it actually makes blowdrying soo much faster.  It makes your hair look so silky and smooth, too.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. It seriously treats your hair. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell. It&#x27;s not an awful smell but it&#x27;s not something that I would choose. But it&#x27;s absolutely worth it considering how much this product works.</li>
            <li> Very good for all types of hair. Even my husband likes it! I use it every morning after I wash my hair. Could be used on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my stylist and my friends have also used Moroccan Oil. I can assure you that the moroccan oil sold here is counterfit. This product does not smell or act like the real product. What a disappointment and waste of money.    I thought I would try to save myself some money, but this was not a wise choice.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have according to my wife. I have puchased this oil many times and will again. The wife says it makes her hair feel the best out of all the products she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny now that I use this! I like the smell also. Sometimes I just use a small drop, and sometimes about a nickel size. I only put it on my scalp occasionally, as that will sometimes weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Really works well with my hair!</li>
            <li> Best product ever. Last about a year. Use a dime size with each use. My hair is shiny, smooth, and healthy. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I saw \\&quot;moroccanoil\\&quot; on the bottle, the (at that time) positive reviews, and the price was right, so I didn&#x27;t bother to read the ingredients.  I knew I messed up when I opened the bottle and out came a heavy perfume smell.  It&#x27;s basically a bunch of polymers and other chemicals, plus a small amount of Moroccan oil to give it an illusion of class.  I did try it once, and it gave my hair that brittle acrylic look that my other polymers and co-polymers did.  Since then I&#x27;ve sprung for the real argon oil, and two drops of that makes my hair feel like silk.  At that rate I won&#x27;t have to buy another bottle of anything during my lifetime.  Hello clean lakes and rivers!</li>
            <li> Love the product,but the bottle was leaking and the solution was to take $4 off the purchase price. I have never had to deal with this kind of problem(damaged goods, Amazon as mediator)so maybe I should have questioned the solution. A new, full bottle would have seemed the correct solution(the oil is not cheap).</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I have damaged hair from 7 years of dying my hair dark, and then going from dark brown hair to blonde.  Works awesome.  My hair dryness has improved alot.  Best price I have found so far and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Amazing answer to color damaged hair. My stylist uses it at the salon and I loved the way my hair appeared and felt afterwards. I&#x27;m doing the same for it at home now. Highly recomend. A small portion in your palm will work magic. It arrived nicely packaged and quickly too.</li>
            <li> I have really damaged, coarse and dry hair that is always frizzy and unruly. After using Moroccan oil, my hair feels softer, and looks much less frizzy and damaged. I have tried my different hair products that claims to help but they dont usually make any difference to my hair, but this product actually tones down the puffiness and frizz and makes it look and feels silky. Even though i apply a generous amount, my hair does not get greasy at all. I know some reviews complain about the smell but it does not bother me at all, it usually goes away once it is absorbed into my hair. I will continue using it and trying other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> love this product. smell wonderful.worth every penny. does wonder for your thirsty mane</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite hair product. It smells amazing and provides hair with deep treatment. The quality of my hair has improved greatly since using this. I cannot recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> Sent product back.  It was leaking bc it was not factory sealed.  It smelled completely different than the original I had purchased at a salon. The consistency of it was wrong too. It was a scam. I got my money back.</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil is the best hair product I have found! I have long, naturally wavy, color-treated blonde hair and this oil keeps my hair smooth, silky and smells delicious!  I buy two bottles at a time!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick but baby fine.  Since it&#x27;s also processed, it gets very dull and frizzy and so I don&#x27;t wash it daily.  All other products made my hair look greasy and dirty by the next day, but Morrocanoil doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s still silky and soft and shiny and I absolutely love it!      I didn&#x27;t want to drop $40 on it at the salon, so thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! buy it even if you can only afford one styling product this is a must have!  two thngs i always have at home milk and morroccan oil You always have milk in your house, you should make this product one of your staples.  I would seriously die without it!</li>
            <li> i bought this after my stylist used it on me. of course you go to a salon and think whatever they used you have to get to recreate the magic.  So, I have it and use it.  It smells good.  I&#x27;m just not sure if it has made a difference.  And I wonder if olive oil would have been just as effective?  my scalp seems just as irritable as before.  So, i&#x27;ll keep trying it and hope to fall in love.</li>
            <li> Love Morocco oil, for my curly hair it&#x27;s perfect and smells great!</li>
            <li> I would bathe in it if I could! The fragrance is intoxicating and it does wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the best when you want your hair to look smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have been using Moroccanoil for 3 years and my ends stay healthier longer with this product, even after using a hair dryer and a curling iron almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly from the seller without issue.  Moroccan Oil has been a great product for me and I use it everyday.  I have naturally wavy hair which has a tendency to either be frizzy when styled in waves or when straightened... and it is very susceptible to humidity.  This product has greatly helped to keep the frizz and stray hairs away.  It has also helps keep my hair manageable and very soft to the touch.  Great product!</li>
            <li> When I received the Moroccanoil, half of it spilled in the box. When I smelled it- it smelled like cheap perfumed oil- not like real Moroccanoil. I have ordered it several times before and I know what the real Moroccanoil smells like and this was not it. Obviously, if the cap was loose in the first place somebody was messing with the product. The bottle should&#x27;ve been sealed. Amazon did refund me for the product though so that was nice.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried Moroccanoil I liked it. As the day went on I realized that though the product does shine my hair up nicely, it was the smell I was hooked on. It&#x27;s like a blend of suntan lotion, white amber and musk. It perfumes your hair in a subtle &#x27;Arabian Nights&#x27; kind of way that I haven&#x27;t found in any other shine product. I find it works much better if I rub a quarter sized dollop into my hair after a wash and condition it while it&#x27;s damp. I can see the shine on dry hair if I have a pulled back &#x27;do, but if my curly hair is just running wild, I need a whole lot of it to see a difference. At these prices, I&#x27;d rather not use a whole lot of it - LOL. I&#x27;m hoping to find a similar scented essential oil that I can just mix with a cheaper hair serum so I can have my scent fix without breaking the bank. All in all I like it  go to a hair supply store and smell it first to see if it&#x27;s your cup o tea.</li>
            <li> Great product and I love smell. This is the fastest shipping I have experienced yet with orders placed through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very curly and can get quite dry in the winter. This along with Paul Mitchell Skinny and Paul Mitchell Taming Spray keeps my hair feeling soft and holds the curls. My hairdresser calls it my secret &amp;#34;cocktail&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  It is an oil, but it doesn&#x27;t make your feel oily at all.  It smells awesome and it really keeps the frizz down on my natural curls. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I will buy this over and over and over again. I just wish it was available in a body spray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products to keep my coarse fly-away locks smooth and nothing else, regardless of price, has even come close.</li>
            <li> It adds shine to my hair that even my husband noticed.  Since you only need a small amount following each shampoo, a small bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and even when I flat iron it I still had a bunch of fly aways and it never felt soft. A friend of mine always has the smoothest softest looking hair so I asked what her secret was and she told me about Morrocan oil. I immediately bought some and have never been happier with a product and I have never gotten so many compliments on my shiny hair :-)</li>
            <li> excellent delivery. amazing product, for my blond and dry hair is perfect!!! I&#x27;m so addicted in it. is the best of all. Brazilian consumer :)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Leaves hair shiny and smells anazing! Must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil for about a month now and I am in love with it! I have fine blonde hair and I was concerned that it would weigh my hair down or make it greasy but I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did! I recently moved to DC from California and my hair is not equipped to deal with humidity at all. Mair hair is usually so ruined after being outdoors for 5 minutes it looks like I didn&#x27;t even shower and I have to pull it up immediately. Since I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil my hair looks fantastic - no frizz or flyaways. It makes your hair really shiny and smooth. The best part is that it lasts forever because I only use one small dab on wet hair. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for volume but I&#x27;m sure you can use with a volumizing product and it wouldn&#x27;t make your hair yucky. This is a great buy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Not heavy!  Works wonders on processed hair!  My hair is so much longer since I&#x27;ve been using it. I only wash my hair every other day and this is great.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  She has tried many different Argon oil based products but has found this one to be the best.  It works great for use with a straightening iron.</li>
            <li> At first I wasnt sure if it was going to work and was also concerned if it was overpriced.  I dry out my hair which this also is works great for..It seems a bit expensive but you don&#x27;t use a lot, Try it you will be happy. Not sure if this is good for fine thin straight hair, might make it greasy or weigh it down.. I have curly hair and I am always trying new creams to make my hair soft, curly with no frizz..This product does that. After a shower I put a small amount on my fingers and start at the ends and lightly through my hair. I still use a type of ty curling cream with it but the outcome is very different, its amazing and it conditions the hair at the same time. It smells not the best but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0049H26RA MOROCCANOIL The Original Oil Treatment 100ml/3.4 fl oz]] I love the produce for my hair but the main reason I buy it is for the horses.   I raise Peruvian show horses. I use this product and it is the best thing on the market for the horses manes and tails. I live in sandy soil and the mains and tails are dry and with out shine. I put it on them once a week and it keeps their mane and tails looking beautiful.   Thanks Pecan Valley Ranch</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it. There really is nothing out there that makes my hair look this good. However there are many fakes out there that look almost 100% real. The difference ultimately is in the oil itself the fake stuff is not as thick and lighter in color it also smells like baby oil slightly. Also the \\&quot;M\\&quot; on the front of the bottle/box is a darker orange and slightly grainy on the fake, where it should be lighter orange and smoother in appearance.  It is a shame that there is no guarantee for a real product here. I have just sent back my most recent purchase after being assured it was authentic  I remain sure it in fact is not.</li>
            <li> I love how this oil makes my curly, coarse hair feel and smell.  After washing my hair, I use three squirts to rub between my hands and then through the last 7 inches of hair, patting the remainder on the flyaways that halo my head.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the original and I much prefer it to the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version. I have long, fine, wavy hair (to my back bra strap). It is coloured and I do keratin &amp;#34;Brazilian blow out&amp;#34; treatments. I am prone to frizz, and I use this out of the shower on wet hair, and then as a styling aid on dry hair. I am otherwise super lo-fi in terms of hair styling and maintenance - I never blow dry, flat iron, curl, etc. This moisturizes - use it on ends rather than roots - it&#x27;s never greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4+ years!</li>
            <li> I have used both the Moroccan Oil and the other brand sold through Amazon.  The only notable difference is the smell (and the price).  I like both but I am not sure I like the scent of the Moroccan Oil so much better that I would continue to pay quite a bit more for this brand.    I have curly dry hair that soaks up this type of product like a sponge and still feels dry a few hours later.  I like to think this helps condition but it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure.  I will say that it makes it immediately shinier and less prone to frizz so I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed to open the box and only find the bottle of oil.  Understandably it would have a screw cap top for shipping, options, etc.  But there was NO pump dispenser included with the bottle.  So now I have this bottle sitting on my vanity and I&#x27;m contemplating how I will extra the oil without over doing it and without the help of a pump.  I&#x27;d recommend purchasing your moroccanoil somewhere that sells it with the pump feature - I know it exists!</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying that I am a man with long hair. I work out in the oil patch and am exposed to extream weather with drys out my hair. A woman recomended that I start using Moroccan oil and loved it from the first day. Help keeps my hair from drying out and the friz down.</li>
            <li> Love this product... the hair feels hydrated, smooth and shinny.... just a little on my hands and smooth over the hair is wonderful! I use every other day...</li>
            <li> LOVE WHAT THIS DOES FOR MY THIN AND MOST OF THE TIME FRIZZY HAIR. I HAVE COLOR TREATED HAIR AND MY HAIR TENDS TO BE ALITTLE FRIZZY AT TIMES AND JUST A DIME SIZE APPLIED TO TOWEL DRIED HAIR HELPS SO MUCH IN CONTROLLING AND SOFTENING MY HAIR. THE SMELL IS GREAT TOO. YES IT MAY BE ALITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT TO ME IT&#x27;S WORTH IT. I&#x27;LL KEEP ON ORDERING !</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. My hair was bleached and it was dry, and always had to use a lot of conditioner and masks to stay soft. With this oil conditioner was not needed, I´d just washed with shampoo and applyed three drops of oil in the hair still wet and ready! A frizz-free, silky and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I am an older adult and this product works great to keep my hair looking healthy. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in Dec. 2009 and wanted to wait a while to write a review and see how my hair will be after sometime .... the result was very good, sometimes this is the only product I use after washing my hair.... It made a big difference after all this months ... my hair is dry, curly and very thin, this oil defines my curls and takes away the frizz ... I absolutely recommended it!</li>
            <li> This is my #1 hair care product.  Can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE moroccan oil, dries my hair quicker and smells amazing. The only bad part is you can&#x27;t use too much or it will weigh your hair down!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BLEACHED HAIR AND IT DOES A GREAT JOB KEEPING THE FRIZZINESS AND DRYNESS AWAY  THIS IS THE 3RD BOTTLE I HAVE BOUGHT!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! A little goes a long way and it also helps to cut back on the drying time! Makes my thick and curly hair very shiny and smooth! :)</li>
            <li> I do love this product and the seller shipped it very fast and it was packaged nicely.  I have noticed that the more I use it though, the more my hair is weighed down.  So, I switch this product with another every few weeks so my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down.  But, overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> good, pump broke easy</li>
            <li> This product is used at my salon. I use it after my hair is dry to help with the frizzies. I&#x27;m very happy with how it works. This bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love Moronccan Oil, it makes my hair looks so shiny and healthy!  I have thick hair and it helps to calm it down some!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!! my hair feels so soft after using it. I use a flat iron and this definitely helps. I would not say it helps at all with static though. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because it does have a very very strong smell , it smells different once you put it in your hair than it smells in the bottle. It stays with your hair. So if you don&#x27;t like strong smells this would not be for you.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I brutally torture my hair with bleach, color, and lots of heat styling.  This product makes my hair so soft and shiny!! I never thought my hair would look so healthy after what I put it through. Moroccan Oil rocks!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful ! (Thought I already reviewed this )</li>
            <li> I have used and loved Moroccan Oil for years. I have really long hair and use maybe a nickel-sized dollop of it at any one time - too much and your hair can start looking greasy. Start by working it into the tips of your hair and then work upwards.</li>
            <li> Differences on the bottle with the one that I bought from the official moroccan oil online shop. So not sure if its original.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. My hairdresser had suggested it and it was $40 at her shop-much less here on Amazon. A little goes a long way-and my hair looks shinier and healthier-without being \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; like some other oils can make it.</li>
            <li> Well, after the hype surrounding this product, I had high hopes for my coarse curly hair and it being a match made in heaven.      Not so much.  Overall, it slightly weighed down my curl and made them a bit less ringlet like and more wavy.  The smell of the product is not great; it has a 1970s hair product aroma, so sort of a chemical undertone.  I definitely would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have thick hair that takes forever to blow dry, even when drying in layers, but this product has really helped to reduce the drying time.  My hair also tends to get brittle and this product keeps my hair soft and shiny.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, even though it is an oil.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damanged and this saved it.  This oil is AMAZING!!!!  If you had a hair service gone wrong or have dry hair or color your hair, therefore drying it out, this is a must have product!  Plus, it smells GREAT !!</li>
            <li> I take really short showers now that I use moroccanoil, I just skip conditioner all together. I&#x27;ve tried similar products they sell at make-up stores, but they made my hair greasy, of course, I have really fine, thin hair. Moroccanoil is a great after-shower detangler and it makes my hair really soft and smooth. My hair isn&#x27;t completely fly-away free, but it is getting better. I&#x27;ve noticed that when I dont use it my hair feels coarse and rough.</li>
            <li> i have oily, thin hair so i was sceptical when my hairdresser tried it on me.  it didn&#x27;t make my hair more oil, just soft and healthy.  also, it&#x27;s terrific in the winter to rub excess oil on dry skin.  i got chapped elbows every winter until i started using this and not a single dry patch all winter last year:-)</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, wavy hair that depends on serums to straiten and protect when blow drying. I had read about Moroccan Oil in New Beauty and In Style Magazine. The price is higher than most products but it&#x27;s well worth it. You use only a small amount for smooth, shinny and healthy looking hair. Friends and co-workers have all noticed and commented on my hair. And, the best part is there is no greasy feeling. In NO WAY does it weigh down your hair or makes it flat. Just soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> I learned about Moroccanoil through my beautician and when she ran out, I turned to amazon.  This product is amazing and keeps my hair looking healthy and fresh.  A little bit goes a long way.  If you experence dry hair, this product is made for you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you.  You get a lot of product for the cost.  You only have to use a small amount of the oil and it works great.  I have very fine hair and it is damaged from coloring it and from blow drying it every day.  My hair dresser used this on my hair and it eliminated the frizzies.  It is getting healthier everyday.  If you have fine hair like me, be careful not to use to much oil because I did that the other day (it was humid outside) and my hair ended up looking greasy.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper on amazon then ANYWHERE ELSE!  i use this in combination with the smoothing cream and its great.  weightless, smooths &amp; protects the hair, and can be used everyday.  I love this product and definitely recommend it you want something that isn&#x27;t full of harsh chemicals and leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have tight curly hair that needs a lot of moisture.  Moroccanoil is expensive, but it is thick for an oil and you do not need to use a lot at one time.  I like the shine it gives my hair and it helps detangle it.  I feel it is worth the money.  I bought a small bottle at a local salon first to see if I liked it and then ordered the larger bottle on-line.  The price is better if you buy it in the largest bottle available.  I shopped around and could not find a better price than amazon.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and dry hair due to years of flat ironing and coloring my hair. In addition, I am currently serving in Afghanistan and as you can imagine the water I bathe in is not the best. We chemically treat it to make it okay to shower with, so it smells like straight chlorine. I bought morrocan oil before I left the states to come out here and let me tell you my hair feels so good! It&#x27;s not back to how it was before i started coloring it but I can tell that it&#x27;s getting there. My hair usually breaks off on the ends very easily but since i started using morrocan oil my ends are managing to stay in tact resulting in having to get a trim less often. I&#x27;ve been completely happy with this product since the day I got it. It leaves my hair feeling protected, shiny, and healthy!</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil. It works wonders for my unruly, coarse and kinky curly hair. It smooths and tames, softens, and leaves my hair looking and smelling shiny, healthy and beautiful. There&#x27;s a lot of silicones in this particular product so people with fine hair or hair that needs weightless products should steer clear, and go with a product that&#x27;s more pure argan oil. My salon sells a bottle this size (maybe even smaller) for almost $50, so while it&#x27;s not a huge savings, it&#x27;s a great deal for someone who uses this product daily. The package arrived quickly and was nicely wrapped so the bottle wouldn&#x27;t accidentally open in transit, and it was in its original box and in perfect condition. Definitely worth it, would recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This product was just as described.  It shipped quickly and I received it very quickly.   I would recommend doing business with them.  Very professional.  Thank you very much for such a great product.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair silky and shiny. It also smells amazing and does not leave my hands feeling greasy. Best I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and so do several of my friends! A must buy especially if you color or flat iron your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Morrocianoil for over two years now and all I can say is \\&quot;What a great product!\\&quot;  All you need is a small drop worked into damp or already dry hair. Your hair will be shiny, soft and very  manageable.  It especially works well on humid days to help keep the frizzies at bay. I was buying it at my regular salon, but they never had the larger bottle in stock.  It&#x27;s definitely worth spending a bit more up  front and buying the 3.4 ounce size, as it will last quite a while. Moroccanoil does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Perfect product for anyone who colors, perms, or flatirons their hair. As a faux-blonde I rely on my Moroccan Oil to keep my hair soft and shiny. It also smells fantastic, which is just an added bonus. If your hair is dry and damaged, I would seriously recommend giving this hair oil a chance.</li>
            <li> Package arrived, safe and sound, earlier than promised, and the Moroccanoil it contained is doing nice things for my hair. The price was reasonable, too.  I&#x27;ll certainly deal with Salon and More again.</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment for your hair!</li>
            <li> I love this hair oil !!!! bought Moroccan oil at Wal-Mart.... not the same.  hair was oily and flat.  this is the real deal makes my dry course hair feel super healthy silky soft!!!  don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> the concentration of actual argan oil here is very low. you can get better products for this price. It&#x27;s basic serum mixed with a little bit of argan oil and a rat poison preservative... don&#x27;t get me wrong I still used it till it was done but I won&#x27;t waste my monet again</li>
            <li> It smells GREAT and works well on dry hair or if used when you&#x27;re getting your hair dried professionally, but for my needs it&#x27;s just OKAY.  I usually wear my hair curly - wash n&#x27; go. I put some in my hair when wet before I leave to go to work and by the time I get to work I feel like I need to put a lot more.  Still looking for the perfect product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Buy the bigger bottle! Trust me, you&#x27;ll use it. It&#x27;s near impossible to find products for my hair that will work without making my hair look greasy. This stuff works. You run a dime-size amount through damp hair. It made my hair look shiny and healthy. It also helped a lot with frizz. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, great shine, smell and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily. I&#x27;ve used many brands but this one delivers and I highly recommend it. Give it a chance I think you&#x27;ll agree!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the argan oil for my daughter who has very dry hair. I must say it has worked tremendously. The texture of her hair has changed dramatically. Its sucha great product that I have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I use Moroccan oil in the summertime to help smooth my VERY thick, naturally curly hair. I prefer to blow dry it straight and this product makes it smoother and silkier and tends to help the puffiness. I have long, thick hair - and usually I pour out a dime-size amount into my palm, rub it together in my hands and spread it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Does not help in high-humid temperatures, I have yet to discover something that will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone else commented that this product is like an expensive Frizz-Ease, however I will have to disagree. I found that Frizz-Ease tends to make my hair feel greasy and weighted-down, while Moroccan Oil does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disgruntlement about this product is that it is quite expensive for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> This oil is great if you have yourself some wild hair going on.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair daily and never have to roll my long hair as this puts so much body in it.  Anything left on my hands I rub on to my skin.  It is wonderful!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil a few months ago and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It makes your hair nice and shiny and my hair seems to finish blow drying much quicker when I&#x27;ve used this product. I am in my forties and color my hair frequently so it often appears dull. This oil seems to be one of the few products that will really make it smooth and shiny and this it does really well. I don&#x27;t notice my hair to be any easier to style or more bouncy or softer in texture and that is why I&#x27;m not giving it five stars. It seems to work more on the surface/appearance of my hair rather than penetrating the strands and changing the body or softness from within if that makes any sense. It is a good product and I will probably order it again unless I find some really great new hair product in the next few months. The bottle lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Finally, an oil treatment that doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or leave that greasy feeling when you run your hand through it. I have only been using this for a few weeks, but I&#x27;m a true believer. My hair is already softer and a lot easier to maintain and comb through. It also looks a lot healthier, which is great because the sun tends to dry mine out even while trying to protect it with a scarf or different \\&quot;leave-in treatment\\&quot;. This stuff smells nice and lingers without being too musky or strong. The price is high, but worth it because while it works, it also lasts a long time. You really only need a little every time you use it. I wish I knew about Morrocanoil sooner. Fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the product and couldn&#x27;t get it for any less through my hairdresser. So, great price, great poduct. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for hair! My sister &amp; I fell in love w/ it the first time our hair stylist used it on us. It is a bit expensive compared to similar products but my sister thought it was worth the price. It was good to find a deal on Amazon &amp; save a few bucks!</li>
            <li> I read about this product and then I bought it and I&#x27;m very happy, It&#x27;s works great!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lei acerca de este producto y entonces lo compre y estoy muy feliz, esto funciona grandioso!!!</li>
            <li> My coarse, dry hair loves this oil. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  I put it on my hair while wet and again on dry hair, after I flat iron.  I also use it to rub on my nails to soften my cuticles. I&#x27;ve tried many products for my hair and this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It makes my hair silky and smooth. I highly recommend it for anyone</li>
            <li> Apply it to dry hair and it gives a  great shine.  Just do not over use.  My hair is long, I use 3 pumps.  I also use this product on wet hair and it controls my frizz.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil for the past year and I just love it. One bottle lasted that long, and I recently just bought a second bottle. When I get out of the shower after washing my hair, I put a dime size into my hair. I let my hair air dry, and then just use my fingers to \\&quot;comb\\&quot; out my hair. This product keeps my hair feeling soft, keeps the frizzies away, and lets my natural waves look soft.</li>
            <li> Nothing&#x27;s better than this Moroccan brand Moroccan Oil for adding a shiny healthy frizz-free look to your hair! This was recommended to me by someone who processes her hair often, by dying her hair different colors frequently. She loves the way this product keeps her hair looking great...and it does! She recommends the shampoo and conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t process my hair that much, but it is very curly and difficult to keep from kinking up in humidity when I&#x27;ve styled it straight. I literally use only one drop, after straightening it and I&#x27;m good to go for the rest of the day! One bottle will last forever! I have gotten so many compliments of how nice my hair looks, even from strangers.&lt;br /&gt;Another couple of things I have to tell you is that it has the most wonderful fragrance, and It&#x27;s great in a warm soak in the tub! Skin feels soft and lightly fragrant in time for a great night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan or Moroccan Oil treatments.  It seems to be all the rage in beauty products right now and I&#x27;ve used everything from the Joico color therapy serum which is the oil in it(about $20 a bottle), this product (about $40), Organix Penetrating  Moroccan Oil (around $7), and pure Moroccan Oil (anywhere from $20-40).  While logically my favorite is the pure oil, let me state that if you are on a budget you should try the Organix Penetrating Moroccan Oil!!  The ingredients of this Moroccan Oil product and the Organix product are nearly identical but the Organix oil is over 30 dollars less!    These are the Moroccan Oil brand ingredients (3.4 oz bottle):    Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Butylphenyl Methyl Propional, Argania Spinoza Kernel Oil (Aragan Oil), Linseed (Linum Usitatissimum) Extract, Fragrance Supplement, D &amp; C Yellow 11, D &amp; C Red 17, Coumarin, Benzyl Benzoate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.    These are the Organix brand ingredients (3.3 oz bottle):    Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, C12 15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylphenyl Methlyproprional, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil (Argan), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract (Linseed), Parfum, Yellow 11, Red 17    You make the call!  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I just wanted to let everyone know that there is a similar product out there for much less!</li>
            <li> I love this product, well shoot, I love almost all the M.O. products!! But this one is the one I use the most. I NEVER get my hair wet without putting this in my hair, either before or after. If I go swimming, Ill put this in my hair and it protects it from the chlorine. If I get out of the shower, this is the first thing that goes in my hair. Ive tried everything from biosilk to that knock off argan oil junk, even CHI. This is THE BEST product as far as oils go. A small dime size lasts even all of my hair, just past my lower back and very thick wavy hair. You just put some in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together like you have lotion and then put it in your hair starting at the tips and working your way up (not on the scalp-unless you want the greasy look! lol). Its not even that expensive if you consider how long it lasts, I bought a 3.4 oz bottle and its been 10 months and I still have some left.     ___________  Also, just a side note, I donated my hair about 2 years ago and have been growing it out ever since and it seems to have grown like a weed by using M.O. products. We use the hydrading mask, intense curl cream, shine spray, and of course the actual moroccan oil. I have super sensitive skin and I notice that I dont break out from using these products, but the mask can be heavy, so I wear my hair up at night and wash my hair at least 2x/wk. Since the 2 years, my hair has grown at least 2 feet, I get it cut frequently and loose about 4 inches every quarter, so...yeah, use this product if youre trying to grow your hair out ladies!! Cheers to sexy beautiful hair!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Moroccan Oil! I went to get a trim and the lady cut 5 inches off - I researched how to help my hair grow and one suggestion was this product. My hair has grown and strengthened immensely! I&#x27;ve almost been using for an entire year (same bottle!!!!!) and today is my first day with out it (forgot it at home) and I can&#x27;t believe the difference. My hair, that I&#x27;ve never dyed before, is so very dry and dull without this product. I recommend it to EVERYONE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 5 stars for me because there is nothing I dislike about this product. It is very light on your hair and soaks in quickly never leaving an oily layer. It has a very attractive light scent and my hair is incredibly soft and shiny after an application.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent choice buying the Morrocan Oil Hair Treatment. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the results. I definitely recomend.</li>
            <li> Have always loved morro can hair oil..always go back to it!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Every woman should have such an oil. The result is immediate. I prefer to spend it as dry as a leave-in. As you pass the hair you already feel looser, thin and soft, and the delicious fragrance and smooth, not bored. It is great for split ends!</li>
            <li> I learned about this product from a friend. I don&#x27;t have much to add that hasn&#x27;t already been written. I have hypothyroidism which has caused my hair to become dry and coarse. I absolutely love this stuff. My hair is softer and shiny. It never looks greasy or feels weighed-down. It is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find this product all over the internet, so I did a lot of research before deciding to order from this company through Amazon. I am very pleased and will definitely order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Literally became addicted to this stuff. I love the smell it&#x27;s so different &amp; makes my hair look very healthy without too much shine.</li>
            <li> very light and airy..  feels as if nothing is on my hair but it still provides the shine and moisture  not a big fan of the smell tho...  but the product is awesome!!</li>
            <li> this hair oil is not as great as advertised...if it is not for the aroma..I would not be using this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I tried to many products to make my hair shine, but they all made it oily looking. NOT good. This is the first product which made my hair look amazing and no grease. Nothing. I feel like a girl from Shampoo Add: looks brilliant and light and healthy. I dont know how anybody can give this product 1 star. I would give it 10 stars if i could. Its expensive, but its worth it. Totally! LOVE it!!!!!</li>
            <li> A little pricey but it works well.  The way it makes my hair feel and look, is just amazing  Absolutely a must have! You will feel the difference right at first use.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels, but not how it smells! I&#x27;d use it more often if it had less of a patchouli/musky scent. It&#x27;s like taking my hair to the black-light poster section of a head shop.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is soooo good I could drink it (not really but you know what I mean).&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft, tangle free, smooth and smelling delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Usually I buy a hair product- use 1/2 (if that) and then it sits in my medicine cabinet for years until I get the urge to try it out again- but not Moroccan Oil- I have probably gone through about 4 bottles in the past 2 years- and I will keep buying it for the rest of my life. Nothing makes my naturally wavy (yet easily straightened) hair look so incredible. I can put it in wet hair and air dry for a sexy beachy wavy look or I can put it in after a blow dry to make my straight hair a little more sleek and tame down those fly away frizzies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could buy a gallon of this stuff I would!</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff! Calms the frizzies, and softens the style without adding ant weight.Received the purchase in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I have tried the garnier oil treatment and wasnt sure what to expect . It made my hair feel great,soft and managiable. I love Garnier and didnt know what to expect because it was a oil . but the oil treatment made my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I felt smooth on my hair when I used it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  Hard to find.  Price isn&#x27;t much different from retail.  Lasts quite a while and has easy dispenser.</li>
            <li> Bought the mask, shampoo and oil, product is amazing and smells so good. All girls should buy it, no doubt</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have fine thin hair.  You use only about 1/2 a drop. Yes I said drop. It makes my hair feel wonderful and believe it or not easier to manage.  But just the smallest amount.  My sister has great hair and she only uses 1 drop. I have to use lots of mousse on my hair and I can now and the styling is much easier. It is hard to explain but I have never seen or used a product like this. I would suggest you share a bottle with someone because it is expensive. (Amazon has the best price) This stuff will last me at least two years at the rate I am using it.</li>
            <li> I am a hair product junkie and this just didn&#x27;t quite give me a fix.  It&#x27;s basically Frizz-ease with some added Argan oil.  I was expected a higher concentration of the Argan oil, but it&#x27;s 5th on the list of ingredients - a fair amount, but not for what you are paying. (the top 5 ingredients of any item are basically what make the product) If something is going to be called &#x27;Moroccan Oil&#x27;, you&#x27;d expect it to be just that, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very smoothing (hence the silcones at the top of the list of ingredients).  Silicones will build on the hair and will eventually have to be stripped with a detoxing shampoo to remove the build-up.  I have virgin naturally curly bi-racial hair with a fine texture (think R&amp;B singer Mya).  Silicone build-up on curly hair can be the devil so curlies beware. The smell is not too bad. Kind of musky. Just glad that I purchased through Amazon and got a great deal (50% of the normal price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it Will suffice for a quick fix for minor frizz, but definitely not a &#x27;treatment&#x27;.  For that, I highly recommend Eden Allure.  They have 100% pure Argan oil available and it doubles as skin care. (not affiliated-just a lover of natural products) Speaking of which, Moroccal oil has color additives (D&amp;C Yellow 11 and Red 17).</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and a little frizzy.  I read about this making hair more manageable.  Even though it is adverstised as \\&quot;Dry Oil\\&quot; it can make your hair look greasy if not used sparingly.  I like to use it on damp hair and then finish styling.  It keeps hair from tangling.  It smells fantastic and does make your hair shiny.</li>
            <li> What a great hair product, absorbs quickly without feeling oily and makes your hair feel silky soft and look super shiny!!!</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and was introduced to Moroccan Oil by my stylist. It is great at moisturising my hair without weighing it down. It also leaves my hair shiny for days and it smells great. I wish they made products for the body too! A little goes a long way-generally I need only about a dime size amount for my short hair. I use it when drying my hair to protect from heat damage and again a few days later for some added sheen. I highly recommended this product as well as the accompanying deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry hair. I have been using this product before i blow dry my hair after washing (sometimes as a scalp or leave-in treatment), and it makes ALL the difference. A little goes a long way. My hair is moveable, shiny, and beautiful! It was recommended to me by my hairdresser. This is truly a great treatment for hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist turned me on to Moroccan Oil because I flat iron my hair almost every day.  I can totally tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.  With it, my hair dries faster, and is much more manageable.  Flat ironing is quicker and the hair has a much more light, feel to it.  I tried other, even more expensive oil products, and they just don&#x27;t compare to this.  Love it!</li>
            <li> If you are an African American woman (or any ethnic woman) who has had RELAXERS and are going through the RELAXED to NATURAL transition? Do NOT waste your time buying this product unless you have the time, money, and patience to deal with your hair.  This is NOT the product to use just a \\&quot;dime sized amount\\&quot; with when transitioning from relaxed to natural.  I personally have thick hair to begin but when I did get relaxers, moisturizing was nothing and my hair held moisture just fine.  In my current attempt to go \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot;, my hair is a giant sponge and this product does not and WILL not do anything luxurious for the new growth that is coming in like wild fire.  The moisturizing has gotten worse and I find myself needing to moisturize TWICE a day and use more product than I have ever used :( My hair looks nothing like the sleek, shiny, and healthy hair that I have when I walk out of the salon after using this product.  I&#x27;m not speaking for ALL women but mostly for those w/ thick, coarse hair AND for those who are in the relaxed to natural transitioning phase.  I also have the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and even those don&#x27;t add the moisture that it claims to give. (At least not going through the transitioning phase).  Now do NOT get me wrong, these products work WONDERFUL when your hairstylist is putting her hands to your hair and has all of the proper tools to get your hair bone straight and ultra glossy but, if you&#x27;re attempting this at home?  You may wanna find a better oil moisturizer that is truly going to help you through the transition :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Really adds volume and shine to your hair.  Also great in controlling fly away hair.  Definitely recommend it to anyone with dry or limp hair.</li>
            <li> For anyone with complaints about possibly getting fake Moroccan Oil online - my guess is it&#x27;s factory related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, and oil a few months ago at a salon - smells like heaven, so indulgent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then purchased the same items at the same salon today - smells/feels like completely different products with hardly any fragrance :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to determine the differences - I tested the older vrs newer product on each hand, and the older product was clearly more fragrant. The smell/consistency on the newer was just off, not thick and creamy as before. I also noticed the older bottle states, &#x27;made in Canada&#x27; - and the new states, &#x27;made in Israel&#x27; ...which leads me to believe they have production in both places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, this issue is not isolated to just orders placed online, but to salons as well, and, again, appears factory related.</li>
            <li> This is the SINGLE best purchase I have ever made in my life. Smells decadent, but doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;hang\\&quot; in your hair... the smell eventually fades when it dries so it isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Even my mother who is allergic to most smelly lotions, hair products and perfumes loooooves this oil. The oil pours out about the consistency of war m honey and soaks right into your hair without leaving it feeling greasy at all. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, and the ONLY downside I can see to this product is that my hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl as well as it used to before I used the product, but if I strip my hair, I&#x27;m sure it will still curl... it&#x27;s just made my hair just too damn healthy!</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my hair like was exhausted ,dry .i did open the Amazon web-site and i find with a review coments (of course) the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment 3.4 Oz Bottle with Blue Box  product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought and maked a order and begining use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Suprise-give to me a excellent result.Im using now the 3rd bottle.&lt;br /&gt;If some of a women looking to change situation with a damage and treatment hair -that is the correct product and mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy, fine hair that I prefer to straighten, and on top of that, I color my hair, including two panels that get bleached and re-dyed purple. I spent the first 25 years of my life living in Atlanta, now I&#x27;m in New York City, so I know a few things about both damaged hair AND humidity.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of high-end hair products out there, in addition to a lot of drug store lines, and Moroccan Oil is the only thing that makes a truly noticeable difference in both my hair&#x27;s texture and humidity resistance without making it a greasy mess. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks (I didn&#x27;t believe the hype, so it took me a while to try it), but even after one use, I was thoroughly impressed. My hair just FELT healthier and blew out easier, which is something of a feat when you consider all the damage I&#x27;ve done to it. Plus it smells nice and you only need a little bit of product, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with a Pureology product that helps repair bleached hair, and my results have been great.</li>
            <li> I have used MoroccanOil before, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it from Amazon.  It&#x27;s cheaper here than at the salon; always a bonus.  I use it every morning before I blowdry my hair and it helps my hair feel soft and smooth.  Only use a TINY, TINY bit; a little goes a long way.  If you use too much, your hair will be oily.  The downfall was that the bottle leaked in the shipping box.  I only lost a few drops of oil but the mess was huge since it&#x27;s an oil-based product.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccanoil, works wonders!    ...However, shipping a little glass bottle in the middle of winter in a cardboard box with just paper wrapping is not the best way to keep the product intact.  My bottle (which was a gift) arrived leaking, and since it&#x27;s a liquid I can&#x27;t exchange it for a new bottle.    So 5 star product, but it loses 3 for terrible shipping and not being able to exchange a leaking product.</li>
            <li> My daughter encouraged me to order Moroccanoil, and although I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks, I definitely can see a difference in my hair . . . it&#x27;s shiny, healthier looking, and the best part is that it seems to have \\&quot;locked\\&quot; my new hair color in better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  Plus, it smells fantastic . . . I&#x27;m thinking about using it ALL OVER!</li>
            <li> I always love buying Moroccan Oil from Amazon. I find when I don&#x27;t use it my hair becomes dull and damaged. Don&#x27;t know if it does wonders frizz, but I have curly hair and it&#x27;s all I use to keep a natural effortless curly (messy) look. Love it! My hair smells great too!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Can&#x27;t be without it.  Age and chemicals have caused my hair to be less than smooth and shiny.  This product makes my hair smooth again,</li>
            <li> O produto é excelente. Basta uma gotinha e os cabelos ficam brilhantes. Meus cabelos tem tinta e luzes e não é qualquer óleo que dá bons resultados. Estou usando faz um mês e estou muito satisfeita com ele. Comprarei novamente. Indico.</li>
            <li> This product has never let me down.  It makes all of the difference for my hair, but is also great for all hair types. I&#x27;ve used it for several of my foster children and got complements from their bio parents.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. I use it after every shampoo and it helps to keep my long hair from getting dried out.</li>
            <li> I had heard about this product everywhere and I really wanted to try it but I was disapointed. I have used Biosilk for years and loved it but I wanted to try something new. I wish I had  never wasted my money on this product. I feel like I had to use a lot more to see a difference but then it  made my hair look greasy. I didn&#x27;t like the smell either. Can&#x27;t wait to go back to Biosilk!</li>
            <li> i have been using this stuff for years! It is definitely worth the price. I have tried other brands and shampoo with Moroccan Oil in it but nothing works as good. My hair is naturally wavy and can frizz in damp weather. A tiny dime size amount works like a charm. Definitely NON Greasy too!</li>
            <li> I tried this based on a recommendation from my hair stylist.  This really helps my thick, dry (colored) hair.  No heavy oiliness...just smooth, silky hair.</li>
            <li> This product help,protect the hair! It also makes your hair smell so well! Adds shine to hair as well! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for your hair with styling and control.  Fine hair needs the one for fine hair.  I ordered the wrong one but will use it anyway, just less of it.</li>
            <li> (Same positive comments others have described - that&#x27;s why I bought it!) Many times no need for anything else. Can be to scenty if you apply too much.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment adds great texture to hair and smells wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it oily.</li>
            <li> Loved this Moroccan Oil!</li>
            <li> Usually on Amazon, you can view the back of the bottle to read the ingredients and here you cannot. I always compare with an authentic product before I buy online and if I&#x27;m unable to read it online, I do not buy it.</li>
            <li> This winter my normally oily hair decided to stay oily at the scalp but become very dry and lifeless on the ends. An attractive combination, I know. Enter Moroccanoil products... I use the hydrating masque as my conditioner every time I shampoo. I also use the Moroccanoil hair treatment with every shampoo (on damp hair prior to drying). I also sometimes put some oil on the ends of my hair when it&#x27;s dry. It makes it soft, shiny and smell oh so good.</li>
            <li> Not worth $42 for a tiny bottle. It comes in a huge box and feels heavy but the bottle is just thick glass to hold less oil. The bottle is extremely small. Smells nice though.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  use it every day...</li>
            <li> This is a non greasy hair product that makes your hair feel very nice and does not require any other hair product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have naturally curly hair and it gets unruly and dry.  When I put this on my hair it tames the monster and prevents dryness.  Plus since my hair is not dry its growing .. I think my hair has grown 6 inches since I started using this 4 years ago</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Reccomended by a stylist 3 years ago and have used it ever since, along with Morrocan Oil Curl Control Cream. I&#x27;ve got solid white, funky, old guy hair and the combination of these two after I shower makes my hair look much more in control, softer, and thicker. No in shower conditioner needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year when my hair care professional first used it on my hair.  My hair had been damaged by blow drying, curling irons, relaxers, coloring, and age and was dry and brittle.  I have short, naturally curly and soft mixed race hair.  She started using Moroccanoil and recommended that I use it to speed the hair drying process. I bought some from home, along with Kuene (sp?) Gloss.  I use the Moroccanoil after shampooing and the Kuene (sp?) Gloss after flat ironing.  My hair looks healthy and shiny and feels so soft.  I don&#x27;t get frizz and, best of all, I haven&#x27;t used a relaxer in over a year.</li>
            <li> Brilliant. i didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon, however. Hands-down this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair has been dyed pretty consistently now for about two years. It&#x27;s long, wavy, and tends to dry and frizzy at the ends. A quick application of moroccanoil after I wash my hair has completely done away with the dryness. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair! it feels and smells great. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey but you only need a small amount. Just rub a a small drop together in your hands and apply all thru&#x27; wet hair. I leave mine to dry naturally.</li>
            <li> This item is counterfeit. The first time I purchase Moroccanoil was from a salon. It smelled amazing but not too overpowering it also did wonders for my hair! When I received my Moroccanoil from Amazon something was definitely wrong. The bottle was leaking when I opened the package. The smell oh it was horrid (a mix of babyoil, ban de soleil, and chemicals), so overpowering that I thought I was going to vomit. I knew something was off and didn&#x27;t even think twice about putting that stuff into my hair. Since I already had an almost empty bottle that I bought from a legit salon I started to compare labels. The Moroccanoil purchased from Amazon was totally off the M on the front had an outline which the real bottle does not. On the back the most obvious is the fact that the counterfeit Moroccanoil doesn&#x27;t have the Registered Trademark and Patent on it. Do not purchase this product, the Moroccanoil website has a salon locator that shows you nearest salons with their product. There&#x27;s really no point in risking putting unknown chemicals into your hair.</li>
            <li> I am completely appalled that this company has the nerve to sell fake Moroccan Oil. When I purchased this item, a quarter of the bottle leaked in the container. I called and they refunded me the price for the spilled oil. Little did I know, until late, that the registered trademark symbol, which is located on all REAL Moroccanoil products was missing off the box of my product.     I contacted Amazon, but they failed to address the issue. Looking at the comments of other people, it appears that they are aware that this company has been selling this fake product and yet they refuse to do anything about it. I guess when they get tired of refunding back the money through their A to Z Guarantee claim, then they will do something about this company who is obviously a joke.     In other words, DO NO BUY THIS PRODUCT from Above ALL BEAUTY! It is not real.</li>
            <li> This product is full of artificial colourings and brought me up in spots. There are silicones in it which give a bit of a smooth finnish, but I can achieve that with cheap hair serum! As for it&#x27;s 5% Argan oil content?! At the price of this stuff I&#x27;d rather use pure argan oil, which is all argan oil &amp; none of the additives that leave my face, neck and scalp red and prone to break outs....</li>
            <li> I have curly/frizzy hair, but when I use a little Moroccanoil in my hair, the texture feels so healthy and smooth. My curls are defined and soft to the touch. The only problem I have is when I don&#x27;t wash my hair the next day, the texture feels funny when I wet it. The product works best right after shampooing.</li>
            <li> After stumbling across this product on Amazon, and seeing all of the amazing reviews, I decided Moroccanoil to spend the $35+ and give it a try.  I went by a local salon, and they said they did not sell it, but that they had a couple of DermOrganic Argan oil treatment free samples sizes for me to try. Naturally, I gladly accepted since it was free.  I have to say, I was REALLY impressed with the DermOrganic Argan oil - for all of the reasons that are listed in the Amazon reviews of their competitor product Moroccanoil.  It made my hair healthy, shiny, and very managable.  My hair almost felt hydrated when dry, yet very smooth.      Still, memories of phenomenol Amazon reviews of Moroccanoil still danced in my head, so about three weeks ago when my samples ran out, I purchased and received my first bottle of Moroccanoil from Amazon.      Honestly, I&#x27;ve been using the MoroccanOil product for 3 weeks now and I am not in the least bit impressed, and surprised by my disappointment.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair nearly as shiny and soft as the DermOrganic Argan Oil samples from the local salon. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel hydrated at all - rather it just feels like I have product on it. My hair actually looks a little dull!  In fact, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a step down from BioSilk (what I&#x27;ve used for 3 years) so far.      Even though I still have a lot of MoroccanOil left, I actually went back to the salon tonight, thanked them again for the samples they gave me before, and purchased a larger bottle of the DermOrganic Argan oil treatment to use instead.  (As a side note, DermOrganic costs about the same.  I&#x27;m a penny pincher, and normally I would just finish the product I have to save money.  The fact I bought DermOrganic even though I still have so much of the MoroccanOil left is definitely saying something about my experiences with both products.)        Given all of the wonderful reviews of Moroccanoil, and the fact that most of the negative reviews of Moroccanoil were from people who had received a counterfeit from Amazon, I almost wonder if the bottle I received from Amazon this month is a counterfeit also.  If I had more time to look into it further, I would - just out of curiosity and principal at this point.  However, I work long hours and unless I get some free time, I&#x27;m going to keep using the DermOrganic argan oil treatment, since I&#x27;m really happy with that product and does everything that the reviewers describe of Moroccanoil.    All in all, I hope other buyers have better experiences than I.  If not, it may be worth trying DermOrganic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I will not go a day without using moroccanoil. my hair has never been this healthy. one thing to keep in mind-- only use a small amount. thus, one bottle goes a long way</li>
            <li> I always apply a little to my wet just washed hair.  After brushing through and blow drying it feels really soft.  My favorite part is the smell.  Its incredible ! It doesnt replace a good shampoo &amp; conditioner but is a great leave in conditioner.  Hair feels less dry and frizzy.  Its also non greasy.</li>
            <li> I was buying this at salons for $60 a bottle! Glad that I found it here instead. It is great to get rid of those little fly-away hairs and it leaves your hair really silky and soft. And, it smells good too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! It keeps my ends moist without an oily feeling. My curls look so good when I put product in before I use my ceramic iron. And the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> A stylist friend recommended this product and I finally bought it expecting to be wowed with super soft and healthy feeling curly hair.  I have dry long hair (mixed regular and coarse curly and beaded) which I iron and color and although I use lots of conditioner and only wash once a week, the ends are starting to break.  I used the Moroccan Oil last night and was shocked to see that it actually made my wild crazy hair even wilder and frizzier and drier than before!  I&#x27;m taking it back and getting a refund.  I personally find putting a good conditioner on my hair after washing it, when my hair is still damp, and then leaving it in and letting it air dry seems to work best.  Also the Olive Oil Masque sold at Regis works well as does Redken Heat Glide.  Good luck to everyone fighting the frizzies!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is fragile, dry and frizzy.  Since I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil products, my hair is much healthier and more manageable.  I mix some of the Moroccanoil Oil Treatment with the Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream and apply to my hair after I shower making sure to brush it through.  After I am done drying and styling my hair, I apply Moroccanoil Glimmer Shine Spray and brush it through too.  The result is beautiful, shiny, healthy, manageable hair.  I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> My first introduction to this particular product was when my hair stylist used it.  I asked, \\&quot;What is it and how can I get a bottle for myself?\\&quot;  But before I asked him, I tried finding it on my own, by going to several beauty supply stores, only to find an imitation called argan oil.  Let me tell you, it is not the same.    If you are looking for a light weight product, that does not weigh your hair down, and smells good too, then this is it!  It is far better than the other oils and creams you are accustomed to, and you only need to apply a small amount.  I would also recommend buying the gold glimmer shine spray to top it off...My hairstylist uses this too.    It is a bit pricey compared to other oils, but investing into a product that is going to give you long lasting results such as shine, body and bounce, is well worth the money.  And to add, it is not your typical hair oil, which is why you will not find it in beauty supply stores.    Enjoy the product!</li>
            <li> Love the smell more than anything. Nice and light oil and you only need very little for your hair. Little expensive though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it daily. It \\&quot;calms\\&quot; frizzies better than other products and though it&#x27;s more expensive than silicone-based shine and anti-frizz solutions, you only need a wee bit so it lasts!</li>
            <li> The oil eliminates all my tangles and smells amazing. The only downside is the cost.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get in Thailand and my wife prefers it to anything else.</li>
            <li> Gives dry hair luster and shine without being greasy.</li>
            <li> My daughter and i have long hair, we use dryers and curling irons constantly so we need a product that tames our dry fly aways.  This product is great and smells wonderful. I use Redkin All Soft cream conditioner (i use a tiny bit and leave it in after i am completely done shampooing and conditioning with a different product) then i put on the Morrocan Oil and difuse, style and go. I get compliments often on how shiny and healthy it looks.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and have frizzy hair that sometimes looks fried after using a straightner.  I&#x27;ve used over the counter \\&quot;frizzy hair\\&quot; oils in the past but when I saw this product on Pinterest I thought I&#x27;d give it a try!  I love it!  It works way better than my other oil products and has a great smell.  It&#x27;s a little pricy but worth the money. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think that adding oil to your hair right after you washed it would be a good thing.  I had to try it to believe it.  A small sized amount rubbed into your hair will leave it managable, shiny and very healthy looking.  It also doesnt make your hair greasy which I thought it really would do.  I personally use the light oil as i have thin hair.  This is an incredible product and if you ever wondered how people get their hair looking so fantastic....the are using a product with Argan oil.  Moroccan Oil hair treatment is great for my thin hair and great for my wifes hair.  We use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST thing, hands down, I have run across, at this point, for your hair! It&#x27;s like magic and once you try it, you HAVE to have it! Trick is to only use a very small amount (like a dime in your palm) at a time and rub it on your hair. Your hair is transformed to the softest, shiniest it has EVER been; just like you were at the salon! It is like a secret people have been keeping!</li>
            <li> My hair has been looking dull for quite awhile. This has made my hair so much shinier....love, love, love it! Would recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Smells good makes my hair soft but I wouldnt say it&#x27;s any better than the Silkease I have used for years which is less than half the price. Nice change though.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but this is very expensive for what you get. Sort of like Biosilk or many other smoothing agents, but with nourishing properties, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair quite as shiny, so I use a little of each now.</li>
            <li> I live and breathe by this product. I have tried others but none compare. This makes my very unmanageable hair silky and shiny. My hair is very long and dry and this oil is the only thing That really works.</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance. Clean scent...not floral or fruity and the pump dispenses the perfect amount needed to moisturize the ends of my hair before blow drying. Makes hair super smooth and stops the fly aways and frizzy look.</li>
            <li> This does work REALLY well and is not at all greasy. I htink it does dry faster too. BUT it smells like MUSK! I didn&#x27;t know what when I bought it. The smell is not overwhelming, but its there enough to cause me to have headaches if I am not careful about how much I use. So if you sensitive to smell, skip it. If not, definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this at my hairdressers. I was a little concerned because she used only this product and my curly, dry, frizzy, heat damaged hair usually needs at least three- a leave in conditioner, styling cream, and something to protect it from heat styling. With just this one product my hair was so much smoother and felt so soft and looks shinier than it has since i was child. Even after I washed it, it still felt more conditioned than usual. I had to buy it for myself. After a week of using it I&#x27;m still in love with it and I&#x27;m telling all of my friends about it.I use only one drop for my shoulder length hair and it&#x27;s not oily at all in my hair. This one bottle should last me at least 5 months.  I normally can&#x27;t use the really nice hair products because I&#x27;m allergic to soy and almonds, but I think this product is more than comparable to those other products. I&#x27;m going to order the hydrating mask for that extra burst of hydration in the summer!!</li>
            <li> I admit that this product is good but it&#x27;s certainly not the best product out there for what it does.  I purchased a bottle of Moroccanoil about a month ago after much debate because the concept of adding oil to keep my hair soft and frizz free is not new to me. I am currently using Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and love the product but I finally broke down and decided to give Moroccanoil a try because of all the great reviews here and on the internet.     When I received the Moroccanoil I decided to put the product to the test to see what it can do, so after washing and towel drying my hair I divided my hair into two pig tails and used the Moroccanoil on one side and Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream on the other side. I then allowed my hair to air dry (as I usually do) and compared the results.      The result was there was not a noticeable difference between the two sides, basically both sides of my hair were soft and frizz free.    My second test was to use the Moroccanoil by itself, with no Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream at all.  I washed and towel dried my hair, applied only the Moroccanoil and then allowed my hair to air dry. The result was some of my hair was frizzy, other parts were oily looking and yet other parts were soft and frizz free.  I decided to repeat this test again later in the week under the assumption that I perhaps I used too much oil or didn&#x27;t spread it out enough but the ended up with the same results.    The last test I tried was to use the Moroccanoil with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream together which resulted in my hair being frizz free, and not oily.       The problem I have with Moroccanoil is most of the time it seems to work well only when combined with Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream and when I am able to finally get this product to work by itself the results are similar to Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream.       Other disadvantages I have found with Moroccanoil is the glass jar and the control factor when you pour out the oil.  Becauseit&#x27;s liquid oil (unlike oil in a cream base) I found that it&#x27;s easy to pour the product out too quickly.  Also the Moroccanoil is not something I have found for sale other than on the internet.     My conclusion is for MY hair the Moroccanoil doesn&#x27;t spread well by itself and when it does it requires the aid of another product.  The results are similar to a product I currently already use (Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream), is not a better price, is harder to use and is not readily available for purchase.     I&#x27;ll be sticking to my Fredrick Fekkai Glossing Cream.</li>
            <li> I have hard to manage hair, and this stuff is awesome. It really does add moisture and help smooth it out. It can make your hair to soft, so maybe every other day usage is best.</li>
            <li> After my stylist used this stuff on my color-treated hair in her shop, I was hooked!  All the claims are true- leaves my hair smooth and shiny, dries quicker, and smells heavenly. A little pricey, but you use such a tiny amount that the bottle should last a long time. I shopped around for it, and Amazon.com was where I found the best price, and free shipping too!</li>
            <li> Finally, something that actually WORKS!  My hair has never felt this silky or stayed frizz-free for so long!  It seems to be expensive, but it&#x27;s not really, a little goes a long way.  The scent is very nice, not overpowering at all and my husband loves it:)</li>
            <li> Hate to be a naysayer, but I don&#x27;t see what the hype on this product is.  I have curly hair and it did nothing to enhance the sheen or manageability of my hair.  I gave the full bottle away to a relative after trying it twice.</li>
            <li> This is a excelente product , I am satisfied with the purchase and with the seller , I recomend it !</li>
            <li> There are many different brands of argan oil out there, but this by far is the best one!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other cheaper brands, and it isnt the same.&lt;br /&gt;This is high quality stuff that will make your hair feel and look amazing, it really repaired my hair and since I&#x27;ve tried other products that weren&#x27;t as good, I&#x27;m switching back to this because I realized just how great it was. The price truly reflects the quality</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have been using it on &amp; off for the past couple of years.  Makes my hair shiny and more manageable and now with the pump that comes with it, it makes it so much easier to apply the right amount.  You only need very little to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing. Fake! Don&#x27;t waste your money. Definitely don&#x27;t give it to these crooks.</li>
            <li> I love how luxurious my hair looks and feels when I use this.  The shine is incredible.  I also use the cream conditioner.  I am a Moroccan fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what came in this bottle, but I&#x27;m QUITE sure it was NOT Moroccan Oil.  Do not order.</li>
            <li> I have think fine hair and it is terrific. It will not weigh your hair down. I have used it a year now. Will not change.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair and straighten all the time, then this product is for you.  It will keep her hair frizz free in any weather!!  Also keep breakage at bay; until your next hair cut.  AMAZING, and work the price!</li>
            <li> I have very long and dry hair. I use this product before i blow dry my hair(sometimes as a scalp or leave-in treatment), and it makes ALL the difference. A little goes a long way. My hair is moveable, shiny, and beautiful! It was recommended to me by my hairdresser, and I must say - WOW! I swear by it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. It smooth&#x27;s my hair and gives it a beautiful shine without a heavy weight or oily feeling. I also rub my hands across my face and use the product it to remove my facial make-up! I have dry skin so it is perfect for me. I run a warm wash cloth over my face and the Moroccan Oil removes all of my make-up without harsh soaps or chemicals. It also smells delicious.</li>
            <li> This oil is a fabulous product to add a lovely sheen to the hair. It brings out blonde highlights wonderfully, and smoothes any dry ends.</li>
            <li> The product I received was a fake, I returned it.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and what came in the correct bottle was not my Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> I am an African-American female with very thick hair. I use this product on a daily basis. A little bit goes a long way! I use it after I wash my hair to help detangle when blow drying. I also use it to add some smoothness and shine after styling and before bed. It has a distinct smell that my boyfriend and I love. :] I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> Love this product for hair and skin!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, i am african american and it really moisturizes my hair and not only leaves it feeling soft, but also smellin good too. I always get compliments on how good my hair smells and feels after applying it, and a little goes a long way....it gives my hair a really nice shine too!</li>
            <li> This is a dream product. I don&#x27;t care about the celebrity endorsements or the hype.. this product is one that works really well, a little bit goes a long way, lasts practically forever (I got my bottle over a year ago and it&#x27;s still goin&#x27;). I&#x27;ve tried some of the argan oil knockoffs, but they lack in consistency/texture/quality and make my hair greasy. Morrocanoil&#x27;s formula is JUST RIGHT. Not greasy, very light, smoothing, and exotically fragrant. Works amazingly well with a flatiron if you want straight hair.</li>
            <li> This smells terrible and the box is so phony! Dont fall for this scam! Day Dream is a con artist! But a bad one!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my stylist.  It takes a small dab in the hand to create a soft, silky, feel to my hair. I use it more as a styling aide but treats the hair as it keeps my loose ends under control.  The slight musky aroma only hints that it is present.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased.  Will continue to get this - and only this, as recommended.</li>
            <li> the oil is great!  i appreciate getting it for the price i did.  Thank you for having this available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> This stuff works on my fine straight  hair and my son&#x27;s  curly hair. It also smells amazing .</li>
            <li> fast shipping, this stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom who loves it so much and she said when she got it it looked like it went thru a tornado and it was open and spilled a little bit. She said it was the real stuff but it was just a mess when she got it.</li>
            <li> My friend told me this product works so I got it from Amazon.  I have colored, bleached, straightened hair...yes its pretty tough for me to deal with my hair.  However, I would let u know dat, no more worries, just wash your hair, apply it before blow dry, then your hair is going to shine.  Perfectly prevent ur hair from frizzy, dull looking start from the first ur first use.</li>
            <li> The original great hair oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for years! It works great and smells fabulous! I always get compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was bleached to death. Hair was breaking, frizzy, and felt like a bale of hay to the touch. After the first use my hair looked healthier. After weeks......my hair is growing, its silky, and the frizz is under control. I have long hair and I use 3-6 pumps and my hair never feels greasy or heavy. The directions recommend less but because I love it soo much, I have used less and it still did the job. In general my hair feel regenerated in all ways, scalp to splitendless tip!</li>
            <li> This took longer to get then if I would of drove to the location to get it.. When I received it the seal was broke and the oil was all over the box and bottle.</li>
            <li> This product contains too much silicones. It is not even real argan oil, argan oil is a minimal part of the ingredients. It isn&#x27;t oily that is true because of the amount of silicones it contains. I have a pretty full bottle of the stuff that I haven&#x27;t been able to use because it makes my hair dry and smells horrible. It wasn&#x27;t worth the hype.</li>
            <li> it is better than i expected. But it probably isn&#x27;t the greatest product though. Hence the 4-star rating. The smell of it is pretty nice too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i reccommend trying their product.as stated above, it is better than my initial rating of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used moroccan oil every time I have washed my hair for the past 5 years!  This is a complete life saver for my hair! (Which is colored quite frequently)  I love the moroccan oil product line!  The shampoo and conditioner are great buys as well if you feel like splurging cause they are pricey.</li>
            <li> This not only works great to tame the wiry wave or curl, but dry hair greatly benefits, and the aroma is &amp;#34;out of this world&amp;#34;.  I always got comments on how wonderful my hair smelled when I used this.  Great for right after shampooing, and also for touch-ups when you want extra moisture, shine, and just feel good about your hair.  It does truly make a difference.  well worth the money, and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product as everyone is raving about it. What a disappointment. It is just like any silicon-based hair product and the \\&quot;fantastic smell\\&quot; is not so fantastic. This product is average at best and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product for protecting your hair without leaving it greasy or weighing it down...  Works fabulously if you have oily hair and don&#x27;t tend to use conditioner because it simply doesn&#x27;t work out to your best advantage.</li>
            <li> I always use moroccan oil in my hair it leaves it so soft and shiny it is a fabulous product</li>
            <li> Ok this is my story.  I love my stylist, he is a creative genious, amazing person, and is one of the few that understands my super long, but super fine, wavy hair that I wear stick straight most of the time.  So what do I when he goes on vacation and I need to get my hair done asap?  I go find a cheaper stylist and cheat on him.  Yes, stupid, I know.  That other stylist saw that I had a little bit of frizz and suggested one of those brazilian anti frizz treatments and told him to go ahead, I mean, what was the worst that could happen?  Well, he fried my hair, not the whole hair, but parts of it, and ever since that happened I have been devastated.  Thankfully, my stylist is back and I saw him a couple of days ago, I told him I was sorry, he hugged me (how forgiving lol) and told me don&#x27;t worry wash your hair a couple of times with clarifying shampoo, use a deep conditioning mask, and take this bottle of moroccanoil treatment, use a tiny bit of moroccan oil on your wet hair before styling and a tiny bit after.  I was leery about trying moroccan oil again.  I bought it online before and hated it; the smell was very strong and the texture was thick and full of silicone.  But I followed my stylist&#x27;s advice and did what he told me last night.  It worked!  My hair is 90% better and not only that, I love my moroccanoil now!  This makes me wonder if I unknownly bought a fake when I tried it the first time.  I probably did.  The bottle I bought at the salon had a softer smell and it was not as thick and greasy as the one I bought online so please be careful if buying this product online.  The one I bought at the salon was the real thing.  And also, never cheat on your stylist, even if the other one is cheap and looks good.  ; )</li>
            <li> I really love this product since it arrived safely and its been months and I still have some left! Its made my hair easier to straighten and it has made my hair softer too and maybe even longer! ooh and I love how it smells :)</li>
            <li> It has become of my haircare routine.  I must use it after every time I wash my hair.  It is not greasy or heavy; just right for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The best hair product I have ever used!  My unruly curly hair now behaves.  Does not weigh your hair down and makes it feel so soft!</li>
            <li> This hair oil makes my hair so soft.  I use it on wet hair.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and smells good.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but, in my opinion, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> smells great, feels light and a friend noticed the first time I used it! She asked what I did to my hair and I told her I had used moroccan oil for the first time... She said she could tell it looked more shiny than usual. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I always recommend this product to people.  It&#x27;s the only thing I know will always work for me!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for one&#x27;s hair, smells great and two or three drops is all it takes.  The sales success of this Moroccan Oil for hair (made in Israel) is well justified.  Our whole household uses it and it lasts because you don&#x27;t use much per application.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to work great in my hair, until my stylist mentioned that my hair was inexplicably getting dark on the ends. I told her what I was using and she was like, that explains it...it has Red 40 in it (that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s amber-colored) and can actually dye your hair over time. She has even seen blondes get a pink tint from using it. She directed me to other brands that are pure and have no color. I won&#x27;t be using it anymore on my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Great! Just have to be carefully not to use too much because your hair can get very oily</li>
            <li> did not purchase for me; purchased for a dear friend in Panama.  she loves it.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful! It makes your hair very soft and adds a beautiful shine. It makes your hair feel and look hydrated!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love Marvelous Oil Deep Nourish! I&#x27;ve applied it when my hair was damp and dry and love both results. Just like the product says...my hair feels NOURISHED!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tried hundreds of other treatments for my dry frizzy unruly hair, and I have to say, this is the best.</li>
            <li> The one that my wife was looking for. I have rcomended for lots of freineds and the loved it quite bit.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  Awesome.  Also:  does the job!  Just a little bit seems to put a nice sheen and shine to your hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I had brought this product on sept 28, 2013. Today it is February 1,2015. This product is amazing, at first I was doubtful about it. My hair is naturally soft, but senior year I decided to get highlights on my hair. Big rookie mistake. Especially if you never dye your hair before, anyways I got this product. The product comes with a pump, and is in a glass container, the oil was thick but smells great. And it feels weird putting oil on my hair. After about 1 year and a half I love this product, the end of my hair, where the highlights are, has become less dry. Well I also do Acv rinses, hair mask, deep condtioning, and etc., to help my hair so I&#x27;m not saying this product does everything. But I noticed that whenever I put my hair in heatless waves or curls my hair ends feels kinda dry. Or whenever I do a acv rinse my hair feels dry. But whenever I put on this product bam, it obsorbs the oil and later makes it soft, smells great, as if you just did a deep hair conditioner. I will recommend this to anyone and repurchase this product,  because clearly i am almost out. But the one bummer thing about this product is the price. But i guess good things don&#x27;t come in a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I use about a dime size blob of this on my wet, dark brown color processed wavy hair, rub it in my hands, pull it thru my hair  then blow dry. Wow! This makes my hair so bouncy, shiny and the hair color is lasting way past the usual 6 week mark.Full and lustrous is my best description. I get compliments on the shine my hair has. This product has blown me away. I have my husband using a tiny amount on his curly color-treated hair too and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I tried this first as a sample from my hairdresser and it really made my hair shine.  I ordered this bottle, and it is much more perfumed than the sample.  It still makes my hair shine, but the perfume is a little strong.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much of a difference this has made. Before I started using Moroccan Oil, the ends of my hair looked fried. I had been brutal to my hair, and it was starting to show. I was debating on cutting of a couple inches just to try and make it look healthier. After using it for a month, my hair looks 100 times better. I&#x27;ve actually had complete strangers stop me and tell me how healthy and shiny my hair looks. It really surprised me the first time it happened. The most amazing thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy like other products I have tried. My hair always looks shiny, but never dirty or oily.</li>
            <li> I love this hair treatment.  I use it at night for an overnight treatment and during the day before styling my hair.  My hair looks healthy all the time!  I no longer use any other treatments.  It is great right after you color or highlight your hair, because it restores it to perfectly healthy  and shiny!  The more you use it, the less product you need, because your hair stays permanently healthy.  I only use a very small amount now--about the size of a dime!</li>
            <li> I have recently started a new hair care regimen and this product works great. It helps to seal in your moisturizer without an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Well I wish I had known I could get it on Amazon for so much less.&lt;br /&gt;It took me 4 months to purchase after it was recommended because all the products together were well over 100.  I am in NY and it is sold at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have unnaturally thin hair.  Years of bleaching, color, stress, poor diet and daily pharmacuetical medications have taken their toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most products are too heavy.  I also can&#x27;t usually just let my hair dry by itself and expect it to look full and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with this.  A dime sized amount rubbed in my hands - I flip my head upside down and apply to ends first alternating \\&quot;tapping\\&quot; my palms on the ends and squeezing the ends in my fists.&lt;br /&gt;I flip my hair back and use another dime sized amount - first to the ends again and evenly through the rest of the hair with the remainder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries by itself and although I see 10% frizz, the hair looks so thick and healthy I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth it to try it.  I like the smell too.</li>
            <li> Everything was great about my purchase.  I ordered this product saturday night and received it monday afternoon. I got what I purchased fot the best price. I will definitely buy from this supplier in the future</li>
            <li> This product worked ok for me, but not great.  Seeing as how I have tried anything and everything that has been suggested:  coconut oil, aloe vera, almond oil, olive oil, argan oil, mayonnaise, beer, eggs, paul Mitchel, ER, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it; I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s more my hair type (and probably not getting the nutrients I need in my food) that is to blame, not so much that the product is bad all together and won&#x27;t work for anyone.   I think if you have healthy hair, it&#x27;ll make it look fabulous, but if it&#x27;s not so healthy, it won&#x27;t do anything to make it look or feel any softer (or less frizzy).  It smells really good though (although there will be someone that will say it stinks:)  One other note, if you blow dry or hot iron your hair straight, it helps with shine a bit, but if you&#x27;re trying not to damage your hair with all that heat, tug, etc,  then just putting it in your hair and letting it dry naturally won&#x27;t help it look better.  Hope that helps a little:)</li>
            <li> I tried this product. I have only used jojoba oil in the past. This product does what it says, but is highly flammable. How good could it be for hair? Read the warnings on the bottle. That&#x27;s why, a couple of seconds after being applied, it seems to have soaked in. Must evaporate instead. Contains linseed oil. Is that what they use in paint thinner?  Hmmmm. I have very long hair and the last thing I need is a torched head. Jojoba oil is much cheaper and natural than this stuff. Don&#x27;t wast your money.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite step of my hair regime!  I really think it makes a difference in the condition of my hair when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.  Makes my hair feel amazing and light weight and really improves my ends.  I have thin hair but a lot of hair.  Also, my color does not fade as quickly. Pretty expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> The abosolute best hair and skin product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product,  you only need a small amount. It adds moisture and shine to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> This is the greatest stuff for your hair.  My hair stylist always uses it on my hair, and it makes it so much softer, shinier and it dries faster, and it smells so good.  I highly recommend it - it only takes the amount about the size of a pea, and you apply it right after you shampoo.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother because she heard about it by word of mouth.&lt;br /&gt;After one treatment, she was sold! The product far exceeded her expectations. She&lt;br /&gt;was impressed with the way her looked and felt.&lt;br /&gt;She was also impressed by the fact that it was easy to use and didn&#x27;t require a lot&lt;br /&gt;of extra work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and great job!</li>
            <li> An awesome product for long hair. It straightens the hair and one only needs 2 to 4 drops . Not only does it smell good, it makes the hair shine and look very healthy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Moroccan Oil line, but if you have to go with anything than the oil is the best. This product is great for damaged hair. When I used to bleach mine, this product made it like silk again. I use just a dab after I get out of the shower, while still a bit wet, and the comb goes right through the hair. Never any tangles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently bought the restorative mask and conditioner too, which do the same thing and don&#x27;t require me to use the oil much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how great this stuff is!  It works perfectly on my hair - so much so that I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner.  Your hair may be different - so - you will need to experiment.  The smell is wonderful - and it also works great on your skin!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse wavy hair that loves to frizz. I have tried tons of different products and treatments just to calm the frizz. Even when I straighten my hair I&#x27;m still fighting the frizzies and flyaways. Most products leave my hair greasy feeling and weighed down or they do nothing. This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works with no greasy feeling (and I use 3-5 pumps) or weighing my hair down. It&#x27;s works on wet or dry hair and my beautician uses it before she colors my hair which helps the color hold longer and stay shiny.  My hair is smooth, shiny and silky and smells terrific!!  I work it through my wet hair prior to drying it straight and then smooth a little over the finished style to calm any flyaways. I don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray anymore to hold the style! It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It works GREAT with my mothers hair and I. I don&#x27;t buy mines on Amazon, but on the actual website. That&#x27;s personally just my choice. It really depends on what you&#x27;re trying to do with your hair. My hair is always frizzy so when I take a shower and damp some on my wet hair and let it air dry, it makes such a huge difference. I love it and we&#x27;ve bought over $100 of it. Yes, I know. It&#x27;s quite a lot of $$$ but a few drops comes a long way :)</li>
            <li> I first used this in DC when a stylist there recommended it. However, he warned me to use it sparingly or else it behaved &amp;#34;strangely&amp;#34; on the hair. I used sparingly, and over time, I saw what he meant. It started off great, and then somehow it actually started to dry out my hair over time while making my hair get an odd sticky feeling. I never used more than a dime sized amount when I applied it. Perhaps it works better with other hair textures. I&#x27;ve stopped using it and switched to coconut oil. My hair and scalp thank me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years on my hair.I have a long haired dog that I&lt;br /&gt; put it on after her bath--shiny coat and sweet smell.It requires a very small amount to achieve good results,so that helps with the only con--it&#x27;s price</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is the best treatment for hair I have ever used!  It is for all hair types.  I recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> An amazing product with great fragrance.Keeps hair styled and looking great. Since I discovered it, I use it every day. Love it</li>
            <li> This is NOT the REAL brand of Moroccan Oil by moroccanoil.com. I wondered what was wrong with it when I opened it... the bottle was oily, the pump didn&#x27;t work well (and was very cheap feeling), it didn&#x27;t smooth my hair well or make it shiny (it actually made it fuzzy), and the SMELL was just AWFUL! It also gave me really bad allergies (itchy eyes &amp; skin and sneeze attack all day after putting it on). I have never had that happen with real Moroccan Oil, it is NOTHING like this: it smells lovely and makes your hair feel silky soft and look superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, something weird is happening. On my Order page for this item is says it was sold by &amp;#34;in stock novelties llc&amp;#34; but on the product page it now says &amp;#34;Sold by JDG Associates and Fulfilled by Amazon.&amp;#34; I am returning this item. I am disappointed in Amazon for continuing to allow this item to sell on here as I see other complaints by other people saying the same thing. This is my first bad experience with 3rd party merchandise bought on Amazon.com. I will look at reviews more carefully next time.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soft and silky, healthy looking and shiny, with one use. Well worth it. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes your hair so smooth and make fly-aways go away.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It smooths the flyaways, softens my hair and helps repair the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the product makes my hair feel soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, coarse hair so for me, having soft hair is a new sensation, and I am obsessed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way, so one pump ONLY!  Do NOT apply at roots, ends only, otherwise your hair will look greasy!</li>
            <li> My hair never felt better this product mad my hair soft, bouncy and just beautiful without having to put greese in it....my hair never looked and felt this good without going to the hair dresser.....</li>
            <li> I was so surprised how quick I received the product. It&#x27;s great. This is the only way to go. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The effect on my hair was OK, but it was expensive compared to other products that have the same or better effect. I suspect I got a bit of an itchy scalp when I used it, but could have been other stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses this on my hair &amp; I had to get some.  Smoothes out the frizzies &amp; has a wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Adds moisture and reduces frizz before and/or after blow drying hair - use small amount so your hair doesn&#x27;t get oily. The hydrating mask is really awesome too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price. The pump was a nice addition and works well. Would recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> keeps frizz to a minimum, smells good, leaves hair soft. makes it easier to straighten my wavy hair. excellent customer service :)</li>
            <li> Received on time and as described.</li>
            <li> I can see the change in my hair on the first time using it. It makes my hair feel really soft like silk, no tangle, no fizzy. My hair is very damaged, thin, and weak. I&#x27;ve used Chi infusion before but there&#x27;s just a bit different but this product is really worth every penny. Save your money and buy this, you have to try it and you will see the difference. Thanks for making this product. By the way, I was buying this from HAIR TECH, they always send products priority. I received it so quickly.</li>
            <li> This hair oil treatment is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great, absorbs fast, and leaves my hair very soft and decreases the frizz. I&#x27;ve been using it now for 3 years and have never found a product to match it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> i had to pay important duty amounting to Eu18.00,on arrival,I had paid for transport and handling fees already,the oil came from the USA I had not requested this.In the future i wil not buy this product from Amazon.com again.Regards,J.Aitton.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive but lasts for 4 months, my hair is so much more manageable. Two drops on wet hair and good to go!</li>
            <li> This oil is simply wonderful. At the first time I used I saw the diference in my hair and my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought Moroccan Oil a couple of months ago and have been using it as heat protectant prior to styling my hair. The results are amazing. I have always been really diligent in taking care of my hair, but this product has made them even better looking, shinier, softer and with virtually NO split ends in sight. It is the very best out there, even my hair stylist said so. I highly recommend Moroccan Oil to anybody who wants to have soft, beautiful, sexy hair. You cannot go wrong when you choose top of the line!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I am a big fan of the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment. It really has transformed my hair. My  hair now seems happier and healthier! It lasts a long time too, as you only need a small amount, about the size of a dime.</li>
            <li> This product really makes your hair shine and look healthier.  The beautiful smell is a huge bonus.  I have purchased this for myself and my adult daughters who also love it.</li>
            <li> not sure whether or not it is a real product in this bottle, but also I wonder about the added chemicals even in the authentic bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pretty much the important ingredient is Aragan Oil, perhaps this one is formulated for hair only, but Aragan Oil in general can be used as a wonderful moisturizer on skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw search Aragan Oil on iherb site and see what options they have as well...  save $10 dollars off a 40 dollar purchase or just take free $5 no matter what and no matter what product and gosh they have a lot! just enter code  KAL996 at checkout after adding item to cart at iherb site</li>
            <li> I buy two of these every five months for my wife. She loves what it does for her hair it gives her hair a nice shine</li>
            <li> I have very long brunette hair, which has become dull and dry since moving to a location with untreated water. My cousin, who happens to be a hairdresser, tried Moroccan Oil on my hair a couple years ago, and the rest is history!&lt;br /&gt;I use Moroccan Oil every time I wash my hair. This product restores moisture and shine to my extra long locks without making my hair oily. The fragrance is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;People can&#x27;t believe my hair looks so heathy, considering the length. Good genes and Moroccan Oil! You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, everyone raves its the best thing ever, Im satisfied, but not going crazy with how good the results were.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best. One of the best things about it, is that it makes my hair feel great. I thought it might be a bit oily when I first got it, but not at all.  It is fantastic and I tell all my girlfriends about it.</li>
            <li> Best hair serum ever and I have tried it all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now.  I learned a valuable lesson a while back....buy the real thing.  I bought another brand of the &amp;#34;same thing&amp;#34;  (according to the salesperson), and withing a few weeks, my hair had an undeniable green tinge to it.  Threw out the generic crap, bought the real thing, a voila!  hair is back to normal color!</li>
            <li> I use this on my curly hair and I really like it, you only need a little bit and I mix it with the curl cream, it leaves my hair shiny and soft curls.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  It was introduced to me by my stylist few years ago.  It has a great aroma and overall hair experience.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read a lot of great review about the product. Before using it, I have done with Garnier Argan oil. Despite of the rave reviews of Moroccan oil, I found that one of the ingredients consist of dimethicone, which means silicone. I just disappointed why it doesn&#x27;t consist of 100% moroccan oil.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this product is worse and overpriced. Because of the glass bottle, you also have to be extra careful to spill any oil and touch the bottle, very slippery. I broke the bottle and now I wasted more than a half left of it.</li>
            <li> This is seriously my favorite hair product. It nourishes your hair without making it greasy at all. It protects it from the heat, and makes hair soft and shiny, without weighing it down. It keeps my hair from getting dry or split ends. I recommend this for oily or dry hair! It soaks quickly into the hair without leaving residue. It is honestly the best, I&#x27;ll keep buying it for years to come. I recommended this to my mom and now she loves it too. I have nothing but good things to say!! It even smells good! I&#x27;m really excited, can you tell? :) It is a little pricey, but I think it&#x27;s worth every penny. I also use this as moisturizer for my skin too, and it soaks in leaving skin so soft, no residue, and supposedly fights fine lines and wrinkles. I love this!</li>
            <li> I like this product, makes my hair softer and gives it shine. Just dab a little on the ends after each wash.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product.  It&#x27;s kind of pricey so haven&#x27;t ordered in awhile.  However, definitely worth the price.  A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> Got my first bottle as a gift, and tried other brands since, but none have the amazing scent, or manage to gloss my hair without feeling greasy. Worth every penny, and I&#x27;m done looking for anything better.</li>
            <li> It really helped me to improve the appearance &amp; health of my hair..and also smell very good!&lt;br /&gt;you can see the results in a very short time</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product, it makes my hair smooth, shinning and looks very healthy , I have been using it for like a year now and I noticed great difference in the texture of my hair, before it was less managable and looks frizzy now its very different and beautiful, I will contenue to use this product like forever, it really worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> I use this a couple of times of week after washing my hair - my hair feels fuller and thicker and shines.  Also, I have never been bothered by dandruff since I have been using Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s very useful for my dry hair. my  hair looks very nice when i use this.</li>
            <li> If you have course hair, this stuff is great! A little goes a long way. The smell is a little obnoxious, but still worth it. Makes your hair very shiny and soft and doesn&#x27;t at all make my hair greasy</li>
            <li> i will definitely repurchase it!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist had used this particular product on my hair, so I was already familiar with it.  I am very pleased with the shine and texture of my hair now. The fragrance is spicy, light, simply lovely.</li>
            <li> Great find in N.J. My niece works as a hair dresser and my hair was dry so I used some. Went on Amazon and bought a bottle. Great for my hair and skin. Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Jane</li>
            <li> My hair stylist was trying to sell me this product for around $70.00 at my salon, and I was so tempted to get it because the product left my hair super soft and shiny without being greasy.  I decided to hold off and check on amazon and to my surprise they had the big bottle WITH the pump, which you couldn&#x27;t find at salons.  This product is amazing, it smells so good and a little goes a LONG way.  I use this product pretty much every day and have been for a little over the year and I&#x27;m only halfway through the bottle.  For a hair product the price is scary, but the product is super concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I have pretty long hair and I use maybe a dime size amount for my whole head of hair.  Would highly reccommend this product to anybody and I have been.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quickly.  My daughter and I use this product on our hair.  It helps protect against heating treatments like hot curlers and hot irons.</li>
            <li> First of all, know this is not Argan oil.  This is some kind of silicone hair product.  it is not an oil.   Morrocan oil works very well to smooth and soften my wild frizzy hair.  A little bit goes a long way.  it makes my hair straight, soft and sleek (with a little help from an iron) without heaviness and even a little resistant to humidity frizz. People think I&#x27;m a straight haired girl.  It smells nice.   FYI --You might want to read the list of ingredients -- the argan oil is listed as about the 4th ingredient in the bottle.... so I dont think it&#x27;s the argan oil that is doing the trick out of this bottle.  Also, this stuff is ridiculously expensive but it is very popular because it works so well.  I have found that sellers and retailers charge all kinds of crazy prices ripping customers off and a lot of reviewers say they receive fake product.   I just bought a bottle from Ricky&#x27;s and they charged me $49 before taxes-- which is 10% more than what the Moroccan oil website charges.  So Ricky&#x27;s is ripping people off on an already expensive product.  (FYI Ricky&#x27;s is a big beauty store in NYC)   So -- I recommend you go to the Moroccan Oil website and order from them directly.  That way you are sure you are getting the real product for the real price.</li>
            <li> My whole family swears by this product.  Does not make your hair greasy.  We have been using for 5 years now and will never be without it!!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work on my hair at all.  But maybe that&#x27;s because I have dry, color-treated, curly, wavy (wild) hair and have been struggling for a couple of years now with an age-related or stress-related frizzing problem.&lt;br /&gt;I was super disappointed because the product is so expensive!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have SUPER THICK (everyone comments on it) curly, dry higlighted hair.  It was breaking off so it looked like straw with tiny fly-aways everywhere.  This product makes it easier to brush after washing, and keeps it a lot smoother and more hydrated.    The only problem is that if you use too much, your hair gets VERY greasy very fast.  My hair used to never be greasy and I could go a few days between washes but when using this I have to shampoo more often.</li>
            <li> My co worker referred me to this product and she just raved about it.  I really didn&#x27;t find it any different than a biolage or biosilk hair tamer/smoother oil.  I really wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I have naturally curly hair, and I feel like it really weighs it down when I wear it in my hair.  When I straighten it, it works the same as any other hair oil/tamer.  It smells good, and makes your hair soft, but so do other cheaper products...</li>
            <li> I had this used on my hair at a saloon and was impressed.  I have dry hair,due to coloring and age. And my hair shined and was so soft. Would highly recomend it for people with the same hair problems as me.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful hair oil I have ever used.  I have long hair which often gets dry on the ends, and this product is amazing. My hair now is not only silky and shines, but this oil smells wonderful too. Definitely try it out if you need something to brighten up, strengthen, and smooth you hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave an &#x27;oily&#x27; feel, but seems to melt right into the hair strands. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, thinking all moroccan oils were alike and realized very quickly, THEY ARE NOT!!!  This one is just OK...nothing special and the worst part is that the wonderful smell I have smelled on other moroccan oils was MISSING.  Even my girlfriends noticed the smell was gone.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> My stylist turned me onto this product. It REALLY works. Apply a small amount to damp hair after shampooing (don&#x27;t use any conditioner) and style as usual - blow dry or not. On all but the rainiest of days, this will keep your hair from frizzing up.   Place your palm over the open bottle and invert to place a dime-sized amount onto your hand. Rub your hands together and spread through your hair. I have chin length, very thick hair and do this twice. That&#x27;s all you need. No more conditioners, gels, sprays, that don&#x27;t work anyway. The 3.4 oz. bottle will last a long time.   The aroma is slightly musky but not overpowering and wears off fairly quickly. This will not stain your pillow or clothes. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product my hair curls together into smooth curls instead of the frizzy mess it was.  I have since been wearing my hair down a lot instead of pulling it into a bun every day.  I love this stuff!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have problematic, thin, curly hair. This product did not weigh my hair down the way most products do. It&#x27;s got a discreet pleasant smell too. Hair felt softer and did not get weighed down even after multiple uses in a row. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that some of the oil spilled out before I received it. Also, it will take a bit longer to ship if you live on my side of the country.     As for the product, I absolutely love it! My hair is fine and oily so I have to wash it every day. My old colorist told me not to but if I don&#x27;t, it looks awful. Alas, my newest stylist recommended this to me. It makes my hair soft, easy to style and shiny without weighing it down. It&#x27;s better for your hair than natural oil, in my opinion. I haven&#x27;t had a trim in over six weeks and my split-ends are minimal. Salons will sell this bottle to you for about $40 bucks and I got mine off of here for $25 so it&#x27;s worth buying from these people.     I have straight hair but since it reduces drying time, I can fully dry it and style in less time. One of my best friends has thick curly hair and used it. Her hair looked amazing with just a dime-size amount and her curls were more defined. She plans to order a bottle as well. After using this, all I need is some hairspray to style and I&#x27;m ready to go. It truly is the last product I&#x27;ll ever have to try!</li>
            <li> Great stuff helps with static electricity. Not too oily and helps manage those hard to tame hairs. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Price was good and shipping was free.  Good deal</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair that tangles and frizzed like crazy. Moroccan oil is the only thing that really works well. Also protects your hair from hair dryer heat damage; not so much from straightener heat though. I have tried many other products, cheaper and more expensive, but I always come back to this one. It also doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This hair treatment is ESSENTIAL for anyone who colors or heat styles their hair regularly.  I use a small amount in my hair each day to help restore shine and strength to my stressed hair and have never been disappointed.  My stylist got me hooked on this product but she often runs out of her supply at her salon.  The price I paid on Amazon is about the same that she charges retail, so for me, the purchase online was out of need rather than price.</li>
            <li> i have very curly (read: frizzy) hair...it is also very dry hair...  and now that i use this product, i just get out of the shower, put a bit in my hand while my hair is damp, and my hair seems to be getting healthier...  (please don&#x27;t misunderstand--i still need to use my other \\&quot;control\\&quot; products--this mainly feeds and moisturizes my hair)  anyway...  i also let my friend with wavy hair borrow it after she got done blow-drying her clean hair, which was way fly-away...one teeny bit got her hair picture perfect and shiny and glamorous for her date...with NO other products.  so, perhaps straight haired people get a better deal...but i still love it!  i highly recommend this product...  wish it were cheaper and easier to get, though.</li>
            <li> I began using this product about a year ago. It is fantastic. It keeps the frizz down and helps with styling. I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone with any type of hair, especially dry, unruly, or frizzy. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair is going downhill fast.  Between old age, menopause and cancer, it is dry, crinkly, breaks easily and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.  I bought this as a last resort (after so many purchases of other products) and it works.  I love it!  The smell is lovely, it doesn&#x27;t drag down my hair and while the ends are a bit dry, this really seems to nourish my hair.  I use it right out of the shower with damp hair and then more when my hair is dry.  Just love it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humid weather. The Moroccanoil is the only product that I have used so far that does not leave a sticky residue and tames my frizz. It is a light smelling oil that you do not notice once it is on your hair. A little bit goes a long way, depending on the thickness and length of your hair. It also helps to ease the itchiness of my scalp in the dry winter months. I am glad that my friend recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> I live in southern Arizona where it&#x27;s exceptionally arid, and my hair suffers. I&#x27;ve tried many brandname hair products that simulate moisture and advertise prevention of fly-away hair, but none works as well as Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> i love this product. the first time i tried it was as a reccomendation of my hair dresser and i fell in love. it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue and makes your hair smell, feel and look amazing. i even put it in my two-year old&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff. Organix makes my hair feel much better for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product Ive used for years.  Makes thick curly hair manageable and so soft.  Compared to all the products I used to buy this is a bargain since you only need a small amout per use.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle (first one lasted a year and a half!).  Love this stuff.  Only takes a small pea size daily on my medium-length hair.  Love the smell!  I also use it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan oil! I usually buy it from a salon but found it here for maybe a couple dollars less. Great  for any hair type &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> A hair dresser friend suggested this for my beard. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell at first, but I like it now. works great</li>
            <li> Especially since moving south....my hair does not frizz.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair and also do high lights....my hair is healthy. Never looks damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Moroccan Oil products.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair shine, softness and smells great!</li>
            <li> Light on my hair smells great I have been buying this for a few years now it is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I love this. Product, I have used it for a long time, good price and I love the pump that came with it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. It really helps me with the cold weather frizz that my hair is going through; especially living in Boston, Massachusetts.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! Helps control frizz without leaving hair feeling greasy. The only downside is the smell but once hair is completely dry you can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this wonderful oil. I use it most every night after I shower. I apply it to my damp hair so when I wake in the morning my hair is shiny, soft and tangle free. My hair is about 4 inches below my shoulder. The aroma of the oil is clean and very nice. It is not heavy ( on my hair). My hair is a little fine but I have a lot of hair. It is also highlighted. My hairdresser says my hair is in great condition and credits this product for some of that. She does note that some color treated blondes have mentioned their hair gets a bit brassy but I have not experienced that. It should also be noted that changing to the lighter oil seems to fix that issue, according to my hairdresser. My husband has started using this and gives it high praise, too. I will purchase it again and from this seller.</li>
            <li> I color highlight regularly. I also shampoo everyday and have tried everything but nothing makes my hair feel as great as this product does. Smells great and shinny. A small drop goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for dry, processed and curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great option to purchase online. This produces very silky hair. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best product for your hair.  Put it in when your hair is wet and it makes it easier to brush and blow dry time shorter.  Put it in when it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s a shine and soothing serum</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s the best oil I&#x60;ve ever used. Your hair won&#x60;t look like it&#x60;s using oil but it will looks healthy. Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, smells wonderful and makes my hair very shiny. I will definitely order it again!</li>
            <li> I love this oil I have  relaxed hair and it works wonder under my scrub cap that I wear consistently with in surgery.  There is no breakage at all, but it seems that my relaxer is benefiting from this product.  My hair moist and soft. I will continue to use this product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is very good for you here for smoothness</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed the benefits of THIS brand of Moroccan oil.  I have tried less/cheaper but they were not even worth the shipping I paid.  It works, absorbent and the scent works well.  Subtle.  Will order again as long as they are competitive.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with product &amp; seller</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products.  This is a re-order and I&#x27;m due to place another.  I have very thick, coarse hair.  I apply it after shampooing when my hair is still damp and it tames my tresses.</li>
            <li> Great value much cheaper than in my salon. Have been using it for years! Better than any other oils that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil hair treatment 3.4 oz bottle with blue box you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product&lt;br /&gt;Manages your hair ... Conditions too</li>
            <li> This is the best light weight non-greasy oil for dry hair! LOVE IT!  LOVE IT! TOTALLLY LOVE IT! Did I say love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Worth the price for sure. I have really thick, naturally curly, coarse hair and it makes my hair so soft and shiny and it smells fantastic! I use it when my hair is wet and again when it&#x27;s dry and styled. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. I recommend this product to anyone! It would work well for any hair type.</li>
            <li> Eliminates static, makes hair feel silky, shiny, thicker and doesn&#x27;t weight down my fine hair.  I use it year round.</li>
            <li> My experience with Maroccan Oil is the most amazing treatment to use for wet or dry hair!  I will NEVER be without this wonderful product!  My daughter being a hairdresser for 14 years has used numerous different leave in hair treatments on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutey NOTHING on todays market compares to the look, as well as the feel I get using Maroccan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and PLEASE DON&#x27;T ever go away!!</li>
            <li> Have used this for a few years now.  Always buy it at a salon. Deceided this time to check out online.  Found it quickly and ordered it for much less than in salons.  EXACT same thing. No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years and I love it. I am really glad that I have found another way to purchase it.  Buying it in your local salon they usually charge more and I am really happy to buy it online at a fair price.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best hair treatment. I love this product because it smells good and repairs damaged hair. I like to apply a small amount to wet hair and blow dry. Once my hair is dry, I apply a little more to tame down the fly-aways.  Since using Moroccan Oil, my hair has improved. This oil also works good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes your hair feel so healthy and smooth.  Great shine too.  No other similar products like it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing on my hair. I don&#x27;t need the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; formula even though I&#x27;m naturally pretty greasy. I have tried some imitation brands that are half the price. Let&#x27;s just say... &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> It took a long time getting here, but my daughter loves the product so it was worth the wait. Evidently it has become all the rage.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for any kind of hair.  Leaves it soft and shiny and the smell is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.  it is wonderful in not my hair but my Shih Tzu as well.  With that double coat and the fact she is a Service dog so she is out a lot and our dry climate it is a God send when it comes to grooming.  her hair has not ever been like this.  it is fluffy and beautiful and knot free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a base with my Essential Oils from young living it dilutes them for my fair skin so I can use them without them doing any burning.  As some oils are considered hot oils, just due to the spice they are derived from.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this product in my hair each time I visited for a hair cut, and I commented that it smelled good. She told me about Moroccan oil and why she was using it (in addition to agreeing that it smelled really good! : )  My hair tends to be rather dry and fine, and she explained that the oil would help to make it softer.  I bought a small sample bottle from her (.85 oz), and tried it for about a month.  It is now a regular part of my morning routine.  You can apply it to damp or dry hair.  You only need a tiny amount, even less than the &amp;#34;dime size&amp;#34; amount suggested in the product description (I used about a &amp;#34;pea&amp;#34; size).  A little bit goes a long, long way.  If you have hair that is a bit dry, or simply want to add a nice aroma to your hair, in addition to giving your hair a little protection from drying out, this product is for you. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!Makes my hair smooth and moist,I have used this product for a few years and I am going to use it forever :)</li>
            <li> What a grand find for color treated hair!  This is the one to use if you want natural looking hair.  Absolute must for fine hair and it only takes a small amount to work.  So easy to use and the product is not greasy but is definitely an oil-- how does it do that?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> this is not the same product, not sure if the formula is different for the &amp;#34;middle east&amp;#34; version.  smell different, feel different, result different</li>
            <li> I have been an avid fan of moroccan oil for years and still have yet to be disappointed. This oil is so moisturizing for my curly hair and my husband and I love the smell. A great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, straight hair who is prone to having static. This is a great way to prevent the annoying static and to soften hair. I use it every time I use a hair dryer. It prevents it from drying out and keeps my hair soft and shiny. I will always use this product.</li>
            <li> I have re-ordered this  this product several times, when I run out I really miss it, great for your hair!</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but for real results you should try SBS Divinity Effect. That&#x27;s the best treatment for hair used in Europe.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff off an on for years now.  Its spendy but very well worth every penny. For my thick somewhat frizzy hair this is the only product I will use forever! I have tried all the  &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; or knock off versions, that don&#x27;t compare, and wasted alot of money in the process!</li>
            <li> It makes my wife&#x27;s long hair shine, she no long has the frizzie look. That makes me like it too.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. It came with a nice pump that helps you control the amount that you use at one time.</li>
            <li> I love this product - this is worth the money.  Wonderful for your hair.  I totally recommend buying this.  It just took a long time to get it, that was the only bummer.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. Couldn&#x27;t find it at a better price any where else. Good product and great price</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever invented for frizzy crazy hair. I&#x27;ve tried the knockoff brands and nothing works as good as this. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will never go back. The fact that it dries your hair faster is a plus so I spend half the time blow drying than I would without it. The price may seem high but honestly it lasts about 6 months for me! If not longer.</li>
            <li> I heard about Moroccan Oil from a co-worker. I first tried the kind that you get at Target and was mildly satisfied. However, my co-worker later clarified that she uses \\&quot;Bottle with the Blue Box\\&quot; so for my birthday I asked for a bottle. What a difference! Even after the first use I noticed my hair to be softer. I have blond hair with natural wave which in the winter I tend to straighten a lot which has caused my hair to become damaged with a straw-like texture. Now, I have been using the product for about 1-2 weeks and my hair looks healthy, soft and shiny. It&#x27;s really helped! The product took about a week to ship but arrived in great/new shape (just as described). I have now added the Mask to my wish list for Christmas. I have noticed that the price does drop the longer it is on my wish list, so I would recommend watching the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate this stuff highly enough!  It&#x27;s amazing!!  No, I&#x27;ve never used a drop of it, but my wife asked me to get some for her, I did, she said thank you, and she seemed happy to get it.  That should be worth 5 stars in any husband&#x27;s book.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and product was in perfect condition.  The product itself works great...makes hair much easier to manage.  Blow dries quicker and it reduces the frizz somewhat.  Product does not smell when it&#x27;s in your hair.  You only need a little bit so this bottle will last several months.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  If I buy it on line it is cheaper than buying at the salon.  Works great for thicker corse hair.</li>
            <li> At first, we would like to choose lowest price.&lt;br /&gt;But we selected middle rating due to quality concern of this product.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry for a long while no matter what shampoo and hair conditioner I used.  After using Moroccan oil for awhile and finding the right amount to use after shampooing, my hair is truly soft and pliable. As icing on the cake, Moroccan Oil smells so good!  I love Moroccan Oil!</li>
            <li> Live by this stuff, use it every time i straighten my naturally curly frizzy hair. Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, when it came in the mail it was already leaking. Now I am still an avid buyer of moroccan oil however i will never but it online ever again. SO PISSED when it had come leaking all over. waste of moneey</li>
            <li> Wow, changed the texture of my color treated hair! My hair looks healthier.  I have tried other oil products that made my hair feel heavy. Give Moroccan Oil A try.</li>
            <li> My former hairdresser suggested this product a few years ago and it has worked fabulously. Best prices can be found online.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased. I have curly hair and it makes my hair so shiny and healthy looking. I have recommended it to several of my friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t post the review before I finish the first bottle. Now that I&#x27;m confident with the quality, I can give gals a recommendation. :)</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry and freaky because of my career as a fashion model most of the time my hair receives many chemical that can really harm my hair. But thanks to Moroccan Hair treatment product, it protects my hair from damage from this harmful chemical like hair coloring and hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> i saw a difference after using it for 8 months .. but its pricy !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The more heat you put on your hair the better it works. Smells awesome too.</li>
            <li> Love the moroccanoil. I have curly dry hair and in just a week my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser turned me on to this amazing oil which does NOT feel oily on your hair. Because you put it on when hair is still wet, it blends into the hair as you blow dry and keeps it in place. No more gels or mousse for me. No more hair conditioners (either wash out or leave in) as the oil makes my hair glisten wonderfully in natural light. No more hairspray because Moroccanoil holds my hair in place however I style it with the blow dryer. Also, with a good haircut you don&#x27;t even have to blow dry. Just rub the oil into the hair, comb and go.   Easy does it - you bet - this product is half price on amazon.com compared to buying it in the salon AND it lasts and lasts. My last bottle (3.4 oz) was used from the end of November, 2008 until the first week in October, 2009 because it only takes a small amount in the palm of your hand to completely coat your hair. I use it every time I wash my hair which is every two to three days. No special treatment regimen but the product is OH SO SPECIAL!! Highly recommended by me as an alternative to pouring chemicals on your scalp :-)</li>
            <li> Very hydrating &amp; not too heavy. Love this product. Great for thin or thick hair. Smells awesome too.</li>
            <li> i thought after reading reviews that the oil worked best for thick curly hair but gave it a try anyway. it is a product that does what it says. i have dry,thin blond hair that has lost it&#x27;s glow with age. my hair improves with every use, i have tried many expensive highly rated hair improvers and usually find them too heavy and my hair feels flat and dirty at the end of the day. this oil if i use a little makes my hair feel soft and healthy and it stays that way until the next wash.   i highly recommend it for blond&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li> Morroccan Oil makes your hair silky smooth, rids snarly fine hair, tames thick curls, and never leaves a greasy look.  How does it do it?!  And the smell is divine...  Can&#x27;t say enough good about it!</li>
            <li> The fragrance was so strong, I had to toss the bottle after only using it once. The one-time use benefit - to me - was not deserving of the positive reviews. My 2 cents of course. Alternatively, try coconut oil from the market or free-trade Argan oil - both without added fragrance - and both are able to penetrate hair.</li>
            <li> This is one product I will not go without. This oil makes my hair softer and easier to style with. The scent is lovely. The bottle last about a for me. Just use a nickle size portion on your damp hair and voila! you can feel the difference. I change my hair color often and this helps lessen the damage. I get compliment on my hair all the time. I can&#x27;t be without it unless I find something else like this or better for a cheaper price. Overall it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair prodcut for daily use. It is light weight and helps control fly away hair.</li>
            <li> This product really helps hair that has been styled a lot.  Use it on damp hair before you blow dry and it helps protect your hair from the heat.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing hair product I have used in years.  It makes my hair hair silky and smooth and very shiny.  My husband ordered it for me and now he uses it as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Since I have dry and frizzy hair when I put it on after I shower and blow dry it keeps my hair all nice and shiny. I was afraid that it would look oily and it doesn&#x27;t. I am very happy with this product and would definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> I have coarse dry hair and from reading all the wonderful reviews about this product, I thought for sure that I would get a product that could tame my mane.  However, I find that my hair is even more frizzy and dry than before I began using this product.  For this price, the product should have a much better result.</li>
            <li> This Moroccan oil is great stuff compared to hair jell or moose,makes your hair silky soft but managable !!!</li>
            <li> Everyone should use this product! I have fine hair and it is stronger, more healthy and shines more than it ever has. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this oil.  My hair has never been better.  I use it everyday before blow drying and it leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny.  Worth triple the price.  A MUST have!!</li>
            <li> This works well, just not with the frizzies. Makes your hair smoother and shiny. Helps to minimize new damage. Good product - great smell. Also really helps with tangles.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccanoil, allows my curly hair to dry naturally faster without blowdryer frizz.  The problem was that, the last two bottles did not have Moroccanoil in it, color and texture almost the same, but smell was different and product did not work.  My hairdresser picked me up a bottle from a hair show, and I could tell it was actually the real stuff in the bottle.  I will never order from amazon shipping again, I know what was sent was not the real Moroccanoil.  I complained to Amazon and only received another bottle of the imposter.  Will only now pay more to get the real stuff!</li>
            <li> My wife just started using this &amp; loves it. Keeps her hair soft, hydrated, &amp; feels lightweight.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Moroccan Oil from my hair dresser and absolutely loved it!  Once it was gone, I had trouble finding it anywhere locally.  I tried other products but nothing made my hair feel as soft as the Moroccan Oil.  I am so glad I found it available on line, and will always return here to purchase it.  It may be a little on the expensive side, but a little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile and have bought numerous bottles at salons.  When I received this in the mail, the seal was not intact and despite looking like the actual oil, it smelled horrible and I had to wash my hands a few times to get rid of the cologne-like stench.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. it makes your hair so soft and shiny.  I also just purchased the \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version which is even better if you have thin hair.    LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I really like it！！！it is really useful for my hair！！！ my friends and I use it and all of us thought it is effecient --- making our dry hair soft and glossy.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using your Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment. I like the smell of the oil. I think I will order more in near future.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other brands that were less expensive because I do love the oil. This brand is pricier but definitely the best. I use it mostly I&#x27;m my bleached hair but it is a great body oil and facial cleanser too.</li>
            <li> It Didn&#x27;t work for me wasn&#x27;t satisfied and was expensive I use it In the morning it makes my hair look frizzy</li>
            <li> I mean... the reviews don&#x27;t lie - this stuff is amazing. Makes your hair soft and shiny. Be wary, however, if you have thinner hair not to use too much or it will make your hair greasy looking the next day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is actual Moroccan Oil. Smells and works completely differently from the way the actual product normally does. I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this bottle, and this is normally a product I love.</li>
            <li> Happy wife happy life! She loves this stuff and is happy with this order. I love the smell of it in her hair! :)</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 2 yrs and the best price is on amazon.  Great product for your hair always</li>
            <li> This has always been a great product for my long, colored blonde hair. I think it is a great moisturizer and adds frizz control</li>
            <li> My friend gave me a travel size version of this oil.  I love the smell and how my hair feels after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It did not  make my hair shine immediately, but as I use it more, my hair seems to look less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Great for people with dry, damaged or permed hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that has become considerably smoother with this serum. I love the smell, the light feeling of the serum, and I use a pump of this daily. It has made my hair feel and look healthier over time.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil for the hair it is light not heavy and feels smooth and silky. Good stuff</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hair mor soft and smooth. I notice that my hair shaines more and since I start using it, my hair stylist notice a change in terms of straight.</li>
            <li> This is great! It keeps my hairstyle for days. There&#x27;s a lot of product so it&#x27;ll last a while, too.</li>
            <li> Used this product and it helps better than most others. I have very long straight dark Italian hair and used WEN in the past....dont waste your money....Moroccan oil is better....works great.</li>
            <li> make my hair very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil helps me tame my curls and gives me a smooth straight look!! I love using this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  I use it to keep my hair soft and protect it from the heat of my styling irons.</li>
            <li> This is the same Moroccan  oil that I purchased at a salon for a lot more. I love this stuff and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Mi wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and it was a bit heavy for my hair my daughter&#x27;s hair is thick and it work really well. Her hair shined and was so soft. I just don&#x27;t recommend it for thin hair use the Moroccan Light. My other daughter bought this and she has thin fine hair like me and that works awesome for out hair type. But it is a great product and I would recommend this product to people.</li>
            <li> This oil was the best for your hair! It made it so soft and look super healthy. Would just put a couple squirts in my hair after I shower and it would control the frizz, split end, and make it look so healthy. I have coarse thick hair and I saw that the Moroccan oil helped my hair tremendously!</li>
            <li> Great value for this product. MO works great your hair will look and feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> This was introduced to me by a fellow aquatics/swim instructor.  Obviously, bieng in the water frequently can take a toll on your hair.  We both have long hair and just a very small amount of the product rubbed between your hands, warms and causes this &#x27;little bit&#x27; to go a long way.  The first time I used it I spent the whole day going around saying to people \\&quot;feel how soft my hair is!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased mine from Amazon and paid a lot less for it than my friend did.  One bottle will last a long time..many months and I have hair down to my waist!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to have and keep the softest, silkiest, healthiest hair of anyone you know.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product when I saw all the fabulous reviews. I was so excited when I got it on the mail and decided to try it the same day. I used it for a week and did not see any improvements on my hair; did not control the frizz or made my hair silky. The only good thing about this product was the smell. It smells great but I would not call it a hair treatment. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, the price is also outrageous.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I love this product.  I smells great and makes your hair smooth and silky.  You only need a tiny amount so it may seem pricey but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is always a good buy and came in record time.  Thanks for the good service.</li>
            <li> My hairsytlist actually put this on my hair and recommended me the product thank goodness for magic oil, That is what i have chosen to call this wonderful product. Great on humidity trust me MAGIC OIL NOT Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I add it to my wet hair, mostly on my ends. It really helps to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product! I kept going back to an expensive hair dresser because everytime I left my hair felt so buttery soft but it was the Moroccanoil she was using in my hair!! I purchased this from her for $31, so Amazon is a little cheaper- but don&#x27;t forget the s/h.     My Hair;  Long 5-7\\&quot; Past Sholders  Semi-Wavy, gets frizzy brushed without a straight iron  Med. Thickness    I put the oil in my hair wet and use about .75tsp, I work it in through the ends first(I like to use a lot, plus my hair is long, you might want to try using less until you figure out what works for you).... then after it is dried and styled(usually flat ironed) I put about a nickel size amount through to tame the fly aways.    Make sure you start at your ends so your roots don&#x27;t get greasy or build up over time and rub the oil together in your palms before putting it in your hair for a more even coat.    It also leaves my hair very shiny but not greasy looking- it looks healthy. I have been using this oil for about 2 months and my hair feels stronger too.    I have nothing bad to say about this product- although it would be much more handy if it came in a \\&quot;squirt\\&quot; type bottle :)</li>
            <li> This stuff really made my hair silky and shiny.  I love that you don&#x27;t need a lot so I know this bottle will last a very long time. :D</li>
            <li> Love this product. My hair dresser has used this for years and didnt tell me. I cant live without it. Great for the days I dont wash my hair. Smells great and makes hair shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair really gets frizzy in humidity, and this tames the beast.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily (after a couple minutes) and it keeps working for a number of days.  I use it with their shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.  My hair dresser friend told me about this product and I liked the sent of it.  So I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is soft and shiny.  It conditions more than the BioSilk but I like to use both rotating every other day.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a hair treatment, and for an occasional fix, it is excellent.  I give it 5 stars for taming frizzy hair, being easy to use and smelling great.  I keep this on hand for quick fixes, when I&#x27;m going out and want my hair to look (and smell!) great.  Perfect for that.  However, I would not use it after every shampoo, as it builds up on your hair.  But if you use it after every shampoo, I recommend  using B00099E8ZA once a week to remove all residue.  This will truly clean your hair and you can use the Moroccan oil regularly and not have the problems other reviewers have mentioned, and get the great benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Moroccan oil.  Like I said, 5 stars (and more if I could) for the great effect it has on your hair.  Will continue to use it.  I take away a star, because, like other reviewers, I&#x27;m not impressed with the ingredients.  I like natural ingredients, and if you say a product is Moroccan oil, than that should be the first ingredient.  I use a product for skin care [[ASIN:B007VEPVZC Bel Essence - (2oz) 100% All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]], and discovered after several months, that my eyelashes were longer and fuller, and my eyebrows were growing in better.  It&#x27;s 5 plant oils (including organic argan oil) - that&#x27;s all, no other ingredients, all natural.  I gave myself an oil treatment on my hair with it, just to try it out let sit for 15 minutes and then shampooed as usual, and my hair was noticeably softer.  I do this once a week or so to see what it will do for my hair.  This is the best skin care - slow change over a couple of months, but after about a week, your skin isn&#x27;t dry, and stays moisturized, after a couple of months, your skin is soft, lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine.  When I went to a new beauty shop the stylist used this on my hair.  We talked about this product and I was really pleased with the results.  I then looked it up on the internet and found the best deal.  I received it in a couple of days and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I believe this is not the real moroccan oil It smells like baby oil rather than the stinky musky scent of real moroccan oil. After reading the other reviews, I will see if I can get my money back for what is the equivalent of $2 worth of yellow baby oil.</li>
            <li> I have used it about 4 times now and do notice it leaves a definite shine i that wouldn&#x27;t be there without it. Like evrything it wears off after a day or so, though</li>
            <li> i have very thick, curly and frizzy dry hair; this product helps me handle my dry ends and keeps my hair healthy, soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> Great smell, even though it&#x27;s oil it isn&#x27;t greasy or uncomfortable. Makes my hair feel soft but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a product that is going to over time repair long term damage more of a short term solution.</li>
            <li> The oil is not the real thing!  I am very disappointed by both the retailer and Amazon.  Why Amazon is allowing merchants to sell fake stuff is beyond me and they have yet to give any satisfactory response to my complaint.  You are better off going to a real salon in your area and physically purchasing the stuff yourself.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, unruly hair.  This oil helps a lot!!  I usually put it in after my hair is dry after a shower and leave it in overnight.  Along with using It&#x27;s A Ten, my hair is 100% better</li>
            <li> I have bought this product several times at the salon and the price through Amazon is much better. Product works well. Adds shine to hair.</li>
            <li> I have oily and thin baby fine hair that I have to wash and blowdry every day.  It also has some out of control wave/curl action and frizz that get magnified when it&#x27;s humid so it gets straight ironed regularly and I dye it every 4-6 weeks.  Obviously, this is all a recipe for damaged and dried out hair.  I had heard about Moraccainoil but hadn&#x27;t tried it.  Then I saw a coupon promotion in a beauty magazine and sent away for it.  From the first moment I felt it in my hands and smoothed it into my hair I knew it was different from anything else I had tried, my hair feld light weight and bouncy even though it was still wet.  It&#x27;s also way lighter than any of the other frizz serums which tend to flatten and make my hair look oily if I use to much.  Moraccainoil also doesn&#x27;t leave a slippery residue on my hands, it speeds the drying time, smooths out frizz, and my hair is also in much better condition since I started using it almost 2 months ago.  It is quite simply the best condition/anti-frizz/blowdry product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product for softening my hair and it smells terrific.  I even use it on my skin from time to time.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. This is not the real product! False advertising. I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have natural  curly hair thats colored so i needed something that keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy this product works!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. I love it.</li>
            <li> This reduces the frizz in my hair significantly! I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair as much, to get rid of frizz. Some days I don&#x27;t even straighten it at all! Only problem is I am not a fan of the smell. My boyfriend likes the smell, so that goes to show the smell is really just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Wow~ Very very very Good~!&lt;br /&gt;I used this product and I knew directly.&lt;br /&gt;That it was the very remarkable choice!!</li>
            <li> Miracle oil!  Smells yummy too.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to.  leaves hair shiny and hydrated</li>
            <li> This oil is exactly what my aging hair needs. Only use a tiny amount. Worth every dime.</li>
            <li> Just a great product for my wife&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> This is the best hair treatment on the market!</li>
            <li> I dis not give it a good chance, for the bad smile it have thats why i decid to but it a way, after asking thwy told me the real Oragan oil it bad smile so it could be something good</li>
            <li> I just this on the ends of my hair where I flat irion and curl. I noticed right away that there are no more split ends.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan oil for the last 2 years,it is excellent for dry hair!  work it into the ends of wet hair before blowdrying!  don&#x27;t ever want to be without it again!! :-)</li>
            <li> Great product and this was a repeat purchase for me. I use it on my long locks and it keeps my hair moisturized and helps with tangles after showers. Be sure to carefully look at your product as I originally was sent some styling cream that had the blue label and is totally NOT the same.</li>
            <li> i love it . it save my dry hair . i use it everyday. but without hair conditioner and mask it makes little sense. definitely will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight (non-greasy) oil. I use as a finishing oil once I have flat ironed or blow dryed my hair. Adds sheen, makes hair silky without the feeling of build-up or weighing down my hair. Great for use on even fine hair. I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable... goes on silky smooth. Love the scent (overpowering though... so hopefully you find it pleasant as well)</li>
            <li> I have the small bottle of this oil and love the smell of it so much I decided to buy the larger bottle. Very disappointing as the fragrance is not the same. Not sure if the formula was somehow \\&quot;improved\\&quot; or changed but when I open the little bottle that is almost empty, it smells great. I also note that my old bottle has an expiration and this does not. There is an 18 month PAO (purchase-after-opening symbol) but I have no way to know how old it is.&lt;br /&gt;My hair also does not seem to be as tamed by it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am done using this if this is how it is now or maybe I need to purchase at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Light version of this for a while and really liked it but figured perhaps the original would do even more.  I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is what I&#x27;d call &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; but not baby-fine....and there&#x27;s much less of it as I age.  I was concerned that the original might weigh it down but it hasn&#x27;t.  It actually makes it appear as if my hair is much thicker again.  At my age, that&#x27;s a real bonus because I like to wear my hair a bit long (past shoulder length) but don&#x27;t want to look like a witch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some older reviews where people think they got fake bottles.  I bought mine from Comely People and have no reason to believe it&#x27;s anything but authentic (comparing smell to Light and the shampoo).</li>
            <li> This product, Moroccan oil, works very well.  Always have some on hand.  This is the third bottle I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my hair silky soft and and smooth. Smells amazing also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost one year. I discovered Moracconoil when my hairdresser used it on my hair, and I loved the way it smelled and how soft it made my hair. I bought some to use at home because I have very dry hair in the winter (static, brittle ends, everything). That was last winter. At first it worked great and I noticed a big improvement in my hair. This summer, I noticed that my hair was feeling really dry again but I kept using the Moracconoil. I recently read a review of Moracconoil on a beauty blog that explains why it has stopped working. Moracconoil is full of silicone, which coats your hair, preventing moisture from reaching your hair and making your hair drier. If you want to use this product regularly, you need to use a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> The best Moroccan hair oil on the market. Never greasy. I blow dry until my hair is slightly damp...add a bit of the oil, then finish drying. Always pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This oil doesnt leave my hair too oily. It lasts a long time. It works best putting in before using the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Want shiny and healthy hair. Use this! It also makes drying my hair faster! And a little goes a long way, so it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I expected great things from this product but it wasn&#x27;t amazing. It can be too greasy if you apply more than 2 pumps on your hair and I have very thick long hair. It doesn&#x27;t smell amazing either. The organix drugstore Moroccan oil smells way better than this. Now for treatment this product can smooth your flyways and hair strands but not great for treatment.</li>
            <li> This product is great and arrived very fast! I love it works great and smells like your on a tropical vacation!</li>
            <li> my hubby wanted me to buy this for him. he loves it. he has thick and coarse hair. he uses is almost everyday, keeps his hair soft</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I bought and got in within a few days of buying it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite all-time hair products! Definitely keep coming back this! Receive just as described. Very well pleased.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this product so much. Because of the name I assumed it was Argan oil from MOROCCO. It is called Moroccanoil after all. Turns out it&#x27;s made in Israel and Argan oil is like the 5th ingredient along with a number of other additives. Not only that, but it did nothing for my hair. I have curly hair that tends to get dry and I thought this would help. It did not. It was waste of my money and I will never again buy it. Nor would I recommend it. Support Argan oil co-ops in Morocco and buy the real thing, which is better for your hair anyway.</li>
            <li> My wife Annie loves this she uses it all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years but always bought it in a salon until I found it discounted here.  One of it&#x27;s features is the great smell...well this stuff smells bad, bad, bad!  It also feels, for lack of a better explanation, like it gunks up my hair.  It definitely does not have the same effect.  It is not worth the savings...I plan to just throw this bottle out and get a fresh bottle at a salon.</li>
            <li> I love the moroccan oil, and I love the perfum! My hair was so dry and now they are soft. For my type of hais is perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily but it does add shine. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 years old and notice my hair was starting to become dry.  I always use a good conditioner but it still seemed to lack luster.  I started using Moroccanoil while in Mexico last year.  Since starting to use this product my hair is so much better.  I&#x27;ve even given this as Christmas gifts to my sisters.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Still not sure if this is the original oil that I have bought at the salon.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time... works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it has lasted me over a year. I only use it   when my hair has a dull look.  It does not give off a high sheen like  the others I have used and smells so clean. Great for aging hair :)  but only on the ends!</li>
            <li> Este aceite es maravilloso! el olor es agradable. El pelo se te ve saludable y mejor hidratado, super brilloso y sedoso. Cuesta un poco comparado con otros, pelo vale la pena, solo se necesita un poquito.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over year. Make my hair so soft, shining,no frizz and smells so good. Since you only need a little the bottle last quite awhile. This is definately a must have.</li>
            <li> Worse hair oil ever.  DO NOT BUY IT.  THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOU THE MONEY.  JUST WASTE IT</li>
            <li> After seeing this product in multiple beauty magazines and reading all the reviews online, I was starting to feel like I could not live without this product. I have long (mid-back) virgin hair and it was just starting to feel very dry and less manageable so I figured I would give Moroccanoil a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I applied about two pumps worth to my towel dried hair and then let it dry overnight. I woke up late so I wasnt able to style it, but I did notice my hair feeling very soft. For trial #2, I put about 4 pumps in my hair (like I said, it&#x27;s very long and fairly thick) and made sure to blow it dry. I can&#x27;t really explain why, but I swear it made my hair feel dry, but at the same time, there was less frizz. This phenomenon happened the next time I blow dried and curled it as well. Lastly, I applied the product, let my hair dry overnight, and straightened it the next morning. I have the best results with this method, as my hair feels very soft and has less frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was looking for a product to decrease frizz, make styling easier and moisture my hair. For me, Moroccanoil is just so-so and not worth the high price tag. I&#x27;m actually trying to use up the bottle as fast as I can so I can try a different (perhaps pure) Argan oil product. **In fact, if anyone uses paypal and wants to buy my barely used bottle, I would be more than happy to sell it!!**</li>
            <li> First time I use this Argan oil. I really like how my hair looks, no frizz, healthy and very shiny. The Argan oil was the 2nd ingredient on the list. I purchased from PerfumesWorld. Oil is made in Israel. Pretty expensive for 3.4oz.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love !!! I purchaed the Moroccanoil because I have curly hair and wanted to get something to hydrate my hair.It is amazing my hair feels so healthy after I use it and it gets rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li> my hair is totally damaged from highlights and heating tools. It is dry, frizzed and unruly. I have tried alot of products to make it smooth and frizz free, nothing has really worked. This Moroccan Oil I do like because it has made my hair very soft but I still have some frizz spots no matter how much oil I put. I will try the Moroccan hydrating mask, see if that helps a bit more with the frizz.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Winter must.  This light weight oil is wonderful for my fine brunette hair.  It controls wisps and flyaway a and keeps my hair young and healthy looking.  The shine means that dry time is significantly longer.  But that means there is moisture in my hair!  I use this again and again... And always buy it on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with fake morracan oil.  I have tried the cheaper Aragon Oil... And it was heavier...  Oily and greasy.  :(.  My hands smell wonderful after I work a small dime size into my hair.  This amount usually lasts me four months.  Update 5/30/15:  What a great product for my six year olds fine hair when pulling up for braids and pony tails.   We don&#x27;t wash her hair everyday so sometimes baby powder (warmer in the summer) or THIS light oil is a wonderful answer on a tangle.  The leave in conditioners leave the hair heavy, dull and lank.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my hair! It was very dry and damage and now it feels like it actually has life back! Very soft and shiny! Love this product</li>
            <li> I like it - I  wish the others who claim to be 100% M oil were really like this $$$ one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Christmas for your hair every time you apply it!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many products on my fine but coarse hair.  This product is easy to use, smells fabulous, absorbs instantly and leaves no greasy residue.  It gives my hair a smooth, glossy finish.  Although it may seem a bit pricey, it lasts a very long time.  I have tried other, less expensive products that claimed to have similar properties, but I was never satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I put this oil on my hair roots every morning to help prevent drying from blow drying and straightening.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair (causasion hair) greasy.</li>
            <li> It is great and makes the hair so soft and silky! Love it and i use it on my face too!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this great conditioner!  My hair is wavy &amp; very thick.  This leaves absolutely no residue. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has a slight fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t feel too oily. My hair feels much smoother after putting this regularly. I would recommend this to all ladies who have frizzy and unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> My biracial daughter uses this &amp; it detangles &amp; softens well and smells amazing. Better on wet hair than dry.</li>
            <li> This product is not the real thing, buyers be aware.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, for far better price!!!</li>
            <li> a friend gave me a bottle of this i didnt know it costed this much i have to say i love the stuff i can put it in my hair wet or dry and its never greasy and its great on your skin to its way worth the price</li>
            <li> I always get told I smell good when I put this on. ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not entirely sure what Moroccan Oil is specifically supposed to achieve (in terms of growth or hair repair etc.), but it smells nice and adds light moisture and shine that I can use a few times a week without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Now that I am the big 6, my hair is a bit drier than it was when I was younger.  I also live in a very dry climate in western Colorado which also contributes to the dryness of my hair.  Moroccan Oil is the perfect additive to my hair to make it soft and moist again.  I have short hair so I only use a small amount on my fingers and spread it through all of my hair.  I can shower twice a day when necessary and if I use Moroccan Oil, my hair does not dry out.  I like the result!</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in hair oil. You only need a little in your palm, place it on damp hair and work it through. Hair looks healthier and less split ends. I&#x27;ve bought this product, along with other items in this line, time and time again. I love it!</li>
            <li> Tried this at suggestion of my Sister.  Makes my hair feel great!  Shines it up as well...  I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly light; hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down at all, which really pleased me since most serums are so heavy.</li>
            <li> Just great for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it was cheaper on here than I could get it at beuty stores.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hair treatment makes my hair feel fuller and yet soft and manageable. Does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for softening, silkening &amp; adding shine to my fine, partly bleach-damaged, dark blonde hair.  It also smells great!</li>
            <li> I have very very thick hair and living in the south with the humidity it is very hard to control in the summer! I have tried alot of products and this one works great!! Amazon has the best prices on good oils for your hair that work.  This stuff is expensive in the stores!!</li>
            <li> I love this product but the price went up :(</li>
            <li> Very light, imparts great shine-best scent ever! The imitations do not measure up!&lt;br /&gt;Use it sparingly on hair, then rub into hands</li>
            <li> Best thing ever so light and moisturizing AT THE SAME DAMN TIME .. Lol no but it&#x27;s awesome I love it my hair is getting stronger by the day.. Love the whole line.. Fyi I&#x27;m mixed race with curly fizzy hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a drug my hair needs it&#x27;s Moroccan oil.it leaves my hair so soft and frizz free&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in the low 20s and my hair is static free.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry, coarse, color treated hair and Moroccan Oil makes it soft, smooth, and shiny.  I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use this product is to apply a quarter size (I have a lot of hair) amount to damp hair (let it dry some), then blow dry.  My sister has fine hair and she finds that this product is too heavy and makes her hair limp and greasy so I would recommend it to people with thick/coarse hair.  I love the smell too!</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair feel so soft and silky, and my hair look so healthy. Bought it for myself and my sister.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and would recommend it to anyone with dry scalp and unruly hair. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> this is the best hair product I have ever tried. love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used on my dry colored hair. I can apply at any time and my hair looks healthy but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This whole line is AWESOME LOVE LOVE BUT THE PRICE THAT&#x27;S THE DOWN FALL</li>
            <li> One squirt and my sometimes frizzy coarse hair looks silky and sleek. Smells great too!!!!!! Helpful hint..to get sleek look, use very hot blow dryer setting and large brush!</li>
            <li> I had searched all over to get a better price. I could not beat it even with the minimal shipping and handeling</li>
            <li> Ive been using this moroccan oil for years and ill keep on buyin that product! It has a very good pleasant smell, and its not greasy even tho its oil! It gives my hair a great shiny look. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Great product for my wavy hair. I live in a dry climate and it really helps control frizziness.  I have used it for over 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is simply the best. There is no other product of this type that works as well on your hair. It keeps it hydrated and shiny and smooth without being greasy.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! The entire line is fantastic! I recommend it highly especially for those with curly hair. This is the best hair care line I have ever tried in my life. I have bought every product out there for curly hair and this is the only one that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> This is my second time to try and leave feedback as this seller removed the first one. The moroccanoil arrived leaking with the scent of stinky cheap cologne all over it. This seller is filling bottles with bogus moroccanoil, thats why so many people complain of it arriving leaking. Real Moroccanoil is sealed, and smells lovely. This seller will not refund my money and also removed my last feedback because it was negative.....so buyer beware. She states she is an authorized dealer but I seriously doubt that.</li>
            <li> I was exposed to this product via my fabulous hairdresser. As a woman who has colored her hair for 20 years I noticed an immmediate improvement that lasted through a wash everytime I saw my hairdresser. Now that I am using it weekly my hair is remarkably improved! Its like a weekly \\&quot;facial &amp; massage\\&quot; for your hair! I only wish it came in a larger quantity.</li>
            <li> I am Black with naturally curly hair and I really like the Moroccan Oil. It is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I rub a quarter size amount between my hands and rub through my hair before I flat iron it. I also rub a dime size amount through it before I wrap it and it smooths my ends...keeping me from having to use the heat as much.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it after my hair is dry to make extra soft. I alao use the hydrating cream after conditioner that isgreat also</li>
            <li> I got the shine and protection of my hair back.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants results right away.  Your hair will look and feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> My hair is very short, approx 1 in.  I bleach my hair every 3 weeks.  I don&#x27;t think I could get away with that without this product.  My hair stays very healthy feeling and looking.  Yes, I shutter at the price but there is nothing better.  It&#x27;s the Royals Royce of hair products.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well. It definitely leaves hair softer and much shinier. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the oily consistancy or the fact you only need about a dime size for normal hair falling past the shoulders. I can&#x27;t really say it fixed my split ends, but it does leave hair feeling much healthier. I rub this through my towel dried hair. The only drawback is that it is in a glass bottle and there is no spray or pump. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a product that would help control the frizz of my naturally curly hair as well as protect from blow-drying.  My hair dresser recommended Moroccan Oil and I love it!  It truly works!  The best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot per application, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a hair freak. Can spend any amount to get my hair and skin fixed.  This little bottle is also great for swimmers too.  I have used it on my 4.5 year old son who had no body to his hair. He&#x27;s young but I always believe that hair reflects your personality and some bit of work begins from childhood itself as my mother did the same for me. I always had good hair touchwood but now all have started complimenting my sons hair as soft, bouncy and shiny for his age. I don&#x27;t overdo it on him just once a week.   It&#x27;s great for long frizzy straight hair too. Please do invest the money if you have tried olive oil and it did not work for yu.  for best results mix it with few drops of olive oil to last longer and after a hot towel therapy wash it with nice shampoo. A bit can be applied on the roots after the wash for manageability and shine.  Enjoy the lovely hair. It&#x27;s magic if used correctly.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product and would recommend to anyone who uses a straightener or heated tools on a daily basis.  It helps protect my hair from drying out and getting split ends from repeated straightening.  I have also ordered pure Argon Oil from Amazon, but can&#x27;t use that on my hair as it looks greasy.  So this product is not pure Argon (Moroccan) Oil, but there is a reason for that.  This product works great without making my hair look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> A dear friend told me about this product.  Her son is a stylist in a high end salon.  The salon can&#x27;t keep this product in stock.  Decided to give it a try.  It is liquid gold for the hair.  This oil is absorbed into the hair so the hair does not feel oily. After just one use, my hair was softer and shiny.  After using several times, my hair is not only softer and more shiny but feels thicker.  I have long hair that is highlighted.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that I am no longer losing hair after shampooing.  This is a fabulous product and I highly recommend it.  However, stay away from the imitators!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! I&#x27;m always dying my hair blonde colours so my hair was getting really dry. I tried this and it made it silky smoothe and shiny. Most of my split ends are gone. It also smells great.. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> As hair ages it changes structure this oil treatment rejuvenates. One only needs a little to restore hair to more youthful flexibility.</li>
            <li> Awesome oil. Specially for a blond (damaged hair) . It&#x27;s making  my hair shiny and soft. The oil smell good too.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I tried everything to tame my frizzy hair and I was about done. Got this as a gift. Works wonders along with smelling super good. Worth the expensive price.</li>
            <li> I used this EXACTLY as directed with NO noticeable difference in my hair!  I was advised numerous times by my hair stylist how well this works to give my hair some shine as well as tame the frizzies.  Nadda!  This is a very high-price item to give no noticeable results.  Please save your hard-earned money.  There are plenty of other more reasonably priced products out there that do a good job. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan oil my hair is fine and then and it does not wait it down</li>
            <li> It is identical to what I bought at the hairdressers and works perfectly and smells great. Anyone who knocks this is just plain nuts. I use it just about every day.</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing for my hair. My hair is still frizzy as ever; as a matter of fact, I think it&#x27;s been looking worse and frizzier than before I started using this product. I have alot of very thick, wavy/curly hair and it sucks out my wave and/or curl and leaves it a bushy frizzy mess. Also, cannot use on dry hair, no matter how little I use or what other people say; it leaves it waxy and makes it ratty like it wants to start dreading. What a waste of money!! I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The brand that started it all.  Moroccan Oil delivers.  A little goes a real long way on the hair so this will last forever.</li>
            <li> Love it! Got it for a better price on Amazon than at the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I use Moroccan Oil all the time from the salon. I ordered it through this seller. The product was old and expired. It left my hair greasy. This was not the same that you get from the salon.</li>
            <li> I love Morrocanoil Treatment. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now. I have tried many other products with Argan oil and I always come back to this. This oil is the perfect blend of silicones and oil for my hair. I use it when my hair is damp prior to styling, and I touch up my hair with it after its dry. My hair is shiny and silky. I can also use it daily on my ends to keep them moisturized and tangle free. It also doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. I do have thick hair that is relaxed. It also has a wonderful, tropical smell that my husband loves. I would recommend this for anyone, especially dry, chemically treated hair for protection. Also, you will notice less breakage and your hair will become stronger over time. If you have fine hair, try the Morrocanoil Light. It works!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m if-y about if i would ever spend $37 on this product again. it didn&#x27;t give me the results i was looking for. mostly it just makes my hair feel heavy. i live in hawaii where it is usually pretty humid, which makes for a lot of bad hair days. i can say that it has helped with the frizz but it hasn&#x27;t made my hair feel crazy soft for long periods of time like everyone else has reported. it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told this was a knock off!!</li>
            <li> Perfect as described.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff not to oily if you don&#x27;t use to much and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan oil for years and it gives my hair a wonderful shine.  The best thing is that its absorbed into the hair and does not leave your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Some folks say the stuff bought on line is a fake.  Well, sorry that isn&#x27;t so.  I got my original sample years ago from my pricey upscale salon.  Recently I bought more, again at the same salon.  It looks like this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old stuff was pretty thick, and had an exotic wood/spice smell.  The smell sort of dissipated quickly, so it was not overpowering.  A tiny dab was all I needed to control the frizzies all day, and it left a nice, non greasy, smooth, feeling to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new stuff smells like generic perfume and is pretty watery.  It takes a lot to get the same control and leaves a slightly greasy feel to my hair.  HUGE disappointment!  I probably won&#x27;t buy any more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cost cutting measures  by the company  create an unacceptable product.</li>
            <li> Really helps my hair :)</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.  She uses it as directed and her hair looks great.  Seemed to be the best price for what we were looking for around us.</li>
            <li> This is a FAKE! Moroccanoil is extremely strict about its retailing. Salons have to sign waivers agreeing that they will not sell at discounted rates. Have you ever noticed how Moroccanoil is never on sale at salons? Only certified salons can sell Moroccanoil products, so anything Moroccanoil sold online will virtually be a fake product. I had to learn the hard way, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Have used it for several years.</li>
            <li> I love it!I can really feel the amazing effect and I do achieve soft, shiny hair.For an occasional fix, it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Makes my curly frizzy hair manageable, soft and smell great.  Recommend to every one.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shine and soft.  I used for over a year and I noticed how my hair got healthier and shinny.</li>
            <li> It works great on my dry scalp. I wear my hair straight and  my daughter wears braids and it works great for her scalp and her braids.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift. It arrived promptly and was in good condition. The recipient was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This oil gives your hair softness, shine and moisture it needs without weighing it down. You definitely see less breakage.</li>
            <li> It smelled weird when i bought it.  The package had also been tampered with.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s generic or what; but i will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Meh, doesn&#x27;t make my hair look/feel any smoother.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use one pump after each wash on hair that&#x27;s mid back length, so it last along time. It turns my permed color treated hair soft and shiny. It also eliminates frizz associated with blow drying.</li>
            <li> It is the best oil I have found.I love the scent and it is not too heavy. It has helped in the process of healing my burned hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF REALLY HELPS YOUR HAIR. MY ORDER WAS PERFECT AND LASTED ABOUT A YEAR.</li>
            <li> I love the way this works, from the smooth glow it gives my hair, to the nice smell it leaves in it. I use it w/every hair wash.</li>
            <li> Salon quality works great on my hair texture. This oil works on thick hair not thin.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it along with the shampoo and conditioner. My hair no longer feels dry and it is easier to style. The smell of this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this product works well on hair without making too oily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally fake! Don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s smelly after you put the oil on hair, the smell is totally different from the product I brought from the official website before.</li>
            <li> This oil is the best moroccan oil product out there. I&#x27;ve tried alternatives from Sally&#x27;s and some of the generic brands that drugstores came up with, but none perform like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely light weight oil-doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied to your scalp for additional moisture and will not make your hair appear oily if you put it directly on your scalp&lt;br /&gt;Adds shine&lt;br /&gt;Has a unique smell...I dont know what to compare it to, but I think it smells great. The smell stays in your hair all day, but isn&#x27;t so strong that people around you can smell it&lt;br /&gt;smooths split ends like no other product&lt;br /&gt;One pump goes a long way. If you&#x27;re concerned about the price of the product, keep in mind the 3.4 ox bottle will last you several months unless you have extremely thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Price...Amazon/Amazon sellers&#x27; prices are consistently the best for this product. I did a lot of research and its one of those products that doesn&#x27;t appear on flash deal sites or go on crazy markdowns elsewhere. That being said, it seems liek a lot of money to spend on some oil, but see my last point in pros...it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Moroccan Oil.  My hair is real thick and dry.  The oil makes it shine and more manageable to work with</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels with this product.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The size of the bottle is good because it comes with a dispenser that releases the perfect amount of the oil.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  I have been using it for over a year and will continue to order it forever.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of the negative reviews, as I placed my order before reading them, I was worried I was going to get a counterfeit product, but mine arrived in a nice new box covered in shrinkwrap plastic, a nice seal on the cap, and is the Moroccan Oil I am very familiar with.  Smells the same, does the right thing, what I received is just fine and dandy. Definitely the real thing.</li>
            <li> A impressão que tive ao passá-lo no cabelo molhado, logo após o banho, não foi das, já que quando cabelo secou, ele não tinha mudado quase nada, só tinha ficado meio \\&quot;lambido\\&quot;... Meu cabelo já é bem hidratado e um pouco ondulado, com um volume médio. Depois disso, dormi e quando acordei, percebi que o meu cabelo estava mais sedoso, um pouco mais liso, com muito menos frizz e muuito brilhante. Acordei e logo meu irmão já veio me falar que meu cabelo tava incrível e brilhante. Passando o dia, percebi também que ele está mais leve. Meu cabelo é bem grande, então tenho que usar uns 2 pumps e meio nele... Mas é um sucesso total, meu irmão e minha mãe já tão doidos pra poder usar também, logo vou ter que encomendar outro! Sobre o cheiro, que é a primeira coisa que todo mundo fala, me decepcionou... Não sei se é porque tava esperando o melhor cheiro do mundo, mas eu achei que não é tão bom assim.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. I have been using this for a few months now and can&#x27;t d without  it. Would recommend this to anyone . You will enjoy thoroughly.</li>
            <li> For some reason this product is extremely famous in Brazil and all my Brazilian friends who used Morrocan Oil recommended it me. I resisted a lot to make my first purchase because the price is a little exaggerated in my opinion. But I ended up buying and absolutely loved it. My hair has never received so many compliments!!! Just loved the product!!! Thanks a lot Brazilian friends, great advice!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Your hair will love it too.</li>
            <li> The product came a lot faster than expected.  The Moroccon oil is very smooth and improves the texture of my hair.  I recommend this to everyone; especially people with naturally curly or course hair.</li>
            <li> This product shipped faster than I&#x27;ve expecting,great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use it, my hair is really soft,and never clutter;but my hair is oil type,so I had dandruff after use it,anyway I will try to use shampoo without condition,then try to use this oil again, I think I would have surprise,I really like the smell!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for your hair. Awesome smell.</li>
            <li> Such quality! my salon started using this company, and they say they get really great reviews. I love the smooth finish and glow.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, long blonde hair that is prone to breakage and this has been my savior. It smells amazing and makes the ends as soft , shiny, and strong as the root.</li>
            <li> Great hair treatment! It makes my hair feel so soft! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Just ok.  Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this because of the reviews that said it was not genuine ... but, it is. Poor packaging, however.</li>
            <li> This smells nothing like the stuff you buy at the salon. It has a weird baby oil smell to it. It works pretty good as far as reducing frizz and making hair easy to comb through, but the smell is terrible. Very disappointed :-(</li>
            <li> My husband and I both LOVE this oil. He has pretty coarse hair and since using this after every wash, his hair is softer and less dry looking. I have really thick, wavy hair that is prone to frizziness. I love that I can use this oil on either dry or wet hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy. I like to run just a little dab through my hair every morning to help calm any fly aways and I also use it thoroughly after every wash. It leaves my hair super shiny, soft, and a lot smoother.  I got my first bottle in Christmas 2013 and just  had to order my second bottle a few weeks ago. So it really does last for a long time even with multiple users. Before I splurged on this oil I was using the Organix Argan oil and it just isn&#x27;t even on the same level as this. It is completely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It makes combing hair more manageable</li>
            <li> Fantastic for naturally curly thick hair.  Helps with drying time and condition of hair; a staple in my routine now.</li>
            <li> No hair oil treatment beats moraccan oil. Ove tried a lot of high end brands and keep coming back to this. Smells so very good.</li>
            <li> Works well, not greasy</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I love it in my hair and the feel is very silky a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. I&#x27;m a big fan of sweet smells, so I enjoy the vanilla scent. I use it along with leave in conditioner after a wash. Also while I flat iron my hair. The light oil is better for straightened hair, but when I wear my hair curly I prefer the heavier oil. My cousin recommended that I try pure Argon oil, which I can use on my skin as well as my hair. However, this product has sufficed for my hair needs.</li>
            <li> Best hair product series on line</li>
            <li> Great product, re-order</li>
            <li> Live on this stuff. Moistens air without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> The best thing on the market! I wish I would have had it sooner! I have been fighting with my curly hair my entire life! Best product I have ever used and believe me I have tried everything you can imagine!</li>
            <li> I tried argon oil because I could find it in local stores.  It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this.  My hair was breaking and shedding. Once I was able to find this on Amazon I bought it and used it again and my hair is back to being healthy looking in less than a month.  Very oily (like cooking oil), use small amount, put it on at bedtime and your hair is softer and healthier in weeks.</li>
            <li> Love the idea and the brand but my friends and I all broke out after using this product on our hair regularly for more than one week.  Breakouts are sometimes hard to diagnose but we did scientific experiments with several of us and wherever hair treated with this product came into regular contact with our skin it caused acne.  sad but that was our experience over 3 months of testing</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Moroccan Oil, and its makes my hair so soft and moisturized!!!  Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Oh yea - this is the perfect travel size of this great product that really supports healthy hair - I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It instantly restores shine and manageability to the hair without being too heavy. A must if you heat style your hair. This is the original....now everyone&#x27;s on the Argan Oil bandwagon, but I still stand by this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the mask at my salon in St Louis ( visiting) and my hair was in awful shape from processing, etc! Thought I&#x27;d share what tips my AWESOME stylist ( st louis ) told me to take home to my regular colorist - first when you towel dry hair DO NOT comb through , (the shaft can \\&quot; drink up oil\\&quot; prior to that but not much if you strip it w/ combing) put 2 pumps or 2 dime size into hair work it through, THEN comb through ( I&#x27;ve heard similarly to put  conditioner in hair right after wetting PrIOR to going in ocean salt can&#x27;t damage cuticle - it drinks up the first thing u put in- so swim caps good!) the oil was also recommended to ADD to the color by your colorist ( again two dime size ) mixed in prior to applying. I rarely write reviews so I&#x27;m just thrilled with this stuff or I wouldn&#x27;t take the time!!</li>
            <li> I started using Morrocan Hair Oil after a visit to the salon. I also use the flexible hair spray and occasionally get the shampoo and conditioner. I have very coarse, unpredictable hair but this brand name does wonders to my hair. I love how it smells and it eliminates frizz!  And it makes my hair so soft and grow so quick! I love Morrocan hair products and I will continue to use them all the time.</li>
            <li> This product is great. My hair is curly and frizzie but with the Moroccan Oil it becomes smooth and silky. I will be purchasing this product again and again!</li>
            <li> Only use a dab. I use it for the ends of my hair when my hair is wet or dry.  A small amount goes a long way!  Makes my hair smooth and silky.  Smells wonderful!  The pump works great!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Works well and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel amazing!</li>
            <li> This is Not my first time buying this product. It leaves the hair soft, manageable, and full of moisture.  Nothing else will do for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Shipper was only off by a day maybe not their fault could have been the post office because even their website said Wednesday and arrived Thursday.</li>
            <li> The only product I will ever use in my hair. Amazing results, does exactly what it days it will and best of all won&#x27;t eventually dry out your hair like other products (biosilk) that smooth and shine.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  The real thing.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again.  Too expensive and it did nothing more than other Moroccan oil treatments.</li>
            <li> good food for your hair, but it cannot make your hair shine if your hair has already damaged. use this one and a primer together!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Keeps my hair looking healthy and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for more than 2 years now. A friend recommended it to me. It leaves your hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I put a little bit in my hair, massaged it in, and the next day my hair was noticeably shinier.</li>
            <li> Great product! A1 Seller! Had it in 3 days!   My hair dresser shared this product with me the last time I was in and I could not believe the results. She used it and then gave me a sample to try. All I can say is \\&quot;AMAZING!\\&quot; I have fought with my hair for 25 + years and always dreamed of having smooth shiny hair like everyone else. But I always had coarse, unruly, frizzy hair. A good flat iron helped a good bit, but still it would eventualy frizz, even with humidity protectants and sprays. This stuff is so simple, but works perfectly. No fuzz or frizz, not greasy at all. All you need is a few drops, so it will last a long time. Hair dries super fast. It&#x27;s super slippery &amp; shiny with no residue. And you can use your usual styling products with it if you like. I can not believe the results. I highly recommend this and the Hair Mask that goes with it to use in the shower. I would like to try the Intense Curl Creme because there are time when I like a little curl, but under control.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin.  Add hair color and highlighting - the result is dry, brittle hair with frizzy ends.  This product does just what it says.  It does not make your hair greasy-ever.  I apply it to my hair after drying.  The frizzies are instantly tamed.  Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, I can often refresh my styling by re-applying this oil and brushing it in while applying heat from my hair dryer.  My hair looks shiny and fresh again.  My hair condition has slowly improved so that I do use less of the product now.  A bottle last forever and this price is great-much less than my hairdresser.  Incredible product.</li>
            <li> This product took almost 2 weeks to get and when it arrived there was no seal, this product was already opened and this was not the product my stylist used. There was NO smell at all and the color was not right. I| will never buy from this person again.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It makes my hair very soft and it feels extremely healthy.</li>
            <li> Good to keep hair soft and manageable. Have to use a very small amount or hair will weigh down</li>
            <li> I have medium long hair and I use this everyday. I live in the north where we have very dry air in the winter and this product is amazing. I use conditioner also, but I attribute the new softness of my hair to this leave in product. You only need a drop so it lasts a very long time. This amount should last me about 9 months. Thinking about trying the facial products now. My hair has never been so healthy. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A this point, this line is very well known and I also know it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but in my case it keeps the hair smoother, shinier and with its natural volume.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff and her hair looks great with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 6 yrs.  I have thick curly hair and this product helps to tame it. Love Love Love the Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> Fake, Fake, Fake!!!I would like to nicely let the Amazon Customers know that this product does not smell like the one that I buy in the hair salon for the past 5 years, the texture is not the same and this product is fake.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s great for styling.  It adds a lot of shine to my hair.  I also use this product on my hair extensions and wigs.  It adds life to them.  It has a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal moroccan oil, my sisters. I ordered with trepidation after seeing all those reviews about how this stuff was fake, but rest assured: the moroccan oil i just bought from thebestbeauty1046 is the real deal- the same magic elixer i&#x27;ve been buying in the salon for $10 more. If you have crazy cavewoman fly-way frizzies like i do, this stuff makes your &#x27;do look as good as a blow out on wash-n-wear hair. Seriously!</li>
            <li> This oil is incredible on my hair. I have thick hair and it works great. My hair looks healthier, silkier and easy to manage. I also like to use it on my skin, since it gives it a silky feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment for hair I have ever found.  It is light, love the smell, and my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I thought that one day I&#x27;d stop using it. That&#x27;s not going to happen. I don&#x27;t like chemical product-y smells, so I&#x27;m picky about what I put in my hair... And this smells fantastic, so that&#x27;s enough, but it does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I went to the hairdresser and she told me that 6 months of not cutting my hair had led to so much damage that unless I wanted a bob, I had to use this stuff just to keep the split ends manageable and to keep my split ends from splitting further up the follicle, and then I have to go in every 6 weeks where she&#x27;ll slowly cut off my damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought, \\&quot;Oh great. This means I get to have crappy hair for the next 4 months of my life.\\&quot; Luckily, my fairy hair-mother was serious when she said this stuff worked miracles on hair. It makes my long hair look great, not just smell great. And it feels so soft afterwards. I also like that I can use it on wet hair when I come out of the shower, not blow dry, and it&#x27;s still perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the little container and it&#x27;s not even half-way out of it and I&#x27;ve used it religiously for three weeks. A little goes a loong way since I have hair that goes to my elbows and I still only need barely more than a dime-size on my fingers. Getting this larger bottle would last anyone forever. It&#x27;s about $45, which SEEMS expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every dime and you won&#x27;t regret it for a second. It&#x27;s not even greasy on the fingers and I have yet to see an oil-stain on my towel or pillowcase, so let&#x27;s just say there are no \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; costs. :)</li>
            <li> I love moroccan oil it is make hair so soft and easy to comb hair</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment for your hair. It makes it smooth and shiny and so  manageable. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Genuine Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is liquid gold in a bottle.  My daughter&#x27;s a hairdresser who recommended I use it.  I couldn&#x27;t live without it now.  I color my hair and use a flatiron every day and it keeps my hair looking healthy.  Others have now come out with hair oil treatments that just aren&#x27;t as good.  It is on the expensive side but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I previously purchased in salons!  Much better price on amazon. Love this oil.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever used in this household.</li>
            <li> works great , smells great too</li>
            <li> great shine, not heavy on hair</li>
            <li> If you want Moroccan Oil this is NOT it. Sure they did a good job making it look authentic and professional but believe me when I tell you don&#x27;t put this stuff on your hands much less rub it in your hair and scalp. I&#x27;ve used the real Moroccan Oil for quite a few years now and this stuff is not the real deal. It smells like cheap flowers and feels like an oil slick. upon opening the bottle, I put a little bit on my hand to feel and smell. The scent is overwelming and sickeningly sweet. It seriously took several hand washes with soap and a brislted nail brish to get the oil slick off. DO NOT waste your time with this company and go out to a salon for your purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Hair has never been better.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you have dry hair or curly hair, it really moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Seller was prompt. I totally am stoked to use this with my other oils for my hair. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Listen, I am a product junkie. I bought Frizz-ease and Argan oil and hundreds of other products. I wish I could say you could substitute this expensive product for those but you cannot. This product works wonders. My hair felt softer, more alive and healed after one use. Days later the effect had not worn off. It is worth it.  Even my mother, who is critical (but loving) of me said my hair looked great and when she touched it she was amazed. Need I say more?     If you&#x27;re hesitant buy the smaller bottle first and then work your way up but this product is worth the cost. Buy this product,it&#x27;s very unlikely that you will be disappointed. It may not work the first time, it did for me, but it will make a difference.</li>
            <li> Great price and product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine from Amazon, but bought it based on the many good reviews here. I had high hopes for this stuff but disliked it immediately. I applied a very small amount (which isn&#x27;t always easy to do since there is no pump) and it made my hair feel like there was product in it. I could tell right away that it would start building up. It didn&#x27;t do a thing for styling either.     I have tried it a few times to give it a chance and because of the high price and money wasted and each time I dislike it even more. It does absolutely nothing to help in humidity and it makes my hair feel horrible. Giving it away - maybe, it&#x27;s my hair type - I hope someone else can use it since I paid so much. :(</li>
            <li> I love the way it softens and moisturizes my hair.  Just a little dab goes a long ways and I don&#x27;t have to do it but about once a month.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil and will continue to buy it.  Now that my income has been decreased I&#x27;ll be more cautious about how much I use, but I will keep buying it. It is a bit pricey but worth it to me.  So many people have commented on how great I smell and I don&#x27;t wear any perfumes, so I know it&#x27;s the Moroccan Oil.  It really tames my curly hair that is dry from color treatment.</li>
            <li> After a friend told me about Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment, I have been using it. It blends into my hair and leaves it feeling healthy with a shine.</li>
            <li> After trying this a few years ago I got hooked!  I can&#x27;t live without it now! I have bought many times and have always been pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item per request of my grandson&#x27;s wife.&lt;br /&gt;Evidently she uses it all the time, and is very pleased&lt;br /&gt;with it.</li>
            <li> This so far has been the best product for my hair, I have tried similar products from other brands, but since I tend to have dry hair this has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Use after each shower! Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!!! Only negative is &#x27;other&#x27; ingredients in this product besides the oil itself.  Wish they could claim it was all natural/organic, as that&#x27;s very important to me, but I won&#x27;t argue with results.  Will order time and time again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF MY HAIR LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL WHEN I UST THIS I PUT A TINY AMOUT ON FINGERS AND LIGHTLY TOUCH THE ENDS WITH IT TOO MUCH MAKES UR HAIR LOOK GREASY</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Moroccan Oil! I have fine, medium thick hair, which is why it is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t flatten my hait. With Moroccan Oil my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down and looks sensational. Oh... and it smells divine!</li>
            <li> I rated this a five because I bought it for my wife. She loves the stuff. I personnaly dont use it</li>
            <li> I love my Moroccan Oil but for the first time I reviewed the ingredients list and compared with a list of ingredients that are best to avoid in products. Looks like this is the last time I&#x27;ll be splurging on the product and replacing the money spent with something more natural</li>
            <li> My sister had gotten this and I tried it and loved it! So when I went looking for this but a bigger size, I was very happy to find this.  It&#x27;s $20 less than what I would&#x27;ve paid if I bought it where she originially bought hers.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel! It does not seem to matter if i put it on wet hair or dry hair. It does not make my hair heavy or greasy. It makes it feel very soft and adds shine.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have fine hair and it does not weigh it down. It makes it soft and bouncy.  I even have added it to my dry hair with great results. What I&#x27;m going to try next is to add a little to my hair before I color it.  It&#x27;s supposed to help the color absorb into the hair shaft better. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is great for people with curly frizzy hair. It helps smooth the hair and is great to use with a straightening iron. I found that I could of got it for the same price by going to an Ultra or Beauty brands store.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of split ends.  Since I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment it is difficult to locate any split ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of Moroccan Oil - every time I shampoo and sometimes in between.  I love this product and the price at Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years and its keep my hair from being too damaged while I grow it out..</li>
            <li> This product is surely an elixir..arrested hairfall right away..Calms your head..Dandruff gone, allergies gone...Pricey but this is what I would but instead of parabens going forward.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil!  What a miracle! I have been using CHI silk for years and decided to make the switch because my hair is much longer.  Not only were the sellers amazing and super sweet (they left me a note in their wonderfully wrapped package!! It made me smile) but the product is great!  I know 3.4 oz seems small but you use only a bit so I bet you could end up using a bottle every 6 months and be fine.  What are you waiting for? Grab yours!</li>
            <li> Since Ive started using Morrocan oil my hair texture has improved 100%.  It is silky and no split ends.&lt;br /&gt;My hair used to feel so dry and frizzy and this product has made it silky and manageable&lt;br /&gt;DOnt feel like i could do with out it</li>
            <li> great product for my hair. But I don&#x27;t like musky smell</li>
            <li> Love Moroccan Oil, 100% authentic and works great for my long hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, flat hair and this stuff makes a world of difference.  It makes my hair feel smoother, stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> Great for ALL hair types with or with out color... will not dry your hair out, gives your hair lots of shine and  for those  humid days and you need to tame your hair Moroccann Oil is GREAT..It is not heavy for your hair ...apply it to your hair wet or dry ....well worth the price...Using a high end shampoo and conditioner along  Moroccan oil will keep your hair from breaking and splitting....</li>
            <li> I found out about this product because my beautician uses it in my hair. It is not too heavy, smells great, and keeps my hair with a shine. I tend to use it about every 3 days or when I&#x27;m going to apply heat to my hair. It is expensive but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect protection for you hair if you blow dry it and straighten it almost everyday! I have been using it for years and my hair stylist is always amazed with how healthy my hair always looks even after 5 months without a trim!</li>
            <li> &amp; thought that this was what was needed for my three textured head of hair (naturally curly, straight &amp; with a birds nest).  But have found a new salon and Michael has helped me realize that the Moroccan oil is too heavy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, not only for hair but also the skin.</li>
            <li> I liked so much.the delivery was fast.the product arrived OK</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle.  Very good for my hair :)</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday on my beard. It gives the beard a nice healthy shine and helps to keep the hair soft. I has helped in keeping the hair from breaking off. I have a naturally white beard, and this product has helped it to stay soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter-in-law.  She has beautiful long hair.  Apply just drops to your hands, rub together, then work through your hair.  It gives incredible shine and does not feel oily.</li>
            <li> this is the best product in the world. i love this for my hair and love the smell of it too. i would buy tubs of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the Argon oil sold in beauty supply stores.  I recommend this product for everyone</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair treatment of all time. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I used to buy it at Nordstrom, but the was a great deal on it! Recommend.</li>
            <li> The pump is broken when I got it, I literally  had to glue it together, and is very inconvenient to use, I just through the pump away</li>
            <li> Worked well, just as advertised and hoped for!</li>
            <li> I really love it! Takes away the frizz. This product helps with the dryness after highlights. I would recommend highly.I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product around for dry aging hair. I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth by using Moroccan oil :)</li>
            <li> smell good and make my hair better</li>
            <li> This product is one not to skimp on.  There are other products out there but this one is the bomb.  BUY IT</li>
            <li> Helps keep hair shiny and scalp in good condition. Do not need to use alot at one time so it lasts a long time and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I thought it was great until I tried 100% argon oil by Watts Beauty which is comparable in price. I</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this product for me after a salon used it on my hair.  I have naturally straight hair, but it is chemically treated and can be dry.  I have tried other oils and it weighs my long hair down and it looks greasy immediately.  When I use this oil, it makes my hair straight, shiny and weightless.  I love it.  I use it after I wash my hair and before I blow dry to enhance my blowdry and make my hair look silky and gorgeous.  I use it on my dry hair to tame and correct split ends and fly aways.  This is an amazing product and will last a very long time as you don&#x27;t have to use much for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this vendor. They took care in the packaging and it was shipped on time.. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly. Leaves a glossy sheen to hair. I was hoping it would help with splits, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a change there. Pricey enough that I moved onto other products</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hair is awesome! Gives a very high hydration to the hair. Just need to put a 5 cents coin size in your hand and the to the hair before the hairdryer. Just need to make sure to not put too much otherwise the hair will get oily. I did that once but it was my fault and not the product lol. The product is very good and I highly recommend you to buy it without any issues!</li>
            <li> It feels like heaven on your hair, that&#x27;s the only way I can describe it. I put it on right after I wash my hair and I swear it makes all the difference. It doesn&#x27;t weight down my waves, it smells amazing and it makes my hair feel soft/look shiny. The only obvious con is the price T_T. Also, the bottle lasts a long time if you just use one or two pumps per use! (it depends on how often you wash your hair as well..I wash mine twice a week). If you&#x27;re hesistant about the price, I get it. But all I have to say is that this very worth it and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> if you have a very dry hair or damaged hair, just try this. Apply when the hair still have some moisturize and only use on the hair tail.</li>
            <li> I got this size because I love the way it tames my flyaway hair and use it daily - this is the perfect size for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is a way to provide income for Morrocan women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I love the smell, and so does my family.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the product and the service. Everything went well. I am happy with my purchase and with purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my sister and I can not thank her enough. Your hair will become sleek and shiny. It is expensive, but worth it. A small amount goes a long way. I can not live without this product.</li>
            <li> By now everyone knows about Moroccan oil.  It&#x27;s wonderful for thick, curly, or unruly hair.  Makes it shiny and manageable.  Since my hair is thin, this product didn&#x27;t work so well for me, since I need body added to my hair.  I gave it to my daughter, who has the thick, gorgeous hair and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this product--when you can get it when it&#x27;s not a counterfeit or if the seller actually delivers!  I have used this product since the fall.  It has a light scent (kind of like a vanilla, but lighter and not as cloying), does not weigh hair down (I have shoulder length hair and use a dime sized puddle).  My recommendations is to buy from reputable sellers.  Check their storefronts to ensure that they have good feedback.  For some reason, this product is easily counterfeited.  When you have genuine Moroccan Oil, expect less frizz, nice shine and manageability without a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look.  It absorbs quickly and easily into the hair with hardly any residue on the hands.  Even massaged in the hands feels good!  I love Moroccan Oil!</li>
            <li> Simply put.....this is the best hair product for any hair type! Smells great &amp; makes your hair silky smooth - Love it!</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment is great for frizzy curly hair shoulder length. This is a true shine but the price is too high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a fake bottle.  I purchased moroccan oil based upon the fabulous reviews and used the bottle in it&#x27;s entirety.  I went to get my hair cut at a salon and my stylist applied a pump of their moroccan oil to my hair at the end of my session.  IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.  The smell and feel of the oil from the salon was phenomenal compared to what I had purchased through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moroccan oil hair treatment itself, is great.  What I received did nothing for my hair and ... might as well have been vegetable oil with food coloring.</li>
            <li> My hair will never be without this product for the rest of my life now that I have discovered this. The price at Amazon is very similar to retail and I had to pay shipping. So I think I could have gotten this at a slightly lower price had I just picked it up at the salon. I&#x27;m a loyal Amazon customer so I ordered it here. This particular seller sent this oil in a well protected package. Nice touch.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product after 20 years of frizzies finally a product that really works and smells great to</li>
            <li> Cheaper than what was in stores and exactly what I expected. Arrived on time and nice because it had the pump!</li>
            <li> Love this. My hairdresser recommended it to repair my hair, damaged from years of blow dryers &amp; coloring. I use it daily &amp; it works. Smells great too! Pricy but one bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is way too expensive for what it is. $5 Garnier Fructis Serum also has argan oil and works just as well!</li>
            <li> Love it!  And you can&#x27;t get it at this price anywhere</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It smells good, makes my hair silky soft and keeps the frizz away. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I think this is great therapy for the hair. I put it in after shampooing and I can feel the tangles go away.</li>
            <li> Even with my Brazilian Blowout, I highlight my hair so need Moroccan Oil. They said it would arrive no later than 4/8, and it arrived on exactly 4/8.</li>
            <li> I want to buy another one for my mom. My hair dry faster after I use it. And I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Been using Moroccan Oil for awhile now and this is my first time ordering it online and it shipped way faster then expected!!  This product is great for thick coarse hair. Really helps with fly a ways and makes hair silky smooth. A small amount of this product goes a long way even on the thickest of hair like mine!!!  I give this product two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairstylist about 2 years ago and I love it.  My hair is so shiny and soft, I get so many compliments.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but because you really only need one squirt of it, the bottle lasts a long time.  Plus it&#x27;s the only product that I use now besides a little hairspray.  My hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> great....I Have purchased for 5 times.....feel like addicted to it</li>
            <li> excellent oil for hair and only a small amount can let your hair look good. I will keep using this one.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for this for Christmas and loves it. She has very long straight hair and loves how it feels after using this product. Her only objection is that the pump is difficult to regulate, and at this price, you really don&#x27;t want to waste any!</li>
            <li> When I started using this Morrocan Oil, I received pleasant results. After a few weeks, I started to take notice that my hair has had its natural glow. It became evident to me then that the Morrocan Oil was extremely of great help.&lt;br /&gt;Up to now, I still have my monthly supply of this amazing oil.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t Over Do It like you can with other hair moisturizers.  It mositurizes and keeps fly aways away but does not make your hair separate and look greasy.</li>
            <li> Recently I bought this, but I found out this is a fake.&lt;br /&gt;You need to watch out. The quality was poor, so I compared it with original one.&lt;br /&gt;The front and backside levels were similar, but different.&lt;br /&gt;It has QR code, but the QR code scanner could not read it.&lt;br /&gt;The picture on this website is different from what I&#x27;ve got.&lt;br /&gt;You need to be careful!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look that shiny.</li>
            <li> Excellent I want more</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF AND THE SMELL IS TO DIE FOR!!! A little goes a long way so I can justify the price.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil. I use it everyday.  I have locs and I love that it does not build up in my hair. My whole family uses this oil. Its great on  natural hair, permed hair, weave etc.</li>
            <li> I have very fine curly hair that can be very dry.  Moroccan oil has really helped.  I put a very small amount in my wet hair and it really makes a difference.  When my hair is dry I can scrunch in a very small amount and it further helps the situation.  It is quite expensive, but since a little bit goes a long way, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Morocanoil products are great and I´d highly recommend it to everyone looking for the perfect purchase, works like a charm</li>
            <li> I love this product it calms my hair down and it looks so soft and shiny love it. I know longer have to wash my hair daily just rub some oil on the ends and curl as usual and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product for your hair!</li>
            <li> I am African American with type 3c hair and this product leaves my hair frizzy and does not define my natural curl. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Pricey but good not live without it!</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil.  My fancy main line hair salon uses it so I decided to buy it myself.  It makes my hair which is naturally course feel incredibly smooth and soft.  It was shipped to me quite quickly as well all with a decent price.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these ~ I received only ONE while they replaced, w/o my permission the others with a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version for blondes with fine hair.  NOT @ all happy w/them.</li>
            <li> I doubt this is really moroccan oil.  It smells TERRIBLE. Will not use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product for dry hair that is light,not greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this on my long haired dogs and their coats are so silky.</li>
            <li> I had to return this as the Moroccanoil scent was different than all my previous purchases from a salon.</li>
            <li> I spent too much money on this product because I though this is going to be different but it is not.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to keep my hair shiny and smooth.  It also removes tangles and smells good but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have had Moroccan Oil before and the bottle I recently purchased does not feel like the first bottle I purchased from a local shop.  I am not happy with the way it works.  It does even smell like the true Moroccan Oil.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment was originally recommended to me by my hairdresser because of the dry weather here in Northern Nevada.  My hair is naturally curly but can get a little frizzy if iti gets too dry.  I use this product on wet hair after washing it.  Just a little dab (maybe the size of a dime), do it lasts a very long time.  Worth the price and then some.</li>
            <li> great  it is really amazing my hair looks so pretty  and soft  I recommend  it for all types of hair</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Other than the fact that it&#x27;s way too expensive -- it does the job.  Plus the smell is luscious.  I&#x27;d buy it again and again.  But please lower the price. Even though it&#x27;s coming all the way from Israel and pricey -- I hope they don&#x27;t start making it in China as a knock-off!!!  I did buy some at Sallys Beauty Supply Outlet thinking it was the same, but it certainly was not and I ended up taking it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to buy hair products. I&#x27;d never regularly used one before this, but a hairdresser put it in my hair at an appointment and I was instantly addicted. It has a nice soft smell that I get complimented on. I&#x27;m usually sensitive to smells but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, just occasionally I get a whiff and it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my hair so soft and healthy-feeling. My hair used to be stringy and straw-like, but now it is just soft and smooth since I use this every day. Love it. The hairdresser also said that it helps protect your hair if you blow dry it daily - not really sure if that is true or not, but I thought I&#x27;d throw that in there.</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil smells fabulous, and helps with frizz and fly aways, it smells so fab, people ask what do you have on that smells so great? I don&#x27;t wear perfumes due to allergies but this is a nice subtle tone that does not affect me. It makes hair look young and adds shine and luster</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else. I have very long blonde hair (I can sit on it) and this softens my hair so it&#x27;s silky, but doesn&#x27;t make it look or feel greasy. Blonde hair has a tendency to look greasy when moisturized, but this product avoids that! Love it!</li>
            <li> I learned about Moroccan Oil from my hair dresser who recommended it to help with my dry frizzy hair.  LOVE IT!!!  I rarely have to use other products to get soft shiny hair.  Plus, I think it helps to repair any damage.  My hair feels 100% better using this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Really helps my damaged hair smoother and shinier! Smells great at the same time without leaving grease on hair. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser initially recommended Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment.  This is the best hair product I have ever used and I have used a lot of products.  My hair is problem hair; curly, frizzy, thick and dry.  But Moroccan Oil gives me hair I can live with and really addresses those problems.  The great thing too is that you only need a small amount and the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> the best oil treatment ever!!!</li>
            <li> If you have any frizz or curly to your hair and want that movie star sleek non-out-of-control hair then this is the product for you. You will be throwing out all the other gimmick hair products because you will realize you are now a part of one of the best kept hair product secrets!!! I recommend watching some Youtube videos that will guide you on how to maximize the outcome for your best results. Worth every $$$ and last and last. Be beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this hair oil treatment. I have used it a couple of years now and it keeps my hair in great condition with a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> Received within 3 days of order. Just the perfect product. I will be ordering from this dealer again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The wife loves this stuff.  Been using it for years. Best stuff she says for her hair won&#x27;t use anything else.  Next buy will be the larger&lt;br /&gt;size offered. Hey, I even use it every once in a while. Works great.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my curly/frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> deliver on time and my wife love it</li>
            <li> Very good results!!! I love it, it leaves your hair soft and ready to comb. If you have a treated hair this product is perfect for your hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all women.  It works on all types of hair.  I have very fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it oily or weighed down.  I am still able to style my hair just like i normally do. Leaves your hair shiney and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> Love Morroccan Oil Hair Treatment.  Other products weigh down my hair. Works with it and not against it. Controls the unruly strands and enhances the curly ones.</li>
            <li> Does not leave hair greasy. Applied to wet hair and corrected the dryness.works much better than the Moroccan hydrating styling cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair havenever  been so glossy and shiny and smelled so great. I gave it to all my friends for x- mas</li>
            <li> Finally a great product for hair, does not make it greasy or weigh it down.  Hair is silky smooth.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love morroccan oil hair care. I started using it last summer and it is incredible. I started with the moisuture repair conditioner and shampoo. The conditioner is a miracle. It&#x27;s really excellent for African hair types especially with damage. It stops breakage on the spot while meeting it conditioned, smelling wonderful, and mousturized for days. It helps promote strong hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just begin using the healing oil 2 days ago and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet. I remember reading a few reviews before purchasing. A reviewer mentioned how it makes hair feel like silk which is so true! It really does! It absorbs into hair fast which is amazing but I haven&#x27;t noticed any help with breakage yet, which I am praying to God it does. I am thinking maybe I need to give it some more time to work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week now since I&#x27;ve been using the product and I have been using it daily to  see if it would help and change the health of my hair but nothing. My hair is still shedding like mad after putting a stupid curl texturizer in which I wish I never did but I trusted this would work right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am very upset and disappointed. I was so hopeful for this product to be a miraculous miracle. Maybe I am not using it correctly?. It does exactly what it says as far as absorbing into the hair, making it very slick and managable (due to the fact I hear there are silocones in it) Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love morroccan oil and their conditioner is excellent. I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this supposedly healing oil to anyone with very kinky unpermed or not fine hair but rather the shampoo and conditioner. I will definitely try some of the other products that other reviewers are taking about.  That has  pure argon oil which I can use on my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am an African American make growing out my hair and no longer cutting it because it&#x27;s expensive. My hair grows way too fast, 3 days after doing my own shape ups and about 5 days coming from the barbers. I&#x27;m thinking about finding a good Dominican salon to go get wash and sets every now and then once my hair reaches neck length which will be by this summe.&lt;br /&gt;I will see if there is anything I am doing wrong before switching. I love Morroccan Oil products too much to be giving up on them so fastout 5 days coming from the barbers. I&#x27;m thinking about finding a good Dominican salon to go get wash and sets every now and then once my hair reaches neck length which will be by this summe.&lt;br /&gt;I will see if there is anything I am doing wrong before switching. I love Morroccan Oil products too much to be giving up on them so fast</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair is so smooth now and it also smells great!! Definetely my favorite hair product, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for any type of hair!  If you have doubts, try a bottle and you won&#x27;t regret it. Like me, you&#x27;ll come back for more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Moroccan oil! My hair is more full and I has an amazing shine. This product does not make my hair feel like a grease ball as other ones have. Recommend to anyone with dry or damaged hair :)</li>
            <li> Omg, I loved it.  It makes my hair si soft, gives ir a body and more natural shine. pricy but won&#x27;t regret what u paid.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be a little dry at times from coloring and once the color starts to fade [red] it loses shine.  Well, just apply a little of this [tiny amount] in the palm of your hands and apply to hair.  Not too much or it will get oily.  I use it every time I wash my hair and any time I need a little livening up.  Lately I have been using the Moroccan oil Glisten and spraying it on, too at the end of styling.  It is superb also.</li>
            <li> After someone at work told me about this product I went out and bought it.  My hair is naturally curly and frizzy and top that off with putting highlights in my hair, it can look a mess.  With this product, I put it in before drying and before styling with a flat iron.  I&#x27;m here to tell you that this worked fantastic!  Even with high humidity my hair did not frizz and it&#x27;s as straight as it was when I styled it.  Not even sweat affects the way my hair looks.  And the feel is so soft.  I&#x27;ve had my hair highlighted before and the blond strands feel like horse hair.  Not with this product.  My hair is extremely soft and beautiful.  I would recommend this to anyone that has unruly frizzy hair.  IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> Very pure oil.  Great for finishing the hairdo or putting a drop on damp hair after shampoo.  it is good for winter skin, dry nails, and a few drops go a long way, leaving no oily feeling at all.  This size bottle will last a long time.  I have used it regularly for several months and the bottle is still very full.  This is very pure oil, with nothing added.</li>
            <li> Light.  Nice fragrance</li>
            <li> the oil smell good, but the result isn&#x27;t that good as other people saying..hair doesn&#x27;t feel smooth after applying it..</li>
            <li> Best Moroccan oil ever and this is the best money I spend on my hair....ever!  Thank goodness for Moroccan oil!</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly as I expected. Seriously? There is a word number requirement?</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for all hair types.  I have processed hair and wanted a treatment that wasnt messy and could use overnight. Wake up and my hair is so and luxurious!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It lasts me about 6 months (not using it every single day, but close to it).  Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It makes my hair soft and shiny. It also smells wonderful. Hint: a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and this is the best product I have experienced to help comb through when my hair is damp and give shine to when dry, Smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure &#x27;why&#x27; this product i received is of lesser quality?  But, it is.  This is disappointing.  I feel that the product I received is not of the same quality as before.</li>
            <li> I let my cheap side get the best of me and purchased a less expensive brand than this. Needless to say, that was an expensive purchase to use as lotion because it was nothing like this brand and I wouldn&#x27;t use it in my hair. There is nothing that compares to Moroccan brand and this one smells so nice! Won&#x27;t every go to the cheap side again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new in using this product I&amp;#34;ve been using it for about 2 years and I&#x27;ll keep using it. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair thanks you so much!</li>
            <li> I love moroccan oil. It is very nice for our hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now. Its really worked well for me</li>
            <li> This product is the best find for my hair I have ever experienced.  I will be a lifetime buyer.  I have very thick but fine hair, which means - it will look dry because it becomes frizzy, fly aways, etc.  My hair is long and long layered and when I use this, 2 pumps worth on 3/4 of lower length of hair then I dry it.  I don&#x27;t have to style, nor use a flat iron unless I am going to a special event, dinner, etc. then all I do is use the flatiron with half the amount of time it used to take before I found this oil. This product has also helped my hair become more healthy, less breakage and there is no heavy feel to it.  I get so many compliments, especially when I flat iron after.  I also use Aveda Brilliant, damage control, protects from heat, this helps for the flat iron. I spray that one all over my hair after the Moroccan Oil is brushed through, then brush again and blow dry, then wa la!</li>
            <li> The drug store versions of this product can&#x27;t compare.  This product helped immensely with my dry, damaged hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best for dry fly away hair!  I can&#x27;t imagine what it would do for normal hair.  Leaves my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li> love love love&lt;br /&gt;works great as heat protection with wet and dry hair , smells amazing and makes my hair soft plus the nurishment effect. highly recommend .</li>
            <li> My daughter always wake up in the morning with tangled hair, but after using this, it&#x27;s much easier to brush her hair now. I use only a little bit (the size of a nickel) after I wash her hair and let it air dry. My daughter likes the pampering from her mommy, too. I would have given it a 5 star if the price is not so high. FYI, the scent is a little rather strong.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and color treated so it can get really dry.  This makes it look great, smell great and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Different scent than the small bottle I was using, but very nice.</li>
            <li> Very good product! makes my hair shine!!!</li>
            <li> A good price &amp; I received it quickly!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of most products, but I love the smell of this Moroccan oil. I just don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s actually soaking into my hair and improving its quality. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to get rid of frizz and stray hairs when I apply it.</li>
            <li> The real company does not sell online or is anyone suppose to. It&#x27;s  called diversion!  Go to a local salon theycsn get you the real product.  Never buy professional  beauty products  online. Most will be fake.</li>
            <li> Good product and shipped in time.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse and extremely curly hair, and live in a very humid climate. This product makes styling much easier and pretty much eliminates frizz. Provides a great shine and has a wonderful scent. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The whole line of products are awesome! Love all of them. The smell lovely and work like charm!!! Used this one, shampoo, conditioner and moose. All great!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have thick wavy hair and this product leaves my hair manageable and soft. 👍</li>
            <li> The best finishing product for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my hair the shine that it needs and it lasts. It makes all the dry ends look so healthy....</li>
            <li> Love this product! Hair soft,  shiny,  easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and it&#x27;s awesome for dry hair, and you don&#x27;t need much so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> On time and as described</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at the Israel Duty Free Shop and loved it.  Itnjust takes a few drops to  create a lovely, non greasy shine to my gray hair. people comment favorably when seeing the effect.</li>
            <li> This stuffs really helps my hair, no frizz, and works better than conditioner.  You only need a drop itch short hair and bottle lasts a year!</li>
            <li> I used it every time I washed my hair as my hair is so dry and frizzy. I put it on towel-dried hair.</li>
            <li> Can I give more than 5 stars? This oil is the perfect thing to finish styling your hair. smells great and hair becomes perfect.</li>
            <li> This was for my mother for Christmas and when she uses it her hair looks amazing!&lt;br /&gt; She is 80 years old.</li>
            <li> This hair oil is great for very dry, overprocessed, over-straightened hair. Use it with the hair masque and your dry, coarse hair is soft. Oil is great for flyaways from the flat iron. I love it and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to control frizz without weighing your hair down. It smells great and I have recommended it to several friends. The larger size bottle (3.4 oz) will last for several months.</li>
            <li> I loved it! It left my hair very bright and soft. My hair was really beautiful. I figured this would leave my hair heavy and opaque when first tried it, but it surprised me. A fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This product is great in helping soften and smooth fly aways and split ends. It works great with a smoothing iron or curling iron. Love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and have been using it for almost 2 years now. It makes my hair shiny and tames the fly aways. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells great too.</li>
            <li> If you have problems with frizzy hair, thiis is the product for you.  It only takes a small amount of product.  This bottle will probably last me a year, or more.  My stylist gave me a sample of the product last year. It was the same thing except that bottle seemed to have some styling product in it.  However, I don&#x27;t see how it could be any different.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really tames my frizzy curly hair. It makes my hair smooth and soft and it smells so good. If only it were a little cheaper I would buy it more often.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny.  Use it weekly.  Thanks for a great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have coarse, curly hair. This proudct used in moderation keeps hair from frizzing and smells so good!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and use it almost on a daily basis. A little bit goes a long way. Too much of it can make your hair oily. I use it on my damp hair and it makes a difference when I dry them off. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this product,  I use daily a small drop to my dry hair and it helps it from getting tangled and knotted though out the day.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Does the job for sure.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy it, it contains very toxic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt; This product is so toxic that it can cause excessive skin dryness, hives, irritate and inflame eczema on contact with your hands. The product contains less than 5-10% of the original oil in the formula. The formula consists of numerous toxic ingredients that are formulated to provide a smell and a feel of some type of oil. The Ingredients are on the box and not the container because they do not want the consumer to become aware the high level of toxins in the product. This products was placed and the hands of celebrities and the rest is history.&lt;br /&gt;Read the article before you make decision to buy it.  [...]</li>
            <li> Have loved this product for many years...but growing increasingly hard to find in local salons. I have straight fine blonde hair and this stuff keeps me from getting frizzy. I use with and without blowdrying and I never look greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever! I use it everyday and it has changed my hair. I will never use another oil!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t scream fake because I have no clue. It is the same label as sold elsewhere. I am not a Moroccan fan of anything.  It is suppose to be great for split ends and adding moisture. I&#x27;m not seeing it! No more Moroccan anything for me!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells good and makes my long, wild hair look shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hair when my stylist told me it&#x27;ll help with brittle and dry hair - I use it a few times a week, very little dollop, and it works great.  I also love the smell.  It makes my hair look good and feel good.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have found to manage my naturally curly long hair.  My ends tend to get dry, no matter how much I condition, and this helps to extend the time between visits to the salon for a trim to shape them up (sorry, Grant)!  I first purchased this at the salon, but since then have gotten it on Amazon - at a savings!  My sister, who has the same type of hair, was using a spray in gel product that is available in most stores, and it was drying up her ends and breaking her hair off, in addition to being a hot mess after sleeping, forcing her to wash it every day if she wanted to avoid a bad hair day.  I told her to try this and now she is using it herself - and loves it, too!</li>
            <li> The girl that does my hair uses this in her salon. When I asked her what she put on my hair each time to make it feel so silky, she showed me the oil in the blue bottle/box. She said it was pricey but it took only a small amt (dime size). So I purchased the Moroccan Oil from Amazon (was cheaper here than anywhere else). This stuff is great. It makes my hair feel so good and it is healthy for your hair especially if you blow dry or use a curling/flat iron. And it doesn&#x27;t take very much @ all to make your hair feel silky until you shampoo it again. They have Moroccan Oil in stores like Wal-Mart and Wal-Greens but it&#x27;s not the real oil. I will definitely continue to purchase this for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t typically much on hair care, but this is my one splurge. It smells phenomenal, and keeps my hair nice and silky. I&#x27;ll put some on my damp hair before blow-drying, or just after I&#x27;ve let my hair air dry and I don&#x27;t want my curls to be so frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not only does it smell great, when I put it on my hair before drying, my hair dries faster.</li>
            <li> i looked everywhere for moroccan oil and could not find any until i came across this. so far i like it. i dont use it everyday  a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great hair product if you have frizzy hair that needs taming. A little goes a long way so 1 bottle lasts me a couple months. It&#x27;s the only product I ever use anymore. It makes my hair more silky and smooth and if I decide to straighten it, it makes that process much faster and easier too. All in all, my hair is healthier and looks better.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair every time I wash it. I can tell a dramatic difference from the times I do use it compared to the times I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  It has some natural curl/wave in it and seems to go where ever it wants.  Moroccan oil is a tamer.</li>
            <li> The best hair oil I ever used before ! It is so good to my hair! I like it! So good!</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic.  I have used it for years and will not try anything else.  However, I will not order it from amazon again.  The bottle leaked!!!!!!! The box had a large spot of oil on it.  The product is expensive and I do not want any wasted.  The next time I need Moroccan oil, I will buy locally.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels now that I&#x27;ve found this product.</li>
            <li> This product is just as described.  Without making your hair greasy, it makes it very soft and manageable.  My hair has been processed for 20 years and has been damaged a lot.  I can&#x27;t say it is a hundred percent better.  But, I noticed even on the first day a BIG difference in my hair.  Definitely will continue to use and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Does everything they say.  Smells amazing, feels amazing, looks amazing... I probably don&#x27;t need to, but I use it everyday, simply because it smells so good and makes my hair so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t put it at your roots or you&#x27;ll look greasy.  Sometimes if your hair is really dry it will sit on top for a few minutes but then when it soaks in you can see the difference.  Also, I use it a lot after I dye my hair, and it keeps it from getting brittle and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone who cares about healthy hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this stuff but was selling it at a much higher price.  She gave me the sample bottle and told me to try it for a while to make sure I like it.  Well, I love it!  But I went onto Amazaon and they had it for much cheaper plus free shipping.  I&#x27;m hooked on this product.  Dries my thick, curly hair in half the time.  Now I don&#x27;t mind blowing my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Moroccanoil. My hairdresser uses it on my hair and I always have a great hair day but she sells it for almost double what I paid on Amazon. It makes my hair dry in half the time AND holds my style all day without too much product. I get compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks. You only need to use a very small amount on damp hair so one bottle does last quite a while!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Really nice fragrance. I have been using this for 2 months, almost daily, and will continue to use it.  Smooths hair but isn&#x27;t too oily.</li>
            <li> I work in a spa and discovered Moroccan Oil through our boutique. I fell in love immediately. My hair has never felt as silky soft, been as frizz-free, or even smelled this great before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin/fine, long, and prone to oil and dandruff. I straighten and blow dry daily, so there&#x27;s a bit of heat damage. I put a drop of Moroccan Oil (dime-sized or smaller) in my hand and then run my hand through my hair, avoiding the roots. You can do this on wet or dry hair. Immediately, you see added shine, less frizz, and a whiff of the incredible scent meets your nose. It has never made my hair appear oily, although I could see how it might if you use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product might seem expensive, but I assure you it lasts a great deal of time. I own the 25 ml/0.85 fl. oz size, and I&#x27;ve been using this same bottle for almost two months. And there&#x27;s over half a bottle left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using this for years. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this! Just a little bit of Moroccanoil makes my hair soft and shiney and easy to manage without an oily feel. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i have used this product before many times but this time around the Moroccan oil was different. It has a nice smell to it but this time around it had a bad smell and was very watery. I don&#x27;t think this was what u have purchased in the past.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> Great product for overly processed  dry hair.  I like the way my hair feels when I&#x27;m done styling it. excellent</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My hair feels so much better since I have been using it. Hopefully it will help with split ends too.</li>
            <li> This product came right away and is just awesome, my hair is COMPLETELY manageable now!!!  Entirely smoother and easy to deal with and soft/shiny.  My Beautician recc. it and I love it!  thank you!</li>
            <li> I first got a small bottle of this item as I just moved out to a farm and the water is so very different than where I lived before.  I love how this has made my hair feel so soft and I can tell that it&#x27;s helped my hair and scalp very much.  Would highly recomment this product!</li>
            <li> Alright my lovely Glamazons. By now you know that I am not only a licensed Hair stylist and Makeup Artist to some of the biggest names, but I am one of the most trusted on product knowledge. You also know that I am not paid for endorsements and I&#x27;m unbiased. Moroccan Oil was exciting when it first launched at our industry trade show, Premiere, in Orlando, Fl. They had demo&#x27;s on the spot, and handed out mini sample bottles to everyone with their grubby little hands out, mine included. As I researched this product and its ingredients a little deeper, I discovered that it is only a subtle, temporary fix for giving a little smoothing effect to the hair. There is no long term benefits from using this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Yes, it smells nice, but it&#x27;s not what it claims to be. No, I&#x27;m not hating on Moroccan Oil. There is nothing wrong with using it if you are just looking for a subtle and temporary fix and don&#x27;t mind spending the money. You could get better results with pure organic coconut oil (used in small amounts). Now that I&#x27;ve told you the truth about this product, I will be honest and say I love their hairsprays and glimmer shine spray. You&#x27;ll have to read those reviews there. If you want an alternative to this oil, Orofluido is much better, smells better and has more lasting results. Be sure to read my reviews before purchasing any hair product. I will ALWAYS give you an honest, educated and professional review. Til next time, smoochie smooch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro/ owner of Glamour Couture PA,NJ,NY</li>
            <li> I think this actually says for &#x27;blonde and thin&#x27; hair on the packaging that I have but this was recommended to me by my hairdresser after she gave me a Brazilian Blowout. After I read it I thought: I have thick and curly hair, how will this work? Well after I tried it once, it was perfect. It was absorbed quickly and gave my hair the perfect shine, not oily at all. I pay special attention to my ends with this after I curl it (two pumps is all I need). This stuff makes my hair feel super soft, even at the end of the day. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great product advised from my hair girl.  I am 50 and color my hair and this brings back the moisture great.  Did not want to spend the money but HAD to resolve the dryness.  Saved a few bucks from the retail price and recommend for very dry, colored hair.  Also has a great smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product! As someone with fine hair, dry hair, and a frequently oily scalp, it is one of the only things I&#x27;ve found that offers conditioning for the hair without making my scalp oilier. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product...it smells really good and helps my hair shine. I continue to use this product everyday.  Get this product if you would like shine in your hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good product but nothing extraordinary.  It is a little expensive in comparison with similar products in the market</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Moroccan Oil is being sold here as other reviewers have commented. I do want to review the product, which I got at my salon. This stuff is wonderful! You take just a very small amount and spread it on your palms. I have very long hair but just use a few dabs. Then just run your hands through your hair to distribute it evenly. If you use the right amount it will soak right in and your hair won&#x27;t be greasy. Don&#x27;t wash your hands afterwards. Just rub it into your skin like lotion. It also smells really great! It also makes your hair shiny and soft, holds down frizz and static, and can be used on either wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> A must have beauty secret. I apply this to the back of my head, above my neck. It helps not waking up with the worst tangles in that area, even after a night sweat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment. I&#x27;ve tried off brands and they absolutely are not the same.  Got a great buy from Amazon on this product!</li>
            <li> The product is good and has pretty good results on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I find it expensive considering that the starting materials&lt;br /&gt;are not difficult to find, But after all I imagine we pay for the&lt;br /&gt;novelty.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived leaking, the company sent a new one quickly.  However that was also leaking.  The worst part though was that it didn&#x27;t look or feel the same as stuff I get at my stylist.</li>
            <li> I prefered the mas rather than this il treatement, it is ok to leave it in the hair, but it doesn&#x27;t hydrates as well as the mask itself</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it yet, but my cousin has it and she like it a lot. The hair torn soft and very shine.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of the products from Moroccan Oil I have loved most of them. This one is great too, but use it sparingly. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Much too oily for my hair but I didn&#x27;t want to throw it away.  So, after bathing I rub the oil on my legs and arms and it is amazing for this.  My skin stays moisturized well into the next day and then I start all over again.  This may be good for people with hair that is dry or needs special treatment but I use it and love it for oil on my body.  I recommend it for that.</li>
            <li> This was a friend request  from Brasil.&lt;br /&gt;Come in time, good price.&lt;br /&gt;Package in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Done not have nothing more to say</li>
            <li> It really work for condition hair, this is the best oil I got, great product, good price, absolutely recommend, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan oil for about 5yrs now, and nothing compares to this brand. Yes, it&#x27;sa little pricey, but if your like me, you will go to extremes to keep your hair manageable. I live in a beach resort on the east coast, and I am constantly fighting the humidity during the summer months. Other people will tell you that this brand works and that brand works, but Nothing compares to Moroccan oil, I&#x27;ve tried all the others, and I know what I&#x27;m talking about!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Moroccan Oil and one bottle lasts a really long time. This is my second time buying this product from Amazon</li>
            <li> Nice small. I always setting my hair( my hair is black and thick, but easy to damaged.), and always use this oil, can protect my hair. i like moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible experience where the hair stylist that I went to almost 1.5 years ago FRIED my hair while putting in highlights.  I used this stuff every time that I washed my hair, putting it on the ends generously and then gradually working up to the scalp and it transformed my hair.  It stopped breaking and has grown out now and you would never know that it was so severely damaged.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.  You can&#x27;t apply too much depending on your hair texture of course.  It leaves my hair nice and silly.  Never frizzy.  I love the smell.  It&#x27;s also very durable.  Love it!</li>
            <li> So far this is a great product.  I recommend this product to all people for their hair product. I really enjoyed using this product</li>
            <li> This works very good to restore shine to my very old white hair.  I have been using it for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> restores moisture to your hair without feeling greasy. it goes on oily, but your hair will soak this stuff up. my hair is not damaged, but just gets dry during the winter, so i can imagine the wonders it would work on damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Best product for frizzy hair on the market!</li>
            <li> I love this product ... and like to give it as gifts since it&#x27;s a pricey yet well worth it extravagance. Leaves hair smelling great and feeling silky soft. Not a heavy feeling either; I just use a couple of pumps in the center of my palm, rub together to warm up, then run hands over damp hair. Air or blow dry. My hair looks shiny (under the right lighting conditions) but not oily, though I do have to shampoo every couple of days especially if I work out. And, that means this bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccan my own. Swear by it. Always a go to gift for a girlfriend .. Keeps split ends away even though I use hot tools on my hair at least four times a week</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. With course, thick hair I need something to maintain the frizz and this product does it. A little bit goes along way espcially prior to flat ironning.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser started using this on my hair and made it so soft after a blow out.  I got the same results at home as if I came straight from the salon.  It has a great scent too.</li>
            <li> My daughter turned me on to this wonderful product last year and suggested I purchase it as a gift for her this year. I was surprised to see how much product is contained in this product size and am delighted that the gift will keep giving for many months.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this product makes it silky soft all day long.  Seriously great product that last for a very long time.  you only need a small amount so one bottle lasts me almost a year.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of another friend who has beautiful, shiny hair.  It works wonders and really does leave your hair feeling soft and looking shiny.  But use sparingly, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Thsi product does a great job of taming frizz.  I&#x27;ve had friends try it who have shiney, smooth hair, and it does not work for them, but I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but worth every cent.  It absorbs into your hair and is not at all greasy.  It smells fantastic</li>
            <li> love love the smell of this, makes your hair more manageable, as well as adding shine, and protecting your hair. Used daily, this will improve the health of your hair, and look. I becomes soft, manageable and shiny. It smooths the hair strands as well.</li>
            <li> Tried another brand but must say this one is great. Not too thick, just right. Can use on wet or dry hair. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I just love the smell. So that&#x27;s a great start for me. I love yummy smelling hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this stuff just works amazingly well! I have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair. Not too oily, not too dry. My bad habit, though, is forgetting to get hair cuts until I realize that my hair is SUPER long. Every single time, my hair stylist says &amp;#34;Wait - HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE I SAW YOU LAST?!?!&amp;#34; She can never believe it&#x27;s been 6 months to a year since I&#x27;ve last seen her because my hair is so healthy. I credit it all to moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> First it has a great smell yet light, works great at keeping my hair smooth. i would recommend for use after blow drying.</li>
            <li> Love how shiny my hair is with Moroccan Oil!  It isn&#x27;t the least bit \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feeling and you can use it on wet or dry hair. I actually use it before and after drying.  Also, I use it as a base for my mineral blusher, it gives my skin a really healthy look.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  I always use it after each hair washing.  It protects my color, locks in shine and preps my hair for styling.  Not to mention the amazing fragrance.  I&#x27;m hooked - love it!</li>
            <li> I loved this for my hair, but I had to stop using it because it made me break out. It worked wonderfully to make my chemically treated hair look soft and shiny and not like straw. My hair was highlighted blonde and was very dry. I applied the Moroccan oil when my hair was wet and then blew it dry. Then I applied a bit more and then flat ironed my hair. It looked truly amazing. It made my hair look healthy and took away the brittle/damaged look completely. However, after I used this for a while, I started getting large pimples on my neck and jawline. I wasn&#x27;t doing anything else differently. I asked my hairstylist and she said that she had to stop using it because it made her break out, too. So, I stopped and the breakouts went away. My Mom uses Moroccan oil and it works wonders for her and doesn&#x27;t cause her any skin problems. I&#x27;m really sad I had to stop using this, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the skin issues.</li>
            <li> If you have super frizzy hair like mine and would love soft, silky, smooth and straightened hair without the burnt smell...this is for you!  I never run out!</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for about two weeks now, and i have no complains, the oil is thick but does not have your hair oily, it has a high smell which i can live with, but some may think otherwise. it has your hair feeling think and looking good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it a good natural treatment for your hair and i recommend for those who don&#x27;t like putting stuff like jell in your hair.</li>
            <li> My niece recommend this product. I used it when I flat ironed my hair and it left my hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> GREAT product if you have dry hair in the desert!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a good product for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s used by my hairdresser and I like to use it also at home.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it</li>
            <li> While I am a true lover of Moroccan Oil, I am also just like every other girl who has damage done to her hair on a daily basis.  Between the sun, chemicals, and styling tools, my hair over the years has become damaged and brittle in a few places.  Enter Moroccan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leave in hair treatment is one of my favorite products.  After you have washed, conditioned, and towel dried your hair, place a dime to quarter sized amount of the oil in your palms and then gently run through your hair.  Combing will also ensure that you will get the oil throughout your hair.  Next you can blow dry and style as you would normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will notice your hair is a lot shinier, not oily feeling at all, and very smooth and soft to the touch.  Moroccan Oil also smells really good!  Give your hair a treat and look for some Moroccan Oil!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!!  I use it after every shampoo and it keeps my hair tangle free and manageable. That is a hard thing to do because I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever to help dry hair. Makes it nice and shiny and easier to control. Makes my hair look great.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair.  I use it every time I wash my hair.  Need to be careful not to use too much or your hair will lay flat.  It has a wonderful smell and has a lot of glycerin in it.</li>
            <li> I use this oil religiously on my hair. It gets rid of frizz and keeps my hair smooth and shiny. I use it when I get out of the shower before I dry and style my hair. I then put some more in after I&#x27;m done styling to add shine. I keep away from my roots and stick to the middle and ends of my hair. I have not come across a product yet that is as good as this one. This is the only thing I can put in my hair and just let my hair air dry. I don&#x27;t even need to style it and the texture of my hair is wonderful and not frizzy. I have thick hair that tends to be quite frizzy when I don&#x27;t style it. I couldn&#x27;t believe I finally found a product that fixes that so I can be lazy some days and just let me hair be!</li>
            <li> Pricey but great product</li>
            <li> A friend of mine borrowed my Moroccan oil and accidentally took it home with her. Being that she lives very far away she said she would just keep it and buy me a new bottle. I told her just do Amazon it looked like a good price. Well, I have used this oil and put it in gift baskets for friends for years and this product is fake. If the price is too good to be true then it is. The label, the box, the smell, how it makes your hair feel. All fake.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used for three years now.  Great price!  Helps hair in the dry desert winters and mountain summers</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best oil treatments I have ever tried.  I have medium to course hair and relax my hair.  Using the Moroccan oil daily has strengthen my hair.  It is stronger and healthier than it has ever been.  I call this oil &amp;#34;hair nectar&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t see my self ever not using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product . This is the best oil for your hair. I been using it for 8 years.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful styling product for dry hair.  It tames my fly aways and makes my hair overall appear healthier.  I use this almost daily despite the expensive cost. It just makes my style appear more &#x27;finished&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use it on my hair, skin, and my dog after I bathe him keeps him from itching all the time</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my hair when I use this.</li>
            <li> Received product right away !</li>
            <li> The bottle leaks when you travel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product only for short term use.If u use it more than couple of months your hair will be \\&quot;fed up\\&quot; of it.It smells nice and seems to be amazing product at the beginning.Later your hair will ask for something lighter.It works better on fine,undamaged hair.If your hair is bleached it wont work at all.</li>
            <li> Always great for my natural hair</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased Moroccan oil I was in an expensive salon, I felt that the oil was so much thicker and the aroma was very strong but I loved it. I didn&#x27;t feel that my hair was greasy after using it, especially the next day, and the smell, though strong, was lovely when it was in your hair. This bottle seems to feel like the oil is much thinner and the smell is not as strong as the first couple of bottles that I purchased. It&#x27;s also the first time I ever purchased a bigger bottle, and I don&#x27;t know if that has anything to do with it for some reason. My hair feels greasy even with just a drop, and the smell is not nearly as strong.&lt;br /&gt;Almost has a watery consistency to it. I&#x27;ll keep using Moroccan oil, but I think I want to go to where I purchased originally.</li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft and helps smooth it out  - I also think it makes my hair dry much faster</li>
            <li> Not happy. After months of using this,  I think the product must be a fake because it is definitely is not working like the real salon quality did.</li>
            <li> this is the best!  Shipment came early and the product was packaged perfectly to prevent breakage.  my hair is naturally curly&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for smoothing and control</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried a bottle of the moroccan oil hair treatment and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  My hair is dry, so it did help with that, but that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li> This product is truly incredible!  I have fine/thin hair and usually oil products build up horrendously and I end up having to wash my hair at the end of the day; however, this is not so with Moroccan Oil!!  You can pretty much drown your locks with this golden syrup and there is no grease to behold!  The smell is delish (for men and women!) and it leaves my hair silky soft and frizz free!  Completely weightless - all of their products are!  I have been using since 2008 and do not need to use anything else!  Oh, and I have tried to be a cheap-skate and sub knock-off products for Moroccan Oil only to be extremely disappointed!  JUST BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I must have this oil treatment!  My hair feels luscious and it smells wonderful.  No more dry ends!  Wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> Umm I mean it&#x27;s just oil , nothing special about it , I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s the fuss is all about , I wanted it to work wonders , but it&#x27;s just an oil that basically does nothing to your hair , oh well at least my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this since everyone on the internet loves it. It smells really great. I don&#x27;t know how much it helps my hair yet but so far I like it better than coconut or jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this. The hair does not tangle and it smells so good. It&#x27;s part of getting ready.</li>
            <li> Best product to spray on hair prior to using a flat or curling iron.  Protect hair from excessive heat.</li>
            <li> I love it.. And I have long hair and need it in sunny Florida!  This was the best price and I loved the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> So great！！！！I will keep using this. The conditioner is kind of useless when I have it. Just like magic on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It really provides deep conditioning to my hair and keeps it soft and shiny even after coloring and blow drying.</li>
            <li> Cant live with out it!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Better than Biosilk.</li>
            <li> Great product, keeps hair sort and shiny</li>
            <li> I had been buying this through my hairdresser for a couple of years when I came across it on Amazon and  couldn&#x27;t resist purchasing it at this price.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not the same product.  The package looks the same but the consistency is thinner, the smell isn&#x27;t right and the way it leaves my hair is definitely not the same.  I was extremely disappointed.  They say you get what you pay for, in this case you pay less and get less (quality).</li>
            <li> Great product! Hydrates my hair without making it grease!</li>
            <li> I have highly textured hair ( my stylist calls it)  so this oil works perfectly to smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> I guess it works.  The other brand Morroccan oil had less odor.  But it seems to help my hair.</li>
            <li> Have always loved Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment. Happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The packaging attracked my attention as it is eyecatching beautiful. Great to give as a present. The oil smells beautiful, like a fresh flower and reminds me of a hot summer day. I use it in damp hair  to style my hair and protect it against the heat of the blowdryer.Pay attention with the amount of product you use as it can easily make your hair too greasy. Just use it in the ends of your hair. Very good product to protect from sun, especially for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Like it very much.  It does make my hair softer and look healthier.  But I have to use it every other wash...it gets greasy at times.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine in my office has the shiniest and bounciest hair, so I asked her what she uses to get it that way. It just so happens that her mother in law is a hairdresser and when she does her hair, she uses this very treatment to keep her hair shiny and manageable. I didn&#x27;t waste any time in ordering it and I have been so happy with the way my hair looks and feels. Since I had to begin coloring my hair to cover some of the grays, it had lost the youthful bounce and texture that I had, but the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment has helped tremendously in retaining that texture.</li>
            <li> The transaction was processed quickly and was received the same day ordered as promised. This is a great product. A little goes a long way. It leaves hair shiny and smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li> Order came in a sealed bottle.  Very happy with purchase and seller.  I used the oil to help tame my fine and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because of the cost!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is coarse with natural curl which can become frizzy and out of control! My hair is much more manageable and soft to touch!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this oil for several years and we love the way it provides the right moisture for our hair. It protects well too from the use of heat tools.  I&#x27;ve tried other oils but this one is simply the best.</li>
            <li> I like to put this thru my hair after I blow it dry... Makes my hair look shiny and it smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best price!!!</li>
            <li> For someone that knows and like it a lot as she uses it for treating her dificult hair gets nice</li>
            <li> Not the real product.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for replenishing your hair without that oily feeling you get from other products that can&#x27;t hold a candle to Moroccoanoil.</li>
            <li> I only use this line in my hair because i am goint nautral but have not compeletely yet! I love the smell and the softness if gives my hair!the shine with out too much oil and the feel is amazing. This is better than grease and light than oils natural chemicals and makes hair very soft!</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly my hair begs for it every morning  I use it on wet or dry hair and even on my little girls hair, amazing stuff, worth the price:)</li>
            <li> I like this product cause it is really good from my hair and i have definately seen an improvement which is great!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair smell great and it gives it a smooth, shiny finish. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yes it is great I love it and recommend it</li>
            <li> I discovered Moroccan Oil while serving as a bridesmaid in a wedding 3 years ago and I&#x27;ve used it every day since!  I have very, very thick hair and it can be a little dry and brittle at times.  It is also naturally curly, and even though I straighten it daily, the southern humidity can cause it to frizz.  All of these issues were solved when I started using Moroccan Oil!  I use it three different ways:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I put two pumps on my wet hair right after getting out of the shower.  It is strong stuff, so it doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I put one more pump on my hair after styling it if the humidity is high that day.&lt;br /&gt;3.  If my hair is especially dry I use it as a hair &#x27;mask&#x27; at night.  I put several pumps on my dry hair and sleep with it on.  The next morning my hair is soft and no longer dry. Works every time!  :)</li>
            <li> What a amazing product! Makes your hair feel soft and manageable. Will def continue buying this!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells amazing and it soaks right into my hair, never leaving it greasy looking. I have very long straight hair, fine hair - but lots of it. It lasts me a long time also. Best hair oil I have used.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times before and as usual I am very satisfied with it.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Was a little skeptical because of previous reviews stating it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.  I&#x27;ve purchased Moroccan Oil from salon before and this seems like real deal.  Shipping was uber quick too!</li>
            <li> This product works really good.  It makes my hair silky without too much greasy buildup.  I have coarse thick hair and becomes easily frizzy, this product helps with all the above</li>
            <li> Great product to tame fly away hair and polish it.  Use it every day on damp hair, then blow dry.</li>
            <li> Get this! I originally bought this at my hair salon for $48 and loved it. So I was even more excited to find it on Amazon for a cheaper price. Plus deliver was very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does wonders for my hair. I blow dry and use a flat iron every day and my hair feels silky soft. I even love rubbing it into my hands after I have rubbed it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product in a sample bottle supplied by my hairdresser &amp; liked it so well, I got this bigger bottle.  It leaves your hair feeling silky soft, not oily.  You don&#x27;t need to use more than about a nickel size, so a 3.4 oz bottle lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Product works well. However it came partially opened and I lost a good amount of the product. Was going to return it but got lazy so dealt with the loss.</li>
            <li> Life saver if you swim a lot or have highlighted hair. The smell is wonderful and light.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this product for life!</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccanoil as a leave-in conditioner on my hair for years, and I love this product. It is a rich conditioner and adds shine without making my hair feel oily. I also massage the oil into my scalp during the dry winter months. My most recent purchase was for my young daughters, who both have very curly hair and are prone to tangles. Brushing their hair after a bath used to be a struggle, but the Moroccanoil makes this much easier. I also love the oil&#x27;s subtle scent on my daughters&#x27; hair. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> great for hair and skin. using it for years</li>
            <li> Use sparingly once a week, one drop in the palm of your hand and rub it through your hair. It really softens and makes your hair behave.  I love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use the Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment in conjunction with the Morocan Hair Treatment cream, as recommended by my hairdresser.  I use just a capful of the oil and leave the concoction on for a minimum of several minutes.  The result has helped my hair become healthier.  I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil smells good and keeps my hair shinny and tangle free.  It applies easily and leaves no residue..  My hai dresser recommended it to me. My sister&#x27;s hair dresser recommended it to her.</li>
            <li> Smooths and softens my thick course hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have very coarse, frizzy hair that I staighten on a regular basis. My hair is cut short because it is so busted that I can&#x27;t do a thing with it. I started using this and use three pumps each time and it has made my hair shiny, straighter, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it feel greasy or look oily. Love it and I don&#x27;t have to straighten so often.  If it matters I am caucasian. I have always heard that caucasian and african american hair are very different but to make the review complete I thougt I should mention.</li>
            <li> Love it! Could instantly notice a difference in my hair. It tames fly-aways and makes hair look and feel smooth and silky. Great product!</li>
            <li> I think this product makes your hair really really soft, but it doesn&#x27;t help much for styling. I have been told it helps when curling your hair, but my curls will just fall out when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased my 5th bottle and I love this product! I can treat my extremely dry hair every day with this and it never gets oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Use this every other day... absolutely love it and keep buying it.  I have very long hair, I use 5 pumps on towel dried hair, put my hair back up in towel while doing makeup etc, once I take it down its very easy to comb through, dries as quickly as if nothing is on it and does NOT make hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I love it! It has made my hair more manageable, softer, and healthier. I recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> A great product.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue in my hair and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It is heavy so you only need to use a little. It is a great moisturizer. It came recommended by my hairdresser and I am happy with my purchase. Sometimes I mix a little with the hydration product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way :) Frizzy hair no more.</li>
            <li> This treatment is terrific. I love the way it makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> Adds just the right amount of shine without making hair look greasy or feel too heavy.  A little product goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a good investment in the health and beauty of your hair.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. Exactly as described and was delivered fast!</li>
            <li> This product is the exact same as what I have purchased previously at hair salon. Love this product. Smells great and hydrates the ends of my hair which is very dry.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t purchase this item due to the large amount of folks saying it was not the real product.  I have purchased this product in a licensed salon before and from this seller on Amazon.  I didn&#x27;t see or smell any differences at all.  I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with my purchase and super happy about the savings $$</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> love this oil, I can put my hair in a pony tail, condition it with this oil go about my day. Hair  does not feel oily or look dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it after every shampoo, great smell too.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Thank you for the prompt service</li>
            <li> If you want an antidote to dry frizzy hair, this is it!  Also speeds up blowdrying time!</li>
            <li> but for my hair which is long and wavy it feels like its coating it and not penetrating the hair shaft</li>
            <li> This product is a must for people who have dry scalp or dry hair.  It is NOT oily &amp; heavy like some hair oils can be.  It is sold just about everywhere now - so it is not hard to come by.  The price may put people off but the benefits of this product are amazing.  After applying it to my hair/scalp weekly I rub the rest into my hands as it makes  them soft and supple.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously purchased this  product online from a different seller, after using it many times from a salon, I was displeased with it&#x27;s authenticity, and it was obviously watered down.  After buying the moroccan oil from this seller, it was genuine and felt and behaved exactly like the prior purchases I&#x27;ve made from salons.&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome seller who sells genuine products.  Genuine products &#x3D; Long lasting products!  It&#x27;s worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!! It truly is the best oil ive used. I have thin hair and it tends to get oily quick, not with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And... It smells AWESOME! I constantly get compliments on the smell of my hair!</li>
            <li> Great product to use every day great results even bought the other Moroccan products to accompany it would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The moroccan oil hair line is a wonderful line, it&#x27;s light and hydrating. This oil does wonders for my dry scalp and it&#x27;s very light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> best x freezing  hair. best product ever&lt;br /&gt;you can use for curly, straight , dry hair. I always had the best rests</li>
            <li> In a nutshell Moroccan Oil makes my hair:&lt;br /&gt;- smell amazing&lt;br /&gt;- dry faster&lt;br /&gt;- feel glossy&lt;br /&gt;- look shiny/healthy/smoother&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this oil on a recommendation from a friend (who is a former stylist) and am hooked for life. I can&#x27;t find anything about it I don&#x27;t like. One word of caution is, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell the difference when you START using this product and when you STOP! Tried to experiment with other oils (i.e josie maron, macadamia natural oil) but NOTHING compares to this! I have dry, naturally curly hair and I find that this product really helps with the frizz and with locking in some moisture. Holy grail product, for sure!</li>
            <li> This is really a wonderful treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now - maybe about a year, and I absolutely cannot stop using it! I love the scent, the texture, and the results it gives my curly hair. Although it&#x27;s a little more expensive than I&#x27;d like to pay, it&#x27;s been worth every penny for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for years and love it. Hair does not become oily  My hair is medium length. I rub about a quarter sized amount in my hands then rub it through my hair followed by a brushing to be sure it I well distributed.  It helps tame frizzy ends and gives a nice finish to hair I do wish it was a bit less expensive</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My hair is softer, shinier, and frizz free</li>
            <li> Love this product. My hair is a bit on the dry side, but this oil beats the frizzies!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been five months since my last haircut, and I have very few split ends. Normally, my hair would have a ton by now. Hooray! I put a couple squirts into my ends after every shower. I only put it on the ends, not up top by my scalp, because I have naturally oily hair and figure I don&#x27;t need extra shine up there. I love that it&#x27;s ideal for any and all hair types. And, my boyfriend LOVES the way it smells on me. You can see my full review on my blog:[...]</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It smells great and leaves my hair feeling so soft.  I would recommend for straight or curly styles.</li>
            <li> Although this product is extremely over priced, it seems to be expensive everywhere I look for it. It has wonderful benefits to my hair I put it in my hair everyday after I shower. It&#x27;s making my hair grow already!</li>
            <li> great product for my hair and I am very happy with it.  The next time I order I would get the light treatment next time.</li>
            <li> THE BEST oil for dry, thin, brittle hair.  Makes it shine and feel healthy.  It is expensive but it lasts forever if you use just the right amount.  Anyone&#x27;s hair will look better using this.</li>
            <li> I discovered this treatment several years ago and purchased it from my salon. It eliminates fly aways and leaves my hair smooth. I love the smell of this oil. The bottle last for quite awhile because only a small amount is used each time.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stylish recommended it and she uses it for all her customers.</li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy hair and I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market for frizz. So I was considering getting a brazilian blowout but didn&#x27;t want formaldehyde in my body. I decided to try this and I used a small amount on damp hair before blowdrying and my hair looks the best I&#x27;ve ever seen it. Even my fiance was astounded and kept giving me compliments on how straight, shiny, and soft my hair was. This stuff actually works, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humid weather.This product is terrific, I like the smell too.</li>
            <li> This product requires one pump to produce a light, shining finish to your hair! I use this several times a day and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone! it has worked wonders for my hair. try their shampoo and conditioner as well. I use the 3 together and its just the best I have tried. Bonus, this stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT THE WHOLE LINE OF THIS PRODUCT AND MY GOSH IT WORKS WONDERS! THE TEXTURE OF MY HAIR, THE SMELL IS DEVINE...I WILL ALWAY USE THE WHOLE ENTIRE LINE, I JUST WISH IT WASNT SO EXPENSIVE BUT TRUST ME REGARDLESS OF THE PRICE, IT IS SO WORTH IT. I SO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE MOROCCAN OIL LINE!</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the bottle leaked a little.  The seal should be double tapped.  This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I hate the feel of conditioner in my hair. Slimy...nasty stuff. BUT...I have buckets of thick hair and have a horrible time getting a comb through it when it&#x27;s wet if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner. My stylist introduced me to Moroccan Oil. Two squirts in the palm of my hand...rub them together and work it through my towel-dried hair. The comb glides right through after applying Moroccan Oil. And the scent....I LOVE it! It&#x27;s different...hard to describe. My 8 yr old loves the scent too and we use it on her very thick hair. She has Celiac disease and her hair had gotten somewhat dull and lifeless...this helps to bring back a healthy shine. I will say that my husband thinks the oil smells like cough syrup...but I don&#x27;t agree.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the Moroccan Oil treatment and it came quickly. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and it makes her normally dry hair shimmer naturally. I will be restocking this in her bathroom regularly.</li>
            <li> It came quickly, it was at a decent price, and I love the product. It makes my hair so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft without being oily</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil tames and conditions hair better than argan oil.  You will be amazed at the shine and smoothness of your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It leaves my hair feeling smooth. It also smells fantastic but not overwhelming. It does not leave an oily residue on my hair after it dries. I would definitely buy again and recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan oil! I absolutely cannot live without it! It smooths your hair and gives it a great shine. It smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> Great product! Worth the money - makes hair silky smooth for course, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> love this product! it smells wonderful and makes my hair smooth!</li>
            <li> Better price than salon for fantastic oil.</li>
            <li> my hair smells so nice. better use in fall and winter and just a small portion will be sufficient.</li>
            <li> Great leave in split end treatment. Best part is a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> This is NOT Moroccan Oil.  I have used Moroccan Oil for years and this is NOT the same product that I buy in the stores.  I have a much more strong perfume like smell.  I am not sure if it is a fake or if was produced differently for the Spanish market.  It has Spanish written above English on the bottle.  Regardless of the reason, it is not the same formulation that is purchased in the U.S.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have dry hair (bleached blonde), and it makes my hair feel smoft, smooth and shiney without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Good service, good product as expected.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft. I love the way it feels. And it smells great too. It is not oily at all.</li>
            <li> This product is simply AMAZING! I have been using it for a while and will purchase again. It makes hair soft, manageable, and most of all, it made my dry-dead-hair look and feel alive again. Highly recommend. This oil is magical. It deserves more than 5 stars. :)</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feel so shine and soft! I bought a bottle for me and another for my sister....she love&#x27;s too!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best oil for dry and colored hair. I recommended for any woman who cares your hair! :)</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product of the decade!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best.  Just a pump or two on wet hair is all that&#x27;s needed to keep your hair soft, smooth and shiny.  I can even skip conditioner occasionally when I use this.  A 3.4 oz. bottle will last me about 8 to 12 months.</li>
            <li> Had medical issues and lost my hair, then took medication that hindered the new growth, this oil really helped me get my hair looking and feeling great again, my hairdresser recommended it and I love it. My hair is like it used to be and even better.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I had been highlighting my hair for years and I blow dry it and use a flat iron every day.  After a while, the breakage was getting really bad becuase I wasn&#x27;t using any heat protectant products.  This was suggested to me and I have now been using it for a little over a year.  The difference is amazing and I no longer have fried ends!  One bottle lasted me 10 months or so and that is with me using it 4-5 times per week.</li>
            <li> Holy mackerel this stuff smells like heaven! I will continue to purchase this product just for that reason. It does hydrate a bit, and it works pretty good as a tamer for those especially unruly hair days, but not significantly better than some of the others out there such as Chi or Rusk Serums.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moroccon oil on the market. Keeps my hair from being frizzy and also keeps it from damage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this, but my wife love this. She said it really works for her healthy hair condition. So I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I believe this product works very well, I recommend it for someone who has dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is so great!  I love the smell, feel and the shine it gives my hair.  I have tried other products that claim to do the same thing but leaves your hair greasy or smell funny. Anyone that needs a product like this will LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Item was not sealed upon arrival because it did not ha e the original seal across the top. Quite a bit leaked out into packaging.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of this product daily. Absorbs quickly. Worth every penny. I will order another before this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Not too oily and has a wonderfully unique smell. Argan oil is too heavy for my hair so this is a great substitute. Pricy but worth it for manageable hair everyday.</li>
            <li> As much as I like to use products that are as stripped down and natural/organic, I really like this product much better than straight argon oil.  I have in the past purchased 100% argon oil that was organic, and I found that yes, it did work ok, but for whatever reasons or additives, this moroccanoil is really the best product for my hair.  It really is non-greasy (I found the 100% argon oil to be a bit greasier and left more residue) and it does leave my hair so soft and shiny and really speeds up the drying time either air drying or blow drying.  It also heat protects when using a curling iron or flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the other thing I did not like about the 100% argon oil is the smell.  Yes it is natural and kind of nutty, but to me, the moroccanoil has a really nice scent that sort of stays with me lightly throughout the day.  I did purchase more 100% argon oil, thinking about being more green, but decided to cancel the order and go back to moroccanoil as it really is such a great all purpose product for my hair!</li>
            <li> This did not smell like real Moroccan oil and I have been using it for years.  I need to return the product - not happy 😞</li>
            <li> Great product. I always use it. It makes my hair so silky. And the shipping was fast. My package came before estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Product!!!! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff. Is it from Morocco? Moroccans must have the shiniest, silkiest hair in the world, if this oil is widely available there.</li>
            <li> However, my niece bought a larger bottle for $30.00</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it daily</li>
            <li> Good stuff...very light.</li>
            <li> I used this treatment on damp hair after shampooing.  Just a few drops is all that&#x27;s needed for my below shoulder length hair.  It defrizzes and acts as a heat protectant because it contains a lot of silicone.  I then use my regular styling products on top of it.  I didn&#x27;t get any frizz, even in the Florida humidity.  It worked like a charm.  I&#x27;m impressed with this product and may decide to make it a regular part of my routine.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> It was delivered according to specifications.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier and the product has more application options, in my opinion, than other products I&#x27;ve tried previously.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it every day.</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and this is awesome for shine and control.  I have tried a lot of products and Moroccan oil is awesome!</li>
            <li> My hair gets colored about every 4-6 weeks and is blow dried and straightened every day. My hair stylist introduced me to this and there is no turning back. My hair is oily, and I was afraid this would make it worse. to my surprise it didn&#x27;t.  I just use a dime size amount, blow dry, straighten and go. I no longer use conditioner or a heat protectant spray. My hair isn&#x27;t damaged, and I give credit to Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my hair which is curly and unruly, I use it (very little) at all times.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product because it isn&#x27;t actually Moroccan oil it&#x27;s mostly silicone and it makes your hair very stretchy and doesn&#x27;t help repair it. it will damage your hair and will make it break less but only because it puts a plastic layer in your hair</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for soft, manageable, silky, bouncy hair with a non-greasy feel. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love it as everyone does.  Just with it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive.  I have tried other brands of Moroccan Oil, but nothing seems to be as good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my hair I use it on my skin and I love it.  It keeps my skin smooth and helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> love the smell and how my hair feels after applying. Not sure if it actually does anything to actually treat the hair but overall have been using it for a while and love it</li>
            <li> I loooooove this stuff because first it smells amazing...second, it&#x27;s soft texture and feel actually works to repair some of the damage I have on my ends. I only use a dime size amount probably less than that into wet hair. The scent lasts for a day or two especially if you have your hair in a bun or tied up. Can also be used on dry hair, especially if you&#x27;ve been out all day and you just want to smoothe out your mane. Won&#x27;t make your hair oily, again if you use a small amount. This bottle will last me a long long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t realize that it was going to take so long to receive it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  A local hairdresser used it on my hair and I found it online to buy.  Smells wonderful and shines beautifully! Happy camper here. :)</li>
            <li> Great product to help keep your hair nourshied and health.</li>
            <li> This oil is magic !  I use it everyday and it doesn&#x27;t build up or make my hair look oily at all.</li>
            <li> excellent product, good price,  I replaced one that my wife loved....</li>
            <li> I like it mixed with the hydrating mask as it improves the softness of the hair, and I also used it as anti-frizz. Love all the products!</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan oil hair products, and this is no different. It helps to smooth my hair when it gets a bit frizzy in the humidity.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Works great!!! and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I like this oil.. you only need a very little ..it will last me a very long time. It was worth the money i spend. .and would order this product again.</li>
            <li> I love the Moroccan oil.  This along with the Moroccan hair mask keeps my hair in great shape.  I use the oil after every shampoo and I use the mask once a week.  Them them both.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted and showed up fast.</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t fall for this or any other &amp;#34;Moroccan Argan OIl&amp;#34; scams. I just returned from Morocco, where I hiked the Atlas Mountains and visited cooperatives of women who hand-press real argan oil from the seed of the argan tree after shelling each one. Argan oil has become such a faddish Western craze that even in Morocco, the cities&#x27; medinas (central squares where merchants gather to sell their wares, in the case of argan essentially to tourists) are full of fake argan oil sellers, whose products are actually vegetable oil with perhaps a touch of argan. The production of real argan oil is labor-intensive and the product, even in Morroccan dirhans (the counrty&#x27;s currency) is relatively costly. Still, I purchased a 25 oz. bottle of pure argan oil (which in its&#x27; natural state is cloudy and must be shaken before use) for the equivalent of 30 US dollars. (The argan used for the face and body is uncooked; there is another version of the oil, roasted and darker, used for cooking and high in mono-unsaturates, like olive oil, that is equally costly).&lt;br /&gt;  The &amp;#34;M - Moroccanoil&amp;#34; line is, like almost all available &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; products, a complete rip-off. Dimethicone and other silicone-derived products were found long ago to enhance hairs&#x27; pliability, softness, silkiness and combability. Nearly every effective conditioner, from Pantene to the most ridiculously overprices brands, depend on some version of silicates to effect the softness and &amp;#34;silkiness&amp;#34; Americans have come to expect from conditioners. (Brands which are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and free of silicone produce a similar effect from alternative slippery ingredients). Argan oil is exactly what is sounds like -- an OIL. When you put in on your hair or your skin it feels OILY, because it&#x27;s SUPPOSED TO. It&#x27;s meant to be used very sparingly and will, after a minute or two, be absorbed, to an extent determined by the exterior dryness of the hair or skin,  by the upper layers of&lt;br /&gt; the skin and thecortex of the hair. In Morocco and elsewhere in north Africa, the oil is left in the hair. The Western preference for hair that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; by products means that argan in the hair is more useful as a pre-shampoo treatment. Remember, though, that if you aggressively shampoo the areas of the hair where you&#x27;ve used the argan oil, you will basically wash it all out. Using it on the ends of the hair and shampooing the ends lightly will allow some of the oil to remain and will leave a soft finish there; using the oil as a scalp massage overnight and then washing well in the morning will help alleviate dry, itchy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;  Argan oil is a wonderful moisturizer for hair and skin, but PLEASE understand what it is, how it is made and how to use it. PLEASE save your money and don&#x27;t waste it on products like this which essentially exploit the &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; quality of a product from a third-world culture but in fact sell nothing more than cheap, readily available (though highly effective, and the EXACT SAME whether in expensive or drugstore products) chemicals produced by the millions of gallons in factories here and abroad. USE THE MONEY YOU SAVE BY NOT PURCHASING THESE FAKE PRODUCTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION OF YOUR CHOICE THAT ASSISTS THIRD-WORLD CITIZENS IN BETTERING THEIR LIVES. And if you want &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; argan oil in this country, you&#x27;ll have to pay a tremendous amount for it. Josie Maran and a couple other cosmetic purveyors offer actual argan oil at the cost of about 89 dollars for 1.7 ounces.</li>
            <li> Best hair oil. Bottom line. Smells great. You only need a very very tiny bit. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> A hair stylist used this product on my hair once and I&#x27;ve been addicted ever since.  I have very fine, long, and slighty wavy hair.  I apply one pump to my hair after washing, primarily on the ends and very sparingly to the roots.  Keeps my hair moisturized, keeps my ends from splitting and smells divinely exotic.</li>
            <li> Whoever says this product does not help their hair may be using too much of it or are crazy!  This oil has completely revived my hair and i have never stopped buying it since my 1st use.  One 3.4 oz lasts me almost a year! I use about a quarter of it after the shower; i have hair half way down my back, shorter hair needs only a nickel size or dime..  I am always changing my hair color but also want my hair to grow as well, this makes it possible. Makes hair soft and protects it from breaking. If you use too much of it will weigh your hair down a little or make it too soft. A little goes a long way and this is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve seen good results on my hair in terms of reducing breakage and giving it a healthy look and shine. Though a little on the expensive side, it&#x27;s worth the investment as the previous bottle I had lasted several months and my hair is long and thick! I would recommend buying one bottle of this instead of a couple of bottles of some cheaper products and using in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> i was a little wory about this because the price and not sure it was going to work for my hair, but is really good and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The product is good! However it doesn&#x27;t reduce the freeze. The hair is much softer, and the oil smells beautiful....&lt;br /&gt;There is no build up. I am satisfied, but I wish that it would reduce more the freeze. It seems that the hair is even thicker.</li>
            <li> I have used so many products over the years because I have very dry, coarse, frizzy, curly hair.  Many products that I used to use would never get rid of the frizz and condition my hair.  This product really changes the condition of your hair to smooth, silky, shiny hair.  I never write reviews but this product deserves it.  If you read that this product is to heavy and leaves hair greasy don&#x27;t believe it.  They simply have used to much product for there particular hair type.  I use three squirts but I recommend trying out different amounts to find the best amount for you.  I towel dry my hair and then use a leave in conditioner and then apply moroccan oil before i blow dry. This product cannot be beat.  The smell is wonderful also.  My husband loves to smell my hair :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I use it every time I wash my hair. It makes my hair baby soft and shiny.... Btw it smells divine! I will keep reordering it!</li>
            <li> The item came in so fast (: As for the product itself, it is a great hair treatment to keep your hair shiny and healthy. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year or so now. So try for yourself! (:</li>
            <li> This is my review after one week use. I have a curly, frizzy, coarse, thick hair. The oil texture is nice and one full pump (quarter size) can cover my thick hair. It does not leave my hair greasy, sticky or oily. The weird thing is that when I apply it, my palm IS sticky as if I had dipped it into some kind of juice !!! My hair is not sticky .. but my hand IS @@&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll update .&lt;br /&gt;Overall, first impression, my hair is sooth and manageable using the oil and so is my palm :/</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product for her hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my frizzy hair under control. Shipping was quick and packaging was great</li>
            <li> Love love this product, if you mistreat your hair like most females do, this will spare you those bad hair days. Adds shine, volume and keeps hair from tangling.</li>
            <li> A coworker of mine uses this and I loved the smell of her hair so much I had to get it..haha!  I makes my hair feel so soft and healthy.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday so it will last a very long time..plus it&#x27;s great that it comes in a pump bottle!</li>
            <li> Due to heat tools, the ends of my hair have become extremely brittle and dry. I had to get extra hair cut off at my last hair appointment and was extremely disappointed in the shape of my hair - also knowing that it would continue to dry out if I didn&#x27;t make a change. After reading the reviews from Amazon, I decided to splurge and purchase this product. WELL WORTH IT! I have been using the oil for approximately a week and have noticed a HUGE difference in the health of my hair. I have naturally thin hair and hate that most products always seem to weigh it down - not this one. I squeeze the smallest amount into the palms of my hands and work it through the ends of my damp hair post-shower first, then finger comb the rest through the rest of my hair. Overall, my hair has become noticeably softer and visibly looks healthier. I&#x27;ve also noticed that without even using the product, my hair has been extremely easy to comb through and much more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the price can be scary at first, it is a great investment! I&#x27;m excited to continue to use this product and see how the rest of the results turn out. Plenty of my friends have started to use it and love it as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! A must buy for hair lovers!</li>
            <li> Foi um pedido. Quem usa afirma que funciona bem. Excelente para dar de presente. É da linha MoroccanOil, já bem conhecida e de qualidade.</li>
            <li> Love this.. use only a little or it will make your hair oily feeling</li>
            <li> i have highlights in my hair so it feels really dry. but this makes my hair feel smooth. i heard it helps grow out your hair aswell so i cant wait to start noticing the results. I recieved it in 3 days overall it was a good experiance.</li>
            <li> THIS ORDER WAS PLACED ON JANUARY 15TH AND I AM STILL AWAITING RECEIPT.  I WILL PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE COMPANIES ORDER IS PLACED WITH.  HAD I KNOWN IT WAS COMING FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY, I WOULD HAVE NOT ORDERED IT.  I NEEDED IT AND DO NOT WANT TO WAIT UNTIL MARCH FOR ITS&#x27; ARRIVAL.  ADDITIONALLY, WHEN I HAVE TRIED TO TRACK THIS ITEM--NOTATION REPEATEDLY STATES UNABLE TO TRACK IT.</li>
            <li> i like it, and free shipping. very protective cover to convey the glass container. size is not so big but pumping is very useful.</li>
            <li> i love moroccan oil products. i used one small squirt of this oil junk on my very straight soft brown hair after my shower on damp locks and then blow dry it. they wouldnt be so soft straight and very supple without it im sure</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail product 👌🏼</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Moroccan Oil for years but have had to drive a distance to get it so I thought I&#x27;d order it from you. Won&#x27;t again. What I got is NOT Moroccan Oil. Disgusted.</li>
            <li> I have always heard amazing things about argan oil helping with hair, skin, face, etc.  I have been struggling with keeping my dry hair smooth.  It&#x27;s been tangling and it&#x27;s so dry and coarse, I can never run hair fingers through my hair.  I can even hear my hair crunch in between my fingers- that&#x27;s how dry my hair is!  I&#x27;ve never chemically treated my hair BUT I do blow dry my hair after showers since my hair is so thick and takes a long time drying.  I finally received a small bottle of the Moroccan Oil, after voicing my dissatisfaction with all the other hair softening serums, from a friend.  Since it is an oil, I don&#x27;t use a whole lot.  I just take one of my fingers and I just cover the opening and I tilt bottle for oil to come out and I just rub it on the ends of my hair.  Start from the middle point of your hair and stroke downwards to make hair ends smoother.  I didn&#x27;t care to have this oil on my scalp since I worry it will make my head greasy.  The oil is very aromatic so if you don&#x27;t favor smells then this might be a no for you.  But I like the smell so it&#x27;s ok!  Might be a tad pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it coats the hair.  I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive...This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I have 2 daughters with long curly hair so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long. Other than that, I really love this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Great hair treatment and good for skin too!  Apply a little (goes a long way) to wet hair and you are easy to go.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil for years and this is NOT the real stuff. It is a knockoff, I am bummed that Amazon hasn&#x27;t stopped this yet. The bottle doesn&#x27;t even look the same..</li>
            <li> This is a great product for your hair. no more frizzy hair! Smells GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;Whether you want your hair curly, or straight this is a great product!!  But, don&#x27;t use too much at a time or your hair will look dirty. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was very annoyed to buy the product from this seller, because the product is not true, it&#x27;s a cheap falsification. I was very sorry to have purchased this product from him. And I want to warn everyone that this product is not true, is any oil, but is not the MOCORRANOIL therefore do not have the texture, smell and even the same power as the real has. DO NOT BUY THIS FAKE</li>
            <li> The product that I received in the mail today, while claiming to be Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment, was most certainly NOT Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clue #1: The smell. The awful, awful smell. The liquid in this bottle smelled like grandma&#x27;s perfume, not like the light, jasmine-y scent of authentic Moroccan Oil. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;Clue #2: The appearance. The thick, cloudy liquid in this bottle looked more like honey, and less like the clear, light, medium-viscosity Moroccan Oil. Come on.&lt;br /&gt;Clue #3: The packaging. The box looked beat up and weathered. And the bottle! The bottle had clearly been opened and re-glued, as evidenced by the stringy, booger-like glue that you find when you peel a brand new credit card off the mailer that it came in. And, while this glue is fun to play with, I don&#x27;t want it in, on, or near my hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment for years, and I&#x27;m no dummy. You&#x27;re not fooling anyone. And if it wasn&#x27;t for Amazon&#x27;s restriction on returning items of this type, I&#x27;d be sending this product back faster than you can say \\&quot;FAKE.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best product on the market for difficult to manage hair.  This oil makes my hair shine, feel silky and stay in place.  It does not appear greasy yet it eliminates frizz.  I recommend this.  Further, it came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I have course hair, and the first time I used this, my hair completely changed.  It took on a soft and shiny feel. And  yet does not feel greasy at all. This is my second bottle, It lasts FOREVER, but I can&#x27;t be without it.  Great value.</li>
            <li> My hair has noticeable softness and shine without feeling or looking greasy. The scent is very fresh. This Moroccan oil is light so hair is not weighed down. May be used while wet or dry and makes untangling a breeze. It is my number one product for styling. May be used on all hair types. It is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly.  Was a gift for my daughter-in-law.  She was happy with it.  Made a great Christmas Gift!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven but I didn&#x27;t got all the results showed on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s my hair type that was not in accordance with the product...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great does wonders for my hair , and it smells heavenly!!i highly recommend this , worth the price you pay</li>
            <li> No matter what the climate, Moroccan Oil always makes my hair look fabulous!!!  Thanks Moroccan Oil, for allowing me to always look my best.</li>
