    <ol>
            <li>very happy with all..</li>
            <li>Best product ever for curly and seemingly unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>vegan, great products..</li>
            <li>all of the Macadamia brand products, this smells great.  </li>
            <li>All of the Macadmia hair products are great for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Quite a deal for a conditioner this good, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do quite as good of job as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>you want a good, healthy hair product but can&#x27;t afford Good</li>
            <li>I love this product line!</li>
            <li>so am glad I found this!</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great &amp; goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I began to use my friend&#x27;s bottles over Christmas break, and I fell in love and ordered my own as soon as I could.</li>
            <li>I have very fine baby hair</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and shampoo to pieces.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the best scent ever, but it&#x27;s not gross-</li>
            <li>Safe for color-treated hair</li>
            <li>BeautyLuxx is not selling the authentic product.</li>
            <li>This one is a kind of light citrusy scent, not too overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>There are better conditioners out there that softens your hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner but better packing is needed as it arrived with the top busted.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I wish the price would be 4 to 5 US dollars cheaper, I would buy it more frecuently.</li>
            <li>My wife says it is the best shampoo she has used in a long time!</li>
            <li>It has a light, fresh scent with a bit of a tropical twist which I absolutely love!</li>
            <li>I thought this would deliver awesome results like the other two did.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this from a legitimate store so you can verify the authenticity of the product you are receiving, as it is a fairly pricey brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, though, it&#x27;s not meant to repair damage, only keep your hair conditioned, of which it does a great job.</li>
            <li>love it smell great and is soft for you hair , the hair will look shiny and soft and is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t all smell the same, but they do all smell really good.  </li>
            <li>so I can avoid purchasing from that particular seller and spend my money with a seller that is selling an authentic product.</li>
            <li>totally worth it in the end</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner it leaves the hair feeling soft</li>
            <li>First things first, this conditioner smells so YUMMY!</li>
            <li>I read that it was a full liter, but I didn&#x27;t realize quite how much you get.  </li>
            <li>which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s the real product!</li>
            <li>I love the deep repair masque and the healing oil treatment.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this line (I have used the shampoo, conditioner and volumizing dry shampoo).</li>
            <li>I have had both shampoo and conditioner straight from the Macadamia company.</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself is very creamy, and it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from a salon in a much smaller size at double the price and liked the results but not the price</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair silky, soft and shiny without the use of my blowdryer and straightener which is a huge bonus for me, as I have fairly fine, thin and color treated hair.</li>
            <li>A complete scam!</li>
            <li>Is it just me or are all the reviews under &amp;#34;Moisturizing Rinse Unisex Conditioner by Macadamia, 33.8 Ounce&amp;#34; really for the &amp;#34;Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask, 8.5 ounces Jar (Health and Beauty)?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny, soft, and luxurious.</li>
            <li>A good product keeps the hair soft and shinny; it is expensive!</li>
            <li>and this is the ONLY conditioner that keeps it from looking like a complete disaster.  </li>
            <li>My hair also got much shiner and had some added volume (only slight, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Long story short, I ended up buying liters of both the shampoo and conditioner from TJMaxx for $50 total!</li>
            <li> Amazon sells fake product which is a HUGE disappointment&lt;br</li>
            <li> even though I use it five times a week (the other days, I use their deep repair mask).  </li>

            <li> On top of that there are several reviews under all of the Macadamia line that say they received a fake product or at least one that didn&#x27;t look and smell like the store bought Macadamia product they typically use, but they don&#x27;t specify which seller from which they purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try out this line for a while now and was completely turned away from buying it on Amazon, as the majority of the reviews I read on it said the product was fake (this goes along with just about every Macadamia Natural Oil product on Amazon....</li>

            <li> I am 49 and my hair has become very dry, but my scalp is oily having me to wash my hair everyday and blowdry.</li>
            <li> not useful for frizzy hair</li>
            <li> My hair was far less broken and ratty after a week of using (I wash my hair every-other-day, and I suggest you do this as well.</li>
            <li> Then when I started using this bottle I instantly knew something was wrong.</li>
            <li> Product not authentic.  </li>
            <li> putting conditioner on and rinsing your hair, usually a conditioner makes your hair feel silkier and softer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it fell flat.</li>
            <li> ; That&#x27;s a tad confusing, Amazon.</li>
            <li> this does not even feel ilke the real one and it smells so nasty.</li>
            <li> If there are seller(s) out there that are selling fake products, I&#x27;d like to know which one</li>

            <li> this does not even feel ilke the real one and it smells so nasty. dont bye it is a rip off.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great &amp; goes on smoothly. I wish it had a detangler elements in it. My hair has tangles in it even after using the rinse twice since I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo to pieces. I began to use my friend&#x27;s bottles over Christmas break, and I fell in love and ordered my own as soon as I could. The product is paraben and sulfate-free- which is exactly what I was looking for. It doesn&#x27;t have the best scent ever, but it&#x27;s not gross- I could describe it as avacado-y? The prodcut works wonders. My hair was far less broken and ratty after a week of using (I wash my hair every-other-day, and I suggest you do this as well. This shampoo/conditioner may be too greasy for every day use). My hair also got much shiner and had some added volume (only slight, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good, healthy hair product but can&#x27;t afford Good On Ya- use this.</li>
            <li> vegan, great products.. i tried their shampoo, hair mask, leave-in conditioner and oil treatment. very happy with all..</li>
            <li> Best product ever for curly and seemingly unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine baby hair and this is the ONLY conditioner that keeps it from looking like a complete disaster.  I am 49 and my hair has become very dry, but my scalp is oily having me to wash my hair everyday and blowdry.</li>
            <li> I love this product line! I use it and recomend it to African American women with damaged hair who want to repair it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from a salon in a much smaller size at double the price and liked the results but not the price so am glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this line of products for a looong time. Then when I started using this bottle I instantly knew something was wrong. I have no idea what conditioner they put in tho bottle but I can guarantee that it&#x27;s NOT fro Macadmia! A complete scam! DO ONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
            <li> My wife says it is the best shampoo she has used in a long time!</li>
            <li> Is it just me or are all the reviews under &amp;#34;Moisturizing Rinse Unisex Conditioner by Macadamia, 33.8 Ounce&amp;#34; really for the &amp;#34;Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask, 8.5 ounces Jar (Health and Beauty)?&amp;#34; That&#x27;s a tad confusing, Amazon.

Amazon sells fake product which is a HUGE disappointment&lt;br /&gt;2. Pricey but totally worth it in the end</li>
            <li> came to cracked and spilling</li>
            <li> This was a bait and switch.  Product not authentic.  I have had both shampoo and conditioner straight from the Macadamia company. BeautyLuxx is not selling the authentic product. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!</li>
            <li> I read that it was a full liter, but I didn&#x27;t realize quite how much you get.  Quite a deal for a conditioner this good, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all of the Macadamia brand products, this smells great.  They don&#x27;t all smell the same, but they do all smell really good.  This one is a kind of light citrusy scent, not too overpowering at all.  The conditioner itself is very creamy, and it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do quite as good of job as the [[ASIN:B002WTC37A Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Mask, 8.5 ounces Jar]], but it does do really well as an everyday conditioner.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with buildup, even though I use it five times a week (the other days, I use their deep repair mask).  For damaged hair though, use the deep repair mask.  This conditioner alone won&#x27;t repair damage to your hair, but it will maintain it&#x27;s healthiness.  Keep in mind, though, it&#x27;s not meant to repair damage, only keep your hair conditioned, of which it does a great job.</li>
            <li> love it smell great and is soft for you hair , the hair will look shiny and soft and is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> im so sold on this Macadamia conditioner .i will recommend this product to my friends at home and at work.</li>
            <li> I can do without this conditioner.  There are better conditioners out there that softens your hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After putting conditioner on and rinsing your hair, usually a conditioner makes your hair feel silkier and softer.  For some reason, this one doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.  I love the deep repair masque and the healing oil treatment.  I thought this would deliver awesome results like the other two did.  Unfortunately, it fell flat.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner but better packing is needed as it arrived with the top busted.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner it leaves the hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> All of the Macadmia hair products are great for your hair.  I love this conditioner.  It makes my hair shiny, soft, and luxurious.</li>
            <li> A good product keeps the hair soft and shinny; it is expensive! I wish the price would be 4 to 5 US dollars cheaper, I would buy it more frecuently.</li>
