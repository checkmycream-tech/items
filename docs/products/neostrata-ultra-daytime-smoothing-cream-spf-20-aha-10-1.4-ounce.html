            <li>and the price was attractive too.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer with AHA for your face.  </li>
            <li>Great with foundation and compact powder.</li>
            <li>The SPF is a great plus.</li>
            <li>This product has been very effective for me.</li>
            <li>Promptly shipped - good price</li>
            <li>My mom loved it and shipped on time</li>
            <li>No break out at all and looks good all day.</li>
            <li>This really works great!</li>
            <li>For some reason, this one moisturizes so much better.</li>
            <li>My Dr. prescribed NeoStrata Daytime Smoothing Cream Level 2 SPF 15 which I have been using for many years,</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Glad they increased the SPF to 20.  </li>
            <li>Now it is even better.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>Will keep using this product for sure.</li>
            <li>I have othing more to say o this product...</li>
            <li>I have used many of Neostrata&#x27;s products for years.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my Dermatologist as daily protection (SPF 15) for my very fair skin and preventing precancerous cell growth.</li>
            <li>People are always telling me that my skin looks great and I am turning 65 years old soon.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey for the 1.4 ounces but the cream spreads easily</li>
            <li>and she commented on how smooth my face was.  </li>
            <li>It also offers good sun protection and has no odor.  </li>
            <li>Works for my adult acne skin, dissolves very top layer of my easily clogged skin.</li>
            <li>Why mess with a good thing?!</li>
            <li>It is worth giving it a try everyone.</li>
            <li>There are many other products out there that cost a lot more but don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>They never fail if I buy the right product for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced this will have the same or better protection.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to have the moisturizer, SPF and AHA all in one product.  </li>
            <li>NeoStrata recently changed the product formula to SPF 20 (remaining ingredients seem unchanged), but I am using this version until it no longer is available.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this cream highly.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t bother my fair and sensitive skin, and has a little sunscreen, but probably not enough.  </li>
            <li>Be careful when ordering this product as this company makes many products that are similar.  </li>
            <li>I believe that because I began using the product before facial lines became blatantly obvious; it has worked fabulously to keep them at bay.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel baby soft and it is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product, which my wife uses, has helped her retain the young looking skin she has.  </li>
            <li>May as well try Paula&#x27;s Choice, which is cheaper and bigger and has a better formula but the same active ingredients as this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone that has normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>No strong odor &amp; absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li>but apparently it&#x27;s off the market, so</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and the tube lasts quite a while even though I use it everyday.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I showed up at my sister-in-law&#x27;s house and she commented on how smooth my face was.  This really works great!</li>
            <li> Very nice! Works for my adult acne skin, dissolves very top layer of my easily clogged skin. I have this same cream for night time use without SPF in it. For some reason, this one moisturizes so much better.</li>
            <li> Noticeably smoother skin and smaller pores!  No strong odor &amp; absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff leavers a white film on your skin, does not soak in at all, horrible. Tried to return, didn&#x27;t happen, sucks to be me.</li>
            <li> My Dr. prescribed NeoStrata Daytime Smoothing Cream Level 2 SPF 15 which I have been using for many years, but apparently it&#x27;s off the market, so I&#x27;m trying this instead.  I&#x27;m convinced this will have the same or better protection.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and love the way it makes my skin feel. I would highly recommend it to anyone that has normal to dry skin. It makes your skin feel baby soft and it is not greasy. Plus you have the benefit of AHA and a sun screen of 15.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time after my dermatologist recommended that I use it.  It is very convenient to have the moisturizer, SPF and AHA all in one product.  If I plan to be in the sun for a long time, I do put on a stronger SPF over this product but this works well alone under sporadic sun exposure.  People are always telling me that my skin looks great and I am turning 65 years old soon.  After purchasing this product from the dermatologist, I found it on Amazon for much less money, so that is where I buy it now.  The price is very reasonable and the tube lasts quite a while even though I use it everyday.  There are many other products out there that cost a lot more but don&#x27;t work as well.  Be careful when ordering this product as this company makes many products that are similar.  The last time I ordered I made the mistake of getting the moisturizer with the AHA but without the SPF and I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> this is a very good cream. and the price was attractive too. a little tingling for start. you know the acid is working on your skin.</li>
            <li> Promptly shipped - good price</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist as daily protection (SPF 15) for my very fair skin and preventing precancerous cell growth. Moisturizes without being greasy. In addition to avoiding prolonged sun exposure, I have been using for years and skin remains youthful and keratosis-free. It is pricey for the 1.4 ounces but the cream spreads easily so you only need a dab to cover your face. NeoStrata recently changed the product formula to SPF 20 (remaining ingredients seem unchanged), but I am using this version until it no longer is available. Why mess with a good thing?!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer with AHA for your face.  Glad they increased the SPF to 20.  Now it is even better.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent.  I have been using this product for years.  It is worth giving it a try everyone.</li>

            <li> Great product! My dermatologist recommended it a few years ago and I have used it ever since. It&#x27;s like a  minor face lift in a tube.</li>
            <li> Good daily use and base SPF protection. Great with foundation and compact powder.No break out at all and looks good all day.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  Does not bother my sensitive skin. The SPF is a great plus. Will keep using this product for sure.</li>
            <li> It is what I always get and like it.  I have othing more to say o this product...it was what I orderd and I like it.</li>
            <li> I have used many of Neostrata&#x27;s products for years.  They never fail if I buy the right product for my skin.  The Ultra Daytime Smoothing Cream softens and exfoliates just as advertised.  It also offers good sun protection and has no odor.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neostrata for years, since my dermatologist recommended it, and have tried several of their items.  I always come back to this one though.  Moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t bother my fair and sensitive skin, and has a little sunscreen, but probably not enough.  I would recommend this cream highly.</li>
            <li> This product, which my wife uses, has helped her retain the young looking skin she has.  It is not drying to the skin, as similar products can be.</li>
            <li> The best product I have used for 15 years!  I am never going to give this product up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used NeoStrata products regularly for 15 years. Obviously, I would not continue to use a product for this long if the results didn&#x27;t meet or exceed the desired results. I believe that because I began using the product before facial lines became blatantly obvious; it has worked fabulously to keep them at bay. This product has been very effective for me.</li>
            <li> I use it daily for skin smoothing and sun protection.  It seems to work.</li>
