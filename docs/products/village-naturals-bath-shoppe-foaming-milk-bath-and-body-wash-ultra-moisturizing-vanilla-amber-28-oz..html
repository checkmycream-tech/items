            <li>It is an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>Garden tubs are the best to take bubble baths in and I always liked this brand.</li>

            <li>good and silky.</li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>I am glad I did buy it, though!</li>
            <li>It is actually amazing.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and wonderful bubble bath.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes really nice bubbles</li>
            <li>It bubbles nicely</li>
            <li>and it just doesn&#x27;t play nice with my olfactory senses.</li>
            <li>makes lots of bubbles and smells nice.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also makes a lovely body wash and leaves my skin smelling good and feeling</li>
            <li>Leaves my sking very soft and with a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a substitute for the absolute best bubble bath ever made which I used to get for free.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great, and it is very very bubbly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that the bubbles of this one are as good as the perfect one -- since I can&#x27;t do a side-by-side comparison for the fact that I no longer have any of the other stuff on hand -- but it would be a close race.  </li>
            <li>very good, even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I then noticed a piece of tape holding the top together</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>I need something much more creamy.</li>
            <li>This body wash is incredible, I have never bought a body wash claiming to be \\&quot;milky\\&quot; and actually seen milk in the ingredient listing.</li>
            <li>This is a great bubble bath and leaves your skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful scent and left me feeling relaxed and peaceful.</li>
            <li>I get out of the bath feeling like my skin is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>As for the scent in this one, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just a metaphor.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and makes you skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>It has a nice, soft scent that fills the bathroom and lingers on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant aroma that permeates the whole house and my skin feels silky smooth into the next day.</li>
            <li>I read a review that this product did not smell so great, so I was a little hesitant to buy it.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product I would readily suggest to ANYONE looking to enhance their shower or bath experience.</li>
            <li>Aside from this, the product smells nice and it&#x27;s bigger than I thought it was going to be as well.</li>
            <li>The bubbles go away quickly &amp; there isn&#x27;t much of a scent to it, even if I use a ton.  </li>
            <li>I like the product  as it is gentle on my skin without much fragrance,, very inexpensive and it arrived very quickly .</li>
            <li>I will be back if ever I run out of body wash. :)</li>
            <li>This is exactly the product I needed to end the search.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>The product is soft and smells good, but those &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; are probably not natural amber or vanilla.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but the bubbles don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Made me super soft.</li>
            <li>So I have to rate that aspect of this bubble bath pretty high.  </li>
            <li>As an added bonus it is also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>i was really disapointed</li>
            <li>milk bath is very helpful in making my skin</li>
            <li>Very Watery.</li>
            <li>is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large, but the amount needed to make a decent amount of bubbles is also large.</li>
            <li>Left my skin soft, but not greasy, and it rinsed very clean.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing this originally because it was literally the only bubble bath on sale at Target.</li>
            <li>I got my item earlier than expected and it came nicely wrapped.</li>
            <li>But I suspect the sweet fragrances I smell are not natural.  </li>
            <li>This purchase was an impulse buy, I am addicted to body washes and needed a couple more items to get super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the price is right and I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>A little amount forms a lot of foam, and the scent is warm and romantic.</li>
            <li>This is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>I prefer cucumber but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>This product was relativly cheap for bubble bath and created an excet amount of long lasting bubbles!</li>
            <li>Now, if you really want to have the scent of vanilla while steeping in this bubble bath, I suggest you fire up a vanilla candle while you&#x27;re at it because that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re going get it.  </li>
            <li>If you can get your hands on any of the Village natural bath soap..</li>
            <li>though I have a sensitive skin, it works</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the variety of Village Natural bath products I get her yearly.  </li>
            <li>only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the bottle may be large, but the amount I have to put it in the tub to get bubbles will make it so this bottle only lasts through 10 to 15 uses.</li>
            <li>I only had to use about a quarter sized amount to get complete coverage.</li>
            <li>i expected a whole bottle of it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would really smell or work, and with online buys I am always very wary of how the item lives up to my expectations.</li>

Well, with this wash it listed dry milk and other natural ingredients on the back. Left my skin soft, but not greasy, and it rinsed very clean. I only had to use about a quarter sized amount to get complete coverage. After getting out of the shower and toweling off, the scent was still on my skin. Subtle, but not nonexistent. This is a fantastic product I would readily suggest to ANYONE looking to enhance their shower or bath experience. I will be back if ever I run out of body wash. :)</li>
            <li> It has become increasingly difficult to find an affordable bubble bath for adults, but my search is over.  This is exactly the product I needed to end the search.  Will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> In general I find it very annoying that it is so hard to find bubble bath in stores and when you do the quality is very low.  This is a great bubble bath and leaves your skin feeling soft.  The smell is nice and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the bottle may be large, but the amount I have to put it in the tub to get bubbles will make it so this bottle only lasts through 10 to 15 uses.</li>
            <li> The Sandal Amber Milk Bath is a wonderful product with a luscious scent. The milk bath fills the bathroom with it&#x27;s wonderful scent and left me feeling relaxed and peaceful. This product was relativly cheap for bubble bath and created an excet amount of long lasting bubbles! I would definitly suggest this product if you like scents such as amger jewel, vanilla or honey like scents. The milk bath also left a faint hint of it&#x27;s scent on my skin afterwords. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Strange, isn&#x27;t it.  But it&#x27;s not my fault as I got hooked because a friend of mine -- a bubble bath pusher no longer in this world -- started giving me the stuff as gifts.  Well ... that&#x27;s history, so I&#x27;m looking for a substitute for the absolute best bubble bath ever made which I used to get for free.  That search led me to try this one and another scent of the same brand.  I can&#x27;t say that the bubbles of this one are as good as the perfect one -- since I can&#x27;t do a side-by-side comparison for the fact that I no longer have any of the other stuff on hand -- but it would be a close race.  So I have to rate that aspect of this bubble bath pretty high.  The disappointment is the scent ... it must have gotten lost somewhere along the shipping route.  But what do you expect when something has the word \\&quot;milk\\&quot; in the name of the scent?  Now, if you really want to have the scent of vanilla while steeping in this bubble bath, I suggest you fire up a vanilla candle while you&#x27;re at it because that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re going get it.  As for the scent in this one, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just a metaphor.</li>
            <li> If you can get your hands on any of the Village natural bath soap..OMG it is the best body soap out there.</li>
            <li> Garden tubs are the best to take bubble baths in and I always liked this brand. Time to relax after a long day!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but the bubbles don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Lasted about a month. Yummy smell and my dauggter loved it too.</li>
            <li> The bubbles go away quickly &amp; there isn&#x27;t much of a scent to it, even if I use a ton.  I prefer other bubble bath products.</li>
            <li> I have not yet received this product but I know village Naturals do not test on animals - and  makes lots of bubbles</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It has a pleasant aroma that permeates the whole house and my skin feels silky smooth into the next day. I don&#x27;t even have to use lotion after bathing for my dry skin. It is an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and makes you skin feel so soft! Makes really nice bubbles but they only stay for about 20 minutes until it&#x27;s just flat bubbles on the surface.</li>
            <li> very good, even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Made me super soft.</li>
            <li> Lots of bubbles.  This produce produces lots of foam which lasts a long time for those who like to relax in the tub. Good price too.</li>
            <li> i nonly got 1 thrid of a bottle of this product. i couldn&#x27;t believe it. i expected a whole bottle of it. i was really disapointed</li>
            <li> I got my item earlier than expected and it came nicely wrapped. I then noticed a piece of tape holding the top together so nothing spills out. The top does not close and this is not a good sign for me, as I am a clumsy person. Aside from this, the product smells nice and it&#x27;s bigger than I thought it was going to be as well.</li>
            <li> It’s not true that skin care products are for girls only.&lt;br /&gt;I’m a man and I use a lot of skin care products because I want to maintain my good skin.&lt;br /&gt;This milk bath is very helpful in making my skin smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have a sensitive skin, it works fine.&lt;br /&gt; I don’t have any rashes at all!</li>
            <li> I compared the ingredients from four Village Naturals products I bought.  Of the 24 ingredients listed on this product, 20 are the same on all of them.  Half of the ingredients are natural-- coconut, milk, aloe, chamomile, orange and shea butter.  But I suspect the sweet fragrances I smell are not natural.  The product is soft and smells good, but those &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; are probably not natural amber or vanilla.</li>
            <li> It bubbles nicely and I like that it&#x27;s made in the USA. Unfortunately, I forgot that their vanilla has a dusty/musty smell. It&#x27;s not a defect, it&#x27;s their formula and it just doesn&#x27;t play nice with my olfactory senses. You do get a lot for the money, though.</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorites. A little amount forms a lot of foam, and the scent is warm and romantic. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last two years, and would not change it. Leaves my sking very soft and with a wonderful smell. I&#x27;ll recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Just not one of my favorites. I prefer cucumber but wanted to try something new. I also like bubble bath.</li>
            <li> Does not moisturize as I thought it would. I need something much more creamy. Very Watery.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the variety of Village Natural bath products I get her yearly.  She loves to soak in the tub, it is her treat to luxuary.  She says she feels so pampered and relaxed in her various scents and kinds of bath products.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the different scents. Great smells, and makes your skin&lt;br /&gt;feel good and silky. A little goes a long way. Great Product and Price.</li>
            <li> makes lots of bubbles and smells nice.....dries skin though</li>
            <li> I read a review that this product did not smell so great, so I was a little hesitant to buy it. I am glad I did buy it, though! The vanilla is not overpowering and the amber mixed in with it is absolutely heavenly. It has a nice, soft scent that fills the bathroom and lingers on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also makes a lovely body wash and leaves my skin smelling good and feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount needed to make enough bubbles is the only reason I did not rate it 5 stars. The bottle is large, but the amount needed to make a decent amount of bubbles is also large. Regardless, the price is right and I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I like the product  as it is gentle on my skin without much fragrance,, very inexpensive and it arrived very quickly .</li>
