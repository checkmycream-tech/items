            <li>Equally satisfying!  </li>
            <li>We were at the end of our vacation and had run out of our own soaps.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Shikai Sandalwood Shower Jell because my wife and I both like the smell of Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;Other users are correct when they state, the product does a nice job in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER</li>
            <li>I already love their cucumber melon body wash, so I figured they would do a good job with this one.  </li>
            <li>Shikai makes a lot of excellent, often organic, body products that really work as advertised.</li>
            <li>This Sandalwood Shower Gel lathers up a storm and leaves a nice, non-greasy layer of moisture all over your body.</li>
            <li>Nice to get three at a time.</li>
            <li>Shikai has also come out with several awesome hand wash formulas that are wonderful and very gentle.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood is mild and mellow, yet very pleasant, I really enjoy it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been the best body wash that I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I first encountered this product when renting a beautiful guest house on a Maui beach.  </li>
            <li>You could say it was a masculine scent, but I think it would smell just as wonderful on women.  </li>
            <li>This is actually by far the best shaving cream (replacement) I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>just took a shot but was totally surprised at how perfect this gel is - as shampoo, soap and shave gel - hope</li>
            <li>ewww the smell is too strong!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy unless you like strong fragrances!</li>
            <li>I also found that it doubles up great as a shaving cream and as a... uhh... nice lubrication ointment for intimate moments in the shower.  </li>
            <li>So many of the liquid soaps are overpowering with a very strong scent.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes skin and love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love the sandlewood smell and satiny feel of this product.</li>
            <li>Smells more like sand.</li>
            <li>A worthwhile indulgence.      </li>
            <li>I used to have a favorite shaving cream</li>
            <li>I am allergic to so many things found in many bodywash formulations, have to read labels like nobody&#x27;s business.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Sandalwood is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>This soap cured my allergic reaction to liquid soap and yet leaves a refreshing scent on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the scent ...........</li>
            <li>I love this shower gel.</li>
            <li>And Amazon has it cheaper than my local health food store, so WIN!</li>

            <li>I enjoy this body wash very much, It isnt too strong and has a great sandalwood smell.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent, great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This way I can make it as strong as I want and get some more moisturizing in there.</li>
            <li>This smells so good and is nice to use, all natural and softens my skin.  </li>
            <li>was a good unisex fragrance..not so much.</li>
            <li>Always run out of it easy....</li>
            <li>I love love love this so much, along with the body lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent and the clean feel after showering.  </li>
            <li>Shi Kai is the ONLY product that keeps my skin in great condition, gets me clean AND doesn&#x27;t make me itch or burn!  </li>
            <li>gel also lathers well and is easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>, we refill our bottles at a huge savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the owners had provided this shower gel.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, there&#x27;s Amazon.</li>
            <li>B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my fiance and it smells so fantastic when he showers with it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to find a body wash that had that scent and was cruelty free.</li>
            <li>The gel is nice and moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this new shower gel, and I very glad I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean but also soothed and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing, but with a certain richness, too.  </li>
            <li>I guessed right!</li>
            <li>you have dry skin or very sensitive skin, this is the best product for you!</li>
            <li>First bottle was a gift--I liked it so much I ordered three bottles</li>
            <li>The sandalwood scent is true and in no way synthethic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works phenomenally, and I really like the Sandalwood</li>
            <li>Mild on skin with a pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Obviously it isn&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s worth the money for making mornings that much easier to take!  </li>
            <li>I really like sandalwood, and it&#x27;s hard to find products with the true aroma - but Shikai nailed it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I love the products of Shikai and, especially, the Sandalwood Shower Gel - my wife has difficulties with most fragrances but tolerates this very well - the Sandalwood leaves a pleasant scent on the body that lasts all day long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect if you suffer dry skin or eczema, the only shower gel or soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn or aggravate my kids skin when their eczema is flaring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be more satisfied if the scent was longer lasting but overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>A couple of bucks a month is worth it for something that works so well.  </li>
            <li>Really more masculine</li>
            <li>It rinses very clean and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, natural aroma, very gender neutral, men feel comfortable using the florals and women using the sandalwood, traditionally a more masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I have received it very fast but delivery was</li>
            <li>As a guy, I don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t give much thought to the soap/shower gel/body wash/whatever-you-call-it that I use to clean myself.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was me, but my wife agreed&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only wish is that the sandalwood scent were more pronounced.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is devine and it leaves the skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a good scent that is subtle, yet clean.</li>
            <li>This shower gel has a rich rather and makes skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I was so hoping for a more lasting, intense sandalwood fragrance.</li>
            <li>exactly like I imagined not too strong not too subtle and very clean -</li>
            <li>while I found this to be moisturizing and gentle</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to anyone who wants to try an oatmeal and aloe shower gel.</li>
            <li>The shower gel itself is gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The 3 pack is no longer available as part of Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program, I wish they would bring it back!</li>
            <li>whatever) is actually better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>My wife swears by the Cucumber Melon; but I really like the smell of Sandalwood; so I got her both</li>
            <li>a guy, I dont really like the fruity smells that some body washes have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shower gel also hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li>and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a musky, woody smell, that&#x27;s actually quite manly (not that it&#x27;s not womanly).  </li>
            <li>The product still deserves 5 stars so I&#x27;ve left my original review</li>
            <li>Generally, I&#x27;m skeptical when I see reviews talking about the toxicity of products, but I&#x27;ve just experienced the problem first</li>
            <li>A little more care in the packing would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular Shikai gel for years.  </li>
            <li>Would be better if it had been packaged in a box or in such a way that the cap wouldn&#x27;t be bumped open.</li>
            <li>I tend to have itchy skin when using highly fragrant shower gels.  </li>
            <li>But still highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend--</li>
            <li>Well, let me tell you, this is one of the few scented products I&#x27;ll gladly buy.  </li>
            <li>you can buy gallons of this wonderful product here:[...</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean without the soap residue that you have with other products.  </li>
            <li>It is still pretty good, unfortunately, the manufacturer has taken the low road here.  </li>
            <li>This stuff lathers up real well, it spreads around real well, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make it feel rubbery.  </li>
            <li>Shikai, the company, has several different aromas, all of them mild, not perfume or cloying at all.</li>
            <li>You may be inclined to rinse off too much because of the soft feeling left on the skin.</li>
            <li>You can use it as a shave gel too, as its been my experience this doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And talk about soft skin..</li>
            <li>They silently changed the formula and omitted the real sandalwood oil that used to be in it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but Amazon mailed the 3 bottles to me in  an open plastic bag and did not secure the tops.</li>
            <li>And with all the extra functionality built in, it&#x27;s hard to complain.  :-)</li>
            <li>The smell is a very soft earthy, seductive and sensual smell and that stays on you the entire day.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin so soft and great smelling, you won;t be disappointed</li>
            <li>et barely smells of sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and this is just about the only body wash</li>
            <li>Fortunately the scent is subtle.</li>
            <li>This product contains Coconut diethanolamide, which has been declared by multiple international entities as a carcinogen, and can cause dermatitis for patients with sensitive</li>
            <li>I tend to have dry skin, and some body washes really add to that and dry my skin in out.</li>

            <li> exactly like I imagined not too strong not too subtle and very clean -</li>
            <li> while I found this to be moisturizing and gentle</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to anyone who wants to try an oatmeal and aloe shower gel.</li>
            <li> The shower gel itself is gentle and moisturizing.</li>

            <li> My wife swears by the Cucumber Melon; but I really like the smell of Sandalwood; so I got her both</li>
            <li> a guy, I dont really like the fruity smells that some body washes have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shower gel also hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li> and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a musky, woody smell, that&#x27;s actually quite manly (not that it&#x27;s not womanly).  </li>
            <li> The product still deserves 5 stars so I&#x27;ve left my original review</li>
            <li> Generally, I&#x27;m skeptical when I see reviews talking about the toxicity of products, but I&#x27;ve just experienced the problem first</li>
            <li> A little more care in the packing would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular Shikai gel for years.  </li>
            <li> Would be better if it had been packaged in a box or in such a way that the cap wouldn&#x27;t be bumped open.</li>
            <li> I tend to have itchy skin when using highly fragrant shower gels.  </li>

            <li> Well, let me tell you, this is one of the few scented products I&#x27;ll gladly buy.  </li>
            <li> you can buy gallons of this wonderful product here:[...</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling clean without the soap residue that you have with other products.  </li>
            <li> It is still pretty good, unfortunately, the manufacturer has taken the low road here.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lathers up real well, it spreads around real well, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make it feel rubbery.  </li>
            <li> Shikai, the company, has several different aromas, all of them mild, not perfume or cloying at all.</li>
            <li> You may be inclined to rinse off too much because of the soft feeling left on the skin.</li>
            <li> You can use it as a shave gel too, as its been my experience this doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And talk about soft skin..</li>
            <li> They silently changed the formula and omitted the real sandalwood oil that used to be in it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product but Amazon mailed the 3 bottles to me in  an open plastic bag and did not secure the tops.</li>
            <li> And with all the extra functionality built in, it&#x27;s hard to complain.  :-)</li>
            <li> The smell is a very soft earthy, seductive and sensual smell and that stays on you the entire day.</li>
            <li> leaves your skin so soft and great smelling, you won;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> et barely smells of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and this is just about the only body wash</li>
            <li> Fortunately the scent is subtle.</li>
            <li> This product contains Coconut diethanolamide, which has been declared by multiple international entities as a carcinogen, and can cause dermatitis for patients with sensitive</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin, and some body washes really add to that and dry my skin in out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong, but my wife really likes the smell on me.    </li>
            <li> To all my male brethren who suffer from dry skin, especially in the winter time: fear not, for here is your answer.  </li>
            <li> I hesitate to say that your skin feels moist after drying yourself off from a shower, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li> I like this and would like to recommend people who have dry skin, same as me.</li>
            <li> During winter when the dry air can chafe or cause ashy dry skin</li>
            <li> bought this soap because I have dry skin (and it claims to be a moisturizing product).</li>
            <li> it, and banish your cracked, dry skin forevermore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m discovering you can even dilute it a tad with some water to make it last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Too much trouble to mail back.</li>
            <li> Smells stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Package came with one bottle already 1/3 empty, and shower gel all over the inside of the bag.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> read about it for yourself, and skip this one until the manufacturer uses some other type of surfactant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i ordered 5 other items.  </li>
            <li> this is the least expensive shikai shower gel in 12 ounce version and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Really, that&#x27;s my only disappointment with it.</li>
            <li> I was overjoyed a couple of months after returning from Maui when I just happened to stumble across Shikai&#x27;s Sandalwood Shower Gel again at my local Whole Paycheck, but I was soon bummed out when the idiots stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> It was tough to tell if this soap was the cause because the symptoms didn&#x27;t disappear quickly / seem to line up with my usage, but after finally going cold turkey a month or two ago the dermatitis has not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> It does not contain typical soap ingredients and is not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon made it lots less expensive--especially the three pack.</li>
            <li> After using a very small amount of the product on my face over the past few YEARS, I recently (past ~6 months) developed severe dermatitis around my eyelid and scalp.</li>
            <li> So I was immediately suspicious of Shikai&#x27;s Sandalwood Shower Gel, but at that point had little choice.  </li>
            <li> Usually scented products upset my allergies, and most shower gels dry my skin, irritate it, and/or give me a nasty rash.  </li>
            <li> less filling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but only four stars for it.</li>
            <li> This is a soap-like product with a mellow sandalwood aroma that&#x27;s not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely pricey, but when you think about how often you have to buy another bottle, it&#x27;s really not that bad.  </li>
            <li> , i.e., it has a manly smell that slowly dissipates over the course of the day.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle, woody, and not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li> the odor is not just subtle it is non existent.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle.</li>
            <li> terrible,- one of the bottle has poured out, and all bottles were wet and not nice.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the dermatitis always returned and yet I didn&#x27;t want to believe this was linked to some product I was using because I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in years.</li>
            <li> Needless to say everything in the box was covered in the shower</li>
            <li> Maybe 10 cents, but they decided it was too expensive for this OVERPRICED product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t disappointed me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Moisturizes skin and love the scent.</li>
            <li> you can buy gallons of this wonderful product here:[...]&lt;br /&gt;it leaves your skin so soft and great smelling, you won;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> This has been the best body wash that I have used so far. Mild on skin with a pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li> while I found this to be moisturizing and gentle I was so hoping for a more lasting, intense sandalwood fragrance. Really, that&#x27;s my only disappointment with it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001ET7EAU Shikai Sandalwood Shower Gel, 12-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]]    This is the best shower gel I have used.  It does not contain typical soap ingredients and is not tested on animals.  I tend to have itchy skin when using highly fragrant shower gels.  This shower gel has a great scent, and it leaves my skin feeling soothed.    I will recommend this to anyone who wants to try an oatmeal and aloe shower gel.</li>
            <li> I love the sandlewood smell and satiny feel of this product. Great moisturizer. I use it as a bath wash and bubble bath. The smell is a very soft earthy, seductive and sensual smell and that stays on you the entire day.</li>
            <li> This works great and does leave your skin softer. You may be inclined to rinse off too much because of the soft feeling left on the skin. Good product.</li>
            <li> Smells more like sand. I kid you not. Fortunately the scent is subtle. The shower gel itself is gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I first encountered this product when renting a beautiful guest house on a Maui beach.  We were at the end of our vacation and had run out of our own soaps.  Fortunately, the owners had provided this shower gel.  Usually scented products upset my allergies, and most shower gels dry my skin, irritate it, and/or give me a nasty rash.  So I was immediately suspicious of Shikai&#x27;s Sandalwood Shower Gel, but at that point had little choice.  We were grungy from the ocean and needed a bath.    Well, let me tell you, this is one of the few scented products I&#x27;ll gladly buy.  The fragrance is subtle, woody, and not overpowering at all.  Clean and refreshing, but with a certain richness, too.  You could say it was a masculine scent, but I think it would smell just as wonderful on women.  It smells healthy, athletic if that makes any sense, and expensive - more expensive than it actually is.  It leaves your skin feeling clean but also soothed and moisturized.  Obviously it isn&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s worth the money for making mornings that much easier to take!  A worthwhile indulgence.      I was overjoyed a couple of months after returning from Maui when I just happened to stumble across Shikai&#x27;s Sandalwood Shower Gel again at my local Whole Paycheck, but I was soon bummed out when the idiots stopped carrying it.  Fortunately, there&#x27;s Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be more satisfied if the scent was longer lasting but overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product. May or may not re-buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:: The 3 pack is no longer available as part of Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program, I wish they would bring it back! The product still deserves 5 stars so I&#x27;ve left my original review but I&#x27;d like to suggest that the shower gel can be purchased by the gallon for around $45 - $48, we refill our bottles at a huge savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying Shikai shower gel for my family for years. It has a fresh, natural aroma, very gender neutral, men feel comfortable using the florals and women using the sandalwood, traditionally a more masculine scent. It&#x27;s perfect if you suffer dry skin or eczema, the only shower gel or soap I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn or aggravate my kids skin when their eczema is flaring. During winter when the dry air can chafe or cause ashy dry skin my kids avoid hand washing. We can&#x27;t have that! Using Shikai at the sink as well as shower is the only way I can get them to wash up with whining. It&#x27;s around $10 per bottle in my area stores, buying it here on amazon with subscribe and save is like getting a bottle free!&lt;br /&gt;Or, as mentioned above, getting by the gallon saves a ton! Shikai has also come out with several awesome hand wash formulas that are wonderful and very gentle.</li>
            <li> this is the least expensive shikai shower gel in 12 ounce version and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Generally, I&#x27;m skeptical when I see reviews talking about the toxicity of products, but I&#x27;ve just experienced the problem first hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this soap because I have dry skin (and it claims to be a moisturizing product). After using a very small amount of the product on my face over the past few YEARS, I recently (past ~6 months) developed severe dermatitis around my eyelid and scalp. The itchiness and redness were unbearable, and my dermatologist prescribed a topical steroid that helped somewhat. Unfortunately, the dermatitis always returned and yet I didn&#x27;t want to believe this was linked to some product I was using because I hadn&#x27;t changed anything in years. It was tough to tell if this soap was the cause because the symptoms didn&#x27;t disappear quickly / seem to line up with my usage, but after finally going cold turkey a month or two ago the dermatitis has not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this week, when I decided to do some research (why I didn&#x27;t do this sooner, I don&#x27;t know). This product contains Coconut diethanolamide, which has been declared by multiple international entities as a carcinogen, and can cause dermatitis for patients with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just read about it for yourself, and skip this one until the manufacturer uses some other type of surfactant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sources:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> As a guy, I don&#x27;t really don&#x27;t give much thought to the soap/shower gel/body wash/whatever-you-call-it that I use to clean myself.  However, my wife picked up some Shikai shower gel from Trader Joe&#x27;s once upon a time, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  This stuff lathers up real well, it spreads around real well, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make it feel rubbery.  I also found that it doubles up great as a shaving cream and as a... uhh... nice lubrication ointment for intimate moments in the shower.  This is actually by far the best shaving cream (replacement) I have ever used.  I used to have a favorite shaving cream and now I haven&#x27;t even bothered buying any for years.  Anyway, the flavor (fragrance, whatever) is actually better than I expected.  It&#x27;s kind of a musky, woody smell, that&#x27;s actually quite manly (not that it&#x27;s not womanly).  It&#x27;s not strong, but my wife really likes the smell on me.    It&#x27;s definitely pricey, but when you think about how often you have to buy another bottle, it&#x27;s really not that bad.  A couple of bucks a month is worth it for something that works so well.  And with all the extra functionality built in, it&#x27;s hard to complain.  :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular Shikai gel for years.  The only confusion on this order was that Shikai has repackaged it!  What used to be Sandalwood and Amber in a different designed bottle is now just Sandalwood.  Equally satisfying!  Susan in Santa Fe</li>
            <li> I purchased Shikai Sandalwood Shower Jell because my wife and I both like the smell of Sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;Other users are correct when they state, the product does a nice job in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER the odor is not just subtle it is non existent. At first I thought it was me, but my wife agreed&lt;br /&gt;so I tried another, younger person. We all agree You just cannot smell Sandalwood. so, one star for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over 10 years.  I am allergic to so many things found in many bodywash formulations, have to read labels like nobody&#x27;s business.  Shi Kai is the ONLY product that keeps my skin in great condition, gets me clean AND doesn&#x27;t make me itch or burn!  I you have dry skin or very sensitive skin, this is the best product for you!</li>
            <li> I really like sandalwood, and it&#x27;s hard to find products with the true aroma - but Shikai nailed it perfectly.  I already love their cucumber melon body wash, so I figured they would do a good job with this one.  I guessed right!</li>
            <li> To all my male brethren who suffer from dry skin, especially in the winter time: fear not, for here is your answer.  I&#x27;ve been using this shower gel for over a year.  It smells of sandalwood, i.e., it has a manly smell that slowly dissipates over the course of the day.  I hesitate to say that your skin feels moist after drying yourself off from a shower, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t feel dry.  I still use hand cream in the winter time [[ASIN:B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]], but this shower gel suffices for spring, summer, and fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it, and banish your cracked, dry skin forevermore.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by the Cucumber Melon; but I really like the smell of Sandalwood; so I got her both and she seems to like them equally.</li>
            <li> Holy Smokes - this Shikai Sandalwood Gel is Great - smells exactly like I imagined not too strong not too subtle and very clean - just took a shot but was totally surprised at how perfect this gel is - as shampoo, soap and shave gel - hope I don&#x27;t drive the price up by publishing this review - I ll be buying more of this its great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my fiance and it smells so fantastic when he showers with it.  The sandalwood scent is true and in no way synthethic.  This shower gel has a rich rather and makes skin feel so soft.  I have to admit, I use it myself from time to time.  It&#x27;s a great soap.  I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. First bottle was a gift--I liked it so much I ordered three bottles and I love it.  It&#x27;s great for dry skin. The fragrance is subtle. Ordering from Amazon made it lots less expensive--especially the three pack.</li>
            <li> Shikai makes a lot of excellent, often organic, body products that really work as advertised. This Sandalwood Shower Gel lathers up a storm and leaves a nice, non-greasy layer of moisture all over your body. My only wish is that the sandalwood scent were more pronounced. But still highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this new shower gel, and I very glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works phenomenally, and I really like the Sandalwood smell.&lt;br /&gt;As a guy, I dont really like the fruity smells that some body washes have. The sandalwood is mild and mellow, yet very pleasant, I really enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower gel also hydrates my skin very well. I tend to have dry skin, and some body washes really add to that and dry my skin in out. This product was great, it kept my skin feeling hydrated for quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel also lathers well and is easy and comfortable to use. I suppose you could even use it as shaving cream, although I have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think its a great body wash and I will be buying again. The three pack is a convenient option too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you.</li>
            <li> I love the products of Shikai and, especially, the Sandalwood Shower Gel - my wife has difficulties with most fragrances but tolerates this very well - the Sandalwood leaves a pleasant scent on the body that lasts all day long</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is one of my favorite scents. I wanted to find a body wash that had that scent and was cruelty free. This fits the bill. The gel is nice and moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t take much. The four star rating is because I wish the scent was stronger. I have remedied this by purchasing some sandalwood essential oil to add to the bottle. This way I can make it as strong as I want and get some more moisturizing in there. You can use it as a shave gel too, as its been my experience this doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So many of the liquid soaps are overpowering with a very strong scent.  This soap cured my allergic reaction to liquid soap and yet leaves a refreshing scent on my skin.</li>
            <li> if i wanted to smell Mr.Bubbles I would buy Mr.Bubbles.  Me nor my coworkers could smell any sandalwood at all.</li>
            <li> I love love love this so much, along with the body lotion. I love the scent ...........it is really yummy !!!! But then again I am a Sandalwood FREAK ! I just wish they made a body spray  and a shampoo and conditioner in this scent !</li>
            <li> I bought this because the shower gel I used before would not release anymore.  I read the reviews and decided to try.  It doesn&#x27;t disappointed me.  I like this and would like to recommend people who have dry skin, same as me.</li>
            <li> I have received it very fast but delivery was terrible,- one of the bottle has poured out, and all bottles were wet and not nice. I&#x27;m sorry but only four stars for it.</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel. Has a great sandalwood scent. And Amazon has it cheaper than my local health food store, so WIN!</li>
            <li> Love this non-soap soap!!  Leaves you feeling clean without the soap residue that you have with other products.  And talk about soft skin.. there you have it!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product et took a chance to purchase this shower gel. It came in a set of three. It does not lather well et barely smells of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I love Sandalwood and Caswell Massey is getting too expensive.  This smells so good and is nice to use, all natural and softens my skin.  Received three generous-sized bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a soap-like product with a mellow sandalwood aroma that&#x27;s not overwhelming.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and this is just about the only body wash I can tolerate.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m the only person in my house using it, and a bottle lasts about 40 days.  I&#x27;m discovering you can even dilute it a tad with some water to make it last a little longer.  Don&#x27;t let the word &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; confuse you.  It&#x27;s a body wash.  Highly recommend--Shikai, the company, has several different aromas, all of them mild, not perfume or cloying at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product but Amazon mailed the 3 bottles to me in  an open plastic bag and did not secure the tops. Needless to say everything in the box was covered in the shower gel- i ordered 5 other items.  A little more care in the packing would be appreciated. Too much trouble to mail back. I have ordered the same product from another website and have never had a problem. I will not reorder this from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Shikai Sandalwood Shower Gel is all they claim it to be. The fragrance is devine and it leaves the skin soft and smooth. Very nice. I like the 3 pack as well. Nice to get three at a time.</li>
            <li> It is still pretty good, unfortunately, the manufacturer has taken the low road here.  They silently changed the formula and omitted the real sandalwood oil that used to be in it.  Now it is just a perfume.  What does 3 drops of sandalwood oil cost?  Maybe 10 cents, but they decided it was too expensive for this OVERPRICED product.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints against this product. I bought a 3-pack and it was reasonably priced. It has a good scent that is subtle, yet clean. It foams like regular soap, but has no additional chemical feel. It rinses very clean and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this body wash very much, It isnt too strong and has a great sandalwood smell.  It pairs very nicely with my sandalwood shave soap, cologne, and lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great...less filling!</li>
            <li> Smells great, cleans well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unisex...I purchased based on reviews that repeatedly stated was a good unisex fragrance..not so much. Really more masculine</li>
            <li> ewww the smell is too strong! Don&#x27;t buy unless you like strong fragrances!</li>
            <li> Everytime I used it I love the light scent and the clean feel after showering.  Always run out of it easy....wished it comes in bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells stronger than I expected. Package came with one bottle already 1/3 empty, and shower gel all over the inside of the bag. Would be better if it had been packaged in a box or in such a way that the cap wouldn&#x27;t be bumped open.</li>
