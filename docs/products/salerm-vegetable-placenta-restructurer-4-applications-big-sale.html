    <ol>
            <li> I Purchase This Product For My Sister-In-Law. So Far So Good. You Start To See New Hair Growing After A Month. The Only Think That She Don&#x27;t Like Is That You Have To Apply The Treatment And Can&#x27;t Wash Your Hair For 2 Days. So Make Sure You Don&#x27;t Put Any Kind Of Hair Products As Hair Spray Etc. It Has Worked For Her And She Is Happy With The Results. Recommend It To Does People That Have Bold Spots.</li>
            <li> I have only used 1 vial, but already I can see less shedding and breakage. Product is was easy to use, didn&#x27;t really have a smell, and really seems to do what it promises. The seller Ienjoybeauty gave above and beyond great customer service after I contacted them about 1 of the vials being broken. They responded quickly to my email and resent a whole new order within 2 days at no additional charge!!!!!!!!!! I will definitely re order product and use this seller!</li>

            <li> I love this product and usually get a treatment at my salon weekly.  Im also excited that the price for four vials was extremely affordable.  The delivery was even faster than I expected.  I will definitely order from this site in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Use this as a key ingredient in my leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Just like they have at the beauty parlor. Nice price.</li>
            <li> Perfect product..i love it</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this really did what it advertised to do. I like salerm products but this one wasnt a win for me.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product, I never knew what a Restructurer was, why it&#x27;s important or what it does. My hair has grown longer and stronger in the year that I have been using this product. I take it to the salon to use once a month to use as a setting lotion and it has made all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has not been falling out as much. Could it be my imagination? This is the only new thing I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love it Love it. I a cant say it enough. After washing my hair I put in before I roller set mt hair. My hair is full of body afterwards.</li>
            <li> help out much will buy again thanks</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Fast delivery. I will definitely be ordering more products from this seller. Thanks! :)</li>
