    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very nice hair dryer!!</li>
            <li>Excellent hair dryer!</li>
            <li>They are the perfect pair to get silky, shiny hair.  </li>
            <li>the best it has ever been.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer!!!</li>
            <li>It is a great dryer</li>
            <li>and I am still happy with it.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is so great, it makes the need for my straightener optional.  </li>
            <li>But in either case I am happy with the results each and every time.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer got my attention in the store, so I went on line at Amazon, found good reviews and good price</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I had been working with an ancient blow dryer that didn&#x27;t have ceramic or tourmaline heating plates</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so good after using this dryer.</li>
            <li>and if you purchase the attachment it does a good job of straightening hair while drying it.</li>
            <li>I decided it was time to get a better dryer, and I am glad every day!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair drier</li>
            <li>and she was very happy to receive this as an early Christmas gift and business investment of course.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I use about 2 drops of 100% pure argan oil instead with great results.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer makes my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>This does an OK job.</li>
            <li>i love the oil.</li>
            <li>It is ok, I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>I have the Argan Heat straightener, and love it, too.  </li>
            <li>My hair withstood the humidity better than ever as well.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>it has made my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>Oh and tried the oil and its just as great as the dryer leaving my hair feeling soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>great blowdryer for the price, has three settings, is definitley an improvement over my old dryer.</li>
            <li>Looks lilke its well made and easy to hankle.  </li>
            <li>I bought this drier 2 1/2 years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this dryer as my last one was getting way too hot and frying my hair.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair dries quickly, feels silky and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>one  - air flow, heat, weight, noise level, how the attachments fit, etc.-  and hair dryers that have 5-star reviews still tend to have 1-star reviews as well.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I am not bothered by the weight, and the predominant sound the dryer makes is a pleasant, quiet \\&quot;whoosh\\&quot;, but there is also an underlying straining motor sound that has me concerned.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I think that is a gimick, but I do think that this is a good, basic hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I typically never write reviews, but felt compelled to after using this amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it to use on my poodle because she needs to be dryer quickly..</li>
            <li>plus though it does not get very hot thus limiting the damage you will do.</li>
            <li>is a powerful dryer.</li>
            <li>I also own a Remington dryer and they both work about the same but this argan heat one is way heavier.</li>
            <li>Can a blow dryer be too powerful?..</li>
            <li>Otherwise well worth the money.</li>
            <li>so of course this would work far better.</li>
            <li>I am using right now for 2 months</li>
            <li>I couldnâ€™t believe, when I got such a nice result after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The hot setting on the One</li>
            <li>I think the combination of lower heat and more power will translate into healthier hair overall.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I ever bought a hair dryer over $30.00.  </li>
            <li>but I can truly say its night and day from my Gold n Hot dryer of 7 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super powerful, and dries my hair quicker than my old hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>it is very well made but it is so powerful if drys my hair so fast</li>
            <li>Im not sure if this gets as hot as I would like, but for the price, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new dryer and this was the only one I could buy right away that a comb would fit.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put too much stock into the Argan infused thing.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this dryer is that it does not get as hot as my old dryer, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>I did not use the free bottle of Argan \\&quot;product\\&quot; that came with the dryer because I stay far, far, away from anything with ingredients like those listed on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It does the same as my old $20 ConAir hair dryer, except that it has more speed.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored (blonde to boot), damaged, wavy and frizzy and it honestly felt like a Pantene commercial after one use!</li>
            <li>My old blow dryer would get so hot</li>
            <li>Hair is silky and smooth when dry</li>
            <li>the high setting might as well be a jet engine. .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t style it with my round brush for a good blow out.. resulting in frizz that I have to correct with a flat iron..</li>
            <li>I decided to spend a little more and try this one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot enough that I can straighten my hair with a large paddle brush and without using my straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>Aside from being a bit heavy, I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>My other dryer was too hot on the hot settting and not hot enough on the warm setting.  </li>
            <li>and I would definitely buy another one when the one I have quits working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this hair dryer several days ago to replace my Remington model that had been sparking and making a popping sound.  </li>
            <li>Overall worth the money so far.</li>
            <li>I actually like this blow dryer very much.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I was sceptical that a hair dryer could/would be infused with argan oil, as the package claimed, but I could actually smell the oil the first time I used it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too hot and it has just enough power to straighten my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and I barely needed to flat iron my hair when finished.</li>
            <li>I like the dryer and feel that it is an improvement over my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by that.</li>
            <li>I also like that my hair feels soft with this.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely poker straight fine hair, though I do have a lot of hair, and it was dull, dry, and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>My complaints about this hair dryer are that the warm setting is barely luke warm,  the low-speed setting blows too hard, and the concentrator attachment is difficult to screw/push on (it does not \\&quot;slide\\&quot; on as the box says).  </li>
            <li>so i have high hopes since i spent over twice as much on this drier.</li>
            <li>Oh and the price as I usually wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on a dryer but its worth as of now.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair, but after i wash my hair and use this to dry it up it makes my hair soft and</li>
            <li>My hair is back to being bouncy, shiny, and so soft that my 3 year old grandson told me my hair was softer than his kitten.  </li>
            <li>For me this is amazing because it cut down on my usual 1.5 process of doing my hair.  </li>
            <li>one major</li>
            <li>I wish I had purchased it on Amazon because I now see that the price here is half of what I paid, but I needed it right</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>I like the argan oil when I want my hair to be extra soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and I still use this dryer pretty much everyday and it works as well as the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Relatively quiet, dries hair much faster than my previous dryer.</li>

            <li> Relatively quiet, dries hair much faster than my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> I never use the hot setting, I always dry my hair on the cool setting and finish with cold air.  </li>
            <li> It cuts my drying time in half, same watts as my old dryer but go figure.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for anyone who has dry or needs a little extra for style.</li>
            <li> It only took my about 10 minutes to completely dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Using the Argan Heat made me realize that the reason my hair was so dry, fragile and difficult to grow was because my cheap hair dryer was damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy nor too loud.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair without my hair feeling like dry.</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair faster!</li>
            <li> I was hoping a new dryer would mean faster drying time but that did not happen.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is of professional quality, but is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I am a lifer with this hair dryer and thinking of buying a few to have back ups.</li>
            <li> The only downside was it was a bit heavy nothing one couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> My hair type is naturally wavy, thick, and frizz-prone.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than I thought it would be, but I can certainly live with that since it cuts my hair drying time down to less than a fourth of the time it used to take and with very little heat.  </li>
            <li> Only knock is its a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> I had started using the Argan oil and cleansing conditioners and that helped some, but when I would blow dry my hair it still was dull, dry, and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> It seems to dry my hair in less time without excessive</li>
            <li> and my previous drier lasted over 6 years</li>
            <li> It has been a little over a year now</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and usually take at least 20 to 30 minutes with my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I have had some very big health problems and the medicines I must now take have been very hard on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair, and I burn through (literally) big box hair driers every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad we can&#x27;t try hair dryers out in the store before purchasing because there is so much to consider when buying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, hair is dry and not fizzy!!!!</li>
            <li> How confusing!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy and awkward to hold</li>
            <li> I still hate to blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I hated to use it, so</li>

            <li> Dryes hair superfast!</li>
            <li> Very nice hair dryer!! I have very thick hair, hair is dry and not fizzy!!!!</li>
            <li> *UPDATE 1 year later*. It has been a little over a year now and I still use this dryer pretty much everyday and it works as well as the day I bought it.  It is a great dryer and I would definitely buy another one when the one I have quits working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this hair dryer several days ago to replace my Remington model that had been sparking and making a popping sound.  I decided to spend a little more and try this one.  I wish I had purchased it on Amazon because I now see that the price here is half of what I paid, but I needed it right away.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this dryer is that it does not get as hot as my old dryer, which is a plus.  My other dryer was too hot on the hot settting and not hot enough on the warm setting.  The hot setting on the One and Only is just right.&lt;br /&gt;This is a powerful dryer. It seems to dry my hair in less time without excessive heat.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t put too much stock into the Argan infused thing.  I think that is a gimick, but I do think that this is a good, basic hair dryer.  I did not use the free bottle of Argan \\&quot;product\\&quot; that came with the dryer because I stay far, far, away from anything with ingredients like those listed on the bottle.  I use about 2 drops of 100% pure argan oil instead with great results.  This is the product that I would recommed instead.  [[ASIN:B005CU75T2 Argan Oil 2 fl oz (59 ml) Liquid]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.  I like the dryer and feel that it is an improvement over my old dryer.  I think the combination of lower heat and more power will translate into healthier hair overall.  I will update after I have been using it  a while longer.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer makes my hair nice and smooth. I always tried to avoid any hair dryer, because they all made my hair frizzier. This hair dryer got my attention in the store, so I went on line at Amazon, found good reviews and good price and I bought it. I couldnâ€™t believe, when I got such a nice result after the first time I used it. I am using right now for 2 months and I am still happy with it. No regrets.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this dryer as my last one was getting way too hot and frying my hair.  It&#x27;s not too heavy nor too loud.  All in all, I would recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m luvin this brand.  This is the second product I&#x27;ve bought from babyliss &amp; I have no complaints!!  Totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> This does an OK job. I still hate to blow dry my hair.  I was hoping a new dryer would mean faster drying time but that did not happen. I also own a Remington dryer and they both work about the same but this argan heat one is way heavier. I was surprised by that.</li>
            <li> I expected that i would get this and wish I hadn&#x27;t spent so much on a hair dryer. I was pleasantly surprised! i love the oil. I use it as a treatment and the dryer has some POWER! I recommend using it on low. It dries my hair without my hair feeling like dry. Overall worth the money so far. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so and my previous drier lasted over 6 years so i have high hopes since i spent over twice as much on this drier.</li>
            <li> Can a blow dryer be too powerful?.. the answer is yes.. it is very well made but it is so powerful if drys my hair so fast I can&#x27;t style it with my round brush for a good blow out.. resulting in frizz that I have to correct with a flat iron.. this was on low setting.. the high setting might as well be a jet engine. . I&#x27;m keeping it to use on my poodle because she needs to be dryer quickly.. one major plus though it does not get very hot thus limiting the damage you will do.</li>
            <li> I actually like this blow dryer very much. It makes my hair very smooth and silky. And I don&#x27;t have a problem with the settings or placement of the switches, as others have stated. I would recommend this blow dryer to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Looks lilke its well made and easy to hankle.  Only knock is its a little heavy.  Otherwise well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair faster! And I have had this for a couple months and can find nothing that I do not like about it!</li>
            <li> It does the same as my old $20 ConAir hair dryer, except that it has more speed. It is ok, I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> I like the argan oil when I want my hair to be extra soft and manageable. The hair dryer is of professional quality, but is a little heavy. I would highly recommend it for anyone who has dry or needs a little extra for style. Arrived on time as promised.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dryer! I was sceptical that a hair dryer could/would be infused with argan oil, as the package claimed, but I could actually smell the oil the first time I used it and my hair looks like I just left the salon. It&#x27;s a bit heavy and awkward to hold but it&#x27;s definitely worth it! I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> My hair type is naturally wavy, thick, and frizz-prone.  With this hairdryer, my hair is not frizzy!  YAY!  It&#x27;s super powerful, and dries my hair quicker than my old hairdryer.  This hairdryer is so great, it makes the need for my straightener optional.  I have the Argan Heat straightener, and love it, too.  They are the perfect pair to get silky, shiny hair.  I also like that my hair feels soft with this.</li>
            <li> Aside from being a bit heavy, I love this dryer. To be fair, I had been working with an ancient blow dryer that didn&#x27;t have ceramic or tourmaline heating plates so of course this would work far better. And I&#x27;ve been using the argon oil that came with it which is a dimethicone-based product... of course my hair would be silkier than when I use my homemade aloe &amp; grape seed oil concoction. So whether its the dryer, the products or the combination- I&#x27;m not sure. But in either case I am happy with the results each and every time. (I&#x27;ve used it 4 or 5 times by now.)</li>
            <li> I have had some very big health problems and the medicines I must now take have been very hard on my hair.  I have absolutely poker straight fine hair, though I do have a lot of hair, and it was dull, dry, and lifeless.  I had started using the Argan oil and cleansing conditioners and that helped some, but when I would blow dry my hair it still was dull, dry, and lifeless.  My old blow dryer would get so hot I hated to use it, so I was in Sally&#x27;s one day and saw this dryer.  I decided it was time to get a better dryer, and I am glad every day!  I never use the hot setting, I always dry my hair on the cool setting and finish with cold air.  My hair is back to being bouncy, shiny, and so soft that my 3 year old grandson told me my hair was softer than his kitten.  It is a little heavier than I thought it would be, but I can certainly live with that since it cuts my hair drying time down to less than a fourth of the time it used to take and with very little heat.  I would definitely recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I typically never write reviews, but felt compelled to after using this amazing product. My hair has never felt so good after using this dryer. It dries quickly and I barely needed to flat iron my hair when finished. My hair withstood the humidity better than ever as well. My hair is colored (blonde to boot), damaged, wavy and frizzy and it honestly felt like a Pantene commercial after one use! I am a lifer with this hair dryer and thinking of buying a few to have back ups. Thank you Babyliss for making my hair the best it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair, and I burn through (literally) big box hair driers every 6 months.  I bought this drier 2 1/2 years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I love it.  It&#x27;s hot enough that I can straighten my hair with a large paddle brush and without using my straightening iron.  This is by far the best hair drier I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer after reading reviews from Sallys Beauty Supply for a bigger price. My daughter in law was visiting and needed to use my dryer, she was taken back with it. It cuts my drying time in half, same watts as my old dryer but go figure.I have wavy coarse hair it has made my hair more manageable. I bought this dryer for my daughter in law for christmas. She loves it also.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!!!</li>
            <li> I have wanted this for Christmas two years in a row and finally someone in my family purchased it, NOW they want one!</li>
            <li> My daughter is a Cosmetologist and she was very happy to receive this as an early Christmas gift and business investment of course.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hot and it has just enough power to straighten my curly hair.  I don&#x27;t feel like it is going to burn my hair either.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair, but after i wash my hair and use this to dry it up it makes my hair soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this dryer to my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad we can&#x27;t try hair dryers out in the store before purchasing because there is so much to consider when buying one  - air flow, heat, weight, noise level, how the attachments fit, etc.-  and hair dryers that have 5-star reviews still tend to have 1-star reviews as well.  How confusing!  I finally decided upon the Argan Heat because no one on Amazon rated it below 3 stars.  This was the first time I ever bought a hair dryer over $30.00.  Using the Argan Heat made me realize that the reason my hair was so dry, fragile and difficult to grow was because my cheap hair dryer was damaging my hair. Now my hair dries quickly, feels silky and looks healthy.  My complaints about this hair dryer are that the warm setting is barely luke warm,  the low-speed setting blows too hard, and the concentrator attachment is difficult to screw/push on (it does not \\&quot;slide\\&quot; on as the box says).  I am not bothered by the weight, and the predominant sound the dryer makes is a pleasant, quiet \\&quot;whoosh\\&quot;, but there is also an underlying straining motor sound that has me concerned.  I may end up exchanging this hair dryer before the return date expires in case there&#x27;s a problem.</li>
            <li> This dryer is fantastic. Hair is silky and smooth when dry and if you purchase the attachment it does a good job of straightening hair while drying it. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new dryer and this was the only one I could buy right away that a comb would fit. I&#x27;ve only used it once but I can truly say its night and day from my Gold n Hot dryer of 7 years. My hair is thick and usually take at least 20 to 30 minutes with my old dryer. It only took my about 10 minutes to completely dry my hair. For me this is amazing because it cut down on my usual 1.5 process of doing my hair.  Oh and tried the oil and its just as great as the dryer leaving my hair feeling soft, shiny and healthy. The only downside was it was a bit heavy nothing one couldn&#x27;t handle. Oh and the price as I usually wouldn&#x27;t spend this much on a dryer but its worth as of now. I would recommend as at the moment. If anything changes I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet, dries hair much faster than my previous dryer.</li>
