            <li>Received damaged n looks cheap!</li>
            <li>but I think I might be needing more.</li>
            <li>but I have to tell you that if you have a lot of lipsticks then you have to buy more then one.</li>
            <li>I love it .....</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>all my lipsticks fit except for one that was a really bulky lipstick when i placed it in the front,so i just placed it in one of the top holders and it fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>it came in perfect condition, i just wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased about that.  </li>
            <li>I love it, but it had some chipped spots in it when I received it.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend, great product and price point!</li>
            <li>I love  my organizer.</li>
            <li>I love having them all organized and easy to find.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made from cheap plastic and not acrylics</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and hassle free.</li>
            <li>Cheap construction.</li>
            <li>I would give it a five stars because it is cheap, compact and does the job</li>
            <li>I just have to move them around to fit them all.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Firstly, this is not acrylic, this is a very cheap plastic, and the plastic is chipped on each corner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased overall with this product and love how it looks, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable and it holds up to 24 lipsticks! :)</li>
            <li>so I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Love how my cosmetics look very organized.</li>
            <li>but idc.. Definitely getting a couple more:)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>but overall its nice</li>
            <li>Totally worth the five stars</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for what I paid</li>
            <li>I bought this and it didn&#x27;t come broken or anything everything was perfect.</li>
            <li>I needed it right away for a project, so I didn&#x27;t have time to return.</li>
            <li>The right size for all my lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>I would most likely order more in the future.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my lipsticks.</li>
            <li>That means I can see all my pretty lippies at once</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting high quality acrylic, I would not recommend this, but if you&#x27;re just wanting a cheap lipstick organizer to clear up some drawer space, this will do the job.</li>
            <li>I really like this lipstick holder.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly fit all of my different brands of lipstick &amp; gloss</li>
            <li>The squares on the bottom row are not as big as all of the others but its a cheap piece of plastic from Hong kong</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.</li>
            <li>very organized</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable at no shipping cost.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really helped me organize my makeup.</li>
            <li>Although it broke in shipping, they were nice enough to replace without me sending it back.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately, the squares are not exactly the same dimension as some of my squared lippies fit perfectly</li>
            <li>I am finally feeling like I can find the right drive when I look for it.</li>
            <li>i really what my money back</li>
            <li>There was a small chip on the corner but it still works fine.</li>
            <li>I decided not to return it because of the long way it came from and for the price was not worth returning back since I would have paid more than what the product itself cost.</li>
            <li>very small and cheap looking .</li>
    </ol>

            <li> very small and cheap looking .</li>
            <li> Anyway, since the price is way below compared to those retail stores, I already braced myself for a cheaply made product; but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It seemed to take a long time to get here also.</li>
            <li> and I have ordered a 3rd one just the other day.</li>
            <li> why it arrived a little later but still earlier than the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> BUT I discovered that I have a lot of tiny make-up items to place in the slots like eyeliner and eyelash tubs, tweezers, bobby-pins, lip and eye brow pencils and tiny samples to name just a few things.</li>
            <li> When I got it their was a chip on the side but other than that</li>
            <li> it came in faster than i expected considering where&#x27;s it&#x27;s coming from!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It took over 3 weeks to arrive and then was cracked when it got here, nothing a little card stock and superglue couldn&#x27;t fix but don&#x27;t waste your money - also the holder sections are a bit smaller than described</li>
            <li> not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> i dont need anything broken and why you guys charge one dolar extra in my credit car?</li>
            <li> just a little slow on shipping</li>
            <li> It was just a small piece that broke off during shipping, not too noticeable.</li>
            <li> There was a small crack in it though</li>
            <li> One little corner did came broken</li>
            <li> It came at least 2 weeks before the estimate date said it would.</li>
            <li> It came a little dirty but no scratches and flaws.  </li>
            <li> Im was waiting for this for put my lips but mokingtop is broken some part..</li>
            <li> it was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> This coming broken</li>
            <li> Bought two, one arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering it because of the prolonged shipment date, but it ended up arriving in approximately seven days.</li>
            <li> I’ve been wanting to get a cosmetic organizer for my lip products but store brands are just so expensive for me.</li>
            <li> i order it, really disappointing.</li>

            <li> it din&#x27;t arrive in good condition&#x27;s both times i order it, really disappointing.</li>
            <li> very small and cheap looking . not worth the price at all. it&#x27;s made from cheap plastic and not acrylics</li>
            <li> I really like this lipstick holder. It is good plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 and I have ordered a 3rd one just the other day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly fit all of my different brands of lipstick &amp; gloss but it fits some &amp; helps de-clutter them. The squares on the bottom row are not as big as all of the others but its a cheap piece of plastic from Hong kong so I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much.</li>
            <li> Good product, shipping just takes forever</li>
            <li> Came earlier than promised.  I actually bought this rack to house various sizes of usb drives.  It is perfect!  I am finally feeling like I can find the right drive when I look for it.</li>
            <li> This is a lipstick organizer. I bought two for all my lipsticks and discovered that it only fits the standard size lipsticks - BUT I discovered that I have a lot of tiny make-up items to place in the slots like eyeliner and eyelash tubs, tweezers, bobby-pins, lip and eye brow pencils and tiny samples to name just a few things. All organized in a nice place. (:</li>
            <li> If you want to neatly showoff your lippies this is a good case to hold them in. I would most likely order more in the future. When you can see your lipsticks you will tend to use them more often. :)</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than quoted. Good plastic strength and design. Will be ordering another soon. My lipstick collection is growing.</li>
            <li> Im was waiting for this for put my lips but mokingtop is broken some part.. I don&#x27;t like it.. I like everything OK...</li>
            <li> I love the way it organizes all of my lipsticks and lip glosses. It is sturdy and hassle free. No assembly was required. It is an amazing buy for the price. I was skeptical about ordering it because of the prolonged shipment date, but it ended up arriving in approximately seven days. Love it!</li>
            <li> it was broken when it arrived. but i didnt do a biggie of it since its still functional. it does what it needs to do. hold my makeup</li>
            <li> Works great I have all my lipsticks very organized it&#x27;s worth every penny it all so works for mi lip liners</li>
            <li> Firstly, this is not acrylic, this is a very cheap plastic, and the plastic is chipped on each corner. But; it does the job. If you&#x27;re expecting high quality acrylic, I would not recommend this, but if you&#x27;re just wanting a cheap lipstick organizer to clear up some drawer space, this will do the job.</li>
            <li> When I got it their was a chip on the side but other than that no complaints in use them for my brushes and lipsticks helps me organize everything and speeds if the process when I&#x27;m doing my makeup</li>
            <li> Received damaged n looks cheap! Not happy at all</li>
            <li> I’ve been wanting to get a cosmetic organizer for my lip products but store brands are just so expensive for me. That is why I am very happy that I came across this. The price is very affordable at no shipping cost. It is not eligible for Prime that’s why it arrived a little later but still earlier than the estimated delivery date. Anyway, since the price is way below compared to those retail stores, I already braced myself for a cheaply made product; but I was wrong. The holes are just the perfect size for my lipsticks and lipgloss, and the product is very stable. I already purchased two but I think I might be needing more. My cosmetics are now well-organized without paying arm and leg so thank you seller for this awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product based on my experience. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> This container is great to put your lipsticks but I have to tell you that if you have a lot of lipsticks then you have to buy more then one.</li>
            <li> This coming broken i really what my money back i dont need anything broken and why you guys charge one dolar extra in my credit car? I wanna my money back</li>
            <li> Came quicker than estimated arrival.  It came a little dirty but no scratches and flaws.  i love this and defenity worth the price!!!</li>

            <li> Exactly what I needed for my lipsticks. I love having them all organized and easy to find.</li>
            <li> Although it broke in shipping, they were nice enough to replace without me sending it back. The organizer has made my vanity look like a dream!</li>
            <li> Came damaged. Cheap construction.</li>
            <li> Love this. Great way to organize your lipstick.</li>
            <li> it came in faster than i expected considering where&#x27;s it&#x27;s coming from! all my lipsticks fit except for one that was a really bulky lipstick when i placed it in the front,so i just placed it in one of the top holders and it fit perfectly! so recommend buying it. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> These arrived intact and I LOVE them!  $5 for two!?  Can&#x27;t beat it!  Each holds 25 lipsticks and the plastic is designed so they are on &amp;#34;risers&amp;#34; and not all one level.  That means I can see all my pretty lippies at once - I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> i love this! it came in perfect condition, i just wish it was bigger. but overall its nice</li>
            <li> This thing fits a lot of different lipstick sizes! I highly recommend! 😊</li>
            <li> Love how my cosmetics look very organized. One little corner did came broken but it was no big deal for me, I managed to glue it back and is not that noticeable plus it gets covered with my cosmetics. I decided not to return it because of the long way it came from and for the price was not worth returning back since I would have paid more than what the product itself cost. But I give it 5 stars because I am rating the product itself, not the seller or packaging which all have their own feedback sections. I&#x27;m very pleased overall with this product and love how it looks, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> There was a chip in the acrylic. I needed it right away for a project, so I didn&#x27;t have time to return. It was just a small piece that broke off during shipping, not too noticeable. It seemed to take a long time to get here also.</li>
            <li> It was great for holding all of my lipsticks and lip gloss!! The price is very affordable and it holds up to 24 lipsticks! :)</li>
            <li> Holds my lipsticks perfectly in place and looks so chic on my vanity!</li>
            <li> Awesome item! I loved the price, but wasn&#x27;t sure about the shipping date. When i received it i was in awe! It came at least 2 weeks before the estimate date said it would. It also was packaged nicely and was the perfect size for me!</li>
            <li> I would give it a five stars because it is cheap, compact and does the job but unfortunately, the squares are not exactly the same dimension as some of my squared lippies fit perfectly but others wouldn&#x27;t and all the lipsticks are the same dimension.  I just have to move them around to fit them all.  Other than that, I&#x27;m loving mine.  It looks nice, it&#x27;s cheap and I actually got it before the order confirmation said I would so I was pleased about that.  I&#x27;m ordering another one for my sister too!</li>
            <li> Bought two, one arrived broken.  They were shipped in the thinnest box possible in a plastic bag from China. NO padding or protection at all. Shipping took FOREVER.  This is very cheaply made. Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space but keeps you lip sticks/glosses on display. It really helped me organize my makeup.</li>
            <li> All my lipsticks fit perfectly! It arrived sooner than estimated date and in perfect condition. It&#x27;s the perfect way to organize and display lipsticks without spending a ton of money. Totally worth the five stars so I&#x27;m buying my second!</li>
            <li> I love it, but it had some chipped spots in it when I received it. I guess u get what u pay for.</li>
            <li> There was a small chip on the corner but it still works fine. It&#x27;s worth it for what I paid so I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it didn&#x27;t come broken or anything everything was perfect. Love it!</li>
            <li> came in the mail today love it !</li>
            <li> Super sturdy and perfect for organizing my lipsticks! Definitely recommend, great product and price point!</li>
            <li> very good for lipsticks, makeup brushes and eye pencils.</li>
            <li> The right size for all my lipsticks.  A good organizer.</li>
            <li> It took over 3 weeks to arrive and then was cracked when it got here, nothing a little card stock and superglue couldn&#x27;t fix but don&#x27;t waste your money - also the holder sections are a bit smaller than described</li>
            <li> I love  my organizer. It looks great on the vanity and holds many items well. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone needs acrylic storage for cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Love it! There was a small crack in it though but idc.. Definitely getting a couple more:)</li>
