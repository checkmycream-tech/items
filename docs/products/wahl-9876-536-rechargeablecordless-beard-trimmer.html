            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I purchase this model trimmer 4 -5 years ago and it was eay to use and dig a great job of trimming and shaping my beard.  </li>
            <li>I had a Remington before this one but wasn&#x27;t really happy with it.</li>
            <li>but if you want a precision trimmer, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is great</li>
            <li>The great thing&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a very nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>Being able to swivel the blade is awesome.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as good as the Wahl</li>
            <li>I recharged the battery on the original and it still works perfectly but the newer&lt;br /&gt;trimmer</li>
            <li>I am a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li>I love them both!</li>
            <li>Trimmer was a good price, arrived quickly, and performs a great job.  </li>
            <li>Try to find another beard trimmer with that kind of warranty.</li>
            <li>not as great as the original</li>
            <li>I went on line to see if I could fine this model of trimmer and now that I have it I am getting good trims again.</li>
            <li>Very smooth running and</li>
            <li>I think you would have to use a beard trimmer a LOT to need more battery.  </li>
            <li>I have Wahl hair clippers that do a much better job, just one pass with an attachment.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl trimmer is just ok.</li>
            <li>It trims well and efficiently with the many included combs.</li>
            <li>(2015 Update:)</li>
            <li>plugged in all the time to be able to use it at all.</li>
            <li>Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li>Most were batteries that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore</li>
            <li>It does come with a pretty good selection of adjustable heads though.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get a full size trimmer if you want to trim the hair on your head though!  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works as advertised, is easy to handle, and trims close.  </li>
            <li>the 180 degree head makes it easy to get the neck.</li>
            <li>This machine is perfect for accurate, precise trimming and grooming beards and mustaches, and it does so extremely well.  </li>
            <li>for  a touch-up it works fine.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if I might find them more useful if used with a comb without the adjustable attachment.  </li>
            <li>The cheap, plastic guide does not stay attached to the trimmer and falls off while trimming.  </li>
            <li>It lets me hold the trimmer in a comfortable position</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy pain, keep shopping.</li>
            <li>I loved the old one, but my wife managed to break the revolving head.  </li>
            <li>The original battery would not carry the shaver after seven months.</li>
            <li>and it still has the original battery charge.</li>
            <li>replaced the original with another \\&quot;name\\&quot; brand trimmer</li>
            <li>So if u like a clean cut hair do.</li>
            <li>the shaver did not cut cleanly while using the combs,   4.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but it serves his needs.</li>
            <li>The shaver is not bad, but the battery issue would prevent me from buyer another Wahl product.</li>
            <li>Nice even cut, nearly foolproof uniform length results quickly.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for my mustache and other areas.  </li>
            <li>I have been through many trimmers from many different brands.</li>
            <li>There is a trimmer that has a new style battery for 10 bucks more.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable trimmer guard works great and is sturdier than the one on my previous trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It was the right choice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cordless, works well, the price is right.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s probably right.  </li>
            <li>it worked perfectly right up until I broke the cord on the charger about 3 years ago.</li>
            <li>The product that I ordered came in a timely manner and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>There is no recharging light on the shaver,so there&#x27;s no way to know when/if you have a full charge or not and finally   5.</li>
            <li>It cuts as well now as it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>About 15 to 20 years ago I purchased my first Wahl Rotating Head beard trimmer</li>
            <li>Recommended if you want to trim your own beard and stop letting other people do it for you.</li>
            <li>If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li>4 different sizes are good, although I only use one and two since I can&#x27;t grow it any longer than that.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the solid, heavy almost professional feel as well.</li>
            <li>If you are expecting a large area trimmer, look elsewhere</li>
            <li>So much for progress.  </li>
            <li>I used to enjoy Norelco trimmers but since they moved production to China their entire product line has been going downhill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that Wahl took a trimmer that seems to be solid and well made and bundled it with cheap plastic beard guides.  </li>
            <li>However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own.</li>
            <li>Besides longevity and superior charge holding the older model cut better, started quicker, did not have the cutting head pop</li>
            <li>Was a replacement of an older version for my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Over all this trimmer is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Wow, this trimmer really worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>Only Wahl trimmers have the powerful motors that don&#x27;t quit or pull your hair.  </li>
            <li>I use the hair clippers for most of my beard now and just use this trimmer to clean up the edges and a few hard to reach spots (like right under my nose)  </li>
            <li>Being 10 years old, mine does not have the rotating head and some other fancy features, but it trims my beard just fine.</li>
            <li>Also they are very loud.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll just reiterate that the trimmer performs very well, is well priced, and the battery issue (dies after about a year) is barely a problem given how well their warranty works.</li>
            <li>My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li>I love the long battery life, it&#x27;s easy to use, my only problem is the head replacement is a bit to hard</li>
            <li>Its flimsy and cheap as hell, made in china for probably less than $3 or $4.</li>
            <li>Have to use my old Wahl to trim my moustache.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS TRIMMER</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money on this shaver.</li>
            <li>Without the attachment it&#x27;ll shave off hair any where, but with the adjustable attachment I find I have to go over and over the same spot many times for it to cut all the whiskers to an even level, and even then it&#x27;s still uneven.  </li>
            <li>I did notice how much sharper the new cutters were with the new trimmer, so I was probably due for a new one, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an older model that still works but is now  used for moderate trimming on our yorky.  </li>
            <li>I was very suprised that it lasted a long time between charges.  </li>
            <li>but this one lasts as long as all of them and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco from Austria had this feature but their new products are single voltage too.</li>
            <li>This trimmer replaces a near identical one I had for ten years.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I bought a new trimmer was the battery was starting to fade on the conair.</li>
            <li>The trimmer isn&#x27;t as wide as thought it would be, I still use my older one from the barber shop.</li>
            <li>If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of leaving the comb attached to the trimmer when I went on vaction early this year and when I unpacked the comb was loose from the trimmer</li>

            <li> I made the mistake of leaving the comb attached to the trimmer when I went on vaction early this year and when I unpacked the comb was loose from the trimmer</li>
            <li> With proper care it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> , my only complaint is the casing is a little cheap but</li>
            <li> I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    </li>
            <li> It was most disappointing since the</li>
            <li> , after a while it does not hold the charge for long so you have to use the cord to use it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how she did it, but I stopped asking those questions long ago.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several different \\&quot;name\\&quot; brand beard trimmers over the years that would last for a few years&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money and get yourself something nice and pass on this dollar store level crap.</li>
            <li> One big downside is that I have gotten the blade wet a few times and it is now starting to rust.</li>
            <li> So be careful not to get it too wet and only wet the blade tips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth noting that my beard grows very thick and dense from my cheeks all the way down my neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen several reviews where people have junked this trimmer after it quit taking a charge less than a year to a year-and-a-half after purchasing it, but unless the design has changed since 2003, the battery is replaceable.</li>

            <li> I put one of the \\&quot;screens\\&quot; on to shave my beard to its desired length, but now it won&#x27;t come off.   Have to use my old Wahl to trim my moustache.  If anyone from Wahl reads this, perhaps you can give me a hint.  Otherwise, I&#x27;ll see if my wife can get it off.</li>
            <li> It worked once or twice and does not work any longer. does not charge    I would like a refund</li>
            <li> The product that I ordered came in a timely manner and was exactly what I was looking for.  I am a very pleased customer.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap lightweight plastic piece of crap. It takes forever to trim my goatee and hundreds of passes.  Forget it for body hair as you&#x27;ll be bleeding from all the passes you have to make.  It does come with a pretty good selection of adjustable heads though.  Spend the extra money and get yourself something nice and pass on this dollar store level crap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t shave for five weeks and desperately needed to trim my beard. After using this trimmer it took 10 years off of my appearance!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great!  If you want a hair/beard trimmer that will last, you have to buy Wahl.  Only Wahl trimmers have the powerful motors that don&#x27;t quit or pull your hair.  I dropped my old Wahl on hard tile and broke it so I had to find a replacement.  This trimmer works great, my only complaint is the casing is a little cheap but all plastic seems to be getting this way.  The adjustable trimmer guard works great and is sturdier than the one on my previous trimmer.  There is a trimmer that has a new style battery for 10 bucks more.  I think you would have to use a beard trimmer a LOT to need more battery.  Make sure you get a full size trimmer if you want to trim the hair on your head though!  This trimmer is really only for beards or a little trimming up around the ears or neck.</li>
            <li> It works just like it says and like you would expect it to. I can&#x27;t ask anymore of a product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a trimmer that covers a lot of space, you are looking in the wrong place.  This machine is perfect for accurate, precise trimming and grooming beards and mustaches, and it does so extremely well.  Recommended if you want to trim your own beard and stop letting other people do it for you.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I don&#x27;t get very good trimming with this.  Without the attachment it&#x27;ll shave off hair any where, but with the adjustable attachment I find I have to go over and over the same spot many times for it to cut all the whiskers to an even level, and even then it&#x27;s still uneven.  I have Wahl hair clippers that do a much better job, just one pass with an attachment.  I use the hair clippers for most of my beard now and just use this trimmer to clean up the edges and a few hard to reach spots (like right under my nose)  Also they are very loud.  I&#x27;m wondering if I might find them more useful if used with a comb without the adjustable attachment.  It&#x27;s also worth noting that my beard grows very thick and dense from my cheeks all the way down my neck so I&#x27;m probably an extreme case.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, but I tried it a couple of times and now I need to get myself one.  It works great.</li>
            <li> Previous groomer played out. Great price. Works perfectly. Just what the guy with a beard to trim needs.</li>
            <li> Past reviews have already covered everything. So, I&#x27;ll just reiterate that the trimmer performs very well, is well priced, and the battery issue (dies after about a year) is barely a problem given how well their warranty works. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Wow, this trimmer really worked well for me.  Nice even cut, nearly foolproof uniform length results quickly.  Very happy with the solid, heavy almost professional feel as well. Wish I would have bought this months ago.</li>
            <li> was told this was a mustache and beard trimmer it is not as advertised,but usable  will not buy a Wahl trimmer again .</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. It yanks you hair out rather than cut them. Its flimsy and cheap as hell, made in china for probably less than $3 or $4. It also stopped working for no reason whatsoever after about 10 days without ever being dropped or anything.    DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> I purchase this model trimmer 4 -5 years ago and it was eay to use and dig a great job of trimming and shaping my beard.  I was very suprised that it lasted a long time between charges.  I made the mistake of leaving the comb attached to the trimmer when I went on vaction early this year and when I unpacked the comb was loose from the trimmer and I found that the tab that holds the comb to the trimmer had snapped off and made it very difficult to use.  I ended up purchasing another brand trimmer and after messing around with it for a couple of months I was still not happy with the results.  I went on line to see if I could fine this model of trimmer and now that I have it I am getting good trims again.</li>
            <li> Just got done using this piece of junk trimmer the trimmer actually felt like it was ripping out my whiskers instead of trimming them it was so painful I had to dust of my 7 year old conair trimmer and finish the job. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS TRIMMER YOU WILL REGRET IT. The only reason I bought a new trimmer was the battery was starting to fade on the conair.My face hurts I have to go shop for a replacement battery.</li>
            <li> I have had either a beard or goatee for the last 28 years, and for most of this time I owned a Wahl trimmer. My first Wahl lasted 10 years, my second Wahl lasted for 8 years. I took a 3 year break using a Norelco (which was a Christmas gift), however, I was never satisfied with the cut at longer settings. I ultimately went back to various Wahl trimmers, yet they all gave out (battery, motor, etc) in less than 2 years.    Deciding to give Wahl one last chance. I purchased the \\&quot;All-in-One Trimmer Kit,\\&quot; given that it had a 5-year warranty. The battery quit recharging after the 3rd month, and Wahl&#x27;s position was since I failed to keep my receipt, there was no warranty coverage. Please note that my failure to keep the receipt was definitely my fault. However, I can say, through personal experience, that Wahl&#x27;s quality and performance has SIGNIFICANTLY declined over the years (based on my last four purchases), and this was the last Wahl trimmer that I will ever own. If you cannot purchase any other trimmer but a Wahl, my advice is that you hold fast to your receipt...because I fear you will need it sooner rather than later. If any other option is available to you, I would strongly urge you to consider it, rather than purchasing a Wahl.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer awhile back.  I absolutely loved it.  It worked great for my mustache and other areas.  Unfortunately, when I tried to start it up a couple of days ago it was dead.  I charged it overnight, but still nothing.  Even though I&#x27;m very disappointed in the short life of this unit (less than a year), I am purchasing another Wahl (9953) to replace it!</li>
            <li> I just tossed my Wahl 9876-536 rechargable/cordless beard trimmer in the trash.  It just stopped working and would not charge after less than 18 months of use.  It was most disappointing since the I have an older model that still works but is now  used for moderate trimming on our yorky.  Besides longevity and superior charge holding the older model cut better, started quicker, did not have the cutting head pop out(a pain to pop back in).  So much for progress.  Both models lacked a setting between no attachment and the shortest one.    Wahl is on my &amp;%!$#$ list even though they came out with a lithium ion charged model.  I will try a Panasonic next.</li>
            <li> I only used this product twice. Both times it worked flawlessly. I had a Remington before this one but wasn&#x27;t really happy with it. Hardly used it at all and had it for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> The cheap, plastic guide does not stay attached to the trimmer and falls off while trimming.  I&#x27;m buying a different brand.</li>
            <li> blades wear out just like all of them. but this one lasts as long as all of them and is much cheaper. so...super!</li>
            <li> It seems Wahl uses this product to sell outrageously overpriced batteries. The battery in my trimmer requires being constantly plugged in to maintain enough of a charge to operate. The original battery would not carry the shaver after seven months. Replacement batteries with shipping are almost as expensive as the shaver and have no substitutes that I was able to find online. The shaver is not bad, but the battery issue would prevent me from buyer another Wahl product.</li>
            <li> The Wahl trimmer is just ok. The trimmer isn&#x27;t as wide as thought it would be, I still use my older one from the barber shop. for  a touch-up it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have been through many trimmers from many different brands. I used to enjoy Norelco trimmers but since they moved production to China their entire product line has been going downhill. After a few bad decisions I finally came to this Wahl. It was the right choice. It trims well and efficiently with the many included combs. The build quality is very solid. It is also one of the last Wahl products made in the USA. The only qualm I have is that it is not able to accept worldwide voltage. My old Norelco from Austria had this feature but their new products are single voltage too. Oh well. Over all this trimmer is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> not as great as the original, after a while it does not hold the charge for long so you have to use the cord to use it</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets the job done. I fully charged it upon receiving it and the battery has lasted me weeks. 4 different sizes are good, although I only use one and two since I can&#x27;t grow it any longer than that. Being able to swivel the blade is awesome. It lets me hold the trimmer in a comfortable position no matter which way I need it to face. One big downside is that I have gotten the blade wet a few times and it is now starting to rust. So be careful not to get it too wet and only wet the blade tips.  (2015 Update:) Still have this machine after 4 years. Battery still holds charge and blades are still sharp. With proper care it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the long battery life, it&#x27;s easy to use, my only problem is the head replacement is a bit to hard</li>
            <li> Was a replacement of an older version for my boyfriend.  Nothing special, but it serves his needs.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works fine. The rechargeable battery lost it&#x27;s ability to hold any charge at all after a couple of months. Now I have to leave it plugged in all the time to be able to use it at all. It&#x27;s definitely not a standard battery, and the only place you can get a replacement is from Wahl or one of their online resellers. Considering that, I&#x27;d recommend getting the non-cordless model  [[ASIN:B000J4I5KE Wahl Revolution Beard Trimmer]]. Might as well since you might have to keep it plugged in anyway.</li>
            <li> Thid beard trimmer trims it all! I use it to cut my hair and fade it like no barber could ever do. I have 3! Saves me hundreds of bucks!!! So if u like a clean cut hair do. Buy this and cut your hair YOURSELF!!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works as advertised, is easy to handle, and trims close.  I&#x27;ve had it about a month, use it about 3 times a week and it still has the original battery charge.If you are expecting a large area trimmer, look elsewhere but if you want a precision trimmer, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Trimmer was a good price, arrived quickly, and performs a great job.  Could not ask for more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated this shaver. Contrary to the propoganda, it did not trim well at all and after being pinched multiple times, I returned it the next day. Specifically:     1. I could not get it to trim the small hairs around the outside ... poor outlining,   2. The combs are hard to attach and detach,   3. the shaver did not cut cleanly while using the combs,   4. There is no recharging light on the shaver,so there&#x27;s no way to know when/if you have a full charge or not and finally   5. The packaging was a nightmare to get through. You&#x27;ll need a sharp knife (careful) or some kitchen shears to get the shaver out.     I returned this shaver the next day. Do not waste your time or money on this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Wahl rechargeable beard trimmer since 2003, and it has worked wonderfully. It cuts as well now as it did when I first bought it. Over the past year the battery has been getting weaker and rescently has died all together. I&#x27;ve seen several reviews where people have junked this trimmer after it quit taking a charge less than a year to a year-and-a-half after purchasing it, but unless the design has changed since 2003, the battery is replaceable. Also, this trimmer comes with a 5 year warranty. Try to find another beard trimmer with that kind of warranty. I plan on buying a replacement battery, and I&#x27;ll try to get another 8 years out of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that Wahl took a trimmer that seems to be solid and well made and bundled it with cheap plastic beard guides.  They snag so badly they actually pull hair out.  Unless you enjoy pain, keep shopping.</li>
            <li> This product works great. Very smooth running and the 180 degree head makes it easy to get the neck. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a very nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer replaces a near identical one I had for ten years.  I loved the old one, but my wife managed to break the revolving head.  I don&#x27;t know how she did it, but I stopped asking those questions long ago.  The trimmer is great and I&#x27;ve used it on my beard and head. I did notice how much sharper the new cutters were with the new trimmer, so I was probably due for a new one, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cordless, works well, the price is right.  What else can I say about it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my 9876 for 10 years and the batter finally died.  BUT, Wahl has replacement Ni-cad batteries for under $4 including shipping.  Being 10 years old, mine does not have the rotating head and some other fancy features, but it trims my beard just fine.</li>
            <li> The product performs quite well.  However, it sounds, I&#x27;m not kidding, like a model airplane gasoline engine.  The guy who cuts my hair says it&#x27;s defective.  He&#x27;s probably right.  If it were purchased from a brick and mortar store, I would have returned it for another already.</li>
            <li> I have owned several different \\&quot;name\\&quot; brand beard trimmers over the years that would last for a few years&lt;br /&gt;and then would die. Most were batteries that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore but some would have switches&lt;br /&gt;that would stop working. About 15 to 20 years ago I purchased my first Wahl Rotating Head beard trimmer&lt;br /&gt;and it worked perfectly right up until I broke the cord on the charger about 3 years ago. The great thing&lt;br /&gt;about it was the 6 position guide. I could trim my hair, eyebrows and beard using the guide and they always&lt;br /&gt;looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the original with another \\&quot;name\\&quot; brand trimmer but it wasn&#x27;t as good as the Wahl so when I saw&lt;br /&gt;this one I purchased it. I recharged the battery on the original and it still works perfectly but the newer&lt;br /&gt;trimmer is a bit quieter, however they both work great! I love them both!</li>
