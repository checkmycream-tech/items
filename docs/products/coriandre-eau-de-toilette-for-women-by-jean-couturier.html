            <li>My wife is very satisfied with her gift.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a bit stronger but still my favorite, from 25* yrs ago!</li>
            <li>I got a good deal and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>I was totally pleased with the</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for the most of my life.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>I wore this perfume &#x27;many&#x27; years ago</li>
            <li>and I got so many compliments.</li>
            <li>In fact, I purposely picked up the 33ml frosted cylindrical bottle based reports that it was close to the original rose chypre formulation.</li>
            <li>it was still available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about the rose in Coriandre, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about in the formulation that I&#x27;m testing.</li>
            <li>The original Coriandre had a brighter fragrance.</li>
            <li>I miss the original aroma.......</li>
            <li>my favorite perfume--glad it is still available--a classic!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice perfume smell, as it&#x27;s the old perfume before in my memories, I like it</li>
            <li>great fragrance for the winter... is a vintage fragrance from the 70&#x27;s possibly older but is very nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Despite some of the reviews I read, the scent was pretty close to the original.</li>
            <li>She was so surprised I was able to find it</li>
            <li>i love this perfume and usually pay so much more .great</li>
            <li>its exactly what</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly how I feel when I wear it.</li>
            <li>The opening is crisp, clean &amp; clear.</li>
            <li>What slight changes I sensed were fruity and lovely.</li>
            <li>that is as season-less &amp; classic as a lightweight gabardine suit.</li>
            <li>Coriandre might be a good choice if you&#x27;re tired of big floral scents and overtly sweet ones.</li>
            <li>This has a strong sour smell with a hint of cat urine in it.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Overall, Coriandre is an easy-to-wear chypre (really?)</li>
            <li>As it goes into the heart, I am picking up a bit a soapiness &amp; barely-there soft florals.</li>
            <li>I have had Coriandre in the past (not recently) and I received many compliments.  </li>
            <li>but my aunt used to love this back in the late 80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s until it was discontinued</li>
            <li>Missing all the key notes of the original.  </li>

            <li> Spicy, soft, sharp, and sophisticated--that&#x27;s how it feels</li>
            <li> The fragrance was spicy and stayed with you for a long time.</li>
            <li> i m uesd to buying and sometimes have a hard time buying it where i live in canada</li>

            <li> I personally have NEVER liked the smell but my aunt used to love this back in the late 80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s until it was discontinued so I decided to buy this for her when I found out it was still available on Amazon. She was so surprised I was able to find it and she loved it.</li>
            <li> This is the fastest that I have ever received a package. I was totally pleased with the how soon it came-they had estimated a week, but it arrived the next day. Was really happy!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  I have had Coriandre in the past (not recently) and I received many compliments.  When I got this recent shipment,I felt like it had been watered down.  I could not tell that I had it on.  I will not order anymore.</li>
            <li> BAD imitation of the original Fragrance.  Missing all the key notes of the original.  They sent me a stale scent .&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:  Amazon wont even allow a return due to &amp;#34;hazardous and flammable&amp;#34;  they suggest I DISCARD according to landfill regulations.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000CNO4F2 Coriandre By Jean Couturier For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Oz.]]I can not say anything about the product as it was never delivered, when I contacted the company they literally said that I had no options. That they had sent, they believed it was delivered, and if you did not get it then too bad! Go Figure, what manner of company is this that Amazon has doing business on its&#x27; website. I will never order from this Company, and am having second thoughts about Amazon as well. Do yourself a favor if Tuccini is the company listed do not order from them as they will not honor your business. Be advised-and be warned!</li>
            <li> Oldie but reliable great scent</li>
            <li> Good buy, great price.</li>
            <li> The original Coriandre had a brighter fragrance. This has a strong sour smell with a hint of cat urine in it. Why did they change the formula?</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I got a good deal and quick delivery.  Such a pretty fragrance.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume and usually pay so much more .great deal  its exactly what i m uesd to buying and sometimes have a hard time buying it where i live in canada this time i was in the usa and had it  promtly deliverd was soo happy thank you</li>
            <li> Spicy, soft, sharp, and sophisticated--that&#x27;s how it feels and that&#x27;s exactly how I feel when I wear it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I rediscover its beauty every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> Overall, Coriandre is an easy-to-wear chypre (really?) that is as season-less &amp; classic as a lightweight gabardine suit. The opening is crisp, clean &amp; clear. The coriander note is subtle to me, not spicy, and I have no problems with wear. As it goes into the heart, I am picking up a bit a soapiness &amp; barely-there soft florals. Dries down to a dry moss &amp; vetiver scent, yet it&#x27;s quite feminine to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coriandre is a soapy woody on me that&#x27;s not very long-lasting. I&#x27;ve heard so much about the rose in Coriandre, but it&#x27;s nothing to write home about in the formulation that I&#x27;m testing. In fact, I purposely picked up the 33ml frosted cylindrical bottle based reports that it was close to the original rose chypre formulation. Sadly, it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Coriandre might be a good choice if you&#x27;re tired of big floral scents and overtly sweet ones. However, I wasn&#x27;t looking for a soapy woody floral, and there are no redeeming qualities in this fragrance that would encourage me to give it shelf space.</li>
            <li> It has been my favorite for the most of my life. I really love it.</li>
            <li> great fragrance for the winter... is a vintage fragrance from the 70&#x27;s possibly older but is very nice and last a long time. Has a woodsy touch and reminds me of the fall season.</li>
            <li> My wife is very satisfied with her gift. If she is happy I am happy! I would use this merchant again.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume--glad it is still available--a classic!</li>
            <li> I wore this perfume &#x27;many&#x27; years ago and I got so many compliments. This one is a weaker perfume. Even my daughter was disappointed. She was going to order it but now she is not. The fragrance was spicy and stayed with you for a long time. Now when I put it on &amp;#34;  I  &amp;#34; don&#x27;t even smell it. Even when I put it on my cloths. I miss the original aroma.......</li>
            <li> Despite some of the reviews I read, the scent was pretty close to the original. What slight changes I sensed were fruity and lovely. Perhaps a bit stronger but still my favorite, from 25* yrs ago!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice perfume smell, as it&#x27;s the old perfume before in my memories, I like it and that is what I expect</li>
