            <li>Pretty colors, yet cheap quality.</li>
            <li>may chip easier than some polishes but the colors are VERY pretty</li>

            <li>colors are cool, polish only lasted one day, polish doesnt like water.</li>
            <li>I found several shades here that work beautifully for every day, and I have not experienced any problems with chipping.  </li>
            <li>Especially the mocha, even though its not really a mocha its more of a dark flesh pink, which its really pretty on my fingers with a top coat.</li>
            <li>went on nice and thick, dried quickly.</li>
            <li>While I love a real red or deep pink for a special event, I have always worn a shade as close to my skin tone as possible for everyday, because it makes fingers look long and slim and is very Lady like.  </li>
            <li>However, after years of manicures, I developed a sensitivity to polish and I stopped wearing I t for the last ten years.  </li>
            <li>lasted a few days (through dishwashing and showering etc) before i had the first chip.  </li>

            <li> DID NOT LIKE THE GLITTER LOOK</li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and when it came in, it was 6 different colors that I didn&#x27;t order. Way a bummer. Not worth shipping back and reordering.</li>
            <li> I really like these shades of nail polish and I like the satin finish.  I have to say that the packaging isn&#x27;t all that protective of the polish bottles.</li>
            <li> Nice colors but horrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish doesn&#x27;t even last one day.  it begins to chip off immediately.  By the second day, every nail was chipped off by nearly half the nail.  What a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> This is a nice assortment of natural hues. I was disappointed only one bottle does not have metallic or glitter (my preference is none) but the product is nice for people that like a little more glitz than I do.</li>

            <li> LIke the Kleancolor brand and these beige shades are a nice addition to my collection. THANK YOU !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these colors! Especially the mocha, even though its not really a mocha its more of a dark flesh pink, which its really pretty on my fingers with a top coat.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the colors,  in the picture you see all the light colors called the nudes. They are so much darker than that when the package arrived. The polish chips the day you put it on. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> This polish is a GREAT bargain...exactly what I ordered, just as they appear in the pic!! The colors are beautiful and no knock off...its the real brand as described (Kleancolor) &amp; all the bottles were full, not damaged. I ordered this 4 days ago &amp; I already got it. I actually bought 4 color sets (42 polishes total) with different colors &amp; I&#x27;ve gotten 3 sets already. I can&#x27;t wait to use them all!!</li>
            <li> I like all the colors,goes on real smooth too</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with nice hands and strong nails.  However, after years of manicures, I developed a sensitivity to polish and I stopped wearing I t for the last ten years.  Many brands have changed their formulations now so I decided to try again.  I ordered this set because of the color selection.  While I love a real red or deep pink for a special event, I have always worn a shade as close to my skin tone as possible for everyday, because it makes fingers look long and slim and is very Lady like.  I found several shades here that work beautifully for every day, and I have not experienced any problems with chipping.  I wear both cream and frosted so the sparklyness was no problem.  My allergies haven&#x27;t kicked up yet, and I am trying several brands to see if there is one that is best.  These are in the running and I have gotten many remarks on how beautiful the nail color is.  My hands are now the perfect backdrop for my ring collection!</li>
            <li> Colors are great polish nice texture</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors but it chips and cracks within a day&#x27;s wear.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, shipping was fast and easy. Love it</li>
