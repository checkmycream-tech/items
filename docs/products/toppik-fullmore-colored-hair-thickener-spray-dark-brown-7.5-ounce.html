            <li>great item with a truly great price, much more on the Fullmore website...</li>
            <li>good thing is that-</li>
            <li>The price is good tho.</li>
            <li>It came in good condition</li>
            <li>Does a great job of covering spots in the hair that don&#x27;t get covered by your own hair.</li>
            <li>Works great, Been using it for years, I will not leave the house without it unless I&#x27;m wearing a hat :)</li>
            <li>Give the hair a nice testure.  </li>
            <li>Effective disguise that is brushable, combable and styleable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it does make the hair appear thicker from a distance and therefore could come in handy for a photo shoot...</li>
            <li>I now use Style Edit with great success.  </li>
            <li>so far all the vendors that sell this product have been great!</li>
            <li>It stains the bathtub too, so I&#x27;m spending more money on bleach.  </li>
            <li>no matter how many times I have used this product.  </li>
            <li>It is an ok product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>These tend to be runny and more like paint.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I have also had many sucessful hair implants.</li>
            <li>Some spray will get on the hair but by spraying the scalp you remove the skin tone on top your head.</li>
            <li>I have been using Fullmore for many, many years now.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for thinning, balding hair, especially for women.  </li>
            <li>Better than Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li>I may be more pleased with it if it were a lighter color</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I wish It did not rub off so easy.</li>
            <li>so easy and</li>
            <li>This hair thickener not only works perfect every time I use it, but It cover well, and is completely undetectable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>Although it does cover up, because it goes on somewhat wet-like, the hair doesn&#x27;t look clean.  </li>
            <li>not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way  too  light, same shade from Jerome Russell is a lot better!</li>
            <li>have used other products of this type, this by far is the best.  </li>
            <li>Good product covers grey and gives body to hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and fast.</li>
            <li>So you do get your monies worth.</li>
            <li>I only wish they could figure out how to make your hair feel more smooth after spraying.</li>
            <li>but so what, it so worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the best money I have ever spent as it gave me back my confidence.</li>
            <li>But, works great to cover small spots.</li>
            <li>For all of us that unfortunately have thining hair, I think this is the best hair thickener on the market.</li>
            <li>I particularly love the blonde as I also spray it lightly over my hair to instantly give it a lighter look!!!</li>
            <li>Although the product basicly instructs you to match the color and spray your hair over the thinning area I have found an even more natural look by using this principal: I part my hair on top in about three placeses start at the back of my hair line and go forward every inch or two.</li>
            <li>It works much better than most other similar products and it&#x27;s easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>certainly wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to touch it....</li>
            <li>It will make a bit of a mess in the shower when you eventually wash your hair, but easy to clean up with cleaners.  </li>
            <li>However, it does work to cover bald and thinning areas very well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very ineffective.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I expected more from them.</li>
            <li>It really thickens the thinning areas and also covers the gray roots...</li>
            <li>AND IT IS VERY EMBARRASSING; MY BEAUTICIAN RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SOME TREPIDATION</li>
            <li>I also received fast delivery when ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I shake the can, I still get drips on my skin and around my hairline.  </li>
            <li>It covers very well but there is still work to be done to make it so the color does not come off on your fingers when you touch your head,  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels much thicker.</li>
            <li>but this is working very well for me.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY HELPS TO HIDE MY ALOPECIA</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m not reviewing it as a hair thickener, but it is GREAT as a way to quickly spray on grey roots when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I get out of the shower, I expose my light spots with the brush, I then hold the can 2-3 inches away and spray, after all spots are sprayed, I brush hair gently and dry, then style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works, looks good upon completion of spraying your hair, but it is a bit messy as it  will leave residue on your hands and facial skin.</li>
            <li>Decent size can.</li>
            <li>Does the job for decent price.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Its great if you are in rush and cant be persist  but not for an everyday or every other day usage.</li>
            <li>I have found a way by using this product that you can very sucessfully thicken the look of you hair with or without transplants and restore a natural look.</li>
            <li>i order this product for my mom who has very thin hair , and some spot barley has hair , and it works great and blend with the color of her hair.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the Toppix hair fibers with MUCH BETTER results.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and liked it enough to reorder.  </li>
            <li>comes down your face if you get into the rain and doesn&#x27;t actually thicken your hair as promised, it&#x27;s more just color.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works but the first bottle I got was the wrong color, I do however love this hair product</li>
            <li>Have used for years to cover large irregular balding area (female).  </li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable and 7.5oz container lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it in the rain or near my hairline,</li>
            <li>Completely disguises thinning patches, makes hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li>It covers 3/4 of the grey but if client continues to use it all week at home it is very drying to hair</li>
            <li>First of all, my hair color is medium brown, but the product was too dark for me to use.  </li>
            <li>I dry my hair completely and move the hair I have off of the bald area</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I dry my hair completely and move the hair I have off of the bald area</li>
            <li> but hair became hard to style afterwards and it just works better to apply some kind of powder directly to the scalp that doesn&#x27;t get everywhere and make the hair all brittle and horrible...</li>
            <li> Let it dry or use a hair dryer on low heat for a faster process.</li>
            <li> However it does leave your hair very sticky and hard to style.  </li>
            <li> you have long hair, it deflates volume and makes  </li>
            <li> The can lasts for a long time and if you dont wash your hair every day it doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> and you get blotches... hold it out and it gets everywhere...made my hair dry and sticky...like straw...</li>
            <li> the black when applied, takes on a slight bergundy color, not completely black.  </li>
            <li> it will make you have an even, natural look which not many other products can achieve.</li>
            <li> It looks natural and can hardly be detected.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money, it contaminates anything that it comes in contact with</li>
            <li> I have to use this product due to hair loss so it helps me deal with my problem.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I always have to match my black hair with other products..</li>
            <li> I use the black hair thickener spray...</li>
            <li> It has to be shampooed out every night or it makes a mess on the pillowcase.  </li>
            <li> but this was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> Spray little or none on your hair and</li>
            <li> A LITTLE</li>
            <li> Yes, it can be a little messy on your pillows</li>
            <li> Instant color coverage that fills out thin hair area.</li>
            <li> , HOWEVER THAT IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY ; UNLIKE SOME</li>
            <li> I am careful to spray it close to my scalp to cover my thin spots.  </li>
            <li> and this product is very messy.  </li>
            <li> FOR THAT I AM SO  THANKFUL; MAYBE IT DOES DULL THE HAIR</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get it to go on evenly...</li>
            <li> So sad Toppix bought out this brand and is destroying it!</li>
            <li> Does help fill in thin hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a great fan -</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, and this product has made a world of difference.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately got all over my pillows, etc.  </li>
            <li> Sorry fullmmore....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to feel insecure about my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> However, neither is the case, and after one attempt to use the hair thickener, the product is useless for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it stains the pillow cases and the bathtub when I wash my hair.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best color in a can I have used....It works great for covering balding areas or covering up gray in between shampoos. I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I use this product before and bought it from they manufacturer but this was a little cheaper. It&#x27;s a great product. with cheaper from this website.</li>
            <li> This really works--a few sprays and it fills in the gaps.  Problem is that the spray powder will also stain your bathroom walls if not carefull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m not reviewing it as a hair thickener, but it is GREAT as a way to quickly spray on grey roots when you don&#x27;t have time to do a full color.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works but the first bottle I got was the wrong color, I do however love this hair product</li>
            <li> Very effective.  Have used for years to cover large irregular balding area (female).  Frustration comes from the overspray that it leaves on the surfaces in my house, especially in the bathroom, where I spray.</li>
            <li> Great just wash you hair before going to bed. Stains your pillow.</li>
            <li> Does help fill in thin hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this product a couple of times but it just doesn&#x27;t hold what it promises. comes down your face if you get into the rain and doesn&#x27;t actually thicken your hair as promised, it&#x27;s more just color. recently I tried hairfor2. not bad.</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on a review.  It works wonderfully to cover the thinning areas on my scalp.  It&#x27;s easy to use and fast. My only concerns are the aerosol application - I wonder what I am breathing in when I spray it (???) and this product is very messy.  It has to be shampooed out every night or it makes a mess on the pillowcase.  It stains the bathtub too, so I&#x27;m spending more money on bleach.  However, it does work to cover bald and thinning areas very well.</li>
            <li> I use the black hair thickener spray...the only problem..the black when applied, takes on a slight bergundy color, not completely black.  This happens every time..no matter how many times I have used this product.  I have used it for over 15 years. I always have to match my black hair with other products..cannot just rely on hair thickener for the back..can you tell me why?</li>
            <li> Product works as well as Toppik which costs double.  Price is very reasonable and 7.5oz container lasts a long time. Try it...you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> This product is a total waste of money, it contaminates anything that it comes in contact with and it&#x27;s very ineffective. Spend your money on proper diet and vitamin supplementation instead.</li>
            <li> great item with a truly great price, much more on the Fullmore website...thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way  too  light, same shade from Jerome Russell is a lot better! I expected more from them. Won&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for women balded by breast cancer treatment - make hair fuller and easy to style. So sad Toppix bought out this brand and is destroying it!</li>
            <li> I like the coverage of this product.  However it does leave your hair very sticky and hard to style.  I haven&#x27;t had it run but the stickiness makes it for me unusable.</li>
            <li> It is an ok product. It covers 3/4 of the grey but if client continues to use it all week at home it is very drying to hair</li>
            <li> This product is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products of this type, this by far is the best.  It looks natural and can hardly be detected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Would give to my friends and relatives for use.  Give the hair a nice testure.  Keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> This hair thickener not only works perfect every time I use it, but It cover well, and is completely undetectable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great to cover any gray hair or Thinning spots</li>
            <li> Its great if you are in rush and cant be persist  but not for an everyday or every other day usage. it will stain your sheets, stains comes off once you wash them but it will leave a mark on everything, anything and anyone you will come in contact with.&lt;br /&gt;If you have long hair, it deflates volume and makes  the hair root sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is that- it will make you have an even, natural look which not many other products can achieve. It also covers all areas you need to cover with no patches or stripes .</li>
            <li> Instant color coverage that fills out thin hair area. Easy to apply. Effective disguise that is brushable, combable and styleable.</li>
            <li> This product is for people with thinning hair like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: My bathroom is covered with overspray.  Like others have said, it&#x27;s very similar to spray paint, the exception is, it&#x27;s totally water soluble.  It will make a bit of a mess in the shower when you eventually wash your hair, but easy to clean up with cleaners.  If you go swimming, it will wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I get out of the shower, I expose my light spots with the brush, I then hold the can 2-3 inches away and spray, after all spots are sprayed, I brush hair gently and dry, then style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I skip washing my hair at night and I have not noticed any transfer of color to my bedding, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Although it does cover up, because it goes on somewhat wet-like, the hair doesn&#x27;t look clean.  The price is good tho.</li>
            <li> It met my expectation, it does color hair close to the scalp which prevents a shiny scalp.  I wish It did not rub off so easy. However, I did recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have to use this product due to hair loss so it helps me deal with my problem.  It came in good condition</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and I think this stuff works well to mask some of the thinning.&lt;br /&gt;BOB</li>
            <li> It really thickens the thinning areas and also covers the gray roots...the only problem I have with it is that it makes hair feel sort of gummy.</li>
            <li> These tend to be runny and more like paint.  I&#x27;m not a great fan - I prefer the kind like toppik which is like microfibers!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately got all over my pillows, etc.  I now use Style Edit with great success.  Sorry fullmmore....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. I have also had many sucessful hair implants. As good as any implants are and mine are great, you can never restore what God gave you. That&#x27;s where the Fullmore product comes in. I have found a way by using this product that you can very sucessfully thicken the look of you hair with or without transplants and restore a natural look. Although the product basicly instructs you to match the color and spray your hair over the thinning area I have found an even more natural look by using this principal: I part my hair on top in about three placeses start at the back of my hair line and go forward every inch or two. I expose the scalp. I then actually spray the scalp. Yes, spray your skin. Some spray will get on the hair but by spraying the scalp you remove the skin tone on top your head. Spray little or none on your hair and your thinning spots become virtually undetectable. The can lasts for a long time and if you dont wash your hair every day it doesn&#x27;t rub off. One suggestion, I tried the product Toppik. It&#x27;s no comparison to Fullmore.</li>
            <li> Works great.  But, to use it, use short bursts.  Do not spray it like hairspray.  Pull hair away and do 3 short blasts.  Wait 30 seconds followed by hairspray to set it.  Then, using BIG comb,lift it and style it.  I haven&#x27;t tried it in the rain or near my hairline, for I don&#x27;t yet know if it would drip.  But, works great to cover small spots.</li>
            <li> This product works, looks good upon completion of spraying your hair, but it is a bit messy as it  will leave residue on your hands and facial skin.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD A THINNING HAIR PROBLEM FOR YEARS AND IT IS VERY EMBARRASSING; MY BEAUTICIAN RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SOME TREPIDATION I ORDERED IT; IT DOES WORK AND FOR THAT I AM SO  THANKFUL; MAYBE IT DOES DULL THE HAIR A LITTLE, HOWEVER THAT IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY ; UNLIKE SOME I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH IT SPRAYING ALL OVER; WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WITH THIS PROBLEM;</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my beautician.  I works beautifully.  I am careful to spray it close to my scalp to cover my thin spots.  I like that it gives my roots a thicker texture to add volume.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life. After removal of a tumor on the crown of my head the hair would not grow back. This product covers it beautifully.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Excellent results.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. Tried several others but  none compared with fullmore.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fullmore for many, many years now. I use it to cover a bald spot on the crown of my head. After I shower and shampoo I dry my hair completely and move the hair I have off of the bald area I spray the area with Fullmore. Let it dry or use a hair dryer on low heat for a faster process. Comb my hair over the area just sprayed and walla, no bald spot. And no one ever knows. It will stay on until you wash it or brush it out. And one can will last me three months. So you do get your monies worth. I also received fast delivery when ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for thinning, balding hair, especially for women.  I don&#x27;t have to feel insecure about my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> Decent size can. Does the job for decent price. Better than Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of covering spots in the hair that don&#x27;t get covered by your own hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, my hair color is medium brown, but the product was too dark for me to use.  Also, when I sprayed it, it went all over my face and my vanity.  I may be more pleased with it if it were a lighter color and if I had someone to apply it for me.  However, neither is the case, and after one attempt to use the hair thickener, the product is useless for me.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I shake the can, I still get drips on my skin and around my hairline.  Last time I used it I actually had drips on my forehead and cheek.</li>
            <li> For all of us that unfortunately have thining hair, I think this is the best hair thickener on the market. I only wish they could figure out how to make your hair feel more smooth after spraying. It covers very well but there is still work to be done to make it so the color does not come off on your fingers when you touch your head,  That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon makes buying on line so easy and so far all the vendors that sell this product have been great!</li>
            <li> This product is life changing! Completely disguises thinning patches, makes hair feel thicker. Can wear hair with confidence without worrying. I have used both the brown and the blonde after changing hair colour. I particularly love the blonde as I also spray it lightly over my hair to instantly give it a lighter look!!! Yes, it can be a little messy on your pillows but so what, it so worth it. Please try it. This is the best money I have ever spent as it gave me back my confidence.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, and this product has made a world of difference. My hair looks and feels much thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through Chemo and losing my hair...but this is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> Good product covers grey and gives body to hair</li>
            <li> IT REALLY HELPS TO HIDE MY ALOPECIA</li>
            <li> i order this product for my mom who has very thin hair , and some spot barley has hair , and it works great and blend with the color of her hair. she is been using it for three years. sometimes i use it on my gray hair lol</li>
            <li> Works great, Been using it for years, I will not leave the house without it unless I&#x27;m wearing a hat :)</li>
            <li> It works much better than most other similar products and it&#x27;s easier to apply.  I especially like that it builds body into the hair.  Unfortunately, it stains the pillow cases and the bathtub when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get it to go on evenly...hold it too close to scalp and you get blotches... hold it out and it gets everywhere...made my hair dry and sticky...like straw...certainly wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to touch it....&lt;br /&gt;it does make the hair appear thicker from a distance and therefore could come in handy for a photo shoot...but hair became hard to style afterwards and it just works better to apply some kind of powder directly to the scalp that doesn&#x27;t get everywhere and make the hair all brittle and horrible...</li>
            <li> Product does the job but also tends to come out and dirties everything up!  I usually buy the Toppix hair fibers with MUCH BETTER results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and liked it enough to reorder.  I hope to order again in the future.</li>
