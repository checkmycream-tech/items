            <li> I have a question: are they smaller tipped like does it create big dots AND small dots or dies it make usually smaller dots</li>
            <li> Nice, but I thought it was something else.  I thought it had the actual polish in it.  My Bad, Oops</li>

I love to paint my own nails and find this tool really nice and easy compared to using toothpicks, the paint sticks onto them nicely and creates a pretty dot. You wouldn&#x27;t think this but I couldn&#x27;t find dotting pens anywhere in stores so that is why I decided to order them on here. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like about ordering this product is that it took a really long time to get here (about three weeks) but when it did get here it was exactly what I wanted and I would order from here again!</li>
