            <li>To be safe I would recommend buying a travel plug adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommend for sure.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this item is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleased.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is perfect for my needs!</li>
            <li>Very light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The mini CROC hot iron is good for people that are traveling with</li>
            <li>best ever flat iron....small and compact so easy to travel</li>
            <li>This iron is so cute and easy to transport.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so it still works okay for me.</li>
            <li>(aka I stopped caring so much about my hair), but a good option if you are traveling abroad.</li>
            <li>I also needed something that was easy to take with me on trips.</li>
            <li>It comes with a traveling pouch and fits easily in any luggage or a medium sized purse.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easily transported.</li>
            <li>The size is good for maneuvering (such as twisting your wrist to give your bangs a bowed shape) and it fits nicely in your hand.</li>
            <li>This thing is perfect to neaten up your bangs, putting a slight curl in them or for styling side-swept bangs.</li>
            <li>(I have pretty straight hair as it is, so perhaps the lack of heat settings wouldn&#x27;t be great for all hair types.)  </li>
            <li>I used it twice during my 10 day trip to Ireland and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to bring my own heavy-duty Croc straightener, but it is not dual-voltage, so I had to look for an alternative that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>I used it for a trip to Europe and light packing was an issue.</li>
            <li>I liked the red color and the handy heat resistant case.</li>
            <li>I really love how easily the cord folds up as well, it saves me tons of time in the morning to be able to just fold up the cord and put the whole thing away in the heat protective case without having to wait for it to cool.</li>
            <li>I just tried this on our recent trip and, &amp;#34;I love it!&amp;#34;  Works perfectly, heated up fast, and didn&#x27;t take up much room in my overnight bag.</li>
            <li>It is very small and light and should be excellent for travel.</li>
            <li>These are amazing for short hair and come in a perfect little pouch for travelling.</li>
            <li>I did miss my full sized Chi, but this worked in a pinch..</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, love the carry case.  </li>
            <li>Even though the iron doesn&#x27;t have changeable heat settings, I think it warms up very nicely without getting hot enough to burn or damage my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thoroughly satisfied and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Of course, for the price, I say it&#x27;s probably worth it if you cannot take a full size iron somewhere.</li>
            <li>I really want to pack light</li>
            <li>I have thin hair, so this \\&quot;baby\\&quot; was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly and since I have shoulder blade length relaxed hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just the plates that get very hot, its the outer plastic part that also becomes too hot for comfort.</li>
            <li>beware it does get very hot but is best for short hair or tight curls.</li>
            <li>But, it got the job done (just took a bit longer b/c of its size), and I was SO happy to have straight hair a few days in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked very well, heated up quickly</li>
            <li>up very quick and gets very hot but does not dry hair out</li>
            <li>does not get as hot as claimed.</li>
            <li>Love the way it silkens and curls and the same time.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using it for the fact that it gets too hot for my hair texture.</li>
            <li>I had to wait for a while to get it really hot</li>
            <li>This is awesome for bangs, thin hair, and sort hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel or that college student!</li>
            <li>so good flat irons is a major need.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and even with fairly long, thick hair, it worked great!  </li>
            <li>This may work okay on (much) shorter hair, but it definitely isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I think it works better than my full size flat iron - would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>Here are the key points of this great little straightener:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats fast and I can straighten or curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product was fantastic for my recent trip to Italy and Rome.</li>
            <li>I do not have real curly hair</li>
            <li>Precut straight but after using the iron it is.  </li>
            <li>I would plug it in, do my make up, and then it would be ready to go.  </li>
            <li>If you have very thick or long hair it may not be the best bet.</li>
            <li>Overall, it gets my hair pretty straight, smooth and does the job, it just gets too hot and can definitely burn you.</li>
            <li>Has nice little carry case too!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for travel abroad.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone that travels a lot.</li>
            <li>It definitely works better than no straightening at all, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as a full-sized flat iron.</li>
            <li>The flat iron heated up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price, but don&#x27;t expect it to function as nicely as a larger version.</li>
            <li>This flat iron does not have temperature control so it will get very, very hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little small and doesn&#x27;t get very hot, but for a trip, it&#x27;s fine and packs easily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot as the \\&quot;big daddies,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Super small and wraps up nice in its little travel bag.</li>
            <li>There is no adjustment for heat, but it seems to get hot enough to smooth down my hair with 2-3 swipes.  </li>
            <li>The portability is a must with young ladies for touch ups.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>b/c it works as well or better than my big, heavy, bulky iron.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair just past my shoulders which is not difficult to straighten, but using this flat iron resulted in frizzy semi-straightened hair.</li>
            <li>I have shorter naturally straight hair that I like to use a flat iron on to get a sleek look.</li>
            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my regular croc, and it doesn&#x27;t have a digital display.</li>
            <li>Actual hot iron plate is only 3\\&quot; x 5/8\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I had recently purchased a regular full size flat iron when I started planning a trip to italy.  </li>
            <li>It is so small and light weight.  </li>
            <li>I love how small this flat iron is!</li>
            <li>I would not use this product daily at home because of its smaller size, but I highly recommend for travel.</li>
            <li>it does say that it is \\&quot;TRAVEL READY WORLD WIDE VOLTAGE\\</li>
            <li>I would not take this product as my travel flat iron as I have too much hair and there is no way this little guy can do my whole head.  </li>
            <li>really isn&#x27;t a problem except for the fact that the exterior material (feels like thin plastic) gets almost as hot as the plate</li>
            <li>but it still does the job if you don&#x27;t have super thick hair.</li>

            <li> Actual hot iron plate is only 3\\&quot; x 5/8\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had recently purchased a regular full size flat iron when I started planning a trip to italy.  </li>
            <li> It is so small and light weight.  </li>
            <li> I love how small this flat iron is!</li>
            <li> I would not use this product daily at home because of its smaller size, but I highly recommend for travel.</li>
            <li> it does say that it is \\&quot;TRAVEL READY WORLD WIDE VOLTAGE\\</li>
            <li> I would not take this product as my travel flat iron as I have too much hair and there is no way this little guy can do my whole head.  </li>
            <li> really isn&#x27;t a problem except for the fact that the exterior material (feels like thin plastic) gets almost as hot as the plate</li>
            <li> but it still does the job if you don&#x27;t have super thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a standard North American 2 flat parallel prongs, where one is slightly larger than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like these flat irons; they definitely get the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for a trip I was going on over Thanksgiving--I used it both in the US &amp; abroad and found that in both cases, it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the flat iron only has two settings... on or off.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron for our trip to Italy this summer to avoid having to take my larger and heavier flat iron, and also because it did not need a voltage converter.  </li>
            <li> My daughter with long thick hair who does the whole nine yards thought it was a bit tedious since the iron area is so little, but I loved it.</li>
            <li> Really compact and small for traveling within North America</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron for a trip to Europe (which won&#x27;t be for another 2 months).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a mini travel flat iron, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take too long to do the job.</li>
            <li> It took really long to flatten my hair</li>
            <li> The iron from end to end is about 7.5 inches long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3- Long power cord</li>
            <li> use this iron on my bangs only since I don&#x27;t typically iron the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s red; it&#x27;s little; it works.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, I wish it would get a little hotter.</li>
            <li> thin, fairly straight</li>
            <li> Since it is smaller than what I normally use, it did take a little longer to do my hair, but not much since I have thin hair.  </li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s not that powerful, and probably not good for those with really thick or curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers are correct.</li>
            <li> &quot; but I am skeptical since it is not labeled on the hot iron itself.</li>
            <li> I will usually plug it in, go put my clothes on and by the time I get back</li>
            <li> As soon as your are finished you can pack it up an put in your bag, saving wait time as it cools down.</li>
            <li> It came with a teriffic little case.     </li>
            <li> The item also travels well since it takes up so little space in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> It is very small and is easier to take out and use if you are only doing a small portion of your hair, or have shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve to do it in small sections to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> worked for my sister (thin, medium length hair) but not for me (thick, slightly wavy, medium length</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve thick</li>
            <li> I do very small sections anyway.    </li>
            <li> There are weak magnets that hold the mat rolled.</li>
            <li> was quite disappointed with this product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this when traveling in Europe and Asia, and I have never experienced any electrical problems.  </li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with a Croc.</li>
            <li> After 3 months, started making noise and scary burning smell then died.</li>

            <li> I bought my Croc for a trip to the UK. It&#x27;s red; it&#x27;s little; it works. I love it! I have thin hair, so this \\&quot;baby\\&quot; was perfect for me. It came with a teriffic little case.     Other reviewers are correct. It doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot as the \\&quot;big daddies,\\&quot; but it still does the job if you don&#x27;t have super thick hair. It might take longer if you have to straighten every hair on your head.  My daughter with long thick hair who does the whole nine yards thought it was a bit tedious since the iron area is so little, but I loved it. I do very small sections anyway.    Since (sigh) I&#x27;m back from my vacation, I keep it in my gym locker for post workout touch ups.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron for a trip to Europe (which won&#x27;t be for another 2 months).  In the meantime, I have been using at home and it does a nice job.  There is no adjustment for heat, but it seems to get hot enough to smooth down my hair with 2-3 swipes.  It is very small and light and should be excellent for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It is cute. Everything is red on it, even the cord! It is very small and is easier to take out and use if you are only doing a small portion of your hair, or have shorter hair. It heats up pretty fast. I don&#x27;t have enough time to do anything else while I wait for it to heat up lets just put it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this iron on my bangs only since I don&#x27;t typically iron the rest of my hair. This thing is perfect to neaten up your bangs, putting a slight curl in them or for styling side-swept bangs. The size is good for maneuvering (such as twisting your wrist to give your bangs a bowed shape) and it fits nicely in your hand. You can also get closer to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case/mat is a nice bonus. Two elastic loops hold the iron and cord in place. The loop for the corn is velcroed on one end. Once everything is secured, you simply roll it up. There are weak magnets that hold the mat rolled.</li>
            <li> I had recently purchased a regular full size flat iron when I started planning a trip to italy.  I really want to pack light so when I saw the baby croc I thought I&#x27;d try it.  It is so small and light weight.  It heats fast and I can straighten or curl my hair.  It&#x27;s dual voltage so it leaves in two days with me on my Italian adventure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go to Europe and it&#x27;s great.  Just attach the correct plug adapter and away you go.  It gets very hot and even with fairly long, thick hair, it worked great!  I even use it at home now b/c it works as well or better than my big, heavy, bulky iron.  Has nice little carry case too!</li>
            <li> Brought product to Europe. It worked over there (with adapter) even though there  was a typo in the volts rating on the product (I verified the typo with the manufacturer before leaving the country.) It seemed to get hotter in the US and I didn&#x27;t have much patience to work with it after  few days of travel (aka I stopped caring so much about my hair), but a good option if you are traveling abroad. I did miss my full sized Chi, but this worked in a pinch..especially if you are short on space.</li>
            <li> This baby croc is wonderful if your hair is already mostly straight. It definitely works better than no straightening at all, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as a full-sized flat iron. Of course, for the price, I say it&#x27;s probably worth it if you cannot take a full size iron somewhere. For my trip to europe, it was wonderful because it is dual-voltage. I think it&#x27;s worth the price, but don&#x27;t expect it to function as nicely as a larger version.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters and they love it. The portability is a must with young ladies for touch ups. Great product</li>
            <li> This product was fantastic for my recent trip to Italy and Rome. I REALLY wanted to bring my own heavy-duty Croc straightener, but it is not dual-voltage, so I had to look for an alternative that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Here are the key points of this great little straightener:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s adorable. Super small and wraps up nice in its little travel bag. Did not weigh my suitcase down.&lt;br /&gt;2. Worked perfectly in Europe with just my cheapie voltage adapter (no converter required). No overheating; no underheating.&lt;br /&gt;3. No, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my regular croc, and it doesn&#x27;t have a digital display. But, it got the job done (just took a bit longer b/c of its size), and I was SO happy to have straight hair a few days in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for travel abroad.</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely and as described.  Wished it was packed better with more padding. Item was not damaged.  Pictured as is.  Cant go wrong with a Croc.</li>
            <li> does not get as hot as claimed. Returned withing a week. I do not have real curly hair and it did not do the job.</li>
            <li> I just tried this on our recent trip and, &amp;#34;I love it!&amp;#34;  Works perfectly, heated up fast, and didn&#x27;t take up much room in my overnight bag. The carry case is great! As soon as your are finished you can pack it up an put in your bag, saving wait time as it cools down. I would highly recommend this to anyone that travels a lot.</li>
            <li> I like these flat irons; they definitely get the job done. I would recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I have natural hair so good flat irons is a major need.</li>
            <li> These are amazing for short hair and come in a perfect little pouch for travelling.</li>
            <li> Excellent for travel my wife used it on our vacation here recently and she said it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and easy to use. Love the way it silkens and curls and the same time.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for shorter hair. Heats up fast, love the carry case.  Glad I purchased this. Love it, love it. When I use this, I am glad after the result.  My hair is not. Precut straight but after using the iron it is.  And it lasts must of the day. Very happy with the product I bought.</li>
            <li> After 3 months, started making noise and scary burning smell then died.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does not have temperature control so it will get very, very hot. It heats up pretty quickly and since I have shoulder blade length relaxed hair it doesn&#x27;t take too long to do the job. I use Tresemme heat protectant with it each and every time that I use it but I still smell that burning smell which I hate. I have stopped using it for the fact that it gets too hot for my hair texture. It&#x27;s not just the plates that get very hot, its the outer plastic part that also becomes too hot for comfort. Overall, it gets my hair pretty straight, smooth and does the job, it just gets too hot and can definitely burn you. Also, after having it for about a year now, the middle of the plate has become brown instead of red.</li>
            <li> Brought this for a trip to Europe, worked great with a plug adapter, but no voltage adapter was needed as it is dual voltage.  I think it works better than my full size flat iron - would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Based on my testing. The mini CROC hot iron is good for people that are traveling with thin, fairly straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;It worked for my sister (thin, medium length hair) but not for me (thick, slightly wavy, medium length hair).&lt;br /&gt;This is because the iron is too small to cover a lot of hair and because it doesn&#x27;t have a temperature control it gets really, really hot when you leave it \\&quot;ON\\&quot; as you do your hair. As a result I ended up burning my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I received a defective one but was quite disappointed with this product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1- No temperature control setting. I had to wait for a while to get it really hot (I&#x27;ve thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;2- Actual hot iron plate is only 3\\&quot; x 5/8\\&quot;. It took really long to flatten my hair bc I&#x27;ve to do it in small sections to straighten my hair&lt;br /&gt;3- The iron from end to end is about 7.5 inches long. While I&#x27;m holding it at an angle my hand covers 2/3 of the iron.&lt;br /&gt;4- 3 really isn&#x27;t a problem except for the fact that the exterior material (feels like thin plastic) gets almost as hot as the plate itself.&lt;br /&gt;5- bc of all the above reasons I ended up burning my ear and my index finger and thumb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1- Really compact and small for traveling within North America&lt;br /&gt;2- Comes with traveling case&lt;br /&gt;3- Long power cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now regarding whether or not this is DUAL VOLTAGE.&lt;br /&gt;I am not an electrician nor have I tested this aboard in Europe but the label on this Mini CROC only indicates 100-120V.&lt;br /&gt;I was told that it should be labeled as 110/240v or 110-240v to be dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a standard North American 2 flat parallel prongs, where one is slightly larger than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that came with it does say that it is \\&quot;TRAVEL READY WORLD WIDE VOLTAGE\\&quot; but I am skeptical since it is not labeled on the hot iron itself. To be safe I would recommend buying a travel plug adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say the CONS outweighs the PROS.ONS outweighs the PROS.</li>
            <li> This is awesome for bangs, thin hair, and sort hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel or that college student! Recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this item is perfect for me.  It gets nice and hot and straightens my hair perfectly.  The item also travels well since it takes up so little space in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is perfect for my needs! I have shorter naturally straight hair that I like to use a flat iron on to get a sleek look. I also needed something that was easy to take with me on trips. Even though the iron doesn&#x27;t have changeable heat settings, I think it warms up very nicely without getting hot enough to burn or damage my hair. I will usually plug it in, go put my clothes on and by the time I get back it is the perfect temperature. I really love how easily the cord folds up as well, it saves me tons of time in the morning to be able to just fold up the cord and put the whole thing away in the heat protective case without having to wait for it to cool.</li>
            <li> This iron met all my needs &amp; then some. It heats up fast and the size is perfect! I&#x27;m thoroughly satisfied and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this when traveling in Europe and Asia, and I have never experienced any electrical problems.  I just snap on the adaptor and go.  It doesn&#x27;t have any heat settings- the longer you give it to heat up, the hotter it gets.  (I have pretty straight hair as it is, so perhaps the lack of heat settings wouldn&#x27;t be great for all hair types.)  I would plug it in, do my make up, and then it would be ready to go.  And the protective mat is comes with is great.  It contains elastic hoops to hold the cord and straighter is place.  I never have to worry about the hotel&#x27;s countertop or my luggage because they&#x27;re protected. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love how small this flat iron is! It comes with a traveling pouch and fits easily in any luggage or a medium sized purse. It heats up quickly and is good quality. The only thing is, I wish it would get a little hotter. I have fine hair, so it still works okay for me. I just don&#x27;t know how it would be on thicker hair.</li>
            <li> best ever flat iron....small and compact so easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up very quick and gets very hot but does not dry hair out</li>
            <li> The flat iron heated up quickly.  However it&#x27;s not that powerful, and probably not good for those with really thick or curly hair.  It&#x27;s just a mini travel flat iron, so keep that in mind.  I used it twice during my 10 day trip to Ireland and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for a trip I was going on over Thanksgiving--I used it both in the US &amp; abroad and found that in both cases, it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to straighten hair. I have fine hair just past my shoulders which is not difficult to straighten, but using this flat iron resulted in frizzy semi-straightened hair. I wanted to love this because the size is perfect for travel and it comes with a travel pouch. This may work okay on (much) shorter hair, but it definitely isn&#x27;t working for me. I plan to send it back.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron for our trip to Italy this summer to avoid having to take my larger and heavier flat iron, and also because it did not need a voltage converter.  I liked the red color and the handy heat resistant case. It worked very well, heated up quickly and I was pleased. Since it is smaller than what I normally use, it did take a little longer to do my hair, but not much since I have thin hair.  I would not use this product daily at home because of its smaller size, but I highly recommend for travel.</li>
            <li> linda muy comoda de llevar y buena para alisar.. llego rapido y me encanta tenerla ..y no es cara gracias</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend for her birthday and she says that the straightener works great! I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This iron is so cute and easy to transport. beware it does get very hot but is best for short hair or tight curls.</li>
            <li> I use this for needlepointing.. It flattens crimped threads perfectly. And it&#x27;s small so it&#x27;s easily transported. I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this just for my bangs, and for that I am very happy with this product.  I would not take this product as my travel flat iron as I have too much hair and there is no way this little guy can do my whole head.  Also, the flat iron only has two settings... on or off.  I would definitely recommend this for bang touch ups though.  The carrying case is GREAT too.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect travel iron. I have fine hair and not real thick, so it was perfect. If you have very thick or long hair it may not be the best bet. Worked great for me in Europe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small and doesn&#x27;t get very hot, but for a trip, it&#x27;s fine and packs easily.  I used it for a trip to Europe and light packing was an issue.</li>
