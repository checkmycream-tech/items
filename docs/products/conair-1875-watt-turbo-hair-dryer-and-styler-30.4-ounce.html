            <li>I would for sure recommend this product to everyone.</li>

            <li>More than anything about this product I like the price.</li>
            <li>I Love my Conair Turbo Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li>Great little dryer and the price was great</li>
            <li>Great price, standard shipping, nice product</li>
            <li>Very basic, but very good pricing.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work great, Gets a little warm</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer for such a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>Would be great if a third option available for hotter air.</li>
            <li>Plus free Shipping.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done and it is cheap.</li>
            <li>It is attractive enough looking</li>
            <li>purchased this because I was looking for the cheapest product available.</li>
            <li>Light weight and dries well.</li>
            <li>Cheap hair dryer that just works..</li>
            <li>The price was right, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>But for the money it&#x27;s super cheap and it works.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to work week due to the cheap price, but it is a great dryer.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product and it works as expected.</li>
            <li>Works great and half the cost of the store.</li>
            <li>this hair dryer is powerful and will do the job.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s worth 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, powerful, and comes with 2 attachments (that I don&#x27;t need), and the lowest price anywhere online (or anywhere I know of ) for this level of dryer/blower.</li>
            <li>As far as the quality it is ok.</li>
            <li>a cool switch, which, like other ones i have tried  still blows some warm air, not the ambient temp.     </li>
            <li>most recently, i used it to adhere plastic over my windows to keep out the draft during the winter.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of this, spend the extra $$$ and buy a better dryer</li>
            <li>so it will not get too hot</li>
            <li>Its a good quality hair dryer with standard features and low priced.</li>
            <li>He likes it a lot better than the others because it is much quieter on the low speed than what we used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this hair dryer works very well.</li>
            <li>this a very inexpensive hair dryer</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>Good price ..nice dryer..took quite a while to travel around the US to get here but at least it made it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I love this blowdryer, it comes with two attachments, a concentrator (to concentrate the air flow) and some other thing that I have no idea how to use.</li>
            <li>cord is a bit short, the heat not as hot as I&#x27;m used to, and the low setting is still pretty strong.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;cool&#x27; button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and quietly!</li>
            <li>quick drying, simple</li>
            <li>Only setting for temperature is Low or High with a separate cool button.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It has two speeds with low and high heat, and</li>
            <li>Only one speed - always high.</li>
            <li>no adjustments beyond &amp;#34; Low - Off - High.</li>
            <li>When I first turned this product on my hair was wet.</li>
            <li>It really help a lot for me and easily dry your hair.</li>
            <li>Does not have multiple temperature and speed controls like my old hair dryer (Low, Med, High), but it does the job well.  </li>
            <li>you are in a hurry though, the high setting blows a lot of air, just not quite as much as your typical politician.</li>
            <li>Good product only two speeds and cold shot button.</li>

            <li> Good product only two speeds and cold shot button.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> and I have been told it will not last very long.</li>
            <li> The price seems to fluctuate a lot so wait until a seller offers it for 10 dollars or less.</li>
            <li> Of course, I haven&#x27;t owned it long</li>
            <li> i do not use it to dry my hair(buzz cut).</li>
            <li> i use it for household projects, when i need to dry whatever i am working on.</li>
            <li> once in awhile you need a hair dryer in the house, even though you do not use it to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper to buy it from Amazon($8) and wait a few days then buy one similar to it at the local CVS($20) and at Walmart($15).</li>
            <li> Not sure what features might be missing to make this hair dryer sell at such a low price.</li>
            <li> These run off 120v AC,  which is needed for the heating element, though  I assume that like other ones  inside is a 12v DC blower motor.</li>
            <li> These likely do not cost much to make, but some can be very expensive.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> Either hot or cold.  </li>
            <li> so I would not worry about having a bad hair day without a hair dryer.  </li>

            <li> Very pleased with product and price!</li>
            <li> Works great for price.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer ever!! I thought that an $8 blow dryer would be a rip off but the reviews convinced me that this was a steal and it totally is! I love this blowdryer, it comes with two attachments, a concentrator (to concentrate the air flow) and some other thing that I have no idea how to use. I thought there would be some fault with this product but it exceeds my expectations. It was cheaper to buy it from Amazon($8) and wait a few days then buy one similar to it at the local CVS($20) and at Walmart($15). I love like it. Buy one from here for $8 if you can!!</li>
            <li> Works great and half the cost of the store. Plus free Shipping.</li>
            <li> Not sure what features might be missing to make this hair dryer sell at such a low price. It does everything I need it to, plus has two attachments I&#x27;ve never used (pinpointer and curler?) The &#x27;cool&#x27; button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp. Doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;medium&#x27; setting but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s worth 20 bucks. If you don&#x27;t like the color blue, well you&#x27;re outta luck. Guess since it isn&#x27;t foldable, it may not be good for travel. Whatever, it blow dries my hair at home when I need it to and does a good job at that. Will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes.    BTW, review is based on the price I paid for it. The price seems to fluctuate a lot so wait until a seller offers it for 10 dollars or less. Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer.</li>
            <li> nice price, nice color, and the attachments are perfect.</li>
            <li> Good price ..nice dryer..took quite a while to travel around the US to get here but at least it made it for Christmas.</li>

            <li> Its a good quality hair dryer with standard features and low priced.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a family hair dryer. Got a great deal and works good.  We also like the color.</li>
            <li> We actually bought this for drying the dog after his baths. He likes it a lot better than the others because it is much quieter on the low speed than what we used before.&lt;br /&gt;If you are in a hurry though, the high setting blows a lot of air, just not quite as much as your typical politician.</li>
            <li> Great price for an adequate hair dryer.</li>

            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Simple to use - no adjustments beyond &amp;#34; Low - Off - High. What more can a person want!</li>
            <li> Really great product for the money!</li>
            <li> Great dryer, it&#x27;s fast and it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> perfect for me.  quick drying, simple</li>
            <li> More than anything about this product I like the price. As far as the quality it is ok. It is attractive enough looking but it&#x27;s cord is a bit short, the heat not as hot as I&#x27;m used to, and the low setting is still pretty strong. But for the money it&#x27;s super cheap and it works.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, no complaints, great price.</li>
            <li> Very good dryer to buy on a budget!</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE, IT&#x27;S AWESOME .it does what is suppose to do.I would recommend  this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> When I first turned this product on my hair was wet. When I turned this device off my hair was dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I was looking for the cheapest product available. It worked perfectly and does appear to be a quality product. I have been very happy so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to work week due to the cheap price, but it is a great dryer. Light weight and dries well.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like.  It&#x27;s a hairdryer with good wattage.</li>
            <li> Great price, standard shipping, nice product</li>
            <li> I Love my Conair Turbo Hair Dryer. It works great and makes my hair look and feel better. I recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Works like a hair dryer. What can I say? The price was right, that&#x27;s for sure. Of course, I haven&#x27;t owned it long so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last. It came with everything needed for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer for such a cheap price.  I would recommend anyone who is on a budget to get one of these.</li>
            <li> Cheap hair dryer that just works..</li>
            <li> GREAT product love the color</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> Great dryer for my hair.  Felt drying time faster</li>
            <li> For the price paid, it is an  excellent buy.  I bought 3 so I would not worry about having a bad hair day without a hair dryer.  This hair dryer is simple and get the job done.  Either hot or cold.  Would be great if a third option available for hotter air.</li>
            <li> Good quality product--Used it as a heat gun for hours on end--Has a protection overload so it will not get too hot--It works great for its original intended use of drying hair too.</li>
            <li> Good product only two speeds and cold shot button.</li>
            <li> awesome look, good hairdryer</li>
