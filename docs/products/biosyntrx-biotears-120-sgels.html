            <li>Keeps my eyes from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li>I order this regularly and am never disappointed by anything I get through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any other brand although the lower price has been appealing.</li>
            <li>cost is almost double the cost of the Thera tears and I have noticed that it causes obvious diarrhea and more belching of fishy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my ophthalmologist and cornea specialist.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because I have mild dry eye in combination with incomplete lid closure while sleeping.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Not only does it keep my eyes well lubricated, but the dry skin on my heels has almost disappeared!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking BioTears for several months now, to help my very dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> But it only really works if I take the recommended daily dosage, two capsules twice daily, which gets expensive, since one bottle is only one month&#x27;s supply.</li>
            <li> Will continue to keep order it as long as they stock it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait that long.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it as long as it helps.</li>
            <li> My Dr recommended this in addition to daily steroid drops, Systane balance, some other drops,</li>
            <li> Yes, I have dry eyes</li>
            <li> My husband had a bone marrow transplant for leukemia in 2001; he has severe dry eye as a result.</li>
            <li> I believe it does work, but my eyes are so dry that I have to use a variety of things to keep sight in one of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Helps my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Helpful in the treatment of dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I have taken BioTears for three years because of dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> My ophthamologist recommended this product for my dry eye condition.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my eye doctor to help with dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have moderately dry eyes with periods of extremely dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BioTears since 2003 when I was suffering from dry eye after lasik eye surgery.  </li>
            <li> I went on line to search for a product for dry eye and ran across BioTears and after reading some of the testimonials, I decided to order it.  </li>
            <li> It does comfort my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> No longer am I constantly wiping my face from tears rolling down my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Living in our dry SoCal climate and wearing contacts probably doesn&#x27;t help!  </li>
            <li> and I took only 2 per day which was half of the recommended dose...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, and it took me years to finally try these.  </li>
            <li> My husband has very dry eyes</li>
            <li> I have to use Bio Tears Gel Caps because I have very dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogrens disease which causes very dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes and have had cataract surgery in both.  </li>
            <li> 10% lacteferrin have not helped at all.&lt;br /&gt;The other items in the gel tab are gotten in other vitamins, flaxseed and multi vitamins</li>
            <li> had bought this product to compare and to see what all the hype was about, but at the end of the day I found the other product</li>
            <li> My Dr. recommended them and at first I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I was using eye drops and having trouble with dry eye.  </li>
            <li> No more dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Bio Tears was the answer for me -- no more eye drops or dry eye problems.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will also conclude that I am not hired by anyone for this review, I&#x27;m just a customer who is desperate like any other dry eye customer to find eye relief and a normal quality of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She convinced me to try Bio Tears for a few months before giving up on any remedy.  </li>
            <li> No more scratchy eyes.</li>
            <li> I did not want to use the rx drops because they had caused me some problems in the past.  </li>
            <li> I think there expensive and only have</li>
            <li> I cant say I have done quite as well as some as tried cutting back to two a day and found couldnt do that.  </li>
            <li> dye eyes, no more!</li>
            <li> Maybe my case was worse than some.  </li>
            <li> Gradually I noticed I wasn&#x27;t needing to use artificial tears as often as in the past.  </li>
            <li> but this was overkill and uncomfortable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My eyes are greatly improved. My ophthalmologist is equally as pleased! No more dry eyes. No more scratchy eyes. Able to see without constantly rubbing my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was using eye drops and having trouble with dry eye.  Bio Tears was the answer for me -- no more eye drops or dry eye problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for four months.  I can tell a huge difference in how my eyes feel.  Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery as usual from Amazon.  My husband has very dry eyes and this is the only supplement that works to give him any relief.  Will continue to keep order it as long as they stock it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I have mild dry eye in combination with incomplete lid closure while sleeping. My eye surgeon suggested that the latter can be treated with a minor procedure but I must improve my tear film before I&#x27;ll see considerable improvement. I felt relief within the first several days of taking this supplement and have cut down my drop usage by 50%. I think I&#x27;ll continue to reap better results over time, as it seems to take several weeks for the full benefit to kick in. I took straight omega 3-6-9 fish oil before taking BioTears and I&#x27;m getting better results from the BioTears formulation.</li>
            <li> Having dry eyes, this product is great for travel..easy to use and it works!  Use it with the drops and you have it made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking BioTears for several months now, to help my very dry eyes.  Gradually I noticed I wasn&#x27;t needing to use artificial tears as often as in the past.  I&#x27;ll keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I have to use Bio Tears Gel Caps because I have very dry eyes. You can&#x27;t find them in local pharmacies. I went on-line to Amazon and found I could get them cheaper even with shipping. Product has always arrived promptly and packaged securely.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogrens disease which causes very dry eyes.  I did not want to use the rx drops because they had caused me some problems in the past.  My eye specialist recommended these and he sells them in his office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think there expensive and only have 10% lacteferrin have not helped at all.&lt;br /&gt;The other items in the gel tab are gotten in other vitamins, flaxseed and multi vitamins</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Keeps my eyes from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li> After taking these...and I took only 2 per day which was half of the recommended dose...i thought I was having an allergic response because my eyes became extremely sensitive and I was tearing copiously. Yes, I have dry eyes but this was overkill and uncomfortable. My opthalmologist had recommended them.</li>
            <li> As usual the product arrived very quickly. I order this regularly and am never disappointed by anything I get through Amazon. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband had a bone marrow transplant for leukemia in 2001; he has severe dry eye as a result. He&#x27;s had procedures and tests galore, and these are THE BEST thing that he has tried. We never run out--they are that important to his health and sanity. It is a shame that the Fred Hutchison Cancer Institute and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance do not feel that they can endorse products, because this is a LIFE-CHANGING product if you have had a bone marrow transplant. If I owned Biotears, I would tie my ads to the SCCA Facebook page and get print ads in the Seattle Times.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because an eye doctor I had years ago recommended it.  Of course, I only took it  for a month or so back then and I did notice quite a difference. Now I&#x27;m having real issues with dry eyes and trying to play catch up.  I believe it does work, but my eyes are so dry that I have to use a variety of things to keep sight in one of my eyes.  I suppose I should stop taking it to see if I notice any difference.  I don&#x27;t think it hurts anything to take it.</li>
            <li> My wife was developing issues in her eyes because of lack of tears.  The doctor suggested a surgical procedure on the tear duct or the Bio Tears.  We choose the latter.  Problem seems to be solved.</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says it does</li>
            <li> Recommended by my ophthalmologist.. dye eyes, no more!</li>
            <li> Did not help me, but maybe it helps others.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different eye drops and restasis.  these really work! I felt and saw the difference within weeks!</li>
            <li> Very useful. Helps my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not like the ones I get from the Dr.s office. These seem to go right thru you, if you know what I mean?</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my ophthalmologist and cornea specialist. Do not bother the stomach and no taste.</li>
            <li> Helpful in the treatment of dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product for a family member.  Very satisfied with the product.  Fast delivery, thanks to Amazon!</li>
            <li> Good for you and helps to eliminate crusty eyes in the morning. I would buy again just for health benefits.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell how effective it is right now. I have used the product in the past and found it very helpful.</li>
            <li> I was trying to compare different supplements for my dry eye condition caused by my inefficient meibomian glands. These glands are helped by finding the right supplement for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared BioTears to my original Thera tears supplements and I found it to work somewhat ok when I was consistent with the regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is almost double the cost of the Thera tears and I have noticed that it causes obvious diarrhea and more belching of fishy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also harder for me to make sure to take it twice a day with meals when I know my thera tears was only once daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought this product to compare and to see what all the hype was about, but at the end of the day I found the other product more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also conclude that I am not hired by anyone for this review, I&#x27;m just a customer who is desperate like any other dry eye customer to find eye relief and a normal quality of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now everyone may find different responses from this product and possibly different side effects, so I can&#x27;t say not to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bio Tears for one month and I can tell some improvement when I go on my daily walks.  No longer am I constantly wiping my face from tears rolling down my cheeks.  A close friend has used this product and has had great results.  She convinced me to try Bio Tears for a few months before giving up on any remedy.  I will continue using this product for several months because I have seen some improvement.</li>
            <li> I have taken BioTears for three years because of dry eyes.  My Dr. recommended them and at first I was skeptical but I am a believer now.  I got results with in two weeks.  I have since found (for me) I can cut back to 2 capsules a day and get good results.  They are $34.95 from the vitamin companies.</li>
            <li> These capsules were recommended by my eye doctor, and they really work fast.  I&#x27;ve worn contacts for 35 years, and I used to go through gallons of lubricating eye drops, especially as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  Taking Bio Tears works better and faster than eye drops.  I take 2 capsules twice daily, and I can really feel a difference when I don&#x27;t take them.  I was skeptical at first, and it took me years to finally try these.  Don&#x27;t wait that long.  Get them now.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking it for a month and notice no difference in my eyes - I think it&#x27;s probably like all products that say &#x27;we are good for you&#x27; - it&#x27;s iffy.</li>
            <li> My ophthamologist recommended this product for my dry eye condition. After about one week, I can tell the difference in the quality of my tears. I live in the desert, so my eyes dry out particularly fast, and this supplement helps keep my eyes hydrated. But it only really works if I take the recommended daily dosage, two capsules twice daily, which gets expensive, since one bottle is only one month&#x27;s supply.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle the the fishy after taste. Will keep and give it another try in a month or so.</li>
            <li> I have been taking 4 pills a day and is pretty much taking care of my not having to use the drops.  I cant say I have done quite as well as some as tried cutting back to two a day and found couldnt do that.  My eyes got grainey again.  But the 4 a day is working pretty well.  Maybe my case was worse than some.  I have been taking for going on my third week now and have used no drops , which is wonderful.  Maybe in time can cut back some but not yet anyway.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my eye doctor to help with dry eyes.  I am off Restasis and taking BioTears daily. And I only have to use over the counter generic drops 2x daily!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I developed a severe dry eye condition.  Living in our dry SoCal climate and wearing contacts probably doesn&#x27;t help!  I was using eyedrops all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ophalomologist recommended trying Bio Tears as a supplement.  The recommended dosage of 4 tabs/a day produced too much bodily moisture and I was actually slobbering a bit!  I cut back gradually and now take only one tablet a day!  It is wonderful!  I haven&#x27;t bought a bottle of eyedrops in years!  My eyes are scratch free and feel great even in low humidity and windy weather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it keep my eyes well lubricated, but the dry skin on my heels has almost disappeared! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have moderately dry eyes with periods of extremely dry eyes. My Dr recommended this in addition to daily steroid drops, Systane balance, some other drops, oh and hot compresses. Who has time for all of that? I was faithful with the BioTears, ok with some of the drops, and a big fail with the compresses.  Even when I just do the BioTears alone I have had good success. I have not tried any other brand although the lower price has been appealing. I am sticking with this because it works.</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes and have had cataract surgery in both.  I hoped this product would work, but I can&#x27;t see any difference.  I went back to my eye drops</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BioTears since 2003 when I was suffering from dry eye after lasik eye surgery.  I was using moisture eye drops 10 to 12 times a day.  I went on line to search for a product for dry eye and ran across BioTears and after reading some of the testimonials, I decided to order it.  I started out taking 4 caps in the morning and 2 in the afternoon, then gradually went to taking 2 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon.  Now I only have to take 1 in the morning and I&#x27;m good all day and all night.  I no longer need to use moisture drops because BioTears works good at keeping my eyes moist.  I love this stuff and I hope they never stop making it.  Once I skipped a day and I could feel the difference in my eye&#x27;s moisture.  So I make sure to never miss.</li>
            <li> I have been using this produce for years.  It does comfort my dry eyes.  I will continue to buy it as long as it helps.</li>
            <li> Best solution after 6 weeks of daily dose (4).</li>
