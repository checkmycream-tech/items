            <li>Adorable!</li>
            <li>smells kind on like the smokey smell you&#x27;d find in a Nepalese restaurant or any restaurant with a wood fired oven for that matter.  </li>
            <li>We liked it.  </li>
            <li>kind of flimsy made.</li>
            <li>We have not seen it in years and decided to try and find it, We have used it many times now and love it !</li>
            <li>its cute and it does work</li>

            <li>I may buy some more of these.</li>
            <li>and I rate these Fir Balsam Incense Logs as the most pleasing.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I treated myself to this item.</li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>We all love the fir balsam incense logs that come with the cabin....</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smoke from the chimney.</li>
            <li>Watching the smoke come out of the chimney is smoothing and relaxing, people will love this cabin at parties.</li>
            <li>Cute, but doesn&#x27;t smell like balsam.</li>
            <li>Very cute wooden house accompanied with a great smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic and so homey and cheerful!</li>
            <li>Also, it goes out easily.</li>
            <li>I think both versions have a beautiful aroma personally.</li>
            <li>Comes seem to burn too quick and are not as scent filled as I remember, but then again that was 40 years ago!  </li>
            <li>I did enjoy using this over the Christmas season.&lt;br /&gt;Logs</li>
            <li>They are imposable to light.</li>
            <li>but i would recommend ordering more right away because you will be amused by this rustic little cabin as it fills your house with a great cedar campfire smell!</li>
            <li>The great smelling incense burns a long time.</li>
            <li>This cabin is just like the original ones from the 1970s, bought one for myself and my mother</li>
            <li>Overpriced for what it is (from a strictly non-sentimental stand point), but you can&#x27;t buy these things where I live now, and can you really put a price on reliving awesome New England childhood memories?  </li>
            <li>and I was pleased to find it as an adult to be able to show my kids.  </li>
            <li>The incense that came with it though smelled a bit too close to pot, and living in a apt complex that just doesn&#x27;t fly.</li>
            <li>we all love it so much.</li>
            <li>It smells like sweet Balsam Fir in the fireplace.  </li>
            <li>This is sweet Balsam Fir, but is the wood smell from burning, not like a wreath on the door.</li>
            <li>and I always enjoyed the Paine&#x27;s incense, without really realizing they&#x27;d been around for decades.  </li>
            <li>Pretty great little cabin thing, its really adorable.</li>
            <li>Its pretty strange because I&#x27;ve built plenty of camp fires with Fir logs and thought it&#x27;d be great.</li>
            <li>My whole family, including my Mom, not only loves the cabin with the little smoking chimney,  but also finds the sweet, balsam smoke incredibly enjoyable and perfect for Christmas time and Winter!</li>
            <li>and it is already worth the money(which</li>
            <li>A while back my husband mentioned that he had one of these years ago when he lived in Maine, and wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to have one again?</li>
            <li>My grandson liked the cabin but the pine-scented logs were too gross to burn in the house; he tossed them.</li>
            <li>The smoke coming out of the chimney just makes me smile.</li>
            <li>Either get a better photographer or don&#x27;t put out such cheap items at a price that is obscene.</li>
            <li>Brings back memories when these were really popular when I was growing up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a real pain to try to find the right incense to fit the cabins holders.</li>
            <li>The build quality is very good for this price and looks like it will last long.  </li>
            <li>That Fir Balsam smell is unmistakeable, it&#x27;s pitched just right, without a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not secured at all, it comes right out if you wiggle the incense stick in.</li>
            <li>Everyone is right -- you can&#x27;t light these logs with a match or cigarette lighter -- you need a steady flame, so my husband uses one of those electric grill lighters.</li>
            <li>This is a great little addition during the winter months!  </li>
            <li>Very cute and everything I  expected it to be</li>
            <li>so I will order the other cones they fit better</li>
            <li>Charming Little</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be smaller than I thought, but it&#x27;s appropriately sized.</li>
            <li>and I am sure my senses are not the same.</li>
            <li>They fall over and when they do you have a hot burning ember in contact with the inside wood lid which I consider a fire hazard.</li>
            <li>The smoke coming out of the chimney never fails to enchant me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought is as a present to myself.</li>
            <li>Thanks again !</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more Paine&#x27;s Fir Balsam Incense Logs when I use up the 10 that came with the cabin.</li>
            <li>The quality was better back then.  </li>
            <li>they smell like wood burning in the country on a crisp autumn day.  </li>
            <li>was excited to find this little cabin that reminded me of my daughter&#x27;s and my favorite place in the world-Our cabin in the woods.</li>
            <li>Love this little cabin, and it&#x27;s made out of real wood which absorbs some of the smoke, so you don&#x27;t even need to light up incense all the time, the wood aroma surrounds the room by itself.</li>
            <li>This is a good stocking stuffer around this time of year, or just regular gift as it is just plain cool.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The incense ashes stay inside the burner and the smell is very aromatic.</li>
            <li>It gave my fire-obsessed nephew, &amp;#34;Sparky,&amp;#34; something else to light other than the logs in the fireplace, although safety first, etc.  </li>
            <li>(make sure the whole ring glows red without gaps) and not a single one has stopped burning before it was completely done.</li>
            <li>Came as expected, not able to fit any incense but cones and the kind it comes with, however.</li>
            <li>My favorite burner..Makes the apartment smell like a little wood cabin</li>
            <li>little cabin did not catch on fire.  : )</li>
            <li>I love this little cabin.</li>
            <li>I totally love this little cabin.</li>
            <li>The little cabin is really cute and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Ordered an exter pack, seems to work a just little better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well constructed and fits nearly any ambience.</li>
            <li>She was elated with her new Paines Cabin</li>
            <li>Well made, and cute, but didn&#x27;t really work, at least not with the sample incense that was included.</li>
            <li>Cute and small.</li>
            <li>Instructions included say to let the yellow flame burn on the tip for a period of time before blowing the flame out so as to get the ember hot.</li>
            <li>The little wooden cabin is well made, I like it, but please make it safe and make it functional.</li>
            <li>The incense it comes with smells like logs on an open fire, like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Must be old or moist.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble lighting them with a lighter or my gas stove</li>
            <li>I have no trouble putting the lit incense into the cabin</li>
            <li>Purchased this for a christmas gift for my 92 year old mother.  </li>
            <li>Old memories are fond memories.</li>
            <li>and I frequently get rave comments on it.  </li>
            <li>Secure the metal ring with glue or small rivets -- please finish the product before you put it on the market for sale.</li>
            <li>Now to just find a good incense to burn in this; the Fir Balsam cones are a major disappointment.</li>
            <li>but I liked to know why you advertise that it can work in fake fireplaces</li>
            <li>Back then they only cost .39cents, but it was nostalgic .. good item and works well..</li>
            <li>I think the trouble might be is that some might be used to the smell of fresh needles or the oil in candles-which I adore too, but that&#x27;s not whst</li>
            <li>but when you receive it it says not to and the cones do not fit right</li>
            <li>At one time you would walk into certain department stores around Christmas and all you could smell in the Christmas area was these little burners.</li>
            <li>Upon ordering both the sticks and the &amp;#34;Cabin&amp;#34; I found the refill sticks to be half the diameter of the original sticks included with the cabin iteself so the little sticks won&#x27;t stay upright once lit.</li>

            <li> Old memories are fond memories.</li>
            <li> and I frequently get rave comments on it.  </li>
            <li> Secure the metal ring with glue or small rivets -- please finish the product before you put it on the market for sale.</li>
            <li> Now to just find a good incense to burn in this; the Fir Balsam cones are a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> but I liked to know why you advertise that it can work in fake fireplaces</li>
            <li> Back then they only cost .39cents, but it was nostalgic .. good item and works well..</li>
            <li> I think the trouble might be is that some might be used to the smell of fresh needles or the oil in candles-which I adore too, but that&#x27;s not whst</li>
            <li> but when you receive it it says not to and the cones do not fit right</li>
            <li> At one time you would walk into certain department stores around Christmas and all you could smell in the Christmas area was these little burners.</li>
            <li> Upon ordering both the sticks and the &amp;#34;Cabin&amp;#34; I found the refill sticks to be half the diameter of the original sticks included with the cabin iteself so the little sticks won&#x27;t stay upright once lit.</li>
            <li> When I was young my father and had the same looking little wooden cabin and every Christmas we would bring it out and it just helped bring in the Holiday spirit !</li>
            <li> By the way, the incense sticks that were included with the little Cabin were as poorly made as the refills and they would cease to burn after only a minute or two leaving 90% or more of the incense stick.</li>
            <li> After about half the first piece of incense burned, we dumped it down the sink -</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure why the person behind &amp;#34;Paine&#x27;s&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t go the extra bit of effort to make sure the heart of the product was sturdy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m forced to type a certain amount of words to leave feedback.</li>
            <li> The incense is difficult to light and keep lit.</li>
            <li> The incense was difficult to light and smelled nothing like fir -</li>
            <li> The balsam insence it a bit difficult to light.</li>
            <li> well maybe a smoky back drafting fireplace burning wet fir logs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine a long time</li>
            <li> It comes with 10 cedar long incense sticks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a very long time since May 29, 2015 because now it&#x27;s September 1 of 2017, and I&#x27;m still waiting for that improved replacement - so the review stands.  </li>
            <li> We received this will a roof rafter loose and separated.</li>
            <li> No worries, the incense sticks won&#x27;t stay lit long enough to ignite the little &amp;#34;Cabin&amp;#34; so all is well.</li>
            <li> now our whole house smells like a fireplace - and not a pleasant one at that.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I spent roughly $20 on this and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Lit the little incense log, stuck it vertical in the center hole inside, installed the lid  </li>
            <li> Packaging was shoddy and roof fell apart, but I superglued it back together.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this little cabin for about 1 day</li>
            <li> My Mom had one of these when I was little.  </li>
            <li> The little house is just like I remember from my childhood.</li>
            <li> She had one of these for years and misplaced it.  </li>
            <li> It is quite small, but it&#x27;s neat.</li>
            <li> But, as I remember with my mother&#x27;s, the incense had a hard time staying lit.</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> There is a small hole drilled into the center of the base of the &amp;#34;cabin&amp;#34; and a steel ring dropped in to hold the stick.</li>
            <li> It smelled awful, very musty and it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> waist your money on this poor representation of what it was when you perhaps were a child.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, I will give it to my sister as a gift as a memory of when we were children.  </li>
            <li> I had to get it for him as a nostalgic reminder of our childhood.</li>

            <li> My favorite burner..Makes the apartment smell like a little wood cabin</li>
            <li> I have owned this little cabin for about 1 day and it is already worth the money(which is a good price).  The build quality is very good for this price and looks like it will last long.  The incense it comes with smells like logs on an open fire, like the real thing.  They come i cone shape, count of 10, and sit on a square block inside the house, for burning.  This is a good stocking stuffer around this time of year, or just regular gift as it is just plain cool.  5/5</li>
            <li> Only  burner to buy!!!</li>
            <li> It smelled awful, very musty and it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> Came as expected, not able to fit any incense but cones and the kind it comes with, however.</li>
            <li> Very cute and everything I  expected it to be</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a real pain to try to find the right incense to fit the cabins holders.I have 4 cabins and they all use different size incense. Also the scents are not the same either. there is no quality control with this product and its accessories</li>
            <li> Overpriced for what it is (from a strictly non-sentimental stand point), but you can&#x27;t buy these things where I live now, and can you really put a price on reliving awesome New England childhood memories?  I think not...</li>
            <li> its cute and it does work but I liked to know why you advertise that it can work in fake fireplaces but when you receive it it says not to and the cones do not fit right had to use a different cone so I will order the other cones they fit better</li>
            <li> Lit the little incense log, stuck it vertical in the center hole inside, installed the lid  and it burned all the way.&lt;br /&gt;Incense smells kind on like the smokey smell you&#x27;d find in a Nepalese restaurant or any restaurant with a wood fired oven for that matter.  Very pleasant, not perfumey.  We liked it.  We bought the pack of 72 extra logs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little cabin did not catch on fire.  : )</li>
            <li> Now to just find a good incense to burn in this; the Fir Balsam cones are a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> Big hit with the children, although it took us a while to catch on (pun wasn&#x27;t intended, but, oh, my it works).  It gave my fire-obsessed nephew, &amp;#34;Sparky,&amp;#34; something else to light other than the logs in the fireplace, although safety first, etc.  He was so successful, however, I found myself coughing from the incense.  Beware if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> A while back my husband mentioned that he had one of these years ago when he lived in Maine, and wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to have one again? I filed that info away, and when his birthday came around, I ordered this for him. It is quite small, but it&#x27;s neat. It comes with 10 incense logs, and you can order more separately. Everyone is right -- you can&#x27;t light these logs with a match or cigarette lighter -- you need a steady flame, so my husband uses one of those electric grill lighters. You could use a gas stove, too, I suppose. That Fir Balsam smell is unmistakeable, it&#x27;s pitched just right, without a hint of sweetness. Not one of those &amp;#34;Holiday Kitchen&amp;#34; scents, but a suggestion of what it&#x27;s like out there in the woods of Maine. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I thought it was going to be smaller than I thought, but it&#x27;s appropriately sized. Love this little cabin, and it&#x27;s made out of real wood which absorbs some of the smoke, so you don&#x27;t even need to light up incense all the time, the wood aroma surrounds the room by itself. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Cute and small. Just didn&#x27;t like the scent of the incense. Well made. Can always purchase different incense elsewhere. No problems otherwise.</li>
            <li> Got a boot out of it. When I was a kid my mother always had one for the holidays. Back then they only cost .39cents, but it was nostalgic .. good item and works well..</li>
            <li> We received this will a roof rafter loose and separated. The tack were in place but not in the rafter. The incense is difficult to light and keep lit. Must be old or moist.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waist your money on this poor representation of what it was when you perhaps were a child.</li>
            <li> I remember smelling these in Woolworths in downtown Chicago at Christmas time.I wanted to try to duplicate those memories.&lt;br /&gt;Well, things never seem the same, but these came close at times. The scent does not duplicate what I remember, but then it has been many years ago and I am sure my senses are not the same. I did enjoy using this over the Christmas season.&lt;br /&gt;Logs are difficult to get started.</li>
            <li> This was a good price, and it came with some balsm fir incense which is always good.  Paines is the way to go for the christmas time incense.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the logs. They are imposable to light. Sorry I wasted my money. The cabin is cute tho.</li>
            <li> I love this little cabin. I just wish it was easier to get the incense to stand upright and stay upright. Also, it goes out easily. But once you get it burning good, it&#x27;s great!! I&#x27;ll be getting another one for a gift to give to someone who loved it.</li>
            <li> My grandson liked the cabin but the pine-scented logs were too gross to burn in the house; he tossed them.</li>
            <li> Paine&#x27;s Balsam Fir Incense &amp;#34;Refill&amp;#34; sticks are a pain. They won&#x27;t stay lit. Instructions included say to let the yellow flame burn on the tip for a period of time before blowing the flame out so as to get the ember hot. The problem is that the ember burns for a few minutes and then goes cold and dies. No matter what you do, these refill sticks won&#x27;t stay lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, these are supposed to be refill sticks for the Paine&#x27;s incense &amp;#34;Cabin&amp;#34; but I must be mistaken. Upon ordering both the sticks and the &amp;#34;Cabin&amp;#34; I found the refill sticks to be half the diameter of the original sticks included with the cabin iteself so the little sticks won&#x27;t stay upright once lit. They fall over and when they do you have a hot burning ember in contact with the inside wood lid which I consider a fire hazard. By the way, the incense sticks that were included with the little Cabin were as poorly made as the refills and they would cease to burn after only a minute or two leaving 90% or more of the incense stick. There is a small hole drilled into the center of the base of the &amp;#34;cabin&amp;#34; and a steel ring dropped in to hold the stick. It&#x27;s not secured at all, it comes right out if you wiggle the incense stick in. Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure why the person behind &amp;#34;Paine&#x27;s&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t go the extra bit of effort to make sure the heart of the product was sturdy. This is a fire hazard -- don&#x27;t leave the room! No worries, the incense sticks won&#x27;t stay lit long enough to ignite the little &amp;#34;Cabin&amp;#34; so all is well. Seriously, I spent roughly $20 on this and it doesn&#x27;t work. The little wooden cabin is well made, I like it, but please make it safe and make it functional. Secure the metal ring with glue or small rivets -- please finish the product before you put it on the market for sale. Once that&#x27;s done, send me another one and I&#x27;ll delete this review and start fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE**  It&#x27;s been a very long time since May 29, 2015 because now it&#x27;s September 1 of 2017, and I&#x27;m still waiting for that improved replacement - so the review stands.  tick .. tick.. tick ..1 of 2017, and I&#x27;m still waiting for that improved replacement - so the review stands.  tick .. tick.. tick ..</li>
            <li> Charming Little Cabin!&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to find this little cabin that reminded me of my daughter&#x27;s and my favorite place in the world-Our cabin in the woods. I bought it and the 72 refill pack of Balsam Fir incense and was even more thrilled when it arrived! My whole family, including my Mom, not only loves the cabin with the little smoking chimney,  but also finds the sweet, balsam smoke incredibly enjoyable and perfect for Christmas time and Winter! I have had no trouble lighting them with a lighter or my gas stove (make sure the whole ring glows red without gaps) and not a single one has stopped burning before it was completely done. I have no trouble putting the lit incense into the cabin and we&#x27;ve burned 4 to 5 a day since it arrived we all love it so much. It does NOT smell of cigarettes or Marijuana in the slightest! It smells like sweet Balsam Fir in the fireplace.  Absolutely fantastic and so homey and cheerful! I think the trouble might be is that some might be used to the smell of fresh needles or the oil in candles-which I adore too, but that&#x27;s not whst this is. This is sweet Balsam Fir, but is the wood smell from burning, not like a wreath on the door. I think both versions have a beautiful aroma personally.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a christmas gift for my 92 year old mother.  She had one of these for years and misplaced it.  She was elated with her new Paines Cabin</li>
            <li> My parents had this when I was a kid and I was pleased to find it as an adult to be able to show my kids.  The smell is wonderful and the smoke comes out of the fireplace!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my mother had one 30 years ago, and I loved the scent. But, as I remember with my mother&#x27;s, the incense had a hard time staying lit. I think it is because it does not receive enough oxygen. Well made, and cute, but didn&#x27;t really work, at least not with the sample incense that was included.</li>
            <li> My Mom had one of these when I was little.  The scent of the incense takes me back 50 years.</li>
            <li> The incense was difficult to light and smelled nothing like fir - well maybe a smoky back drafting fireplace burning wet fir logs.  After about half the first piece of incense burned, we dumped it down the sink - now our whole house smells like a fireplace - and not a pleasant one at that.  Doubt I will ever burn another piece of incense.</li>
            <li> Pretty great little cabin thing, its really adorable. The incense that came with it though smelled a bit too close to pot, and living in a apt complex that just doesn&#x27;t fly. I had some cedar logs from another purchase that worked well though. Its pretty strange because I&#x27;ve built plenty of camp fires with Fir logs and thought it&#x27;d be great. In any case I definitely bought it for the cabin.</li>
            <li> Packaging was shoddy and roof fell apart, but I superglued it back together.  Love it regardless!</li>
            <li> I totally love this little cabin. It is so whimsical. The smoke coming out of the chimney never fails to enchant me. I&#x27;m so glad I bought is as a present to myself. My children love it too.</li>
            <li> When I was young my father and had the same looking little wooden cabin and every Christmas we would bring it out and it just helped bring in the Holiday spirit ! We have not seen it in years and decided to try and find it, We have used it many times now and love it ! Thanks again !</li>
            <li> This is a great little addition during the winter months!  I definitely reccommend this product! I think it&#x27;s silly I&#x27;m forced to type a certain amount of words to leave feedback.</li>
            <li> This would be a perfect gift. The great smelling incense burns a long time. I may buy some more of these.</li>
            <li> kind of flimsy made. The insence kept going out</li>
            <li> I have tried several types of pine incense and I rate these Fir Balsam Incense Logs as the most pleasing. The little cabin is really cute and sturdy. The smoke coming out of the chimney just makes me smile. I am glad that I treated myself to this item. I will definitely be getting more Paine&#x27;s Fir Balsam Incense Logs when I use up the 10 that came with the cabin.</li>
            <li> It was not as I remembered it as a child.  I remember the color being somewhat darker - not red.  The quality was better back then.  I bought one for my sister also.  I just cannot see $13.65 for something so amatuerish-like made.  They aren&#x27;t even logs.  They don&#x27;t look anything like the picture.  Unfortunately, I will give it to my sister as a gift as a memory of when we were children.  But it was a very poor comparison to the way they were made.  Quality was next to nothing.  I will not be proud giving this to her, but hopefully our memories will be the way they are supposed to be.  Either get a better photographer or don&#x27;t put out such cheap items at a price that is obscene.</li>
            <li> My brother and I grew up with a log cabin burner as part of our family Christmas. I had to get it for him as a nostalgic reminder of our childhood. At one time you would walk into certain department stores around Christmas and all you could smell in the Christmas area was these little burners. Old memories are fond memories.</li>
            <li> i love it.  Makes me think i was in the mountains smelling fir trees nestled in a log cabin. The log cabin incense burner wrks great and the incense is top quality</li>
            <li> This incense burner was a gift and it worked out great! The incense ashes stay inside the burner and the smell is very aromatic.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories when these were really popular when I was growing up. Seems like everyone had one.  Comes seem to burn too quick and are not as scent filled as I remember, but then again that was 40 years ago!  Nothing is quite the same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine a long time and I frequently get rave comments on it.  I ended up purchasing another one as a gift for a friend of mine.  We all love the fir balsam incense logs that come with the cabin....they smell like wood burning in the country on a crisp autumn day.  Heavenly!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very cute wooden house accompanied with a great smelling fragrance. Love the smoke from the chimney.</li>
            <li> This cabin is just like the original ones from the 1970s, bought one for myself and my mother and she loves it. It comes with 10 cedar long incense sticks but i would recommend ordering more right away because you will be amused by this rustic little cabin as it fills your house with a great cedar campfire smell! Watching the smoke come out of the chimney is smoothing and relaxing, people will love this cabin at parties. I would recommend this to anyone who loves incense and cabins.</li>
            <li> The little house is just like I remember from my childhood. Perfect. The balsam insence it a bit difficult to light. Often goes out. Ordered an exter pack, seems to work a just little better.</li>
            <li> My parents had one of these during my younger years and I always enjoyed the Paine&#x27;s incense, without really realizing they&#x27;d been around for decades.  It&#x27;s very well constructed and fits nearly any ambience.</li>
            <li> Great throwback to my childhood. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Adorable! Works great.</li>
            <li> Cute, but doesn&#x27;t smell like balsam.</li>
