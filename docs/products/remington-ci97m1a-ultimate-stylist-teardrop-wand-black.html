            <li>The glove is especially handy to keep your hands and face from burning.</li>
            <li>but once you are used to it, it works great!</li>
            <li>The quality seems to be very good.  </li>
            <li>Remington hair products are great</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>so it works great.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to this, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked great</li>
            <li>and it turned out to be fairly time consuming.  </li>
            <li>had a swivel cord that is always good when working on hair.</li>
            <li>in all a nice hair tool.  </li>
            <li>it would be nice if they would include the interchangeable wands instead of encouraging us to \\&quot;collect all 3\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Adjustable temperature would be nice as well.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, nice results.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great for different types of curls and with a good hairspray (and weather!)</li>
            <li>I love this curler.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this curler!</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of touching it one day</li>
            <li>the style holds most of the day.</li>
            <li>Maybe a more skilled person than me would get better results.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve become much more adjusted to using it</li>
            <li>Make sure you know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Author of \\&quot;1106 Grand Boulevard\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Quick to warm up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many hot tools and this was the first time I have ever experienced this.</li>
            <li>So it was easy for me to decide to pick up this teardrop iron.</li>
            <li>and it does not tangle easily.</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve been using a cone-shaped styling&lt;br /&gt;wand, which gives me what I like to call beautiful &amp;#34;mermaid hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;interchangeable barrels&#x27;,  on the box and in the fine print in the&lt;br /&gt;instructions</li>
            <li>This is a huge drawback.</li>
            <li>A glove is included to help with the wrapping of the hair, since there is not a clip or anything to help secure the hair.  </li>
            <li>Long, straight to wavy, smooth hair would be best.  </li>
            <li>This product does make beautiful, loose beachy-style waves.</li>
            <li>Stick with a large curling iron with a clamp, or go with a wand that is tapered at the top so it is easier to wrap your hair around, and slide it off.</li>
            <li>Good buy overall.</li>
            <li>But it is fairly inexpensive, and if you have a moderate amount of dexterity may give you the hairstyle you&#x27;re aiming for.</li>
            <li>(might be true to all wands)</li>
            <li>So maybe, if your hair is much longer, you might have a better experience.  </li>
            <li>ultimate stylist teardrop wand has found a happy home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Remington, for constantly updating your popular line of styling</li>
            <li>My daughter is very proficient with the &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; style curling wand, but she wanted to create more &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; waves.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but make sure you&#x27;re a long-haired person who&#x27;s used to curling wands (or wants to get used to them) before buying.</li>
            <li>At first, it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers, but with practice, you will learn to leave the ends just off the iron to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, makes big waves, heating glove helps in styling (your hands are safe don&#x27;t get burnt or hot), wife liked the product, uses it.</li>
            <li>This one is not, and it got so hot that I feared it would burn up my fine</li>
            <li>I believe that different hair types need different temperature settings for best results.</li>
            <li>It does heat up quickly, and is very hot.  </li>
            <li>This is a ceramic wand and my girls tell me it gets very hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me a good, long while to adapt to using it.</li>
            <li>and I love my new hair-style.</li>
            <li>If the first one isn&#x27;t right, a different barrel might be better, but who is going to spend more money to find out?  </li>
            <li>This is a great little wand made by Remington.</li>
            <li>The only thing we didn&#x27;t like was that it does not have any kind of clamp to hold the hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder-blade length and left to its own devices, quite curly.  </li>
            <li>Not being accustomed to this kind of styling aid, my \\&quot;wavy curls\\&quot; did not all go the same direction.  </li>
            <li>Still stuck with the problem of my own curls being curlier, so these actually looked straightened.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a fun way to curl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always loved Remington products, but I feel like their new products are more for professional stylists, rather than daily home use.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the 45 second video demo showing you how easy it is and how quickly it turns out pretty.</li>
            <li>Not hard, and available on even the cheapest curling irons.  </li>
            <li>The hair does look more natural immediately and she does not have to spend so much time brushing it out.  </li>
            <li>This is a good option for the money and it will make a good traveling product because she won&#x27;t be distraught if it breaks in her suitcase.</li>
            <li>She said she isn&#x27;t sure the design really does much to help other than maybe shape the curls a bit more, but she is overall pleased with the product</li>
            <li>and I can tell you it gets hot.</li>
            <li>how hot I want the iron to get.</li>
            <li>Wife used it and this was and is her first wand.  </li>
            <li>The box talks about 2 more attachments with different shapes</li>
            <li>but you only get one - would not cost a lot more to include all three.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get the hair on to the barrel so that the different curls were not sticking out all over.  </li>
            <li>sometimes feels too hot, almost burning my skull</li>
            <li>Lacking instructions for first time users</li>
            <li>and I often straighten it and then use hot rollers or a curling iron to make it smooth and with a soft curl.</li>
            <li>She even watched several online videos to learn the technique better.  </li>
            <li>I still managed to burn myself the first time.</li>
            <li>When I first opened this I was hesitant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t my favorite curler, but it isn&#x27;t my least favorite either.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really use it because it just got too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an interchangeable-barreled wand before and liked the results, but the teardrop-shape is really unique, at least in my curling iron collection.  </li>
            <li>I may just need time to get more accustomed to this device but my flat iron was much easier to use.</li>
            <li>With this curler and some dry shampoo, I&#x27;ve been able to get curls</li>
            <li>but I tried a super affordable Remington wand out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>If you want something that is easy to use and will last, this might be the wand for you.</li>
            <li>First thing to note is that the little glove that&#x27;s meant to protect your other hand from burning doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li>This barrel produces lovely loose, beachy waves.</li>
            <li>I bought a slimmer curling wand a few years back and loved it so much I ended up buying 2 more of the exact same - one backup for myself and one for my step daughter.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really curl my hair how I like it too.  </li>
            <li>and frankly, it seems to me that storing any wands you bought would take almost as much space as just having another curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It makes fantastic and lasting curls.</li>
            <li>However, I found it very unwieldy to try to wrap, and hold my hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my 15 year-old daughter, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>product doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It really is just a curling iron with a swivel power</li>
            <li>I really like the style of this styling wand.  </li>
            <li>It does curl but it doesn&#x27;t create a nice look because the curls ar uneven when I do it.</li>
            <li>My hair is very short and I always see photos of young women with long, loose curls that I think are very attractive.</li>
            <li>It has a unique shape which produces nice waves instead of the standard round curls.  </li>
            <li>For reference, my daughter had long, fine, layered straight hair.</li>
            <li>have very long, fine hair and found that this product did not work well for me.  </li>
            <li>The first time was a complete joke.  </li>
            <li>Word of caution, use heat protector leave in conditioner on your hair before use-this has protective coating but better to be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>I like that you can just get the barrels you want, instead of having a bunch of barrels included in the package just to get one particular barrel you want.</li>
            <li>instructions were clear, but mostly covered the other</li>
            <li>Finally, there does not seem much chance of successfully using this on anything other than long hair.</li>
            <li>It might be a good product with a proper glove or other method to protect your hand, but the only they provided is just straight up insufficient.</li>
            <li>It had a protective outer sheath to protect your hand/face when you use it as well as a glove as it gets super hot, so be very careful</li>
            <li>Not your normal shaped curling iron rod.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s suppose to, but I just don&#x27;t like these new irons that require the use of a glove and having to hold your hair in place by hand.</li>
            <li>It is clipless you need to wrap your hair around the barrel carefully while wearing the special glove that come with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does heat to a pretty high temperature, and my wife is used to a salon quality flat iron and curling iron</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I am a big fan of Remington brand hot tools.</li>
            <li>and if I remember my Ray Bradbury correctly that is almost hot enough to ignite paper.  </li>
            <li>I think this particular barrel is for pretty long hair which I do not have.</li>
            <li>She has tried some VERY elaborate systems from Japan and Hong Kong but they always seemed to require a lot of work for results that lasted for less time than an average dinner party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife tried this wand out a few times over the past several weeks and offered very simple feedback - &amp;#34;It&#x27;s the best curling wand</li>
            <li>The product does get very hot and has only one temperature setting, but my daughter had not had a problem with her hair burning or being damaged by the product after several weeks of continuous use.</li>
            <li>It does whatever you need it to do as far as curls go</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m old-fashioned, but I find the old iron designs easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not likely to put out that much time and effort for passable hair.  </li>
            <li>With hair like that you could throw in a few of these waves and it would look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The glove is essential for me and the wand really heats quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This produces beach wave curls which are really neat and last a long time, when you use heat protective spray first of course.</li>
            <li>And that was with professional thermal protectants.</li>
            <li>which apparently is needed if you want to do some of the more complex hair styles out there.  </li>
            <li>If you are not quick at uncurling your hair from the wand, you will quickly smell your hair burning.  </li>
            <li>I also like that i can buy different shaped barrels to use on this particular iron.</li>
            <li>This tear-drop wand did neither, and the shape it left behind simply did not look good on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were no individual curlers to pre-heat, no multi-phase application and next to no waiting time before the wand was ready.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t think it was so much a product quality issue as this type of design may work for a limited percentage of people, and it just didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
            <li>My natural curl was curlier, so I couldn&#x27;t actually leave any of them undone</li>
            <li>I got this item for my wife, who has naturally curly red</li>
            <li>A big bonus to me is that the wand is thick enough so that by placing it close to my scalp when curling, I can get the necessary height on top.</li>
            <li>It takes much longer than some of the other curling products she owns.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any advantage to this product over a large curling iron, and certainly not over a traditional wand.  </li>
            <li>At first she burned her hand and her hair a little bit.  </li>
            <li>In the end I spent way more time than usual for a really strange looking hairstyle that ended up in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>Someone with thin fine hair and someone else with thicker heavier hair would use different heat settings.</li>

            <li> and I often straighten it and then use hot rollers or a curling iron to make it smooth and with a soft curl.</li>
            <li> She even watched several online videos to learn the technique better.  </li>
            <li> I still managed to burn myself the first time.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this I was hesitant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t my favorite curler, but it isn&#x27;t my least favorite either.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really use it because it just got too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an interchangeable-barreled wand before and liked the results, but the teardrop-shape is really unique, at least in my curling iron collection.  </li>
            <li> I may just need time to get more accustomed to this device but my flat iron was much easier to use.</li>
            <li> With this curler and some dry shampoo, I&#x27;ve been able to get curls</li>
            <li> but I tried a super affordable Remington wand out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> If you want something that is easy to use and will last, this might be the wand for you.</li>
            <li> First thing to note is that the little glove that&#x27;s meant to protect your other hand from burning doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li> This barrel produces lovely loose, beachy waves.</li>
            <li> I bought a slimmer curling wand a few years back and loved it so much I ended up buying 2 more of the exact same - one backup for myself and one for my step daughter.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really curl my hair how I like it too.  </li>
            <li> and frankly, it seems to me that storing any wands you bought would take almost as much space as just having another curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It makes fantastic and lasting curls.</li>
            <li> However, I found it very unwieldy to try to wrap, and hold my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 15 year-old daughter, and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It really is just a curling iron with a swivel power</li>
            <li> I really like the style of this styling wand.  </li>
            <li> It does curl but it doesn&#x27;t create a nice look because the curls ar uneven when I do it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very short and I always see photos of young women with long, loose curls that I think are very attractive.</li>
            <li> It has a unique shape which produces nice waves instead of the standard round curls.  </li>
            <li> For reference, my daughter had long, fine, layered straight hair.</li>
            <li> have very long, fine hair and found that this product did not work well for me.  </li>
            <li> The first time was a complete joke.  </li>
            <li> Word of caution, use heat protector leave in conditioner on your hair before use-this has protective coating but better to be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> I like that you can just get the barrels you want, instead of having a bunch of barrels included in the package just to get one particular barrel you want.</li>
            <li> instructions were clear, but mostly covered the other</li>
            <li> Finally, there does not seem much chance of successfully using this on anything other than long hair.</li>
            <li> It might be a good product with a proper glove or other method to protect your hand, but the only they provided is just straight up insufficient.</li>
            <li> It had a protective outer sheath to protect your hand/face when you use it as well as a glove as it gets super hot, so be very careful</li>
            <li> Not your normal shaped curling iron rod.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to, but I just don&#x27;t like these new irons that require the use of a glove and having to hold your hair in place by hand.</li>
            <li> It is clipless you need to wrap your hair around the barrel carefully while wearing the special glove that come with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does heat to a pretty high temperature, and my wife is used to a salon quality flat iron and curling iron</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a big fan of Remington brand hot tools.</li>
            <li> and if I remember my Ray Bradbury correctly that is almost hot enough to ignite paper.  </li>
            <li> I think this particular barrel is for pretty long hair which I do not have.</li>
            <li> She has tried some VERY elaborate systems from Japan and Hong Kong but they always seemed to require a lot of work for results that lasted for less time than an average dinner party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife tried this wand out a few times over the past several weeks and offered very simple feedback - &amp;#34;It&#x27;s the best curling wand</li>
            <li> The product does get very hot and has only one temperature setting, but my daughter had not had a problem with her hair burning or being damaged by the product after several weeks of continuous use.</li>
            <li> It does whatever you need it to do as far as curls go</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m old-fashioned, but I find the old iron designs easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not likely to put out that much time and effort for passable hair.  </li>
            <li> With hair like that you could throw in a few of these waves and it would look fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The glove is essential for me and the wand really heats quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This produces beach wave curls which are really neat and last a long time, when you use heat protective spray first of course.</li>
            <li> And that was with professional thermal protectants.</li>
            <li> which apparently is needed if you want to do some of the more complex hair styles out there.  </li>
            <li> If you are not quick at uncurling your hair from the wand, you will quickly smell your hair burning.  </li>
            <li> I also like that i can buy different shaped barrels to use on this particular iron.</li>
            <li> This tear-drop wand did neither, and the shape it left behind simply did not look good on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were no individual curlers to pre-heat, no multi-phase application and next to no waiting time before the wand was ready.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t think it was so much a product quality issue as this type of design may work for a limited percentage of people, and it just didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
            <li> My natural curl was curlier, so I couldn&#x27;t actually leave any of them undone</li>
            <li> I got this item for my wife, who has naturally curly red</li>
            <li> A big bonus to me is that the wand is thick enough so that by placing it close to my scalp when curling, I can get the necessary height on top.</li>
            <li> It takes much longer than some of the other curling products she owns.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any advantage to this product over a large curling iron, and certainly not over a traditional wand.  </li>
            <li> At first she burned her hand and her hair a little bit.  </li>
            <li> In the end I spent way more time than usual for a really strange looking hairstyle that ended up in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> Someone with thin fine hair and someone else with thicker heavier hair would use different heat settings.</li>
            <li> She was not able to achieve a nice wave due to the non-stick nature of the barrel and how hard it is to wrap the hair around it.  </li>
            <li> If you want curls or have extra long hair, there are additional attachments sold separately.  </li>
            <li> This is obviously for someone with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> long enough hair, I couldn&#x27;t figure how it was &#x27;helpful&#x27;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have long hair and a little patience to learn to use the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thin and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl at all.</li>
            <li> Imagining how loose, short curls would look around my face, I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product from Remington have her the longest lasting curls of any device she has tried AND required absolutely no effort.</li>
            <li> I did try it out on my daughters long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely round-it&#x27;s shaped like a teardrop.</li>
            <li> Does the job well, loose curls</li>
            <li> In the past, I’ve used a curling iron with a clip, which gave me regular curls but always left a kink where the clip laid.  </li>
            <li> First, she thought it was rather cheesy to have only one attachment for the wand.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2CJRODOEMZQQS]]I have long, thick hair that is naturally curly</li>
            <li> I have really long, really, really thick hair, so it takes me a while to curl my whole head, even with this wand, and the cliplessness of this wand takes a little bit of practice to use without burning oneself.  </li>
            <li> have only used this iron a few times</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently there are replacement wands that use the same handle, including a round one with a clamp.  </li>
            <li> spent your money on this product.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell you how long it lasts but if it&#x27;s anything like my previous Remington I expect it to work for years.</li>
            <li> Hair is hard to spiral around with the teardrop and since it&#x27;s awkward to maneuver it makes it very easy to burn your hand like I did,</li>
            <li> Unlike the other wand that I have, this one doesn&#x27;t have a temperature dial that lets me pick</li>
            <li> My other iron has this as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes practice that I am not willing to put in.</li>
            <li> At first the curls were either not there at all or a bit weird looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The barrel can be removed and there are 2 other attachments you can use with it, so</li>
            <li> You would expect that a product that takes a modular approach to the wand shape would have a base handle that is sufficiently sophisticated with temperature control.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also a fan of the plastic rest that let&#x27;s me lay the iron down without worrying about burning any surface.</li>
            <li> Another drawback is that you have to buy the other attachments separately!</li>
            <li> She has long, thick hair, so maybe that was it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You plug it in, wrap your hair around it for a few seconds and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, she was never able to achieve what she can with a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> If you have medium to long hair and looking for that wavy casual look this is for you.</li>
            <li> Second, this wand badly needs a variable temperature control.  </li>
            <li> Not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> usually a name-brand kinda gal when it comes to hair products ($$$!!!)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not, it&#x27;s difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I just am not too crazy about the clipless curling iron design.</li>
            <li> The teardrop shape is awkward and adds nothing to styling; in fact it detracts, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> However, my girlfriend says that wearing the glove and trying to navigate the wand around her head without burning herself is awkward.</li>
            <li> I found this awkward to use and the teardrops shape made ridges in my hair not waves.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium length, comes to the base of my shoulder blade.</li>
            <li> It has a swivel cord at it&#x27;s base, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting a cord tangled up around your arm when your using it.</li>

            <li> I love this curler. My hair is super thin and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl at all. With this curler and some dry shampoo, I&#x27;ve been able to get curls that last all day (even though by the end of the day they are looser). I enjoy this curler!</li>
            <li> Ficking awesome!!... It does whatever you need it to do as far as curls go</li>
            <li> My wife tried this wand out a few times over the past several weeks and offered very simple feedback - &amp;#34;It&#x27;s the best curling wand I have ever used&amp;#34;. She has tried some VERY elaborate systems from Japan and Hong Kong but they always seemed to require a lot of work for results that lasted for less time than an average dinner party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product from Remington have her the longest lasting curls of any device she has tried AND required absolutely no effort. There were no individual curlers to pre-heat, no multi-phase application and next to no waiting time before the wand was ready. You plug it in, wrap your hair around it for a few seconds and you&#x27;re done. Period. Seriously - next to no work.</li>
            <li> I am used to traditional curling irons with a clamp.  I never noticed the clamp causing ripples in my hair or kinks.  However, I wanted to try this style of wand. It comes with a heat resistant glove to use to wind the hair around the wand. Maybe I am just not getting the hang of it but it didn&#x27;t really curl my hair how I like it too.  It actually looks fuzzy and I still managed to burn my hand even with the glove.  Remington hair products are great but I just am not too crazy about the clipless curling iron design.</li>
            <li> This is a ceramic wand and my girls tell me it gets very hot which apparently is needed if you want to do some of the more complex hair styles out there.  The quality seems to be very good.  I made the mistake of touching it one day and I can tell you it gets hot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any advantage to this product over a large curling iron, and certainly not over a traditional wand.  The teardrop shape is awkward and adds nothing to styling; in fact it detracts, in my opinion.  Hair is hard to spiral around with the teardrop and since it&#x27;s awkward to maneuver it makes it very easy to burn your hand like I did, lol.  Stick with a large curling iron with a clamp, or go with a wand that is tapered at the top so it is easier to wrap your hair around, and slide it off.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am a big fan of Remington brand hot tools. I bought a slimmer curling wand a few years back and loved it so much I ended up buying 2 more of the exact same - one backup for myself and one for my step daughter. She still uses it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually a name-brand kinda gal when it comes to hair products ($$$!!!) but I tried a super affordable Remington wand out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised. So it was easy for me to decide to pick up this teardrop iron. Unlike the other wand that I have, this one doesn&#x27;t have a temperature dial that lets me pick how hot I want the iron to get. This is a huge drawback. I believe that different hair types need different temperature settings for best results. Someone with thin fine hair and someone else with thicker heavier hair would use different heat settings. Another drawback is that you have to buy the other attachments separately! Come on just include it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because it actually works. I&#x27;m used to using this style of wrapping and holding my hair without a clip and my hair is medium length so it works great. This wand wouldn&#x27;t work as well for shorter hair - stick with a thinner barrel for that. I also never use the gloves that come with these irons. I feel it&#x27;s a hinderance and I tend to let my hair slip when using the glove. With some practice, I find it isn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a fan of the plastic rest that let&#x27;s me lay the iron down without worrying about burning any surface. My other iron has this as well. Also the cord swivels which is awesome - you would think this is standard with hair tools but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this iron a few times so I can&#x27;t tell you how long it lasts but if it&#x27;s anything like my previous Remington I expect it to work for years. Great for different types of curls and with a good hairspray (and weather!) the style holds most of the day. Good buy overall.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this iron on her hair.  It has a unique shape which produces nice waves instead of the standard round curls.  The hair does look more natural immediately and she does not have to spend so much time brushing it out.  The only thing we didn&#x27;t like was that it does not have any kind of clamp to hold the hair.  This means that you must get it started by holding your hair and wrapping around the iron and holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing comes with a glove which is supposed to protect the &amp;#34;holding hand&amp;#34; from the iron in case you bump it, and while it does prevent immediate burns it needs to be thicker.  You can burn your hand through the glove unless you&#x27;re careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently there are replacement wands that use the same handle, including a round one with a clamp.  We don&#x27;t have these and frankly, it seems to me that storing any wands you bought would take almost as much space as just having another curling iron.  Again- that&#x27;s speculation as we don&#x27;t have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a nice hair tool.  Does a good job, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to, but I just don&#x27;t like these new irons that require the use of a glove and having to hold your hair in place by hand. I guess I&#x27;m old-fashioned, but I find the old iron designs easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always loved Remington products, but I feel like their new products are more for professional stylists, rather than daily home use.</li>
            <li> Note that this review was written by my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, fine hair and found that this product did not work well for me.  In the past, I’ve used a curling iron with a clip, which gave me regular curls but always left a kink where the clip laid.  Recently, I&#x27;ve been using a cone-shaped styling&lt;br /&gt;wand, which gives me what I like to call beautiful &amp;#34;mermaid hair&amp;#34;.  This tear-drop wand did neither, and the shape it left behind simply did not look good on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to help with the process of holding hair on the iron, the package includes a heat-resistant glove.  The product also features a mechanism for swapping out the wand for different shapes.  Unfortunately, only the teardrop shape is included in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue I have with this wand is that it has no temperature control.  You would expect that a product that takes a modular approach to the wand shape would have a base handle that is sufficiently sophisticated with temperature control.  This one is not, and it got so hot that I feared it would burn up my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product seems to miss the mark and I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> It makes fantastic and lasting curls. However, my girlfriend says that wearing the glove and trying to navigate the wand around her head without burning herself is awkward. It takes much longer than some of the other curling products she owns. This is a good option for the money and it will make a good traveling product because she won&#x27;t be distraught if it breaks in her suitcase.</li>
            <li> Wife used it and this was and is her first wand.  She said she isn&#x27;t sure the design really does much to help other than maybe shape the curls a bit more, but she is overall pleased with the product</li>
            <li> I farmed this out to my daughter as she is the resident long-haired beauty/model and this report is based on her observations.  First, she thought it was rather cheesy to have only one attachment for the wand.  The box talks about 2 more attachments with different shapes but you only get one - would not cost a lot more to include all three.  Second, this wand badly needs a variable temperature control.  It only operates at 410F and if I remember my Ray Bradbury correctly that is almost hot enough to ignite paper.  If you are not quick at uncurling your hair from the wand, you will quickly smell your hair burning.  Finally, there does not seem much chance of successfully using this on anything other than long hair.</li>
            <li> The Remington Ultimate Stylist Teardrop Wand as it is packaged is designed to give hair waves.  If you want curls or have extra long hair, there are additional attachments sold separately.  Out of the box:  The handle, the teardrop barrel, and a heat protective glove (just in case you touch the barrel).  I tried it a few times.  The first time was a complete joke.  My hair is shoulder-blade length and left to its own devices, quite curly.  Not being accustomed to this kind of styling aid, my \\&quot;wavy curls\\&quot; did not all go the same direction.  My natural curl was curlier, so I couldn&#x27;t actually leave any of them undone and it turned out to be fairly time consuming.  In the end I spent way more time than usual for a really strange looking hairstyle that ended up in a pony tail.  With practice, it did actually improve.  I was able to get the hair on to the barrel so that the different curls were not sticking out all over.  Still stuck with the problem of my own curls being curlier, so these actually looked straightened.  Moved on to somewhat straightening my hair before I started, then the results were passable.  But I&#x27;m not likely to put out that much time and effort for passable hair.  This styling wand is not for me.  Does it work?  Yes.  Long, straight to wavy, smooth hair would be best.  With hair like that you could throw in a few of these waves and it would look fantastic.  Things I would change:  it would be nice if they would include the interchangeable wands instead of encouraging us to \\&quot;collect all 3\\&quot;.  If the first one isn&#x27;t right, a different barrel might be better, but who is going to spend more money to find out?  Adjustable temperature would be nice as well.  Not hard, and available on even the cheapest curling irons.  Overall, this wasn&#x27;t for me.  But it is fairly inexpensive, and if you have a moderate amount of dexterity may give you the hairstyle you&#x27;re aiming for.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Quick to warm up&lt;br /&gt;- Does the job well, loose curls just like I wanted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- (might be true to all wands) sometimes feels too hot, almost burning my skull&lt;br /&gt;- Lacking instructions for first time users</li>
            <li> Maybe a more skilled person than me would get better results. I found this awkward to use and the teardrops shape made ridges in my hair not waves.  Maybe it takes practice that I am not willing to put in.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2CJRODOEMZQQS]]I have long, thick hair that is naturally curly and I often straighten it and then use hot rollers or a curling iron to make it smooth and with a soft curl. This teardrop shape Remington iron does just that. Very easy to use, nice results. The glove is especially handy to keep your hands and face from burning. Enjoy the 45 second video demo showing you how easy it is and how quickly it turns out pretty.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, makes big waves, heating glove helps in styling (your hands are safe don&#x27;t get burnt or hot), wife liked the product, uses it. Recommended by her.</li>
            <li> This is a novelty for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a good, long while to adapt to using it. At first the curls were either not there at all or a bit weird looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve become much more adjusted to using it, I think it&#x27;s a fun way to curl. The glove is essential for me and the wand really heats quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t my favorite curler, but it isn&#x27;t my least favorite either. It just takes time to learn to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a curling wand, which you have to use without a clip. Make sure you know what you&#x27;re getting. If you&#x27;re used to this, it&#x27;s great. If you&#x27;re not, it&#x27;s difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder-length; I felt this was meant for people with longer hair. Not a bad product, but make sure you&#x27;re a long-haired person who&#x27;s used to curling wands (or wants to get used to them) before buying.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try this iron so I got it for her.  At first she burned her hand and her hair a little bit.  She was not able to achieve a nice wave due to the non-stick nature of the barrel and how hard it is to wrap the hair around it.  Keep in mind, you are playing with a 400+ degree iron with your gloved hand, and you can definitely feel the heat through the glove.  Not pleasant.  She even watched several online videos to learn the technique better.  Sadly, she was never able to achieve what she can with a traditional curling iron.  She has long, thick hair, so maybe that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I don&#x27;t think it was so much a product quality issue as this type of design may work for a limited percentage of people, and it just didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
            <li> This curling iron takes a bit of getting used to. It is clipless you need to wrap your hair around the barrel carefully while wearing the special glove that come with it. I still managed to burn myself the first time. I think this particular barrel is for pretty long hair which I do not have. I did try it out on my daughters long hair. This barrel produces lovely loose, beachy waves. I also like that i can buy different shaped barrels to use on this particular iron. It does take a bit of practice to use but once you are used to it, it works great!</li>
            <li> I do not like this wand.  It does heat up quickly, and is very hot.  A glove is included to help with the wrapping of the hair, since there is not a clip or anything to help secure the hair.  However, I found it very unwieldy to try to wrap, and hold my hair.  My hair is medium length, comes to the base of my shoulder blade. So maybe, if your hair is much longer, you might have a better experience.  Or perhaps if using it on someone else....maybe....</li>
            <li> My hair is very short and I always see photos of young women with long, loose curls that I think are very attractive. The tear-drop tip on this product looked like it might work on my hair, so wanted to give it a try. Imagining how loose, short curls would look around my face, I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great and I love my new hair-style. A big bonus to me is that the wand is thick enough so that by placing it close to my scalp when curling, I can get the necessary height on top. That worked, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ultimate stylist teardrop wand has found a happy home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Remington, for constantly updating your popular line of styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Betty Dravis, July 24, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Author of \\&quot;1106 Grand Boulevard\\&quot;</li>
            <li> First thing to note is that the little glove that&#x27;s meant to protect your other hand from burning doesn&#x27;t do a very good job. I couldn&#x27;t really use it because it just got too hot to handle.  It might be a good product with a proper glove or other method to protect your hand, but the only they provided is just straight up insufficient.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this I was hesitant. Not your normal shaped curling iron rod. It&#x27;s not completely round-it&#x27;s shaped like a teardrop. It had a protective outer sheath to protect your hand/face when you use it as well as a glove as it gets super hot, so be very careful the 1st couple of times you use it. Word of caution, use heat protector leave in conditioner on your hair before use-this has protective coating but better to be safe than sorry. And never, NEVER hold the heated barrel in your hand even with the glove. This produces beach wave curls which are really neat and last a long time, when you use heat protective spray first of course. The barrel can be removed and there are 2 other attachments you can use with it, so it&#x27;s versatile. It has a swivel cord at it&#x27;s base, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting a cord tangled up around your arm when your using it. If you have medium to long hair and looking for that wavy casual look this is for you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 15 year-old daughter, and she absolutely loves it. We read the unfavorable reviews, and she remarked that the reviewers probably didn&#x27;t practice enough. My daughter is very proficient with the &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; style curling wand, but she wanted to create more &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; waves. This product does make beautiful, loose beachy-style waves. The trick is to learn to hold the wand upside-down and wrap the hair around it. At first, it&#x27;s easy to burn your fingers, but with practice, you will learn to leave the ends just off the iron to prevent burning. For reference, my daughter had long, fine, layered straight hair. It does not work as well on my shoulder-length hair. The product does get very hot and has only one temperature setting, but my daughter had not had a problem with her hair burning or being damaged by the product after several weeks of continuous use. Highly recommended if you have long hair and a little patience to learn to use the product.</li>
            <li> This tool burned my hair in milliseconds! And that was with professional thermal protectants. I can still smell the scorching three days later. I&#x27;ve used many hot tools and this was the first time I have ever experienced this.</li>
            <li> I got this item for my wife, who has naturally curly red hair.&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture on Amazon. It really is just a curling iron with a swivel power cord.&lt;br /&gt;It does heat to a pretty high temperature, and my wife is used to a salon quality flat iron and curling iron but this iron was a nightmare! Her hair got stuck it in the iron and burned, even though it was set at a low temperature.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spent your money on this product. Save your money and buy a quality styling iron.</li>
            <li> This is obviously for someone with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work at all for someone with shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;Mentions &#x27;interchangeable barrels&#x27;,  on the box and in the fine print in the&lt;br /&gt;instructions you find out that you have to buy them separately.&lt;br /&gt;Glove was for protection in case you touched the barrel, but since I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;have long enough hair, I couldn&#x27;t figure how it was &#x27;helpful&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;It only had on/off no heat adjustment/&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were clear, but mostly covered the other &#x27;interchangeable&lt;br /&gt;barrels&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t understand how a &#x27;tear drop shape&#x27; did anything, but maybe if I had&lt;br /&gt;longer hair I would see how it helped.&lt;br /&gt;It had a swivel cord that is always good when working on hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great little wand made by Remington. If you want something that is easy to use and will last, this might be the wand for you. No problem getting my hair out of it and it does not tangle easily.</li>
            <li> I really like the style of this styling wand.  I&#x27;ve used an interchangeable-barreled wand before and liked the results, but the teardrop-shape is really unique, at least in my curling iron collection.  I have really long, really, really thick hair, so it takes me a while to curl my whole head, even with this wand, and the cliplessness of this wand takes a little bit of practice to use without burning oneself.  But even just leaving my hair wavy and using this to define a few locks really makes a difference.  I like that you can just get the barrels you want, instead of having a bunch of barrels included in the package just to get one particular barrel you want.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use without touching the heat element or leaving a segment of you hair unfurled. I may just need time to get more accustomed to this device but my flat iron was much easier to use. It does curl but it doesn&#x27;t create a nice look because the curls ar uneven when I do it. It did not burn my hair as others have claimed.</li>
