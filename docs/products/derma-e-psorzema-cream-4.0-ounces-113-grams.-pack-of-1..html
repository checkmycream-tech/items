            <li>very good combination of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>this cream is incredibly soothing.  </li>
            <li>Works great on dryness, flakiness, rashes and redness.</li>
            <li>very nice cream for the eye</li>
            <li>VERY EFFECTIVE ON MY WIFE&#x27;S ECZEMA.....</li>
            <li>and I think it is keeping my hands in good condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The search for a good eczema product continues... -_-</li>
            <li>When I was looking for a replacement, I ran across good reviews of Psorzema Cream and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Good Price.  </li>
            <li>Good fortune to all those seeking relief</li>
            <li>and please comment if you know of a good remedy...</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It keeps it under control until the arrival of warm and sunny days..which work even better!</li>
            <li>My eczema is mild compared to others, but I have to say that this is the best creme I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many).  </li>
            <li>This cream is very mild but very effective.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>It has been working amazingly for me.</li>
            <li>kind of scares me</li>
            <li>Nice cream</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li>So far this Psorzema Creme seems to be the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>SO FAR SO GOOD!!</li>
            <li>Cream feels excellent putting it on, nice and rich, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and by morning my skin is flaking off again, so the cream is nice</li>
            <li>I used Psorzema instead and it really helped with the redness, flaking, and it healed beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many many items through amazon, and been happy with every purchase, but this is the first purchase that compelled me to write a reivew.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even started applying it to my scalp with better results than anything else.</li>
            <li>Most products cause burning/itching for my children.  </li>
            <li>And the great thing is you can put it on as much as you want without any side effects.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this during the winter and we have not found a better lotion anywhere.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my arms and legs, and, even though it works great as a moisturiser, I don&#x27;t think it did much for my psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any steroid cream I have ever tried. :)</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to use more</li>
            <li>I added more,</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>more than medicine she got from her dermatologist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this did not work better.</li>
            <li>I have been using pine tar soap and olive soap for cleansing, then argan oil and/or tamanu oil with Kiehls body lotion and Aveeno Anti-Itch Cortisone cream on top of that.</li>
            <li>This product while called a cream is more of a gel like consistency to it.  </li>
            <li>I also use DermaZinc Cream - 4 oz which makes my head tingle and is a heavier cream and more fragrent than Psorzema.  </li>
            <li>We put this on my son every night after his bath and then put aquaphor on top of it.  </li>
            <li>We have been doing this for a couple of months and it keeps most of the eczema under control.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I used the SBR cream mainly after showering (hydrating the skin, and sealing in the moisture), and it worked great to keep my eczema under control.  </li>
            <li>This cream is awesome for psoriatic patches on skin or any dry areas.</li>
            <li>fact that it&#x27;s chemical and steroid free makes it even better.</li>
            <li>This Psorzema cream would probably be great for someone who just has sensitive skin but no psoriasis or eczema.</li>
            <li>inside was a free sample of the Psorzema cream.</li>
            <li>I have eczema primarily on the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands.  </li>
            <li>And the most important thing, this cream contains no dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li>and so far so good</li>
            <li>However, I put it one twice a day even though I am pretty sure once a day would work just as fine.</li>
            <li>, I apply it 3 or 4 times daily, I am happy that I found this special cream.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is all natural and steriod free!</li>
            <li>I was hopeful after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Then put this cream on it right after your shower, it has done a world of good so far.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not bad, just is.  </li>
            <li>Once I get it under control, most &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; lotions work fine to keep my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter who has mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I really like Derma-E products and have had great experiences using the various creams and serums.  </li>
            <li>It works better in combination with another lotion/creme but doesn&#x27;t work any better with the body wash of the same name.  </li>
            <li>After many frustrating conversations and visits with the dermatologist, and too many prescriptions of steroids, I began a relentless research, much of it on my beloved Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>and I wish I had known about it the first year of his life!</li>
            <li>Ideal for dry and or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant cream to use, unscented, moderately moisturizing but it really does nothing toward healing the abominable curse that is eczema.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to say that the skin on my nose now looks completely normal, soft, smooth, flake free, not red at all.</li>
            <li>It helps to calm my skin and lessen the plaques.  </li>
            <li>but he said it was worth it.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to look for a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Well, bonus, so far 2 days in and I&#x27;ve not had any severe redness the scaling is better and no itchies.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to wash your face in the shower and make sure to clear off any scaling with a wash.</li>
            <li>and it fully absorbed.</li>
            <li>and then there is the issue of cortisone being absorbed into your system thus causing liver damage.</li>
            <li>I put in on and it felt nice initially</li>
            <li>many, many other products did not.  </li>
            <li>bought this on here due to the good reviews</li>
            <li>They were right.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and very gentle on my rosacea.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how light weight and quick absorbing</li>
            <li>and he was pleased just after several days</li>
            <li>and I understand that it won&#x27;t just go away; it has to be treated consistently.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m still using this cream religiously and my face is still doing so much better.</li>
            <li>It was working well at first, but the effectiveness is falling off a bit, so I switched to this for a week to see if it would work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do like that it does not smell funny</li>
            <li>At first I mixed it with the hydrocortisone to relieve it quickly to prevent infection, and after 1 application of the mixture, it was gone!</li>
            <li>My most recent annoyance has been a patch near my right elbow.</li>
            <li>I have suffered with eczema all my life and normally use Eucerin right after my bath for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Psoriasis could be caused from toxin overload, or inablility to digest certain foods.  </li>
            <li>After having tried \\&quot;everything on the market\\&quot; for my kids&#x27; severely dry, sensitive skin and eczema, I can honestly say this line was the least-irritating.  </li>
            <li>It shipped fast.</li>
            <li>It did relieve my itchiness, but not by much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work for me, but I guess it doesn&#x27;t work out for everyone.</li>
            <li>It really works and because there are no steroids I can apply it often without worry.</li>
            <li>I keep using it daily because it keeps my skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>That means that I can use as much of it as I need and as often as I need.</li>
            <li>Product worked very well on eczema.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This cream doesn&#x27;t really make my skin feel moisturized, it just calms the eczema.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and couldn&#x27;t really believe what I was reading.</li>
            <li>about 4 times before I went to bed that night just to really give it my all.</li>
            <li>I also gave some to a girlfriend who has exzema on her hands and it has really helped her.</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t really work for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the hype is real.  </li>
            <li>I use it for spots of psoriasis on my scalp, its never greasy and really helps alleviate the flaking and itching.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more when this jar is empty.</li>
            <li>It works better than topical steroids and completely cured my exema.</li>
            <li>Plus it never makes it worse before it gets better, which is what I&#x27;ve experienced  with other products.</li>
            <li>Consequently when I use it on my scalp it does soften the crustiness but seems also to absorb better than other creams.  </li>
            <li>The steroid creams/sprays worked okay for the first few weeks, and then the effectiveness seemed to wear off.</li>
            <li>My husband was able to curb use of steroids (he cannot completely stop using them) for long stretches of time.  </li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate psoriasis, where lesions just pop out of nowhere and disappear.  </li>
            <li>It works decently well for that purpose, but so would a $1.50 tub of vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a bit expensive for the amount they give you, but the actual product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own, it barely moisturizes my skin, much less help my eczema.  </li>
            <li>stopped using this and applied pure aloe for a while which helped to reduce the pain and redness by a lot, but didn&#x27;t clear the spots to normal condition.</li>
            <li>I really like this natural product line.</li>
            <li>It works great, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive (no matter where you buy it).  </li>
            <li>and we are right now in the coldest temperatures that we have ever had Southern California.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have psoriasis or eczema, just super dry hands in the winter that often crack and bleed when the temperatures drop.</li>
            <li>I use this at night and see relief by morning, but I do need to use consistently or the ezcema comes back.  </li>
            <li>I am new to this product - what I can tell you is that it keeps your skin and affected are&#x27;s soft and relives the itching, but it does not get rid of the problem...</li>
            <li>My ears, elbows are almost entirely clear,  and the new patches clear up within a day when I see them apply the creme.</li>
            <li>Psorzema Creme on a low shelf, at Sprouts and while it seemed hidden away,  when I read through the ingredients it seemed to have many of natural items I&#x27;d read that have been shown to improve Psoriasis &amp; Excema (sp?) symptoms (Neem, Burdock,  Bearberry)  </li>
            <li>I have been using this on my son (1 year old) to relieve his eczema patches.</li>
            <li>That combined with the fact that I really didn&#x27;t want to have to apply steroids for the rest of my life, led me on the inevitable search for something that would work..</li>
            <li>Seemd like a lot just to chance that it might work (or not work,  as history had so far shown).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using it for my baby girl since she was 4 weeks old.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, but still hydrates.</li>
            <li>One unexpected benefit -</li>
            <li>all natural blah blah blah.</li>
            <li>My son has had eczema since he was 8 weeks old.  </li>
            <li>We have almost completely eliminated the need for steroid creams with the use of this homeopathic cream.</li>
            <li>Derma E products are awesome...and natural.  </li>
            <li>If you use it immediately after showing, it keeps skin soft and balanced all day without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>After the third day of using this, all the scaliness and redness came back, exactly like what happens when I stop using the psoriasin for three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this time was different, over the next week, thick pieces of skin began to peel off my nose, revealing healthy, normal skin</li>
            <li>This cream really does wonders for dry and rash-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this cream on my legs as regular lotion as to not waste it.</li>
            <li>I will update my review in a month and adjust the stars if necessary, but so far, this works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks on my scalp and it has made a huge difference with my dry scalp</li>
            <li>I put on a thin layer on the patch before bedtime, not really expecting anything amazing to happen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year and a half now along with pine tar soap which is very moisturizing and the red, blotchy is almost completely gone</li>
            <li>I will say that that first night of using it, it did sting a little each time I applied it.</li>
            <li>I started to suspect that I had seborrheic dermatitis which apparently can only be managed with no permanent solution.</li>
            <li>My hands were very raw, from itching so much, so I selected this cream, and it was very soothing, did not burn the open cuts.  </li>
            <li>Has really helped my dry, dry skin.</li>
            <li>It works at keeping the dry skin on my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it quickly clear up my minor breakouts, it immediately relieves the itching.  </li>
            <li>I realized I needed to go the full natural route, as I&#x27;ve truly come to believe a lot of the cause is due to using soaps, dyes, frangrances, and of course our diets (where it&#x27;s hard to find natural foods, even meat and veg, that do not contain steroids and other chemicals).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad, I really wanted something not harsh or filled with steroids as treatment.  </li>

            <li> Got this for my daughter who has mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I really like Derma-E products and have had great experiences using the various creams and serums.  </li>
            <li> It works better in combination with another lotion/creme but doesn&#x27;t work any better with the body wash of the same name.  </li>
            <li> After many frustrating conversations and visits with the dermatologist, and too many prescriptions of steroids, I began a relentless research, much of it on my beloved Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> and I wish I had known about it the first year of his life!</li>
            <li> Ideal for dry and or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a pleasant cream to use, unscented, moderately moisturizing but it really does nothing toward healing the abominable curse that is eczema.</li>
            <li> and I am happy to say that the skin on my nose now looks completely normal, soft, smooth, flake free, not red at all.</li>
            <li> It helps to calm my skin and lessen the plaques.  </li>
            <li> but he said it was worth it.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to look for a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Well, bonus, so far 2 days in and I&#x27;ve not had any severe redness the scaling is better and no itchies.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to wash your face in the shower and make sure to clear off any scaling with a wash.</li>
            <li> and it fully absorbed.</li>
            <li> and then there is the issue of cortisone being absorbed into your system thus causing liver damage.</li>
            <li> I put in on and it felt nice initially</li>
            <li> many, many other products did not.  </li>
            <li> bought this on here due to the good reviews</li>
            <li> They were right.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and very gentle on my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how light weight and quick absorbing</li>
            <li> and he was pleased just after several days</li>
            <li> and I understand that it won&#x27;t just go away; it has to be treated consistently.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m still using this cream religiously and my face is still doing so much better.</li>
            <li> It was working well at first, but the effectiveness is falling off a bit, so I switched to this for a week to see if it would work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do like that it does not smell funny</li>
            <li> At first I mixed it with the hydrocortisone to relieve it quickly to prevent infection, and after 1 application of the mixture, it was gone!</li>
            <li> My most recent annoyance has been a patch near my right elbow.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with eczema all my life and normally use Eucerin right after my bath for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Psoriasis could be caused from toxin overload, or inablility to digest certain foods.  </li>
            <li> After having tried \\&quot;everything on the market\\&quot; for my kids&#x27; severely dry, sensitive skin and eczema, I can honestly say this line was the least-irritating.  </li>
            <li> It shipped fast.</li>
            <li> It did relieve my itchiness, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work for me, but I guess it doesn&#x27;t work out for everyone.</li>
            <li> It really works and because there are no steroids I can apply it often without worry.</li>
            <li> I keep using it daily because it keeps my skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> That means that I can use as much of it as I need and as often as I need.</li>
            <li> Product worked very well on eczema.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This cream doesn&#x27;t really make my skin feel moisturized, it just calms the eczema.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and couldn&#x27;t really believe what I was reading.</li>
            <li> about 4 times before I went to bed that night just to really give it my all.</li>
            <li> I also gave some to a girlfriend who has exzema on her hands and it has really helped her.</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t really work for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the hype is real.  </li>
            <li> I use it for spots of psoriasis on my scalp, its never greasy and really helps alleviate the flaking and itching.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more when this jar is empty.</li>
            <li> It works better than topical steroids and completely cured my exema.</li>
            <li> Plus it never makes it worse before it gets better, which is what I&#x27;ve experienced  with other products.</li>
            <li> Consequently when I use it on my scalp it does soften the crustiness but seems also to absorb better than other creams.  </li>
            <li> The steroid creams/sprays worked okay for the first few weeks, and then the effectiveness seemed to wear off.</li>
            <li> My husband was able to curb use of steroids (he cannot completely stop using them) for long stretches of time.  </li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate psoriasis, where lesions just pop out of nowhere and disappear.  </li>
            <li> It works decently well for that purpose, but so would a $1.50 tub of vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive for the amount they give you, but the actual product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s own, it barely moisturizes my skin, much less help my eczema.  </li>
            <li> stopped using this and applied pure aloe for a while which helped to reduce the pain and redness by a lot, but didn&#x27;t clear the spots to normal condition.</li>
            <li> I really like this natural product line.</li>
            <li> It works great, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive (no matter where you buy it).  </li>
            <li> and we are right now in the coldest temperatures that we have ever had Southern California.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have psoriasis or eczema, just super dry hands in the winter that often crack and bleed when the temperatures drop.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and see relief by morning, but I do need to use consistently or the ezcema comes back.  </li>
            <li> I am new to this product - what I can tell you is that it keeps your skin and affected are&#x27;s soft and relives the itching, but it does not get rid of the problem...</li>
            <li> My ears, elbows are almost entirely clear,  and the new patches clear up within a day when I see them apply the creme.</li>
            <li> Psorzema Creme on a low shelf, at Sprouts and while it seemed hidden away,  when I read through the ingredients it seemed to have many of natural items I&#x27;d read that have been shown to improve Psoriasis &amp; Excema (sp?) symptoms (Neem, Burdock,  Bearberry)  </li>
            <li> I have been using this on my son (1 year old) to relieve his eczema patches.</li>
            <li> That combined with the fact that I really didn&#x27;t want to have to apply steroids for the rest of my life, led me on the inevitable search for something that would work..</li>
            <li> Seemd like a lot just to chance that it might work (or not work,  as history had so far shown).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using it for my baby girl since she was 4 weeks old.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, but still hydrates.</li>
            <li> One unexpected benefit -</li>
            <li> all natural blah blah blah.</li>
            <li> My son has had eczema since he was 8 weeks old.  </li>
            <li> We have almost completely eliminated the need for steroid creams with the use of this homeopathic cream.</li>
            <li> Derma E products are awesome...and natural.  </li>
            <li> If you use it immediately after showing, it keeps skin soft and balanced all day without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> After the third day of using this, all the scaliness and redness came back, exactly like what happens when I stop using the psoriasin for three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this time was different, over the next week, thick pieces of skin began to peel off my nose, revealing healthy, normal skin</li>
            <li> This cream really does wonders for dry and rash-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this cream on my legs as regular lotion as to not waste it.</li>
            <li> I will update my review in a month and adjust the stars if necessary, but so far, this works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks on my scalp and it has made a huge difference with my dry scalp</li>
            <li> I put on a thin layer on the patch before bedtime, not really expecting anything amazing to happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year and a half now along with pine tar soap which is very moisturizing and the red, blotchy is almost completely gone</li>
            <li> I will say that that first night of using it, it did sting a little each time I applied it.</li>
            <li> I started to suspect that I had seborrheic dermatitis which apparently can only be managed with no permanent solution.</li>
            <li> My hands were very raw, from itching so much, so I selected this cream, and it was very soothing, did not burn the open cuts.  </li>
            <li> Has really helped my dry, dry skin.</li>
            <li> It works at keeping the dry skin on my hands soft.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it quickly clear up my minor breakouts, it immediately relieves the itching.  </li>
            <li> I realized I needed to go the full natural route, as I&#x27;ve truly come to believe a lot of the cause is due to using soaps, dyes, frangrances, and of course our diets (where it&#x27;s hard to find natural foods, even meat and veg, that do not contain steroids and other chemicals).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, I really wanted something not harsh or filled with steroids as treatment.  </li>
            <li> saw this product in the &#x27;natural section&#x27; of my base&#x27;s commissary and since the price was good</li>
            <li> Not sure if we&#x27;ll buy the cream again, but definitely the lotion, which is a little more practical for kids who don&#x27;t sit still very long.</li>
            <li> I get itchy, red, rashy patches, sometimes with tiny blisters, on my hands and forearms, due to my incredibly sensitive skin and necessary hand washing.  </li>
            <li> I plan on continuing to use this cream as I don&#x27;t want the condition to return, but as this is a large 4oz jar and I only need a little for my nose, I think this jar will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fact that this does not contain any harmful ingredients that are so common in other products.  </li>
            <li> a little bit really goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the price deter you from purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands (fingers only really) that is usually spurred on my stress and takes a long time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> flaky, dry, red, and irritated.</li>
            <li> I had lost hope that I would find a product, much less a natural one, that would relieve my itching</li>
            <li> He has had  so many expensive creams ordered by the Dermatologist that never really worked well until he tried a sample of this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Psorzema for the past 6 months, and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use the Psorzema body and face wash along with this cream all year long.</li>
            <li> We are due with our next soon, and am planning to use it on both of our sons to prevent eczema.</li>
            <li> (got it on June 15th) and all it has done is dry out the eczema on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> OI use this product for dry skin and psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Our pedi told us it was baby acne at first, but then it got a lot worse...</li>
            <li> but I could get the same effect with a 7 dollar cream that wears away in a few hours and leaves my skin just as dry.</li>
            <li> For flare ups, I usually use hydrocortisone mixed in with Eucerin, but now, I just apply the Psorzema Creme a couple of times and the flare up is gone!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty expensive for the size.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t judge other Derma-E products based solely on this one though.</li>
            <li> which is the definition of a three star review, because it is not okay in terms of actually improving my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> If you like the heaviness of the other creams then perhaps you will not prefer this one.</li>
            <li> I was in denial that the new cream was causing this and continued to apply for about 5 days while my spots got worse and</li>
            <li> However,  \\&quot;natural remedies\\&quot; seem really expensive  to me, especially considering that nothing seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> A frustrating search,  especially considering I&#x27;m a single mother and it seemed I was constantly spending money on a different cream or shampoo trying to find something that worked,  as my psoriasis just continued to get worse.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, esp.</li>
            <li> It appeared during late summer 2012 and has been with me since, refusing to give in to any/all topical treatments under the sun!</li>
            <li> It was embarassing as it made my nose red as well, and I even had someone joke that I looked like an alcoholic... not the impression I want to give!</li>
            <li> I am going crazy trying to find the right product for eczema.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I had extremely dry skin on my nose that would flake and peel.</li>
            <li> this cream is, especially compared to the thick heavy creams I had been using.</li>
            <li> I am all healed up now, no more rough skin</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to work</li>
            <li> I got this cream to use for a preventative measure to keep from getting the little cuts in my fingers.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for making our lives a little easier and saving us a few pennies.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Psorzema creme a few times in the hopes that maybe it would help at some point</li>
            <li> I have used MANY expensive creams, and PRESCRIPTION CREAMS, for my horrible rosacea and NOTHING has helped as much as this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The dermatologist tried a few treatments on me that ALL fried my skin and left me worse off than I was to begin with.</li>
            <li> and I had to put it on every other day to help at least a little with the itching but prolonged use of steroid creams</li>
            <li> and she was shocked it stopped the itching right away.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think it moisturized any longer than other products we&#x27;ve tried, at least it didn&#x27;t do anymore damage.  </li>
            <li> At least give it one try if you have a problem with redness or any other skin problem.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a plain odor to it which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything suggested to us by our pediatrician and dermatologist, and while some things helped, nothing could consistantly get rid of the all over rash or do much for the really bad patches.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and nothing worked in the past,</li>
            <li> (Though I&#x27;m unable to get to my entire scalp</li>
            <li> I had various, expensive, very heavy and greasy creams recommended to me to use, which seemed to help some, but not completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had excema (dermatitis) off and on for years, but it has become chronic since a particularly bad period for my hay fever allergies last October.  </li>
            <li> But I am grateful that at least it was not super-expensive and it did not make my face look worse.</li>
            <li> I have read that cortisone is not good to use long term because when you quit using it, the eczema comes on twice as bad</li>
            <li> She has rosacea and this is one of the least expensive creams she can purchase for her face.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was buying this in the health food stores (for approximately $15), but sometimes I can find it on amazon for 3-5 dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> , it does not sting, it did not make my face redder or my psoriasis worse, but it did not make any improvements, either.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a severe breakout in the past two years, but at its worst, it took several prednisone treatments to get it under control.  </li>
            <li> So, I figured $15 isn&#x27;t bad for something that at least works as a moisturizer and if it helps my eczema, it&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
            <li> My son has terrible eczema, and has since shortly after birth.</li>
            <li> but, unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My husband suffers terribly from rashes, especially on his hands.  </li>
            <li> I was searching on amazon for something to help because I was desperate.</li>
            <li> My mother has really bad eczema and nothing has worked.  </li>
            <li> I was completely shocked that this product seemed to &#x27;work overnight&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I remember having an eczema \\&quot;necklace\\&quot; when I was four; a horrible outbreak on both arms that recurred for years; patches on my legs, feet, and hands... but the worst one was the outbreak under my nose.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling eczema all my life. I remember having an eczema \\&quot;necklace\\&quot; when I was four; a horrible outbreak on both arms that recurred for years; patches on my legs, feet, and hands... but the worst one was the outbreak under my nose. I looked like I either had a red flaky mustache, or my upper lip was severely chapped and was beginning to migrate up my face (you can only imagine how I was treated in school that year!). My most recent annoyance has been a patch near my right elbow. It appeared during late summer 2012 and has been with me since, refusing to give in to any/all topical treatments under the sun! Even the SUN won&#x27;t make it go away (I tried that too!)!  But a ray of hope shined on me recently when I picked up a Derma-E product for my grandma at the store... inside was a free sample of the Psorzema cream. She said she had no use for it, and sent it home with me... I put on a thin layer on the patch before bedtime, not really expecting anything amazing to happen. The next morning, the flakiness was gone! It was no coincidence, it was DEFINITELY the cream. So, I hopped onto Amazon and got myself a tub of the stuff. It shipped fast. Today is day two of the Derma-E treatment, and I am noticing a big difference. I think I&#x27;ve finally found THE ONE! &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it&#x27;s chemical and steroid free makes it even better.</li>
            <li> Did not help with my eczema</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is how the product is supposed to work, but I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now (got it on June 15th) and all it has done is dry out the eczema on my fingers.  It hasn&#x27;t cleared anything up because I still get bumps and cuts all over my fingers from my eczema but what I did like about this product is that it&#x27;s not greasy.  It did relieve my itchiness, but not by much. There&#x27;s a plain odor to it which is also a plus. I really wanted this product to work for me, but I guess it doesn&#x27;t work out for everyone.</li>
            <li> very good combination of ingredients.  Both Neem and Burdock are antifungal</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my son (1 year old) to relieve his eczema patches. It really works and because there are no steroids I can apply it often without worry.</li>
            <li> My mother has really bad eczema and nothing has worked.  I gave her this and she was shocked it stopped the itching right away.</li>
            <li> I am new to this product - what I can tell you is that it keeps your skin and affected are&#x27;s soft and relives the itching, but it does not get rid of the problem...</li>
            <li> after useing for a couple of weeks all of my exzema cleared up! I have tried everything and nothing worked in the past,If I could I would give it ten stars</li>
            <li> This cream did not provide relief for my excema, which is centered around my neck area.  I have had excema (dermatitis) off and on for years, but it has become chronic since a particularly bad period for my hay fever allergies last October.  I have no medical insurance, so have been hunting for an over the counter remedy.</li>
            <li> I have Psoriasis on my scalp, ears, nails and elbows, and starting getting splotches on various areas on my arms and legs. The steroid creams/sprays worked okay for the first few weeks, and then the effectiveness seemed to wear off. That combined with the fact that I really didn&#x27;t want to have to apply steroids for the rest of my life, led me on the inevitable search for something that would work.. A frustrating search,  especially considering I&#x27;m a single mother and it seemed I was constantly spending money on a different cream or shampoo trying to find something that worked,  as my psoriasis just continued to get worse.  I realized I needed to go the full natural route, as I&#x27;ve truly come to believe a lot of the cause is due to using soaps, dyes, frangrances, and of course our diets (where it&#x27;s hard to find natural foods, even meat and veg, that do not contain steroids and other chemicals).  However,  \\&quot;natural remedies\\&quot; seem really expensive  to me, especially considering that nothing seemed to work.  I found derma|e Psorzema Creme on a low shelf, at Sprouts and while it seemed hidden away,  when I read through the ingredients it seemed to have many of natural items I&#x27;d read that have been shown to improve Psoriasis &amp; Excema (sp?) symptoms (Neem, Burdock,  Bearberry)  It was $20 for a 4 oz. container.  Ouch. Seemd like a lot just to chance that it might work (or not work,  as history had so far shown).  ... I&#x27;m so glad I did. I saw results within 24 hrs. My ears, elbows are almost entirely clear,  and the new patches clear up within a day when I see them apply the creme. I&#x27;ve even started applying it to my scalp with better results than anything else. (Though I&#x27;m unable to get to my entire scalp so I&#x27;m still on the hunt for something that works as well there. And my nails..)  I&#x27;m a believer now, and the cost seems insignificant when the effectiveness is taken into account.  I totally recommend this product, and hope others find it to be as helpful as I have!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream and the Psorzema lotion.  After having tried \\&quot;everything on the market\\&quot; for my kids&#x27; severely dry, sensitive skin and eczema, I can honestly say this line was the least-irritating.  Most products cause burning/itching for my children.  Of the entire time they had this cream applied (say, 20 days), only a couple days did one say that it caused them irritation.  That&#x27;s a big deal for us.  While I don&#x27;t think it moisturized any longer than other products we&#x27;ve tried, at least it didn&#x27;t do anymore damage.  Not sure if we&#x27;ll buy the cream again, but definitely the lotion, which is a little more practical for kids who don&#x27;t sit still very long.</li>
            <li> This cream is very mild but very effective. Works great on dryness, flakiness, rashes and redness. Won&#x27;t cause thinning of the skin like cortisone. It&#x27;s a staple on our medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Like the way it feels when I apply it.  It temporally relieves the itching on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This product is invaluable when dealing with eczema.  I depend on it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son who has been plagued with psoriasis for years. He has had  so many expensive creams ordered by the Dermatologist that never really worked well until he tried a sample of this stuff and he was pleased just after several days so I decided to order a jar. He said it makes a big difference. Takes a little time to work but he said it was worth it. I see a big difference in his skin already.</li>
            <li> very nice cream for the eye</li>
            <li> My son has terrible eczema, and has since shortly after birth. We have tried everything suggested to us by our pediatrician and dermatologist, and while some things helped, nothing could consistantly get rid of the all over rash or do much for the really bad patches. We finally tried this and after 2 days of rubbing it in once per day, the all over rash was GONE. The patches even disappeared! This stuff is amazing and I wish I had known about it the first year of his life! We are due with our next soon, and am planning to use it on both of our sons to prevent eczema.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with eczema all my life and normally use Eucerin right after my bath for maintenance. For flare ups, I usually use hydrocortisone mixed in with Eucerin, but now, I just apply the Psorzema Creme a couple of times and the flare up is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using it for my baby girl since she was 4 weeks old. I love the fact that it is all natural and steriod free! Another mother recommended this product, and I&#x27;m SO thankful she did! Our pedi told us it was baby acne at first, but then it got a lot worse...flaky, dry, red, and irritated. At first I mixed it with the hydrocortisone to relieve it quickly to prevent infection, and after 1 application of the mixture, it was gone! Since then, I only apply it after her bath, and it&#x27;s never come back! She&#x27;s now almost 4 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was a little skeptical at first, esp. with the price. The 4oz jar lasts awhile though...a little bit really goes a long way, so don&#x27;t let the price deter you from purchasing. It lasted us almost 3 months! I would definitely recommend this product and give it a try!</li>
            <li> I would give 10 stars to this product if I could. It works better than topical steroids and completely cured my exema. I keep using it daily because it keeps my skin smooth and moisturized. And the most important thing, this cream contains no dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema all of my life and I understand that it won&#x27;t just go away; it has to be treated consistently. So far this Psorzema Creme seems to be the best I&#x27;ve come across. It actually relieves the itching and keeps it at bay without being harmful like topical steroids. That means that I can use as much of it as I need and as often as I need. As a former topical steroid user, that means A LOT. Plus it never makes it worse before it gets better, which is what I&#x27;ve experienced  with other products.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this-- does not make psoriasis go away but definitely soothes it.  Gave it 3 stars because does not make it go away, but my husband does request this and needs it.  Psoriasis could be caused from toxin overload, or inablility to digest certain foods.  This cream goes hand in hand to the way to healing</li>
            <li> Not helping my psoriasis</li>
            <li> I purchased this face cream for my wife. She has rosacea and this is one of the least expensive creams she can purchase for her face. She was buying this from one of the local stores, but since I got her the Psorzema Creme&#x27;, she&#x27;s been getting it from Amazon. Thank you Amazon for making our lives a little easier and saving us a few pennies.</li>
            <li> I have contact dermatitis and suffer from severe itching on the back of my legs. I used a couple of cortisone creams prescribed by my dermatologist to help me with the itching but these creams would only work for maybe a day and I had to put it on every other day to help at least a little with the itching but prolonged use of steroid creams kind of scares me so I wanted to look for a more natural alternative. Found this at Vitamin Shoppe, same amount but for $20 so it is cheaper on Amazon. It has been working amazingly for me. I had lost hope that I would find a product, much less a natural one, that would relieve my itching but this has. And the great thing is you can put it on as much as you want without any side effects. However, I put it one twice a day even though I am pretty sure once a day would work just as fine. This is a miracle cream! Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> It takes 4-6 weeks like they say, but my psoriasis is cleared up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Derma e and it did well in getting rid of a scar on my leg.  However, the Psorzema cream did not work at all.  I am using it now as a moisturizer for my feet.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this during the winter and we have not found a better lotion anywhere.</li>
            <li> Product worked very well on eczema. It has a pleasant scent and absorbs quickly! I really enjoy the fact that this does not contain any harmful ingredients that are so common in other products.  Item was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate psoriasis, where lesions just pop out of nowhere and disappear.  I bought this for my arms and legs, and, even though it works great as a moisturiser, I don&#x27;t think it did much for my psoriasis.  It&#x27;s too bad, I really wanted something not harsh or filled with steroids as treatment.  However, packaging and delivery was excellent.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome for psoriatic patches on skin or any dry areas. It works better than any steroid cream I have ever tried. :)</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who has mild psoriasis. She likes it and says it works well for her.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have psoriasis or eczema, just super dry hands in the winter that often crack and bleed when the temperatures drop. I got this cream to use for a preventative measure to keep from getting the little cuts in my fingers. SO FAR SO GOOD!! I have not had any cuts or cracks yet this year and we are right now in the coldest temperatures that we have ever had Southern California. I think this is helping me. I use it before I go out of the house on my finger tips and I think it is keeping my hands in good condition. Fingers crossed that I can make it through the winter without crackied skin.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands (fingers only really) that is usually spurred on my stress and takes a long time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on here due to the good reviews but it actually worsened by eczema and burned upon application. I was in denial that the new cream was causing this and continued to apply for about 5 days while my spots got worse and worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this and applied pure aloe for a while which helped to reduce the pain and redness by a lot, but didn&#x27;t clear the spots to normal condition. I use this cream on my legs as regular lotion as to not waste it. It works decently well for that purpose, but so would a $1.50 tub of vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The search for a good eczema product continues... -_-</li>
            <li> Husband uses this product and likes it.</li>
            <li> I have eczema primarily on the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands.  I haven&#x27;t had a severe breakout in the past two years, but at its worst, it took several prednisone treatments to get it under control.  Once under control, I was using a product by Ferndale Laboratories called SBR-Lipocream (skin barrier cream).  I used the SBR cream mainly after showering (hydrating the skin, and sealing in the moisture), and it worked great to keep my eczema under control.  Ferndale has discontinued that product (though they have newer products that I have not tried).  When I was looking for a replacement, I ran across good reviews of Psorzema Cream and decided to give it a try.  My eczema is mild compared to others, but I have to say that this is the best creme I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many).  Not only does it quickly clear up my minor breakouts, it immediately relieves the itching.  I&#x27;ve bought many many items through amazon, and been happy with every purchase, but this is the first purchase that compelled me to write a reivew.  I&#x27;ve been using Psorzema for the past 6 months, and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ideal for dry and or sensitive skin. Not heavy, but still hydrates. I use the Psorzema body and face wash along with this cream all year long.</li>
            <li> For a while, I thought was suffering from rosacea. The dermatologist tried a few treatments on me that ALL fried my skin and left me worse off than I was to begin with. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year and a half now along with pine tar soap which is very moisturizing and the red, blotchy is almost completely gone and my skin feels smooth and soft now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was buying this in the health food stores (for approximately $15), but sometimes I can find it on amazon for 3-5 dollars cheaper. Plus I don&#x27;t have to pay for the gas to drive there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (7/21/14): I&#x27;m still using this cream religiously and my face is still doing so much better. If I miss a day, I notice a difference immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I have even been using it on my boyfriend&#x27;s rosacea and psoriasis and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> OI use this product for dry skin and psoriasis. It keeps it under control until the arrival of warm and sunny days..which work even better!</li>
            <li> I have excema and have to change products every 5 years or so.  Been using for about a year and so far so good</li>
            <li> I really like Derma-E products and have had great experiences using the various creams and serums.  I have tried the Psorzema creme a few times in the hopes that maybe it would help at some point but, unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t.  On it&#x27;s own, it barely moisturizes my skin, much less help my eczema.  Maybe I have to use more but it&#x27;s pretty expensive for the size.  It works better in combination with another lotion/creme but doesn&#x27;t work any better with the body wash of the same name.  I wouldn&#x27;t judge other Derma-E products based solely on this one though.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me</li>
            <li> Psorzema is probably the only non-prescription cream that works on my eczema.  I get itchy, red, rashy patches, sometimes with tiny blisters, on my hands and forearms, due to my incredibly sensitive skin and necessary hand washing.  I use this at night and see relief by morning, but I do need to use consistently or the ezcema comes back.  This cream doesn&#x27;t really make my skin feel moisturized, it just calms the eczema.  Once I get it under control, most &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; lotions work fine to keep my hands soft.  One unexpected benefit - I had a tattoo done recently and was directed to put Curel lotion on it 3x daily during the healing process.  I used Psorzema instead and it really helped with the redness, flaking, and it healed beautifully.</li>
            <li> My thinking is that the people who use this cream may not have as severe skin like I do. Cream feels excellent putting it on, nice and rich, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and by morning my skin is flaking off again, so the cream is nice but I could get the same effect with a 7 dollar cream that wears away in a few hours and leaves my skin just as dry.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate eczema on my face for the last 6 years (eyebrow area, nose, chin and cheeks). It just showed up one day and never left. I was searching on amazon for something to help because I was desperate. My face was red, itchy, scaly and I was at my wits end. I read the reviews and couldn&#x27;t really believe what I was reading. So, I figured $15 isn&#x27;t bad for something that at least works as a moisturizer and if it helps my eczema, it&#x27;s a bonus. Well, bonus, so far 2 days in and I&#x27;ve not had any severe redness the scaling is better and no itchies. My recommendation is to wash your face in the shower and make sure to clear off any scaling with a wash. Then put this cream on it right after your shower, it has done a world of good so far. I will update my review in a month and adjust the stars if necessary, but so far, this works.</li>
            <li> Been using this cream for about 5 yrs and use nothing else. Not greasy and very gentle on my rosacea.</li>
            <li> this cream is incredibly soothing.  I was hoping it would also treat, but it does not.  I discovered they have another product to try however.  I have not yet tried it.</li>
            <li> For the past year, I had extremely dry skin on my nose that would flake and peel. It was embarassing as it made my nose red as well, and I even had someone joke that I looked like an alcoholic... not the impression I want to give! I tried various solutions and nothing seemed to work. I started to suspect that I had seborrheic dermatitis which apparently can only be managed with no permanent solution. I had various, expensive, very heavy and greasy creams recommended to me to use, which seemed to help some, but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product in the &#x27;natural section&#x27; of my base&#x27;s commissary and since the price was good and I had nothing to lose, I gave it a try. I was surprised by how light weight and quick absorbing this cream is, especially compared to the thick heavy creams I had been using. I put a big glob on my nose and didn&#x27;t rub it in at all and it fully absorbed. Each time this happened I added more, about 4 times before I went to bed that night just to really give it my all. I will say that that first night of using it, it did sting a little each time I applied it. The next morning I was amazed when my nose did not look flaky at all! I was completely shocked that this product seemed to &#x27;work overnight&#x27;. I continued to apply the cream morning and evening and after a couple days I was dismayed to see some flaking return. However, this time was different, over the next week, thick pieces of skin began to peel off my nose, revealing healthy, normal skin underneith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for two months now and I am happy to say that the skin on my nose now looks completely normal, soft, smooth, flake free, not red at all. I plan on continuing to use this cream as I don&#x27;t want the condition to return, but as this is a large 4oz jar and I only need a little for my nose, I think this jar will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> As Advertised.  Good Price.  Controls itching and rash if used daily.  Noticeable difference after a couple of days.  Will order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks on my scalp and it has made a huge difference with my dry scalp</li>
            <li> I have used MANY expensive creams, and PRESCRIPTION CREAMS, for my horrible rosacea and NOTHING has helped as much as this stuff.  At least give it one try if you have a problem with redness or any other skin problem.  I also gave some to a girlfriend who has exzema on her hands and it has really helped her. more than medicine she got from her dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my face. It was diagnosed by a dermatologist earlier this year. I have been using [[ASIN:B001B4S0YC Psoriasin Psoriasis Relief, Multi-Symptom, Topical Ointment, 4 oz.]] ever since the diagnosis. It was working well at first, but the effectiveness is falling off a bit, so I switched to this for a week to see if it would work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this did not work better. I do like that it does not smell funny, it does not sting, it did not make my face redder or my psoriasis worse, but it did not make any improvements, either. After the third day of using this, all the scaliness and redness came back, exactly like what happens when I stop using the psoriasin for three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this two stars because it does not work for me. I can&#x27;t say \\&quot;it&#x27;s okay\\&quot; which is the definition of a three star review, because it is not okay in terms of actually improving my psoriasis. It makes no difference. But I am grateful that at least it was not super-expensive and it did not make my face look worse.</li>
            <li> I am going crazy trying to find the right product for eczema. I have been using pine tar soap and olive soap for cleansing, then argan oil and/or tamanu oil with Kiehls body lotion and Aveeno Anti-Itch Cortisone cream on top of that. I have read that cortisone is not good to use long term because when you quit using it, the eczema comes on twice as bad and then there is the issue of cortisone being absorbed into your system thus causing liver damage. Sigh. So I decided to try this because it is - ta DA! - all natural blah blah blah. I put in on and it felt nice initially but within the hour my spots were itching again. I am using tamanu oil under it (I recommend Teliaoils Madagascan tamanu oil) which seems to help. It is a pleasant cream to use, unscented, moderately moisturizing but it really does nothing toward healing the abominable curse that is eczema. I have ordered another product called Gormel cream which has 20% urea in it and we will see how that goes. This Psorzema cream would probably be great for someone who just has sensitive skin but no psoriasis or eczema. It will not worsen the condition but will not help it either - for me, anyway. Good fortune to all those seeking relief and please comment if you know of a good remedy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ******** Update 12/7/2012 ********&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin problem was not eczema at all, it turned out to be a fungal infection - so please take my review with a grain of salt. Since I do not have experience with how it works on psoriasis or eczema, I have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice cream but didn&#x27;t really work for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This product while called a cream is more of a gel like consistency to it.  That&#x27;s not bad, just is.  Consequently when I use it on my scalp it does soften the crustiness but seems also to absorb better than other creams.  If you like the heaviness of the other creams then perhaps you will not prefer this one. I also use DermaZinc Cream - 4 oz which makes my head tingle and is a heavier cream and more fragrent than Psorzema.  I would not give that one up for this.  But I would keep both to use at different times.</li>
            <li> My son has had eczema since he was 8 weeks old.  we have been trying numerous lotions and finally found a combination that seems to wor.  We put this on my son every night after his bath and then put aquaphor on top of it.  We have been doing this for a couple of months and it keeps most of the eczema under control.</li>
            <li> VERY EFFECTIVE ON MY WIFE&#x27;S ECZEMA.....</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful for my daughter&#x27;s skin. We have almost completely eliminated the need for steroid creams with the use of this homeopathic cream.</li>
            <li> Derma E products are awesome...and natural.  This is one of several I use.  Has really helped my dry, dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers terribly from rashes, especially on his hands.  After many frustrating conversations and visits with the dermatologist, and too many prescriptions of steroids, I began a relentless research, much of it on my beloved Amazon.com. I took the advice of reviewers here who said this product, Derma E Psorzema, works.  They were right.  Sometimes the hype is real.  My husband was able to curb use of steroids (he cannot completely stop using them) for long stretches of time.  He keeps a jar at hand wherever he is -- at home, office, even in the car. This product just works for him, and many, many other products did not.  For us, it has been like a miracle salve.</li>
            <li> This cream really does wonders for dry and rash-prone skin.  If you use it immediately after showing, it keeps skin soft and balanced all day without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful after reading so many positive reviews. However, this didn&#x27;t work for my eczema. It may work for yours, though.&lt;br /&gt;This cream caused a burning sensation on the eczema-affected skin. I&#x27;m going back to what I&#x27;ve been using, an organic salve for eczema.</li>
            <li> My hands were very raw, from itching so much, so I selected this cream, and it was very soothing, did not burn the open cuts.  I am all healed up now, no more rough skin, I apply it 3 or 4 times daily, I am happy that I found this special cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I used this for a while to treat the eczema on my face and neck and saw immediate results. It is a bit expensive for the amount they give you, but the actual product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Its not greasy at all! I use it for spots of psoriasis on my scalp, its never greasy and really helps alleviate the flaking and itching. I will be buying more when this jar is empty.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hand eczema.  It works at keeping the dry skin on my hands soft.  I really like this natural product line.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have severe psoriasis and avoid the topical steroids while BF&#x27;ing.  It helps to calm my skin and lessen the plaques.  I need several tubs to spread onto my skin.  (my body is 90% covered). It works great, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive (no matter where you buy it).  I had no problems with this seller, it arrived in a timely manner and the packaging ensured no damage.</li>
