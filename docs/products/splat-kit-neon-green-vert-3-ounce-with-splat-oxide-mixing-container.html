            <li>This is got to be the best hair dye ever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost everything out there and this brand works unbelievably great!</li>
            <li>The bleach that comes with it is awesome!</li>
            <li>My son was very happy.</li>
            <li>We are both VERY PLEASED!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I guess fading is just the price you have to pay for awesome hair!</li>
            <li>Despite this, it is the best brightly colored hair dye I have gotten.</li>
            <li>I like Splat as a hair dye and the Lusty lavender and purple work great.</li>
            <li>Bleach works great though.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Great product,fast ship[ping.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>but I loved it.</li>
            <li>The product itself is of good quality.</li>
            <li>and I thought it looked really good.</li>
            <li>would pick another color, but don&#x27;t blaim the brand, I have had good experience with Splat... just not this color.</li>
            <li>It was extremely potent and dyes anything it touches!</li>
            <li>and i always love the results!</li>
            <li>but honestly i would i use it again</li>
            <li>It kind of gets on your hands too since it bleeds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a brunette, and I didn&#x27;t wanna bleach because it would have taken 40 minutes (EW) and honestly don&#x27;t wanna burn my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice color but</li>
            <li>It was packaged like new and had excellent color.</li>
            <li>well i used luscious rasberry and the color was great when i first did it</li>
            <li>I am happy with how it turned out when I first put it however but fading is fading</li>
            <li>It is very very light even after two applications of the dye.</li>
            <li>The color was way more Magenta/red</li>
            <li>;I love splat dyes...easy to bleach and color</li>
            <li>but the others are OK</li>
            <li>I used most of the colors from Splat</li>
            <li>I love that it contains bleach with it too and don&#x27;t have to buy that separately.</li>
            <li>Especially if it is hot and you are sweating a lot.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Its a bit more neony than I wanted</li>
            <li>I love splat.</li>
            <li>and i love amazons deals .</li>
            <li>Both the latter worked awesome for me.</li>
            <li>(She has two-tone hair this year, teenagers are so interesting ....).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not 100 percent sure,</li>
            <li>I really do love it, and</li>
            <li>I did add a bit more about 30 min in since it appeared to be lacking.  </li>
            <li>I lathered my goatee in the dye and then after I was done worked it in more with the disposable gloves that comes with.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dye.</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and they fade nicely too with washing which is good, I don&#x27;t like dyeing my hair more than once a month or so.</li>
            <li>I have been dyeing my hair for years with fun colors and this product is by far the best!</li>
            <li>This was a very cool color.</li>
            <li>I especially love the pink.</li>
            <li>It fades very quickly though.</li>
            <li>ok this neon green shade is perfect</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instructions are so easy even a caveman can do it.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow this stuff does what it says and every color is bright and vivid!</li>
            <li>Thankfully both the dye and bleach were fine to use.</li>
            <li>Have fun with this, but I think there are better products.</li>
            <li>Splat is fantastic product.</li>
            <li>but the neon green was THE best colour that i have used .</li>
            <li>The color is great and it shipped pretty fast, but it just fades so quickly.</li>
            <li>right, sure.</li>
            <li>But the instructions were super easy</li>
            <li>the official spat website is well i couldnt find the original website</li>
            <li>This is the best green I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>bleach is pretty decent too    lasted a good time</li>
            <li>the color doesn&#x27;t come out as bright as the box unless you have bleach blonde hair</li>
            <li>Son did full head dye job.</li>
            <li>the color faded fast even with color safe shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>--maybe both will be cool.  </li>
            <li>Happy to have found the green easily online since its not sold in stores.</li>
            <li>I now use better brands such as punky color, paint box, special effects all better than this one</li>
            <li>Other than that, it would great.</li>
            <li>The seller was quick to ship and it got here in 2 days through USPS.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and the color faded really quickly</li>
            <li>i have dyed my hair many times and it only gets better each time i dye it .</li>
            <li>This is to be expected from any bright colored hair dye, but it just faded so quick.</li>
            <li>but i follow the splat name trust me its worth it</li>
            <li>Washes right out</li>
            <li>Except for the inch right at the scalp</li>
            <li>If you want it to be really bright and permanent and remove that &#x27;hollow&#x27; look, you can color again (no bleach) a week after the first application.</li>
            <li>love the green, always love splat but color fades to quick</li>
            <li>and it grows back, if you are lucky, he says:).</li>
            <li>The color was supposed to be a beautiful vibrant green</li>
            <li>The color is nice and vibrant, but it washes out the next shower.</li>
            <li>And my order came soooo fast!</li>
            <li>My first hint should have been the lack of bleaching liquid.</li>
            <li>overall product could be better doe.</li>
            <li>make sure you have almost white bleached hair</li>
            <li>Great coverage, long lasting die.</li>
            <li>If you get a extra bleach you can use the color more than once.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would still work so that is the only reason I did it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to put a towel on your pillow for a few days.</li>
            <li>It was not completely white, but good enough for what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please be sure to check for expiration dates on your products before use, and do not buy online because you never know how long it&#x27;s been sitting on the stockroom shelf.</li>
            <li>I love Splat, it&#x27;s inexpensive and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>The lighter you bleach your hair, the longer the color will last and it will be WAY more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Extremely good color and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The kit is a good all-in-one package, if you have really thick long hair you might need more than one kit.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so please help because i really wanna dye my hair</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a better priced green so it was worth the money</li>
            <li>The color is nice but fades much more quickly than Splat&#x27;s red or purple and requires more frequent touch-ups with the impossible application bottle.</li>
            <li>and I really likes the vibrant color while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the green anywhere near me and I am glad I found it here because it was affordable as well!</li>
            <li>After several cuts 2 1/2 months later, top still has color.</li>
            <li>would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone and you would be better off buying a different product.</li>
            <li>He found the red quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using hair gel or Vaseline or something to put around the edge of your hair and all over your ears to keep it from dying your skin.</li>
            <li>Mixed the green with a light blue for a nice turquoise.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be better than the little clip on colored hair pieces you get at the mall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything pretty much, everything the US makes and have even bought stuff outside the country.</li>
            <li>His hair was really green and it stays bright for a long time.</li>
            <li>I was looking more for a florescent lime green.  </li>
            <li>it got to me on time and it turned my hair green witch is what i wanted to happen :)</li>
            <li>I hadnt been able to find Neon Green anywhere near me</li>
            <li>Vibrant color that looks professionally done (when correctly applied of course).</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown, and the lightener that it comes with is enough to get my hair nearly white before dyeing.</li>
            <li>The instructions were smudged, and I was thankful I had used other splat products before and was familiar with the bleaching and dying process.</li>
            <li>I purchased this color because most of the other splat colors were available in stores except this one (and a few others, like orange, yellow, etc.)</li>
            <li>We used other bleach we had on hand and the green color came out nice, but it fades super fast, way faster than some of the other colors.  </li>
            <li>The first time I dyed my hair, I had to do it three times before the color would stick and actually appear green and, after that, I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with extra dye twice more to maintain the color.</li>
            <li>Her costume is complete now.</li>
            <li>I have tried natural instincts, a reddish color called raspberry creme, and I&#x27;ve tried a color of fuchsia from another brand.</li>
            <li>Only place the die really takes is on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any one who wants to have a different look.</li>
            <li>but I THINK the problem with the seller is they do stockpile old boxes as another reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li>I decided to rinse it shortly after my hour passed, and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I completely understand why after doing this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinse with cool water until mostly clear, and dry immediately, again with a hair dryer if possible.</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE NEON GREEN HAIR DYE!!  </li>
            <li>Also be aware that the bleach works really well and fast, at least on my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t prove this, but the color barely took on my bleached hair and was completely gone in a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I agree with some of the other reviews, the bleach was only partially full</li>
            <li>Been using for 2 years now , product kinda sucks , i wash in cold water with mild shampoo but the color seems to start to fad after the first wash, the only reason i still buy is because i mix this with another blue color to give a great look,&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use neon green, I used luscious raspberries, but I bet the green is just as effective.</li>
            <li>Its a great product, I wish it was a little less messy though.</li>
            <li>It can stain a lot if you are not careful :</li>
            <li>I am most curious to see if the green works as well as the blue.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely not going to be using Splat products again, and I&#x27;ve already purchased my new hair color from a different company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use it again because the color looks really fake, but it is super fun.</li>
            <li>normally, and dry throughly preferably with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes several minutes to wash out the excess in your hair but this time it only took about 10 seconds...and i was left with bleached hair.</li>
            <li>Green is hard to find out in the real world, so I ordered it via Amazon, was really easy.</li>
            <li>only thing I did not like was that my intended color was less toward the blue and more toward the green.  </li>
            <li>After the recommended 30 minutes I rinsed in the shower and washed it (as the instructions stated which is strange since normal over the counter hair dye requires you let it dry after the rinse).  </li>
            <li>It worked as directed, faded a little fast but no problem.</li>
            <li>Very intriguing, because gray hair is usually very hard to dye.  </li>

            <li> The kit is a good all-in-one package, if you have really thick long hair you might need more than one kit.  </li>
            <li> and I really like this product.</li>
            <li> so please help because i really wanna dye my hair</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a better priced green so it was worth the money</li>
            <li> The color is nice but fades much more quickly than Splat&#x27;s red or purple and requires more frequent touch-ups with the impossible application bottle.</li>
            <li> and I really likes the vibrant color while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the green anywhere near me and I am glad I found it here because it was affordable as well!</li>
            <li> After several cuts 2 1/2 months later, top still has color.</li>
            <li> would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone and you would be better off buying a different product.</li>
            <li> He found the red quickly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using hair gel or Vaseline or something to put around the edge of your hair and all over your ears to keep it from dying your skin.</li>
            <li> Mixed the green with a light blue for a nice turquoise.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be better than the little clip on colored hair pieces you get at the mall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything pretty much, everything the US makes and have even bought stuff outside the country.</li>
            <li> His hair was really green and it stays bright for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was looking more for a florescent lime green.  </li>
            <li> it got to me on time and it turned my hair green witch is what i wanted to happen :)</li>
            <li> I hadnt been able to find Neon Green anywhere near me</li>
            <li> Vibrant color that looks professionally done (when correctly applied of course).</li>
            <li> My hair is light brown, and the lightener that it comes with is enough to get my hair nearly white before dyeing.</li>
            <li> The instructions were smudged, and I was thankful I had used other splat products before and was familiar with the bleaching and dying process.</li>
            <li> I purchased this color because most of the other splat colors were available in stores except this one (and a few others, like orange, yellow, etc.)</li>
            <li> We used other bleach we had on hand and the green color came out nice, but it fades super fast, way faster than some of the other colors.  </li>
            <li> The first time I dyed my hair, I had to do it three times before the color would stick and actually appear green and, after that, I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with extra dye twice more to maintain the color.</li>
            <li> Her costume is complete now.</li>
            <li> I have tried natural instincts, a reddish color called raspberry creme, and I&#x27;ve tried a color of fuchsia from another brand.</li>
            <li> Only place the die really takes is on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any one who wants to have a different look.</li>
            <li> but I THINK the problem with the seller is they do stockpile old boxes as another reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I decided to rinse it shortly after my hour passed, and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I completely understand why after doing this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinse with cool water until mostly clear, and dry immediately, again with a hair dryer if possible.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE NEON GREEN HAIR DYE!!  </li>
            <li> Also be aware that the bleach works really well and fast, at least on my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t prove this, but the color barely took on my bleached hair and was completely gone in a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews, the bleach was only partially full</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 years now , product kinda sucks , i wash in cold water with mild shampoo but the color seems to start to fad after the first wash, the only reason i still buy is because i mix this with another blue color to give a great look,&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use neon green, I used luscious raspberries, but I bet the green is just as effective.</li>
            <li> Its a great product, I wish it was a little less messy though.</li>
            <li> It can stain a lot if you are not careful :</li>
            <li> I am most curious to see if the green works as well as the blue.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely not going to be using Splat products again, and I&#x27;ve already purchased my new hair color from a different company.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use it again because the color looks really fake, but it is super fun.</li>
            <li> normally, and dry throughly preferably with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Normally it takes several minutes to wash out the excess in your hair but this time it only took about 10 seconds...and i was left with bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Green is hard to find out in the real world, so I ordered it via Amazon, was really easy.</li>
            <li> only thing I did not like was that my intended color was less toward the blue and more toward the green.  </li>
            <li> After the recommended 30 minutes I rinsed in the shower and washed it (as the instructions stated which is strange since normal over the counter hair dye requires you let it dry after the rinse).  </li>
            <li> It worked as directed, faded a little fast but no problem.</li>
            <li> Very intriguing, because gray hair is usually very hard to dye.  </li>
            <li> However, when it arrived in the mail, although the thick, protective packaging was dry and fine, the inside (aka the product) was soaked and crushed.</li>
            <li> green, super green... hair.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The product must have been expired or old because it was extremely runny and did not color the hair at all!</li>
            <li> He has used every color, because he gets bored so easy.</li>
            <li> After a few washes it is completely just yellow like when I bleached it</li>
            <li> the other colors I have from Splat that I got from Walmart stay in weeks, months and barely fade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here I am, almost four weeks after the initial dying, and my hair has turned to a strange greenish-yellow color already after only washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> blue, pink, orange, purple, red, black, white, yellow, and brown .</li>
            <li> Neon Green Complete Kit (1 Application)]]</li>
            <li> i just want something that is temporary for about 2 weeks not completely permenante</li>
            <li> Not much rinsed out for me in the shower, and when washing it the lathered shampoo only had a slight green tint meaning that it did not pull much out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Splat colors just seem to last longer than any other brand (This is my 5th color from them).  </li>
            <li> IT didn&#x27;t last very long as compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do NOT wash for about 3 days, and try to keep it dry.</li>
            <li> Did dry over time, so kept straying with a squirt bottle to keep it moist.  </li>
            <li> I followed all the directions, we left the bleach in for 30 minutes, same with the green dye (I was doing my husbands hair).</li>
            <li> This kit is designed for single use, however in my case I am going to use it again and again.  </li>
            <li> Also be careful how close to the scalp you apply the dye, it will leave spots, that may stay as long as the color in your hair does.</li>
            <li> and i have called the splat company for having this problem with a previous product from splat and they never called back</li>
            <li> Being that I cannot read neanderthal, I am unable to confirm that a caveman could actually read the instructions, however its pretty basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The box I received was already open and the color was not full.</li>
            <li> I proceded to apply it like i usually do and after it had set long enough</li>
            <li> but then SOON faded to pink, Once u used pink</li>
            <li> (She used their pink color, however.)</li>
            <li> I got this color (green) from the seller: 360Living last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> placed the green dye in the second mixing bowl and used that to place on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try green now, and we&#x27;ll have to figure out what to do with the blue</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried blue and pink Splat, we&#x27;re soon to try the green ...</li>
            <li> However, this batch of green must have been really old and past useable date.</li>
            <li> I recommend this hair dye over any other.</li>
            <li> The bottle of hair dye that i got was basically food coloring and some other liquid.</li>
            <li> Longer than any other products.</li>
            <li> consistency, the dye it self wasn&#x27;t like the other colors they provide&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I believe the seller has a large stockpile of old kits that have gone bad.</li>
            <li> Not really neon green as expected.</li>
            <li> My son wanted green dye so he can color his hair red and green for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to only have half as much as other colors I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair</li>
            <li> I usually do pink but went green for the Packers.....</li>
            <li> I mean big time.</li>
            <li> all other green dyes..just dont cut it  </li>
            <li> I will probably dye it black just to cover it up.</li>
            <li> I say \\&quot;we\\&quot; because it&#x27;s my daughter that has half her hair bleached blond, and that&#x27;s the part we&#x27;re coloring</li>
            <li> color was a goopy, oozy mess.</li>
            <li> i dyed my hair other colours and the slightest touch might rub off and bleed onto things but splats neon green allowed me to style my hair for a few months .</li>
            <li> The bleach was in such a bad way that we couldn&#x27;t actually get it out of the bottle, and the actual dye washed out in 3 showers (this brand usually lasts for almost 2 months.)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste a dollar on this stuff.</li>
            <li> This green looks nothing like on the box at all.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t green anymore.</li>
            <li> neon green  </li>
            <li> if you have to buy any colour dye buy SPLAT&#x27;s neon green .</li>
            <li> It lasted a beautful green for 2 weeks, then just DIED.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> It has been 3 months and my hair is still mostly green.</li>
            <li> Did the green twice, once for over an hour, and after a week, it is still gone.</li>
            <li> Heed my warning and dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> After hitting a few stores, we decided to give the internet a try.  </li>
            <li> I had to redye it almost destroying my hair :</li>
            <li> My college kid had green hair, as requested.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other Splat colors, this one came in a hard plastic bottle that cannot be squeezed when applying the color and is pain in the butt to work with.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see it offered from Amazon directly) or the seller, but the product is very bad, is a waste of money and barely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to have hair past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> The bleach is blue in color so even after looking in the mirror it was difficult to tell how well it was working.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I understand that green is a difficult color to maintain in comparison to other colors, it shouldn&#x27;t be this difficult.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is not a good product starts to fade a few days after applying​ it.</li>
            <li> I used to go to a very expensive salon that would put colored streaks in my silver-gray hair (natural color now).  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard for colors to take to my hair, even with bleach.</li>
            <li> The bleach was extremely thick...</li>
            <li> but what we ended up with was a pale ugly green color</li>
            <li> Well this stuff SUCKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used splat hair dye over the last 2 years and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Runny, thin and doesnt dye even if you just used the bleach that came with it.</li>
            <li> This person followed all instructions with poor results.  </li>
            <li> Im sort of an expert at dying my hair weird colors.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> sorry :T</li>
            <li> Waist of money because without the activator liquid the product is useless!</li>
            <li> I use the Splat brand often, and have not been disappointed until this purchase.</li>
            <li> CRAP CRAP CRAP.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is just terrific. The seller was quick to ship and it got here in 2 days through USPS. Splat is the product I have stuck with for 6 years or so now, and would never leave it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Walgreens. I didn&#x27;t use neon green, I used luscious raspberries, but I bet the green is just as effective. It was extremely potent and dyes anything it touches! I highly recommend using hair gel or Vaseline or something to put around the edge of your hair and all over your ears to keep it from dying your skin. Also be careful how close to the scalp you apply the dye, it will leave spots, that may stay as long as the color in your hair does. The color was way more Magenta/red then deep red like I thought it showed on the box. Also be aware that the bleach works really well and fast, at least on my hair. I won&#x27;t use it again because the color looks really fake, but it is super fun. I don&#x27;t think the dye is as toxic as a lot of dyes, but the bleach is of course. Have fun with this, but I think there are better products.</li>
            <li> I usually do pink but went green for the Packers.....;I love splat dyes...easy to bleach and color</li>
            <li> Im sort of an expert at dying my hair weird colors. I&#x27;ve used everything pretty much, everything the US makes and have even bought stuff outside the country. Well this stuff SUCKS! I mean big time. If you&#x27;ve tried manic panic, this stuff is just like it. Runny, thin and doesnt dye even if you just used the bleach that came with it. I followed all the directions, we left the bleach in for 30 minutes, same with the green dye (I was doing my husbands hair). It is YELLOW today. CRAP CRAP CRAP. I wouldn&#x27;t waste a dollar on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like Splat as a hair dye and the Lusty lavender and purple work great. This green looks nothing like on the box at all. It is very very light even after two applications of the dye. I am upset with the color of this. I will probably dye it black just to cover it up. Do not buy this color dye Splat but the others are OK</li>
            <li> This is got to be the best hair dye ever! I&#x27;ve used almost everything out there and this brand works unbelievably great! I have dark hair so it&#x27;s hard for colors to take to my hair, even with bleach. The bleach that comes with it is awesome! And my order came soooo fast! I will definitely order from these guys again![[ASIN:B003GQYRUY Splat Rebellious Colors Neon Green Complete Kit (1 Application)]]</li>
            <li> well i used luscious rasberry and the color was great when i first did it but then SOON faded to pink, Once u used pink and it faded to orangeish but it could just be my hair wont take the color or something but honestly i would i use it again it just fades soon and colors scalp AND BEWARE: IT WILL STAIN FORHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Splat is fantastic product. I especially love the pink. However, this batch of green must have been really old and past useable date. My first hint should have been the lack of bleaching liquid. It seemed to only have half as much as other colors I&#x27;ve used in the past. Within a few minutes of putting it on my hair, it began to really burn. Immediately washing it out, my hair came out in fistfuls and clumps. I used to have hair past my shoulders. Now, it&#x27;s pixie-length. Please be sure to check for expiration dates on your products before use, and do not buy online because you never know how long it&#x27;s been sitting on the stockroom shelf.</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 years now , product kinda sucks , i wash in cold water with mild shampoo but the color seems to start to fad after the first wash, the only reason i still buy is because i mix this with another blue color to give a great look,&lt;br /&gt;But overall product could be better doe.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product starts to fade a few days after applying​ it.</li>
            <li> I used most of the colors from Splat and I really like this product. The colors are vibrant and they fade nicely too with washing which is good, I don&#x27;t like dyeing my hair more than once a month or so. I love that it contains bleach with it too and don&#x27;t have to buy that separately. Its a great product, I wish it was a little less messy though. It can stain a lot if you are not careful :P.</li>
            <li> I use the Splat brand often, and have not been disappointed until this purchase. I believe the seller has a large stockpile of old kits that have gone bad. The bleach was in such a bad way that we couldn&#x27;t actually get it out of the bottle, and the actual dye washed out in 3 showers (this brand usually lasts for almost 2 months.) Would not purchase from this retailer again.</li>
            <li> Washes right out and you&#x27;re left with bleached hair. It rained and the color dripped all over my shirt..I know it says semi-permanent, but this is aweful.</li>
            <li> The product must have been expired or old because it was extremely runny and did not color the hair at all! The color was supposed to be a beautiful vibrant green but what we ended up with was a pale ugly green color, looks washed out and did not last at all! Will never purchase this again!</li>
            <li> i just want something that is temporary for about 2 weeks not completely permenante so please help because i really wanna dye my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used splat hair dye over the last 2 years and have never been disappointed. It works so well with my hair and i always love the results! I recommend this hair dye over any other.</li>
            <li> This was a very cool color. It fades very quickly though. After a few washes it is completely just yellow like when I bleached it but it isn&#x27;t green anymore. I am happy with how it turned out when I first put it however but fading is fading and it doesn&#x27;t last long. It kind of gets on your hands too since it bleeds. Especially if it is hot and you are sweating a lot. But the instructions were super easy and I really likes the vibrant color while it lasted.</li>
            <li> the reason for me not liking it is because i had it in for a week then it faded out and i have called the splat company for having this problem with a previous product from splat and they never called back</li>
            <li> My son was very happy. His hair was really green and it stays bright for a long time.</li>
            <li> Son did full head dye job. After several cuts 2 1/2 months later, top still has color. This brand lasts and the colors show just as the box. Every time he uses splat we cant go anywhere with kids and adults complimenting him.</li>
            <li> Not really neon green as expected. Bleach works great though. Mixed the green with a light blue for a nice turquoise.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and the color faded really quickly</li>
            <li> Extremely good color and long lasting. As per another review I left the bleach in for an hour, spritzing with water occasionally since it stops bleaching if it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash normally, and dry throughly preferably with a hair dryer. Apply the color, and leave on for 2-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse with cool water until mostly clear, and dry immediately, again with a hair dryer if possible. Do NOT wash for about 3 days, and try to keep it dry. It&#x27;s a good idea to put a towel on your pillow for a few days. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The liquid was spilled out in the box and the instructions ruined. Waist of money because without the activator liquid the product is useless! Waist of money!</li>
            <li> Its a bit more neony than I wanted but I loved it. I couldn&#x27;t find a better priced green so it was worth the money</li>
            <li> Unlike the other Splat colors, this one came in a hard plastic bottle that cannot be squeezed when applying the color and is pain in the butt to work with. The color is nice but fades much more quickly than Splat&#x27;s red or purple and requires more frequent touch-ups with the impossible application bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this color because most of the other splat colors were available in stores except this one (and a few others, like orange, yellow, etc.) The product itself is of good quality. However, when it arrived in the mail, although the thick, protective packaging was dry and fine, the inside (aka the product) was soaked and crushed. Thankfully both the dye and bleach were fine to use. The instructions were smudged, and I was thankful I had used other splat products before and was familiar with the bleaching and dying process. The box was ripped to shreds.. I don&#x27;t know if this is the company or the mailmen but whoever it was just ruined my day.</li>
            <li> I love splat. Always have. Happy to have found the green easily online since its not sold in stores. Her costume is complete now.</li>
            <li> I havent purchased this from amazon   but i have bought it at walgreens    MY FAVORITE NEON GREEN HAIR DYE!!  it is ...neon green  all other green dyes..just dont cut it  make sure you have almost white bleached hair tho  bleach is pretty decent too    lasted a good time</li>
            <li> ok this neon green shade is perfect i have dyed my hair many times and it only gets better each time i dye it . blue, pink, orange, purple, red, black, white, yellow, and brown . but the neon green was THE best colour that i have used . it lasts the longest out of all of the dyes and SPLAT is now my only source of hair dye and i love amazons deals . so it all ties in toghether . i dyed my hair other colours and the slightest touch might rub off and bleed onto things but splats neon green allowed me to style my hair for a few months . thats all that realy matters . if you have to buy any colour dye buy SPLAT&#x27;s neon green . the official spat website is well i couldnt find the original website but i follow the splat name trust me its worth it</li>
            <li> I tried this a year ago, (bought it from H-E-B)  It lasted a beautful green for 2 weeks, then just DIED.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting..right, sure. I&#x27;m a brunette, and I didn&#x27;t wanna bleach because it would have taken 40 minutes (EW) and honestly don&#x27;t wanna burn my hair. Buy this by experiment only, don&#x27;t buy if you need that look for something weeks later. I have tried natural instincts, a reddish color called raspberry creme, and I&#x27;ve tried a color of fuchsia from another brand. Both the latter worked awesome for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best green I have ever used!  It has been 3 months and my hair is still mostly green. Splat colors just seem to last longer than any other brand (This is my 5th color from them).  The kit is a good all-in-one package, if you have really thick long hair you might need more than one kit.  The lighter you bleach your hair, the longer the color will last and it will be WAY more vibrant.  If you want it to be really bright and permanent and remove that &#x27;hollow&#x27; look, you can color again (no bleach) a week after the first application.</li>
            <li> The box I received was already open and the color was not full. I used it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;The color was a goopy, oozy mess. IT didn&#x27;t last very long as compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried blue and pink Splat, we&#x27;re soon to try the green ... I say \\&quot;we\\&quot; because it&#x27;s my daughter that has half her hair bleached blond, and that&#x27;s the part we&#x27;re coloring (She has two-tone hair this year, teenagers are so interesting ....). Green is hard to find out in the real world, so I ordered it via Amazon, was really easy.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Granddaughters just had to have this. Thought it would be better than the little clip on colored hair pieces you get at the mall. WRONG. Only place the die really takes is on the scalp. Did the green twice, once for over an hour, and after a week, it is still gone. Except for the inch right at the scalp LOL</li>
            <li> green, super green... hair.  didn&#x27;t wash out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Splat hair dye for about 2 years and never once was i dissappointed. Until this. I hadnt been able to find Neon Green anywhere near me so i decided to buy on here. When i opened the box i noiced there was about only 1/4 of the \\&quot;Splat Oxide\\&quot; in its bottle. Even then it still worked, but not well. After i had my hair bleached i decided it was time for the dye. I proceded to apply it like i usually do and after it had set long enough (looked like it should) i went to wash out the excess. Normally it takes several minutes to wash out the excess in your hair but this time it only took about 10 seconds...and i was left with bleached hair. NO DYE STAYED! The bottle of hair dye that i got was basically food coloring and some other liquid. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SCAM! Heed my warning and dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Packaging was just awful, but the hair dye is wonderful and turns out well</li>
            <li> I bought Splat because my friend used it in her hair and I thought it looked really good. (She used their pink color, however.) I only dyed the front part of my hair (all the hair in front of my ears). The first time I dyed my hair, I had to do it three times before the color would stick and actually appear green and, after that, I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with extra dye twice more to maintain the color. In addition, I&#x27;ve tried mixing the color with my shampoo (as suggested by the company). Here I am, almost four weeks after the initial dying, and my hair has turned to a strange greenish-yellow color already after only washing my hair every other day. I am definitely not going to be using Splat products again, and I&#x27;ve already purchased my new hair color from a different company.&lt;br /&gt;While I understand that green is a difficult color to maintain in comparison to other colors, it shouldn&#x27;t be this difficult.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely NOT recommend this product to anyone and you would be better off buying a different product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter and she LOVES it!!!!! I recommend this product to any one who wants to have a different look. We are both VERY PLEASED!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews, the bleach was only partially full and I had to wonder if it had spilled somewhere in the process or evaporated or something.  We used other bleach we had on hand and the green color came out nice, but it fades super fast, way faster than some of the other colors.  Still, it did what we wanted it to do, just wish it had lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I got this color (green) from the seller: 360Living last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not 100 percent sure, but I THINK the problem with the seller is they do stockpile old boxes as another reviewer mentioned.  I can&#x27;t prove this, but the color barely took on my bleached hair and was completely gone in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the other colors I have from Splat that I got from Walmart stay in weeks, months and barely fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t know if it was the color (I would try again but they don&#x27;t have it in town and I don&#x27;t see it offered from Amazon directly) or the seller, but the product is very bad, is a waste of money and barely works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pick another color, but don&#x27;t blaim the brand, I have had good experience with Splat... just not this color.</li>
            <li> My son wanted green dye so he can color his hair red and green for Christmas.  He found the red quickly.  After hitting a few stores, we decided to give the internet a try.  Eureka...he found it!  His sister had recommended this brand. Amazon made it possible!</li>
            <li> love the green, always love splat but color fades to quick</li>
            <li> Great coverage, long lasting die. Vibrant color that looks professionally done (when correctly applied of course).</li>
            <li> When I used this (I store bought it) I used it on my bleach blonde hair however, it did not stick on at all! I just sucked I had to redye it almost destroying my hair :C. I now use better brands such as punky color, paint box, special effects all better than this one sorry :T</li>
            <li> The color is great and it shipped pretty fast, but it just fades so quickly.This is to be expected from any bright colored hair dye, but it just faded so quick. It only lasted about 2 weeks. Despite this, it is the best brightly colored hair dye I have gotten. I really do love it, and I guess fading is just the price you have to pay for awesome hair!</li>
            <li> It worked as directed, faded a little fast but no problem. Just follow directions verbatim. Would use it again .</li>
            <li> Will die the scalp but washes out within 2 washes.Great product,fast ship[ping.If you get a extra bleach you can use the color more than once. I did my hair like 4 times just bought extra bleach.</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair for years with fun colors and this product is by far the best! It stays for about 2-4 weeks. Longer than any other products.</li>
            <li> I love Splat, it&#x27;s inexpensive and it lasts a really long time. My hair is light brown, and the lightener that it comes with is enough to get my hair nearly white before dyeing. I&#x27;ve tried every color and it is the only brand that I will use now when coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to dye my goatee.  This stuff works great.  Comes with everything you need except mixing bowl and brushes.  This kit is designed for single use, however in my case I am going to use it again and again.  Instead of using the mixing bottles, I used a couple of bowls and brushes to get the desired look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are so easy even a caveman can do it.  Comes in multiple languages.  Being that I cannot read neanderthal, I am unable to confirm that a caveman could actually read the instructions, however its pretty basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the lightening bleach and left in my hair for just a bit over an hour.  I have a bit darker than medium brown which states 45-50 minutes.  I did add a bit more about 30 min in since it appeared to be lacking.  Did dry over time, so kept straying with a squirt bottle to keep it moist.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would still work so that is the only reason I did it.  The bleach is blue in color so even after looking in the mirror it was difficult to tell how well it was working.  I decided to rinse it shortly after my hour passed, and it worked very well.  It was not completely white, but good enough for what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed the green dye in the second mixing bowl and used that to place on my hair.  I lathered my goatee in the dye and then after I was done worked it in more with the disposable gloves that comes with.  After the recommended 30 minutes I rinsed in the shower and washed it (as the instructions stated which is strange since normal over the counter hair dye requires you let it dry after the rinse).  I completely understand why after doing this.  Not much rinsed out for me in the shower, and when washing it the lathered shampoo only had a slight green tint meaning that it did not pull much out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like was that my intended color was less toward the blue and more toward the green.  I was looking more for a florescent lime green.  Other than that, it would great.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye. It was packaged like new and had excellent color. I couldn&#x27;t find the green anywhere near me and I am glad I found it here because it was affordable as well!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give zero stars, so I put one. The color is nice and vibrant, but it washes out the next shower.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery! Satisfied.</li>
            <li> The bleach was extremely thick...like the texture of honey! We had to add water to it to even use it. But it DID bleach my hair. The dye, however, didn&#x27;t take..at all!</li>
            <li> Nice color but the color faded fast even with color safe shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a friend.  This person followed all instructions with poor results.  I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> it got to me on time and it turned my hair green witch is what i wanted to happen :)</li>
            <li> I used to go to a very expensive salon that would put colored streaks in my silver-gray hair (natural color now).  Sometimes these costly colors would be gone in DAYS.  I finally bought some Blue Splat and had a hairdresser friend put it in--WITHOUT the bleach.  It has stayed in my hair for MONTHS.  I&#x27;m going to try green now, and we&#x27;ll have to figure out what to do with the blue--maybe both will be cool.  Stay tuned.  I am most curious to see if the green works as well as the blue.  Very intriguing, because gray hair is usually very hard to dye.  I&#x27;ve saved a fortune, and everyone loves my blue streaks, including me.</li>
            <li> Worked! My college kid had green hair, as requested.</li>
            <li> My son loves splat! He has used every color, because he gets bored so easy. I keep telling him his hair&#x27;s going to fall out, but it is just hair and it grows back, if you are lucky, he says:). Anyhow this stuff does what it says and every color is bright and vivid!</li>
            <li> 1) There wasn&#x27;t enough developer in the bottle there as like 1/10 of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;2) consistency, the dye it self wasn&#x27;t like the other colors they provide&lt;br /&gt;3) the color doesn&#x27;t come out as bright as the box unless you have bleach blonde hair</li>
