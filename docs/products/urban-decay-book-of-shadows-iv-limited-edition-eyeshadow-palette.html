            <li>I use something else since I wasn&#x27;t really impressed by</li>
            <li>So I chose this beautiful Book of Shadows, and it is perfect.</li>

            <li>The mascara is great as is the primer</li>
            <li>Great deal and great packaging....</li>
            <li>What a great set.  </li>
            <li>The primer is the best one I&#x27;ve used and the mascara is nice as well.</li>
            <li>great for creating night time and wintery looks.</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing!</li>
            <li>She keeps showing up with amazing looking eyes!</li>
            <li>with UD eyeshadows, these shadows are incredibly pigmented and should compliment most skin tones.  </li>
            <li>Primer potion is a good steal too, although I don&#x27;t use it often (the wetness of the potion turns me off a bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything in the palette is useful and the speaker is a great bonus!</li>
            <li>While it is very cute, I loathe the bulkiness of it.  </li>
            <li>Love this eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>In love!</li>
            <li>Wish it was packaged better, bc the shadows are amazing!</li>
            <li>Beautiful Rich Pigments there eyeliner Smooths on Nice.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>The primer potion is one of my favorites for keeping your shadows and liners put all day, and the mascara is nice, it thickens and lengthens lashes.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s a lovely palette with a beautiful range of strong, pigmented colors, but the design frustrates me to tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While applying it after primer is best, these shadows are vibrant even without</li>
            <li>ALMOST ALL THE COLORS ARE NEW EXCEPT FOR LIKE 4 OF THEM WHICH IS GREAT!  </li>
            <li>BUT THIS ONE IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>and I doubt many people will.  </li>
            <li>The top of the pallette has pop-up plastic butterflies.  </li>
            <li>SO MOST PROGRAMS DONT RECOGNIZE IT.  </li>
            <li>I AM ALSO IN LOVE WITH THE MASCARA</li>
            <li>IM JUST IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK OF SHADOWS.  </li>
            <li>HOW ARE THEY GOING TO TOP</li>
            <li>The liquid liner is OKAY, as it is too watery</li>
            <li>When you slide it out, the box opens and it has 3D butterflies, cute.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this brand from YOU.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s still enjoying experimenting with all the colors.</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this make up kit, I would have given it a 5 if the mascara were better quality.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite eye pallette.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I couldn&#x27;t get the QR codes to read and</li>
            <li>I love UD shadows.</li>
            <li>and I love all the liquid liners that UD puts out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always, fabulous eyeshadows!</li>
            <li>More importantly, it has 16 good sized, wonderfully pigmented shadows, mostly shimmer a few matte, a full size 24/7 liquid liner in Perversion</li>
            <li>I LOVE Urban Decay and used to love the Gash line, so this was also a great buy for me</li>
            <li>There are too many unusable colors and the packaging is cheap.  </li>
            <li>All the colors are gorgeous and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I have been Very Loyal to Cover Girls Mascara for ever.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re getting a full-sized liquid eyeliner here, which lasted me months and is hands down one of the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Light shimmery greyish blue&lt;br /&gt;Bust</li>
            <li>Pinkish light medium brown&lt;br /&gt;Skimp:</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented, I have an olive kind of skin tone.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner goes on smooth, the mascara seperates and hugs each lash beautifuly.</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy.</li>
            <li>The shadows are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Book of Shadows 4, By urban Decay is Very nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with Urban Decay&#x27;s products, I own Naked and Naked 2, love them both, this has a wider range of shades, blues, purples, black with gold shimmer, gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are as expected, great.</li>
            <li>but I would not have paid the full $64.lies.  </li>
            <li>but I would not have paid the full $64.</li>
            <li>, it stays put until you remove it, a full size UD Primer Potion, a travel size mascara and a speaker with cards you can hook up to your computer, smartphone, etc to get the looks they provide or just listen to music with.</li>
            <li>I bought this palette immediately upon its release, that means I paid FULL price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that was pretty Cool!</li>
            <li>All these colors are very pretty and look good one (well, maybe not the blue with my eyes being green/hazel) and stay on all day without fading.</li>
            <li>i love it more then there Naked Palette.</li>
            <li>with some Super Curl to it.</li>
            <li>and I would most definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>The quality is fabulous and the colors are rich and vibrant!</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing, and the box it comes in is much bigger than it appeared to be on these photos!</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s amazing palette</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s having a lot of fun with it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Colors are easy to use and blend, as well as vibrant.</li>
            <li>First, it comes in a beautiful, sturdy, thick cardboard case.</li>
            <li>:) Glad it was on sale to (paid only $22 total)!</li>
            <li>The packaging on the Naked palettes is way nicer quality and more portable.  </li>
            <li>The packaging on the Naked palettes is way nicer quality and more portable.  </li>
            <li>so very feminine/girly!</li>
            <li>I LOVE URBAN DECAY MAKEUP</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t complain about anything!</li>
            <li>so if I go over it twice, it will wipe off the first line.</li>
            <li>you just Move on to Bigger better things.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>much as I love the eyeshadows, the extra goodies that come with BOSIV are ah-mazing.  </li>
            <li>16 pretty colors, eye primer, and eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow is very glittery!</li>
            <li>mascara is only okay to me.  </li>
            <li>The mascara is also excellent--not a volumizing mascara, but it will fully coat your lashes and give it a full, natural look.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun to play with new looks.</li>
            <li>Nice jet Black.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are too strong for my complexion (I&#x27;m Asian), but I could always use it as eye liner.</li>
            <li>I do not hold Amazon responsible for it.</li>
            <li>I originally wanted to buy the naked palette, but I already had too much nude toned shadows.</li>
            <li>It runs from light to dark starting at the bottom on the drawer, with a lovely mix of matte and shimmery shades.  </li>
            <li>the eye shadow is very pigmented and the primer poison made the eyeshadow last threw out the day and the eyeliner was easy to apply it without having to go over it several times and it came with a bonus speakers so she thought that was pretty neat</li>
            <li>IT GOES PRETTY LOUD TOO.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and that&#x27;s for sure, because just the eyeshadow usually costs around $50.00 Dollars!</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend anyone that&#x27;s  looking for  high end eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li>The mascara and the other little extras are a pretty good size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful palette that I would recommend to anyone, due to its wide range of neutral colors, with a few colorful eyeshadows thrown in (plus those extra goodies - yay!).  </li>
            <li>I chose this because the other palettes weren&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>10 of the colors are new to this</li>
            <li>This was my first Urban Decay purchase and I hooked!!!</li>
            <li>I love that it came with primer potion, curling mascara AND waterproof eyeliner, I just pack this up with a few brushes when I travel and am all set!</li>
            <li>There is also a little speaker and you can sit your phone on top and scan QR codes to watch videos of different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve almost completely used everything up.  </li>
            <li>keychain wasn&#x27;t that loud</li>
            <li>Have fun pulling it out though; after two or three times, the drawer got jammed</li>
            <li>but what u expect there small your not going to get a lot of sound coming out of it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not extremely dark but for being Latina, you can say I am.</li>
            <li>Other than the 2 minor flaws, the products are worth the price for the palette!</li>
            <li>I ordered mine directly from the Urban Decay website.</li>
            <li>The natural tones of the eye shadow make her big blue eyes pop.  </li>
            <li>My favorite look (I wear it constantly) is to use crystal on the inner half of the lid, gravity on the outer half and blue bus in the crease.  </li>
            <li>got this in the mail a few days ago and this happens to be one of my fiancé first urban decay products she ever had  </li>
            <li>The money I paid for a whole range of makeup, but received only half?</li>

            <li> There is also a little speaker and you can sit your phone on top and scan QR codes to watch videos of different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve almost completely used everything up.  </li>
            <li> keychain wasn&#x27;t that loud</li>
            <li> Have fun pulling it out though; after two or three times, the drawer got jammed</li>
            <li> but what u expect there small your not going to get a lot of sound coming out of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not extremely dark but for being Latina, you can say I am.</li>
            <li> Other than the 2 minor flaws, the products are worth the price for the palette!</li>
            <li> I ordered mine directly from the Urban Decay website.</li>
            <li> The natural tones of the eye shadow make her big blue eyes pop.  </li>
            <li> My favorite look (I wear it constantly) is to use crystal on the inner half of the lid, gravity on the outer half and blue bus in the crease.  </li>
            <li> got this in the mail a few days ago and this happens to be one of my fiancé first urban decay products she ever had  </li>
            <li> The money I paid for a whole range of makeup, but received only half?</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a thick, cardboard box that has a flip out top where butterflies pop up--really gaudy and tacky, seemed like a waste of cardboard to me.  </li>
            <li> They look well when mixed together and the palette lasts you a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to use.would recommend to anyone, due to its wide range of neutral colors, with a few colorful eyeshadows thrown in (plus those extra goodies - yay!).  </li>
            <li> When I opened it, I was very surprised and disturbed: a set of missing Mascara, pencil and concealer.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much color here (at least compared to the Vice palette), aside from some blues and greens, but the quality of the neutral eyeshadows make up for it.  </li>
            <li> Silvery grey (also in Naked)&lt;br /&gt;Cobra: Blackish brown&lt;br /&gt;Baked:</li>
            <li> the only down side is the speaker  </li>
            <li> I know appearances count, UD, but I really don&#x27;t want to spend 5 minutes trying to access my eyeshadows because the drawer is poorly</li>
            <li> However, this also says it comes with a mini speaker and a few tutorials on looks by Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> but I guess it is like every other relationship.</li>
            <li> allot faster then other things that I has gotten from Hong kong.</li>
            <li> I had to search the name of the look on youtube to look for other tutorials on them.</li>
            <li> i loooooooove Urban Decay, but they really got it wrong with this one :/</li>
            <li> Also, my Primer Potion was dried up and flaked right off my eyelids, and the stupid little speaker/ microphone thingy did not work right out of the box, so that was pointless.</li>
            <li> IT GOES ON REALLY DARK IM</li>
            <li> There are just all eye shadow, and the remaining cells are empty!!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;ll take up half your makeup box (if you find one that fits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> it is missing is black.</li>
            <li> BUT I THE LITTLE SPEAKER IS JUST JEANOUS</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like: The bulky, gimmicky cardboard package.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would have put a few mattes in there, but all in all ..</li>
            <li> I was on vacation, and a collection was taken when I was missing home.</li>
            <li> It also includes the 24-7 liquid eyeliner pen in black, a small squeeze bottle of primer potion, and a mascara.  </li>
            <li> THE SHEET WITH THE TAG THINGY IS A LITTLE SMALL</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a few days ago after seeing it on sale, it was $64, I got it for $29!</li>
            <li> Its big, clunky, and difficult to pull out of the \\&quot;book\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I also like that they include an eyeline (black), though I find liquid eyeliner a bit difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> was the way my Product was shipped, I was not happy with.</li>
            <li> The QR codes, phone holder, cords and speaker are all useless for me.  </li>
            <li> Grab these while you can, before the price jumps up like the 15th Anniversary Palette, one I&#x27;m sorry I missed out on.</li>
            <li> Just be wary of the box.  </li>
            <li> Just be wary of the box.  </li>
            <li> But this Book of Shadows has the WORST possible packaging!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward to use and takes up a ton of space.  </li>
            <li> Also, the speaker is basicly crap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone that would contest UD&#x27;s ability to put out quality shadows is an insane person to me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All these colors are very pretty and look good one (well, maybe not the blue with my eyes being green/hazel) and stay on all day without fading. I LOVE Urban Decay and used to love the Gash line, so this was also a great buy for me :) Glad it was on sale to (paid only $22 total)! I definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re and Urban Decay fan and want a variety of colors. I don&#x27;t even use the Primer and it STILL stays on all day w/o fading!</li>
            <li> This pallette is jammed-packed with shadows.  It includes a bunch of neutrals as well as some colors.  10 of the colors are new to this pallette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Bus: Periwinkle&lt;br /&gt;Gunmetal: Silvery grey (also in Naked)&lt;br /&gt;Cobra: Blackish brown&lt;br /&gt;Baked: Glittery copper&lt;br /&gt;Bender: Olive green&lt;br /&gt;Gravity: Shimmery purple&lt;br /&gt;Lost: Shimmery brown&lt;br /&gt;Hijack: Greenish blue&lt;br /&gt;Midnight Cowgirl: Shimmery beige&lt;br /&gt;Sin: Simmery pinkish neutral (also in Naked)&lt;br /&gt;Midnight Rodeo: Glittery medium brown&lt;br /&gt;Crystal: Light shimmery greyish blue&lt;br /&gt;Bust: Light-medium brown&lt;br /&gt;Missionary: Pinkish light medium brown&lt;br /&gt;Skimp: peach&lt;br /&gt;Zephyr: Whitish shade - lightest in the pallette&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this pallette you can do neutral looks as well as a smokey eye and play with color.  It also includes the 24-7 liquid eyeliner pen in black, a small squeeze bottle of primer potion, and a mascara.  There is also a little speaker and you can sit your phone on top and scan QR codes to watch videos of different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;The variety of shades.  They apply well and it&#x27;s fun to play with new looks. My favorite look (I wear it constantly) is to use crystal on the inner half of the lid, gravity on the outer half and blue bus in the crease.  I use Skimp as a highlight shade under the brow and at the inner corner.  I then line the eye with navy blue eyeliner.  Gunmetal works well as a liner too, as does blue bus if you want to do an all blue look. I also like that they include an eyeline (black), though I find liquid eyeliner a bit difficult to use.  The mascara is great as is the primer potion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: The bulky, gimmicky cardboard package.  The QR codes, phone holder, cords and speaker are all useless for me.  I won&#x27;t use them and I doubt many people will.  I also don&#x27;t like that the eyeshadows are in a pull out drawer.  It&#x27;s awkward to use and takes up a ton of space.  The top of the pallette has pop-up plastic butterflies.  The packaging on the Naked palettes is way nicer quality and more portable.  I would have preferred this design for the Book of Shadows.  This is definitely an at-home only pallette.  And it&#x27;ll take up half your makeup box (if you find one that fits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for $29 on the urban decay website but I would not have paid the full $64.lies.

            <li> The colors are amazing, and the box it comes in is much bigger than it appeared to be on these photos! I luvvvvvvv it!! The mascara and the other little extras are a pretty good size. It&#x27;s worth the money and that&#x27;s for sure, because just the eyeshadow usually costs around $50.00 Dollars! Great deal and great packaging....so very feminine/girly! Good luck!</li>
            <li> I LOVE URBAN DECAY MAKEUP AND I HAVE ALL THE BOOK OF SHADOWS BUT THIS ONE IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE.  THE SHEET WITH THE TAG THINGY IS A LITTLE SMALL SO MOST PROGRAMS DONT RECOGNIZE IT.  BUT I THE LITTLE SPEAKER IS JUST JEANOUS YOU CAN LISTEN TO YOUR MUSIC ON YOUR PHONE OR IPOD IT GOES PRETTY LOUD TOO.  I AM ALSO IN LOVE WITH THE MASCARA IT GOES ON REALLY DARK IM ABOUT TO BYE THE BIG VERSION OF IT.  ALMOST ALL THE COLORS ARE NEW EXCEPT FOR LIKE 4 OF THEM WHICH IS GREAT!  IM JUST IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK OF SHADOWS.  HOW ARE THEY GOING TO TOP THAT ONE?</li>
            <li> This is awesome! All the colors are gorgeous and very pigmented. I got this for $20 so I really can&#x27;t complain about anything! The liquid liner is OKAY, as it is too watery so if I go over it twice, it will wipe off the first line. The mascara is nice-typical mascara. The primer potion is one of my favorites. Overall it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Book of Shadows 4, By urban Decay is Very nice i love it more then there Naked Palette. Beautiful Rich Pigments there eyeliner Smooths on Nice. Mascara was like my Dream mascara. Nice jet Black. with some Super Curl to it. I have been Very Loyal to Cover Girls Mascara for ever. but I guess it is like every other relationship. you just Move on to Bigger better things. ha ha. the reason why I am Giving this Review 4 out of 5 Stars is 1,) is that Urban Decay chose to Discontinue the Book of shadows 4. 2.) was the way my Product was shipped, I was not happy with. My envolpe was Ripped. why it was not in a Box is beyond me. I do not hold Amazon responsible for it. as the Seller. I got it faster then what was predicted. I ordered it on February 8th. and got it On the 13th. allot faster then other things that I has gotten from Hong kong. lasted all Day though so that was pretty Cool!</li>
            <li> This was my first Urban Decay purchase and I hooked!!! I bought this six months ago and I&#x27;m still using it. I&#x27;m almost out of two colors, but I use them almost daily.  I bought the \\&quot;Naked\\&quot; set yesterday and it has the two colors I use for daytime looks.  The quality is fabulous and the colors are rich and vibrant! I won&#x27;t use anything but UB eye shadows from now on!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing! They look well when mixed together and the palette lasts you a long time. I have already bought 2 of them and I would most definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented, I have an olive kind of skin tone. I&#x27;m not extremely dark but for being Latina, you can say I am. The speaker is louder than my phone a plus. The eyeliner goes on smooth, the mascara seperates and hugs each lash beautifuly. The primer we all know its the best. Overall a great buy.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a few days ago after seeing it on sale, it was $64, I got it for $29! First, it comes in a beautiful, sturdy, thick cardboard case. When you slide it out, the box opens and it has 3D butterflies, cute. More importantly, it has 16 good sized, wonderfully pigmented shadows, mostly shimmer a few matte, a full size 24/7 liquid liner in Perversion, it stays put until you remove it, a full size UD Primer Potion, a travel size mascara and a speaker with cards you can hook up to your computer, smartphone, etc to get the looks they provide or just listen to music with. I&#x27;m very impressed with Urban Decay&#x27;s products, I own Naked and Naked 2, love them both, this has a wider range of shades, blues, purples, black with gold shimmer, gorgeous! The primer potion is one of my favorites for keeping your shadows and liners put all day, and the mascara is nice, it thickens and lengthens lashes. Grab these while you can, before the price jumps up like the 15th Anniversary Palette, one I&#x27;m sorry I missed out on. Would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of urban decay eye primer potion and eye shadow. I originally wanted to buy the naked palette, but I already had too much nude toned shadows. So I chose this beautiful Book of Shadows, and it is perfect. Some of the colors are too strong for my complexion (I&#x27;m Asian), but I could always use it as eye liner. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> Gave this to our daughter for Christmas.  What a great set.  I will be buying more of this brand from YOU.  Cheaper than at the Department stores and the same thing.  The natural tones of the eye shadow make her big blue eyes pop.  The package came wrapped up perfectly, nothing damaged.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! I gave it to a friend for christmas and she&#x27;s having a lot of fun with it. She keeps showing up with amazing looking eyes! It&#x27;s been two months and she&#x27;s still enjoying experimenting with all the colors.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally earlier this year when it was on sale and I&#x27;ve almost completely used everything up.  It was definitely a steal--mascara, eyeliner, primer potion, and 16 eyeshadows for $29.  The cheapo in me went nuts.  To sum it up: It&#x27;s a lovely palette with a beautiful range of strong, pigmented colors, but the design frustrates me to tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOX&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick, cardboard box that has a flip out top where butterflies pop up--really gaudy and tacky, seemed like a waste of cardboard to me.  Below this is a sort of \\&quot;drawer\\&quot; you pull out which showcases all of the shadows, with separate compartments for the eyeliner, mascara and primer potion.  Have fun pulling it out though; after two or three times, the drawer got jammed and I basically had to pull it out by jamming a knife in there.  I know appearances count, UD, but I really don&#x27;t want to spend 5 minutes trying to access my eyeshadows because the drawer is poorly designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EYESHADOWS&lt;br /&gt;Like with UD eyeshadows, these shadows are incredibly pigmented and should compliment most skin tones.  It runs from light to dark starting at the bottom on the drawer, with a lovely mix of matte and shimmery shades.  There isn&#x27;t much color here (at least compared to the Vice palette), aside from some blues and greens, but the quality of the neutral eyeshadows make up for it.  While applying it after primer is best, these shadows are vibrant even without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDITIONAL ITEMS&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love the eyeshadows, the extra goodies that come with BOSIV are ah-mazing.  You&#x27;re getting a full-sized liquid eyeliner here, which lasted me months and is hands down one of the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.  The mascara is also excellent--not a volumizing mascara, but it will fully coat your lashes and give it a full, natural look.  Primer potion is a good steal too, although I don&#x27;t use it often (the wetness of the potion turns me off a bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a wonderful palette that I would recommend to anyone, due to its wide range of neutral colors, with a few colorful eyeshadows thrown in (plus those extra goodies - yay!).  Just be wary of the box.  It&#x27;s a pain to use.would recommend to anyone, due to its wide range of neutral colors, with a few colorful eyeshadows thrown in (plus those extra goodies - yay!).

            <li> I love the colors in this make up kit, I would have given it a 5 if the mascara were better quality.</li>
            <li> got this in the mail a few days ago and this happens to be one of my fiancé first urban decay products she ever had  and it&#x27;s amazing the eye shadow is very pigmented and the primer poison made the eyeshadow last threw out the day and the eyeliner was easy to apply it without having to go over it several times and it came with a bonus speakers so she thought that was pretty neat the only down side is the speaker  keychain wasn&#x27;t that loud but what u expect there small your not going to get a lot of sound coming out of it anyways but overall it&#x27;s amazing palette and I highly recommend anyone that&#x27;s  looking for  high end eyeshadow palette</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow! 16 pretty colors, eye primer, and eyeliner. The eyeshadow is very glittery! I wish they would have put a few mattes in there, but all in all ..It is my favorite eye pallette. I am very happy I got it!</li>
            <li> I loved this pallet since ever! And I only could buy reccently! The primer, the collors... Gave me options to make wonderful smoky eyes. In love!</li>
            <li> I chose this because the other palettes weren&#x27;t available. There are too many unusable colors and the packaging is cheap.  I will stick to the \\&quot;nude\\&quot; palettes. I suggest you do the same.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are as expected, great. However, this also says it comes with a mini speaker and a few tutorials on looks by Urban Decay. Yeah, don&#x27;t plan on that. For the most part, I couldn&#x27;t get the QR codes to read and when I did it says there was an issue with the videos. I had to search the name of the look on youtube to look for other tutorials on them. Also, the speaker is basicly crap. It sounds aweful! Other than the 2 minor flaws, the products are worth the price for the palette!</li>
            <li> I love UD shadows. The primer is the best one I&#x27;ve used and the mascara is nice as well. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Colors are easy to use and blend, as well as vibrant. Everything in the palette is useful and the speaker is a great bonus! (:</li>
            <li> For years I have used Urban Decay.  I bought this palette immediately upon its release, that means I paid FULL price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that would contest UD&#x27;s ability to put out quality shadows is an insane person to me.  The shadows are fantastic.  The primer is the only primer I use and I love all the liquid liners that UD puts out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is only okay to me.  I use something else since I wasn&#x27;t really impressed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downfall of this palette is the packaging.  While it is very cute, I loathe the bulkiness of it.  I don&#x27;t need the butterflies or the unneccesary phone attachments to view videos.  Personally, I find the drawer feature was a horrid decision.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine directly from the Urban Decay website. As always, fabulous eyeshadows! But this Book of Shadows has the WORST possible packaging!! Its big, clunky, and difficult to pull out of the \\&quot;book\\&quot;. The eyeshadow pans started to loosen and four of them have literally fallen out of the palette. Also, my Primer Potion was dried up and flaked right off my eyelids, and the stupid little speaker/ microphone thingy did not work right out of the box, so that was pointless. i wanted to leave this review bc i loooooooove Urban Decay, but they really got it wrong with this one :/ Wish it was packaged better, bc the shadows are amazing!</li>
            <li> I want to ask you to figure out why I came incomplete set of cosmetics. I was on vacation, and a collection was taken when I was missing home. When I opened it, I was very surprised and disturbed: a set of missing Mascara, pencil and concealer. There are just all eye shadow, and the remaining cells are empty!! How can this be? It&#x27;s a shame! The money I paid for a whole range of makeup, but received only half? I enclose photos of open enrollment and demand your explanation.</li>
            <li> great for creating night time and wintery looks. All of the shadows are shimmery, some with actual glitter pieces in them. I love that it came with primer potion, curling mascara AND waterproof eyeliner, I just pack this up with a few brushes when I travel and am all set! Only color it is missing is black.</li>
