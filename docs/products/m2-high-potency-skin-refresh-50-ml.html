            <li>GREAT COMBINATION &amp; GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>incredibly smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the M2 skin care product is great though, I have been using it for two years</li>
            <li>that works great.</li>
            <li>The cleaners and moisturizers is great as well.</li>
            <li>Works great but is sticky.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>I bought this when I saw in a Facebook ad that it was great for treating acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li>it is great.</li>
            <li>On the contrary, the peeling has always made me feel happy that the serum is doing it&#x27;s job where it needs to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it worked great,</li>
            <li>I purchased the M2 Skin Care HP Skin Refinish 20% along with M2 Skin Technologies Skin Recovery Moisturizer after reading great reviews on the products and</li>
            <li>The mandelic acid is great, but the algae extract, for those of us acne prone, is death.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>This serum is amazing!  </li>
            <li>M2 works amazing!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li>I did experience a 3 week period where my skin went through almost a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; from the product, but now I can honestly say, my face feels INCREDIBLE and remarkably improved.</li>
            <li>YOU MUST WEAR A GOOD SUNSCREEN during the day when using this product.</li>
            <li>loved it during the summer too drying during the winter months in the northeast.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the good reviews I thought I would take this and</li>
            <li>and it looked good.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li>Along with this, the skin on my face didn&#x27;t feel good anymore.</li>
            <li>I put a good deal of research into buying face creams .</li>
            <li>This one looked good.  </li>
            <li>I could never understand why everyone else was able to find over the counter products that worked for them and made their skins so beautiful.</li>
            <li>From the great comments this had, I thought I would be acne free by now!</li>
            <li>I rarely get a zit now, and my skin looks GREAT!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used, it is a bit pricey but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>So, many formulations may contain AHA but in ineffective trace amounts to keep their customers happy.</li>
            <li>In the winter I am sure to follow it up with a great night cream like Cetaphil</li>
            <li>OK!  </li>
            <li>And that is better than nothing!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I totally love this product!</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked better since before puberty!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me but I will continue use to actually be able to judge the product!</li>
            <li>This stuff in FABULOUS!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;My loving, amazing husband has been &#x27;working on my back\\&quot; almost every night for 9 months.</li>
            <li>The skin refinish serum is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>AMAZING BUY.</li>
            <li>I use this &amp; the skin recovery moisturizer and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I have tried lot&#x27;s and lot&#x27;s of products from fancy ($$$$) to drug store brands.  </li>
            <li>and I think the best approach is to use intensely for a week or two and then give your skin a day or two to recover so it doesn&#x27;t get fed up and start peeling.</li>
            <li>The M2 Skin Care 20% is complementing my routine regime, and I&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
            <li>Good face wash out of so many face wash creams I tried using before,</li>
            <li>Either way since then I&#x27;ve kind of dropped off with my use.</li>
            <li>it kind of burns.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is quite nice ...</li>
            <li>Totally worth the expense!!!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the vivant mandelic much more!</li>
            <li>I tend to have hormonal breakouts and this has been the best so far to help with that.</li>
            <li>Tried it just for the affected area and it made a HUGE difference overnight!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in the morning :-)    </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m mostly using this for hyperpigmentation from the sun and not for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but you can apply lotion on top once it dries and that fixes the problem.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I dont know if mother nature was being generous with her gifts during that precious time</li>
            <li>, Im almost 100 percent sure it will work one way or another.</li>
            <li>This was better than nothing at the time when I couldn&#x27;t afford vivant.</li>
            <li>My pores are notably cleaner, which means they&#x27;re no longer inflamed.</li>
            <li>and i love using this at night for acne and scars</li>
            <li>So glad I&#x27;ve come to my senses</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve begun to breakout more, and in places like my forehead where I never breakout.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this treatment.</li>
            <li>If you use it before make up make sure it dries and you have a primer with SPF and your foundation or</li>
            <li>I did that because my skin can take it and unlike most I didn&#x27;t recieve that burning sensation.</li>
            <li>and my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff-</li>
            <li>More than the acne, my problem has been the hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>use it a lot more in the summer as it can be drying.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>This works ok for me, it does cause a lot of peeling.  </li>
            <li>3) Lightly wipe washed skin with Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel on cotton ball/pad.</li>
            <li>Lightly wipe skin with Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel on cotton ball/pad. 3)</li>
            <li>This product is stunning.  </li>
            <li>My face became better and better after months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also feel like my skin looks better and tighter.</li>
            <li>That also has gotten better.</li>
            <li>Works better if you use moisturizer after applying&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Retin A before laser re-surfacing, and didn&#x27;t notice any more difference than using M2.</li>
            <li>and until I find something better I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It kept most of my acne at bay</li>
            <li>Smoother and more radiant complexion.  </li>
            <li>and I HIGHLY suggest getting it!!!!!</li>
            <li>Its is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Tightens up your skin and leaves it smooth and delicious to the touch the next morning!  </li>
            <li>I just received my first bottle of M2 and could not be more thrilled.</li>
            <li>The design of the bottle is elegant and a fantastic idea in theory, but it does not work well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it really did me any good.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed and pleased with my skin care routine/products, that I wanted to share and possibly help some of you that are looking for the right skin care routine in their 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I scar easily, esp.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face mostly blemish free and smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong and it tends to be somewhat sticky).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s strong</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter, my pores seem smaller, and I my skin has a beautiful glowing appearance.</li>
            <li>It is tacky and smells kind of funny, so</li>
            <li>On top of that, I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in just days</li>
            <li>Consistency is important.</li>
            <li>It glowed, my acne was reduced, and my skin felt really smooth...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great skin in a short time.</li>
            <li>Must be used everyday but it exfoliates and smoothes skin wonderfully,</li>
            <li>No cystic acne,  smooth skin and my scarring started fading.</li>
            <li>The lady who did my laser re-surfacing read the ingredients and she had a very favorable opinion of M2 even though she was promoting their own line of products.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li>good and natural products like this than go the botox route or under the knife.</li>
            <li>Ordered 20% M2 and paid much higher cost!!  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in Amazon!!!  </li>
            <li>Unlike anything else so well worth the money!</li>
            <li>With this stuff, you will notice significant improvement within about a month.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any significant reduction in pimples.</li>
            <li>From reading the reviews I was so excited to buy this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the original product from skinstore rx before...</li>
            <li>I used this product when it was in it&#x27;s original packaging.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the original one.</li>
            <li>It is not for everyone as some may not be familiar with AHA products.</li>
            <li>so I am excited to see what a year does.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff is derived from the fountain of youth.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I use this each evening on clean skin, and after 15 minutes apply a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>With this product, I experienced visible results after only the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in over a year, the last time I used M2.</li>
            <li>Can cause a bit of peeling when used twice a day but not bad.</li>
            <li>That last part is very important: use a moisturizer over this and be sure to wear sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li>It clears brown spots quickly with nightly use.</li>
            <li>If you think that the product isn&#x27;t working (because your melasma looks the same), see if your freckles and/or acne scars are getting better (these are more \\&quot;shallow\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>Its super super sticky.</li>
            <li>but it runs out quickly</li>
            <li>It does NOT smell at all, but once it dries it is super sticky, SO</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to say that I LOVE this product and will definitely keep purchasing!</li>
            <li>My skin texture did improve rather quickly, I used it nightly and exfoliated in the mornings.</li>
            <li>However, when I wake up in the morning I love how soft and smooth my skin feels.</li>
            <li>I also have hyperpigmentation from when I was pregnant</li>
            <li>So what I do is I will apply M2 to a clean face right before bedtime.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li>I was very concerned that this lotion would be too strong for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun and quick to do.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you that when I first used M2, my skin LITERALLY changed overnight!</li>
            <li>No more adult acne and my skin just looks smooth, almost flawless.</li>
            <li>I have yet to see any real progress with the fine lines on my forehead</li>
            <li>Finally, I came across this amazing product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing I have found to be effective in evening out my skin tone and diminishing the appearance of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>But it make my skin more sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li>i bought the cleanser because I realized that after a couple of weeks of success, nothing was changing.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better, as far as acne scarring and sun damage goes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really give it a fair rating since I do not use it as regularly as I should...</li>
            <li>It is very smoothing to the texture and when I am good about using it several times a week I do get compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been breaking out in places i rarely ever do, like my forehead and neck and sideburn area and nose.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then start with 12% then go to 20% if you want more effect.</li>
            <li>you can overcome the rougher aspects of this product, it will definitely be worth it.</li>
            <li>Completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Might not be suitable for particularly sensitive skin - would recommend a &amp;#34;patch test&amp;#34; first.  </li>
            <li>it is sticky but its worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I can tell its doing something since my skin looks better already.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product more for hyperpigmentation, and so far it has done nothing for that.</li>
            <li>It took a couple months for my skin to start looking clear but my scars have faded and I don&#x27;t get nearly as many breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I rarely get break outs anymore</li>
            <li>I will certainly try on my face but it works great on dark knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>I use it on my acne prone skin, which is not severe acne, but just can be breakout prone if I am not careful, and it works awesome to help keep those little skin bumps away.</li>
            <li>Just one use of this clears up my skin right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin and get razor burn easily, this stuff eliminates it.</li>
            <li>The stickiness is actually a good thing because what that is, is the AHA&#x27;s breaking down the damaged outer layer of skin.</li>
            <li>I really see just as much improvement with the M2 as I do these deeper peels, but I&#x27;m on a mission to have blemish free skin.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice any effect on wrinkles,maybe it needs more time,im not sure,however if you have oily,acne prone skin,it absolutely works to clear up the skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle is quite large and that makes the price worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a highly rated product, however for me someone with sensitive skin it stung and burned and it lasted for quite awhile before skin felt ok again.</li>
            <li>(so not horrible enough for me to choose Accutane -</li>
            <li>The first time I applied this product (after washing with my clarisonic)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and just put in an order for my second bottle.</li>
            <li>You will see sometype of a difference and it might actually work better for you than it did for me....</li>
            <li>Hopfully I see more in the next week</li>
            <li>I saw some difference when I first started using it</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this but for the price I probably will not be buying it again anytime soon.</li>
            <li>It tightens pores also and makes my skin look smoother, more even toned and overall better/younger.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>The first night I used it, it made my face feel so sticky</li>
            <li>My skin tone looks lighter, brighter, and more even when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li>I literally noticed differences within the first day of use.</li>
            <li>I wish I had done this in the first place.</li>
            <li>I went out for the first time in 27 years without make up on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than in the last 20 years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to finish my first bottle and already ordered my second, so glad to see that the price has dropped.</li>
            <li>This has done so much for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months, but it got rid of my blemishes after the first use.</li>
            <li>I make teeny-tiny dots of the product on my forehead first and then rub in.</li>
            <li>I see that some have said it is sticky, but if you read the instructions they say to put a moisturizer over it and that REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>It is a key ingredient to add tartness to many</li>
            <li>Love what they do for my skin which is not getting younger.</li>
            <li>I have been on Retin A numerous times, antiobiotics, birth control, differin gel, tea tree oil, sulfur soaps, salicylic acid products, alpha hydroxy acid products and so much more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a rather large bottle and since it works best in small amounts</li>
            <li>Ultimately I have returned to buy more because it really does work.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell when I am getting low and most of the time I have to really work at it to get it to squirt out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The first application I put almost 2 pumps and it made my face incredibly sticky so the next time (and every time afterward) I have used only 1 pump and my face still feels a bit sticky, however I only use it at night just before bed</li>
            <li>but im pretty sure after the fisrt day I saw reduced redness and no new breakouts.</li>
            <li>For me, I feel like even one night of not using it causes the un-doing of the positive results.</li>
            <li>I have waited a long time to write this review to make sure I have reaped all of the benefits.</li>
            <li>I would give this the amazing rave reviews that some have, but I have seen a slight improvement with my skins appearance.</li>
            <li>Four stars because I was expecting better results for my dry lines as well</li>
            <li>so first off, I dont know if I was suppose to use all three products together (CLEANSER,SERUM AND MOISTURIZER), but I was only using the serum and mositurizer once a day, at night to be precise, after I washed for 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I feel that this product is less effective than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li>My skin is SUPER sensitive and I have literally tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>acne, clearer skin in certain areas.</li>
            <li>Just be smart with it for certain, since your using this at home without a doctor&#x27;s supervision.  </li>
            <li>If you are a person of a certain age and struggle with acne, breakouts, even rosacea breakouts</li>
            <li>I love trying all kinds of new ones, but this one I keep going back to.</li>
            <li>I use this right before I go to sleep over the targeted dark spots, and make sure to use a moisturizer with SPF in the day (Alpha Hydroxy Moisturizer).</li>
            <li>It sluffs off old skin super fast and allows your skin to regenerate.</li>
            <li>I suffer an occasional break out, have melasma from sun damage and am showing signs of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>On the downside, I have not noticed much difference with the one (rather large) age spot that I have.  </li>
            <li>This really is a product that lives up to what it says it will do, and in a vast ocean of products that make big big claims, the fact that this one actually does what the company claims is pretty magnificent!</li>
            <li>Many women enjoy the concept of what AHA&#x27;s can do but have a hard time accepting the pain it takes to get there.</li>
            <li>I am noticing a HUGE difference with exfoliation and lightening of these scars with the products I listed above.  </li>
            <li>But the Amazon price is much lower than at the doctor&#x27;s clinic.</li>
            <li>Every night would be too much for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to try gentler means to get rid of them before going for intense chemical treatments from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>The label states that if you apply too much product it can cause your face to be sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>so it really hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li>This product really does work well in both preventing and removing acne.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel really sticky after using it</li>
            <li>its really stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I just wasnt doing much for me.</li>
            <li>but than my skin started to get really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>It helped my skin so much.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth and lightens my skin to only a bit.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and have had problems with acne, blackheads, whiteheads, follicular issues, scarring and discoloration.</li>
            <li>I ordered the whole line of products.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product looked as advertised.</li>
            <li>but it was too much in terms of the peeling aspect.</li>
            <li>It would be too much on the face at once.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay attention to that too much just read.</li>
            <li>If your skin is stinky and not drying your using too much.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well</li>
            <li>Not well known and I didn&#x27;t know really what to expect when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 but am blessed with very &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from Blue light therapy to Accutane.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>but I have very problem skin.  </li>
            <li>told I really like this product &amp; hope</li>
            <li>If you use too much, has a sticky feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li>This really helps my skin seem to retain moisture</li>
            <li>But it works very well for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer however is very tacky and stays that way.</li>
            <li>Nothing&#x27;s ever really worked for me til I found M2.</li>
            <li>In a short time, my skin is completely clear, smoother, pores are tighter, wrinkles are softened and my skin is now more even toned.  </li>
            <li>The stinging is not bad and I normally have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also starting using Bobbi Brown&#x27;s intensive serum to help my skin not peel and regenerate some lovely new skin cells after the old ones were all gone and the combination is a match made in heaven!</li>
            <li>Ok ok maybe im being dramatic but</li>
            <li>Also, this product will cause excessive drying and peeling so make sure to wear moisturizer and SPF always!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this three weeks, so I&#x27;ll report back later if it is more/less successful.</li>
            <li>Never ship a inferior or less effective product and try to pass for more expensive and potent product.  </li>
            <li>Really folks, don&#x27;t go wild here, you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>Fast forward to today: It isn&#x27;t working as quickly for me as it did back then.</li>
            <li>It just seemed to help the blemishes I had and stop the new ones from getting large and unsightly.  </li>
            <li>After a week, I was completely clear of acne for the first time ever since I was a pre-teen (approx 20 years ago).  </li>
            <li>This is my new bby!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried practically everything to promote more even, less pock-marked skin.  </li>
            <li>I add a moisturizer on top (something scented slightly helps).  </li>
            <li>Overall there was some tingling but nothing that was unbearable and it quickly faded.</li>
            <li>However, after the initial period of adjustment, I now just feel a mild tingling sensation when the lotion is applied.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smoother, particularly on my forehead.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing facials regularly, which it&#x27;s helping tremendously.</li>
            <li>sure enough, my cystic acne comes back along my jaw line</li>
            <li>I have hormonal acne and occasionally break out on my chin, but I am always looking for something to stop the breakouts even though my acne is mild.  </li>
            <li>I use NIVEA or Waxelene, but recommend something lighter like NEUTROGENA HEALTHY SKIN in the blue and white tube with SPF.  </li>
            <li>Comes in a convenient twisting pump that you can open and close, and you only need like a dime size at most for your face.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, be prepared that your skin may at first tingle/burn slightly and may dry out as it gets used to the formula~but you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the lotion.     </li>
            <li>The product had exploded inside the packaging, which being transported to a high altitude location (Colorado) is understandable.</li>
            <li>**: M2 High Potency Skin Refresh 20%.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as a OTC retinol product without a prescription.</li>
            <li>It works great for sun damaged skin and it lasts a really long time, my brown spots are fading though I would also like to add that I alternate between M2 and Retin-A every other night.</li>
            <li>I experimentally applied it on my UA and it brought my UA&#x27;s skin much fairer.</li>
            <li>So I only use M2 on days where my facial regimen consists of light washing with my fingertips and a gentle toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has really helped my skin stay consistently - clear.  </li>
            <li>so I will update this review in a few weeks when I&#x27;ve seen more results.    </li>
            <li>Blackheads that were in my skin are rising to the top and coming out without any trouble, redness or scarring.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I saw immediate results, my skin felt smooth and it seemed that my breakouts were less frequent.</li>
            <li>I have FINALLY found the right product.  </li>
            <li>Uses less of the product and keeps my skin from becoming too dependent on it.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>As a result, I began a new project on how to make some improvement and slowdown what is happening to my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s work from the bottom up to encourage new skin cell growth.</li>
            <li>I was putting off ordering it because I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $50 despite the great results but it would definitely have been a worse catastrophe to run out and have to wait for the new order to come in.</li>
            <li>My hyper pigmentation is slowly getting better but isn&#x27;t fading as fast as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I then changed to using the &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; product line, such as their facial wash and their light moisturizer and</li>
            <li>I am blonde, blue eyed, slender and tall with somewhat sensitive skin which burns easily.</li>
            <li>I am African American and have light skin, but I produce a lot of melanin</li>
            <li>It is strong, smells odd and leaves a film on the skin, but--</li>
            <li>On nights that my skin feels especially dry, 30 minutes after Retinol or AHA application, I spread on a very light layer of German Nivea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something to clear up my skin and even out my skin for years!</li>
            <li>Everything seems to be working so far!</li>
            <li>I put the refinish cream on before sleep and first thing in the morning followed by the moisturizer 15 mins later and have seen signifigant improvement of my pore size and scars.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I am 23 years old and have suffered with acne (not HORRIBLE) but the occasional cystic big pimples or red scaring.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but find it&#x27;s a little too strong.</li>
            <li>so I slowed down on the use just to make it last longer.  :-)</li>
            <li>This is basically a watered down version of the original...</li>
            <li>I purchased this product &amp; used it in combination with the Obagi Clear.</li>
            <li>I used M2 all over my face, but used Obagi Clear to spot treat darker areas.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going to keep at it and hope that all the breakouts will clear up, and I will again be awed by this product,</li>
            <li>I can clearly see visible results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping that in another 3 months, it&#x27;ll be completely clear.</li>
            <li>M2 works to clear up the hyperpigmentation and as a side-effect reduces your acne breaks out.</li>
            <li>it helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>You will need to get used to the stickiness of the product, but I only apply it at night time when I&#x27;m asleep away, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>No as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, I have hyper-pigmentation problem cause by too much ACTH in my system.</li>
            <li>As I have only had this product for 2 weeks I have yet to see any real results</li>
            <li>I am looking for a reduction in sunspots on my face that I have been self conscious about for a while-</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to chemical/environmental allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t suggest this product to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This has improved my skin so much since adding it to my nightly facial routine.  </li>
            <li>So far, this product has been awesome...outside of my acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 years old, and I have been struggling with acne since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>This has helped my skin so much that I should finally write a review.  </li>
            <li>Im using manoka honey to lighten my hyper pigmentation from old acne, and it works way</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop it completely</li>
            <li>I use it also with the moisturizer and a sunscreen for sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>Drug store products,  home remedies, natural products, even adapalene gel.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have hyperpigmentation on my forehead and along the side of my face.  </li>
            <li>I am a 41 year old latina with adult acne and age spots, nothing, nothing i tried before worked(clinique, proactive, etc....)</li>
            <li>so I would put this on at night- completely cleared it up.</li>
            <li>Now, after a couple months, the skin on my face is glowing and feels SO INCREDIBLY soft..</li>
            <li>I plan to update this at the 6 month mark, but so far out of all of it, the Green Cream made the most drastic difference to my skin appearance and texture overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;polished from the benefits of using these natural acids on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M2</li>
            <li>Malic acid is a naturally occurring organic compound found in most&lt;br /&gt;unripe fruit.</li>
            <li>that these are natural.</li>
            <li>Most OTC products are a complete waste of time - it takes forever for even a tiny improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any significant change to my skin yet, its been almost a month of using, no matter how little I try to apply, it still feels sticky.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40s and prior to using this product, suffered from adult acne since my early 20s, particularly during my cycle.</li>
            <li>Melasma is stubborn and takes a long time to clear up, but this product really does help if you stick with it</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product was in 2006, I went through the last 6 years trying different things.</li>
            <li>Maybe I only gave four star because my expectations were so high.  </li>
            <li>is my daily routine now: washing my face with Q10 cleansing wipes, then I apply M2 High potency skin refinish 20%.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 54 year old male, and I do have wrinkles around my eyes, but this stuff has helped keep my skin tighter, brighter, and even toned and I used to live in Florida and tan all the time.</li>
            <li>I apply this in a similar manner to the Green Cream except that it is more fluid and seemsto spread easier.</li>
            <li>I had tried different face washes, proactiv+, toners, salicylic acid pads, a new birth control pill, etc.</li>
            <li>I exfoliate using a gentle jojoba oil facial massage (sometimes mixed with sugar in the shower during the winter) about once each week.     </li>
            <li>I use it on my face, back and chest and keeps my tone even, my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I overcame this by only using M2 on gentle facial days.</li>
            <li>Then I saw that it&#x27;s really meant as an overall facial serum for a myriad of problems (lines/discoloration, etc.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my whole life and finally at 31 I feel I found something that actually works.</li>
            <li>within 1-2 weeks my skin finally started to calm down and within 3-4 weeks the cystic acne was completely gone.  </li>
            <li>This has made my skin very smooth and glowing, no more uneven tones on my forehead and cheekbones, it has completely changed my skin though I would still like to see my brown spots go away completely.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re talking clear night in the Rocky Mts looking up at the stars number of spots on my back!</li>
            <li>It use to make my skin clear, but now all it does is make pimples I already have smaller(does not make them go away) and prevents future breakouts.</li>
            <li>Early 40s female who suffered from cystic acne as a teenager and, as a result, has pitted skin.  </li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin, like me, this will sting alittle, but only temporarily.</li>
            <li>I barely get any breakouts, but the purpose of this is to specifically get rid of scarring and it does just that.</li>
            <li>I know my face is to get worse before it gets better,  </li>
            <li>However after that, I began developing small bumps everywhere which eventually became full blown inflamed acne.  </li>
            <li>I have had more deep cyst acne since I have started using both products, but that is happening less and less now.</li>
            <li>It was a miracle product for me for about the first month and a half.  </li>
            <li>but then little by little my skin got better.</li>
            <li>Stinging: Again, if an AHA product doesn&#x27;t sting, that has almost always been a dead giveaway for me that it is not potent enough to be effective.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it was clear the product had exploded prior to shipping because the serum had crusted and the entire contents had seeped out of the bottle and had coated the interior of the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>This works to resurface the skin, but it is a different type of Alpha Hydroxy acid which activates and exfoliates the uppermost layers of skin cells, while the Retinol in the Green Cream is absorbed to do</li>
            <li>I saw results in the first few days of using it.  </li>
            <li>Lately my skin has been a little more sensitive so now when I use the product it burns like hell, only for about 5-10 seconds or so.</li>
            <li>There is NO miracle lotion to take decades off your face, only surgery can do that; that said, this stuff is the most dramatic and affective face lotion I&#x27;ve ever used regardless of price.</li>
            <li>,i will repurchase again,the con is that it is sticky, let it dry completely if you want to use another moisturizer on top,overall this is a product i would recommend.</li>
            <li>Allow to dry completely.</li>
            <li>I recieved this last month, I used it everyday at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because those treatments work to clear up your acne first and then wait for the slow healing process of the scars that cause the hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest starting use with this every other day before bedtime to allow your skin to adjust.</li>
            <li>As others have said it is a little sticky, so I just apply it in the evening, let in sink into the skin for a few minutes and then add a touch of moisturizer and its fine.</li>
            <li>My skin is very stubborn and using this daily in the mornings or after a hard work out my skin has stayed clear!</li>
            <li>It  can sting a little and be sticky if too much is used, so use a pea sized amount.  </li>
            <li>During the day, I always use sunscreen, because I have noticed that using M2 frequently makes my skin a little sensitive to sunlight.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> it is great.</li>

            <li> and it worked great,</li>
            <li> I purchased the M2 Skin Care HP Skin Refinish 20% along with M2 Skin Technologies Skin Recovery Moisturizer after reading great reviews on the products and</li>
            <li> The mandelic acid is great, but the algae extract, for those of us acne prone, is death.  </li>

            <li> This serum is amazing!  </li>
            <li> M2 works amazing!</li>

            <li> YOU MUST WEAR A GOOD SUNSCREEN during the day when using this product.</li>
            <li> loved it during the summer too drying during the winter months in the northeast.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews I thought I would take this and</li>
            <li> and it looked good.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> Along with this, the skin on my face didn&#x27;t feel good anymore.</li>
            <li> I put a good deal of research into buying face creams .</li>
            <li> This one looked good.  </li>
            <li> I could never understand why everyone else was able to find over the counter products that worked for them and made their skins so beautiful.</li>
            <li> From the great comments this had, I thought I would be acne free by now!</li>
            <li> I rarely get a zit now, and my skin looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used, it is a bit pricey but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> So, many formulations may contain AHA but in ineffective trace amounts to keep their customers happy.</li>
            <li> In the winter I am sure to follow it up with a great night cream like Cetaphil</li>
            <li> OK!  </li>
            <li> And that is better than nothing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I totally love this product!</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked better since before puberty!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me but I will continue use to actually be able to judge the product!</li>
            <li> This stuff in FABULOUS!!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;My loving, amazing husband has been &#x27;working on my back\\&quot; almost every night for 9 months.</li>
            <li> The skin refinish serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> AMAZING BUY.</li>
            <li> I use this &amp; the skin recovery moisturizer and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I have tried lot&#x27;s and lot&#x27;s of products from fancy ($$$$) to drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> and I think the best approach is to use intensely for a week or two and then give your skin a day or two to recover so it doesn&#x27;t get fed up and start peeling.</li>
            <li> The M2 Skin Care 20% is complementing my routine regime, and I&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
            <li> Good face wash out of so many face wash creams I tried using before,</li>
            <li> Either way since then I&#x27;ve kind of dropped off with my use.</li>
            <li> it kind of burns.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is quite nice ...</li>
            <li> Totally worth the expense!!!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the vivant mandelic much more!</li>
            <li> I tend to have hormonal breakouts and this has been the best so far to help with that.</li>
            <li> Tried it just for the affected area and it made a HUGE difference overnight!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in the morning :-)    </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m mostly using this for hyperpigmentation from the sun and not for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> but you can apply lotion on top once it dries and that fixes the problem.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I dont know if mother nature was being generous with her gifts during that precious time</li>
            <li> , Im almost 100 percent sure it will work one way or another.</li>
            <li> This was better than nothing at the time when I couldn&#x27;t afford vivant.</li>
            <li> My pores are notably cleaner, which means they&#x27;re no longer inflamed.</li>
            <li> and i love using this at night for acne and scars</li>
            <li> So glad I&#x27;ve come to my senses</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve begun to breakout more, and in places like my forehead where I never breakout.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this treatment.</li>
            <li> If you use it before make up make sure it dries and you have a primer with SPF and your foundation or</li>
            <li> I did that because my skin can take it and unlike most I didn&#x27;t recieve that burning sensation.</li>
            <li> and my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff-</li>
            <li> More than the acne, my problem has been the hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> use it a lot more in the summer as it can be drying.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> This works ok for me, it does cause a lot of peeling.  </li>
            <li> 3) Lightly wipe washed skin with Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel on cotton ball/pad.</li>
            <li> Lightly wipe skin with Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel on cotton ball/pad. 3)</li>
            <li> This product is stunning.  </li>
            <li> My face became better and better after months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also feel like my skin looks better and tighter.</li>
            <li> That also has gotten better.</li>
            <li> Works better if you use moisturizer after applying&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Retin A before laser re-surfacing, and didn&#x27;t notice any more difference than using M2.</li>
            <li> and until I find something better I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It kept most of my acne at bay</li>
            <li> Smoother and more radiant complexion.  </li>
            <li> and I HIGHLY suggest getting it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Tightens up your skin and leaves it smooth and delicious to the touch the next morning!  </li>
            <li> I just received my first bottle of M2 and could not be more thrilled.</li>
            <li> The design of the bottle is elegant and a fantastic idea in theory, but it does not work well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it really did me any good.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed and pleased with my skin care routine/products, that I wanted to share and possibly help some of you that are looking for the right skin care routine in their 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I scar easily, esp.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face mostly blemish free and smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong and it tends to be somewhat sticky).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s strong</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter, my pores seem smaller, and I my skin has a beautiful glowing appearance.</li>
            <li> It is tacky and smells kind of funny, so</li>
            <li> On top of that, I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in just days</li>
            <li> Consistency is important.</li>
            <li> It glowed, my acne was reduced, and my skin felt really smooth...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great skin in a short time.</li>
            <li> Must be used everyday but it exfoliates and smoothes skin wonderfully,</li>
            <li> No cystic acne,  smooth skin and my scarring started fading.</li>
            <li> The lady who did my laser re-surfacing read the ingredients and she had a very favorable opinion of M2 even though she was promoting their own line of products.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> good and natural products like this than go the botox route or under the knife.</li>
            <li> Ordered 20% M2 and paid much higher cost!!  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in Amazon!!!  </li>
            <li> Unlike anything else so well worth the money!</li>
            <li> With this stuff, you will notice significant improvement within about a month.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any significant reduction in pimples.</li>
            <li> From reading the reviews I was so excited to buy this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the original product from skinstore rx before...</li>
            <li> I used this product when it was in it&#x27;s original packaging.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the original one.</li>
            <li> It is not for everyone as some may not be familiar with AHA products.</li>
            <li> so I am excited to see what a year does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff is derived from the fountain of youth.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I use this each evening on clean skin, and after 15 minutes apply a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> With this product, I experienced visible results after only the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> , my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in over a year, the last time I used M2.</li>
            <li> Can cause a bit of peeling when used twice a day but not bad.</li>
            <li> That last part is very important: use a moisturizer over this and be sure to wear sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> It clears brown spots quickly with nightly use.</li>
            <li> If you think that the product isn&#x27;t working (because your melasma looks the same), see if your freckles and/or acne scars are getting better (these are more \\&quot;shallow\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> Its super super sticky.</li>
            <li> but it runs out quickly</li>
            <li> It does NOT smell at all, but once it dries it is super sticky, SO</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe to say that I LOVE this product and will definitely keep purchasing!</li>
            <li> My skin texture did improve rather quickly, I used it nightly and exfoliated in the mornings.</li>
            <li> However, when I wake up in the morning I love how soft and smooth my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I also have hyperpigmentation from when I was pregnant</li>
            <li> So what I do is I will apply M2 to a clean face right before bedtime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li> I was very concerned that this lotion would be too strong for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fun and quick to do.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you that when I first used M2, my skin LITERALLY changed overnight!</li>
            <li> No more adult acne and my skin just looks smooth, almost flawless.</li>
            <li> I have yet to see any real progress with the fine lines on my forehead</li>
            <li> Finally, I came across this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing I have found to be effective in evening out my skin tone and diminishing the appearance of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> But it make my skin more sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li> i bought the cleanser because I realized that after a couple of weeks of success, nothing was changing.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better, as far as acne scarring and sun damage goes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give it a fair rating since I do not use it as regularly as I should...</li>
            <li> It is very smoothing to the texture and when I am good about using it several times a week I do get compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out in places i rarely ever do, like my forehead and neck and sideburn area and nose.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then start with 12% then go to 20% if you want more effect.</li>
            <li> you can overcome the rougher aspects of this product, it will definitely be worth it.</li>
            <li> Completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Might not be suitable for particularly sensitive skin - would recommend a &amp;#34;patch test&amp;#34; first.  </li>
            <li> it is sticky but its worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I can tell its doing something since my skin looks better already.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product more for hyperpigmentation, and so far it has done nothing for that.</li>
            <li> It took a couple months for my skin to start looking clear but my scars have faded and I don&#x27;t get nearly as many breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I rarely get break outs anymore</li>
            <li> I will certainly try on my face but it works great on dark knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> I use it on my acne prone skin, which is not severe acne, but just can be breakout prone if I am not careful, and it works awesome to help keep those little skin bumps away.</li>
            <li> Just one use of this clears up my skin right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin and get razor burn easily, this stuff eliminates it.</li>
            <li> The stickiness is actually a good thing because what that is, is the AHA&#x27;s breaking down the damaged outer layer of skin.</li>
            <li> I really see just as much improvement with the M2 as I do these deeper peels, but I&#x27;m on a mission to have blemish free skin.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any effect on wrinkles,maybe it needs more time,im not sure,however if you have oily,acne prone skin,it absolutely works to clear up the skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is quite large and that makes the price worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a highly rated product, however for me someone with sensitive skin it stung and burned and it lasted for quite awhile before skin felt ok again.</li>
            <li> (so not horrible enough for me to choose Accutane -</li>
            <li> The first time I applied this product (after washing with my clarisonic)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and just put in an order for my second bottle.</li>
            <li> You will see sometype of a difference and it might actually work better for you than it did for me....</li>
            <li> Hopfully I see more in the next week</li>
            <li> I saw some difference when I first started using it</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this but for the price I probably will not be buying it again anytime soon.</li>
            <li> It tightens pores also and makes my skin look smoother, more even toned and overall better/younger.  </li>
            <li> I love it and would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> The first night I used it, it made my face feel so sticky</li>
            <li> My skin tone looks lighter, brighter, and more even when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li> I literally noticed differences within the first day of use.</li>
            <li> I wish I had done this in the first place.</li>
            <li> I went out for the first time in 27 years without make up on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than in the last 20 years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to finish my first bottle and already ordered my second, so glad to see that the price has dropped.</li>
            <li> This has done so much for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months, but it got rid of my blemishes after the first use.</li>
            <li> I make teeny-tiny dots of the product on my forehead first and then rub in.</li>
            <li> I see that some have said it is sticky, but if you read the instructions they say to put a moisturizer over it and that REALLY works!  </li>
            <li> It is a key ingredient to add tartness to many</li>
            <li> Love what they do for my skin which is not getting younger.</li>
            <li> I have been on Retin A numerous times, antiobiotics, birth control, differin gel, tea tree oil, sulfur soaps, salicylic acid products, alpha hydroxy acid products and so much more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a rather large bottle and since it works best in small amounts</li>
            <li> Ultimately I have returned to buy more because it really does work.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell when I am getting low and most of the time I have to really work at it to get it to squirt out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The first application I put almost 2 pumps and it made my face incredibly sticky so the next time (and every time afterward) I have used only 1 pump and my face still feels a bit sticky, however I only use it at night just before bed</li>
            <li> but im pretty sure after the fisrt day I saw reduced redness and no new breakouts.</li>
            <li> For me, I feel like even one night of not using it causes the un-doing of the positive results.</li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to write this review to make sure I have reaped all of the benefits.</li>
            <li> I would give this the amazing rave reviews that some have, but I have seen a slight improvement with my skins appearance.</li>
            <li> Four stars because I was expecting better results for my dry lines as well</li>
            <li> so first off, I dont know if I was suppose to use all three products together (CLEANSER,SERUM AND MOISTURIZER), but I was only using the serum and mositurizer once a day, at night to be precise, after I washed for 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I feel that this product is less effective than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li> My skin is SUPER sensitive and I have literally tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> acne, clearer skin in certain areas.</li>
            <li> Just be smart with it for certain, since your using this at home without a doctor&#x27;s supervision.  </li>
            <li> If you are a person of a certain age and struggle with acne, breakouts, even rosacea breakouts</li>
            <li> I love trying all kinds of new ones, but this one I keep going back to.</li>
            <li> I use this right before I go to sleep over the targeted dark spots, and make sure to use a moisturizer with SPF in the day (Alpha Hydroxy Moisturizer).</li>
            <li> It sluffs off old skin super fast and allows your skin to regenerate.</li>
            <li> I suffer an occasional break out, have melasma from sun damage and am showing signs of fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> On the downside, I have not noticed much difference with the one (rather large) age spot that I have.  </li>
            <li> This really is a product that lives up to what it says it will do, and in a vast ocean of products that make big big claims, the fact that this one actually does what the company claims is pretty magnificent!</li>
            <li> Many women enjoy the concept of what AHA&#x27;s can do but have a hard time accepting the pain it takes to get there.</li>
            <li> I am noticing a HUGE difference with exfoliation and lightening of these scars with the products I listed above.  </li>
            <li> But the Amazon price is much lower than at the doctor&#x27;s clinic.</li>
            <li> Every night would be too much for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try gentler means to get rid of them before going for intense chemical treatments from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> The label states that if you apply too much product it can cause your face to be sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> so it really hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li> This product really does work well in both preventing and removing acne.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel really sticky after using it</li>
            <li> its really stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just wasnt doing much for me.</li>
            <li> but than my skin started to get really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It helped my skin so much.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin smooth and lightens my skin to only a bit.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have had problems with acne, blackheads, whiteheads, follicular issues, scarring and discoloration.</li>
            <li> I ordered the whole line of products.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product looked as advertised.</li>
            <li> but it was too much in terms of the peeling aspect.</li>
            <li> It would be too much on the face at once.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay attention to that too much just read.</li>
            <li> If your skin is stinky and not drying your using too much.</li>
            <li> and it worked very well</li>
            <li> Not well known and I didn&#x27;t know really what to expect when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I am 63 but am blessed with very &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from Blue light therapy to Accutane.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> but I have very problem skin.  </li>
            <li> told I really like this product &amp; hope</li>
            <li> If you use too much, has a sticky feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li> This really helps my skin seem to retain moisture</li>
            <li> But it works very well for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer however is very tacky and stays that way.</li>
            <li> Nothing&#x27;s ever really worked for me til I found M2.</li>
            <li> In a short time, my skin is completely clear, smoother, pores are tighter, wrinkles are softened and my skin is now more even toned.  </li>
            <li> The stinging is not bad and I normally have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also starting using Bobbi Brown&#x27;s intensive serum to help my skin not peel and regenerate some lovely new skin cells after the old ones were all gone and the combination is a match made in heaven!</li>
            <li> Ok ok maybe im being dramatic but</li>
            <li> Also, this product will cause excessive drying and peeling so make sure to wear moisturizer and SPF always!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this three weeks, so I&#x27;ll report back later if it is more/less successful.</li>
            <li> Never ship a inferior or less effective product and try to pass for more expensive and potent product.  </li>
            <li> Really folks, don&#x27;t go wild here, you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> Fast forward to today: It isn&#x27;t working as quickly for me as it did back then.</li>
            <li> It just seemed to help the blemishes I had and stop the new ones from getting large and unsightly.  </li>
            <li> After a week, I was completely clear of acne for the first time ever since I was a pre-teen (approx 20 years ago).  </li>
            <li> This is my new bby!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried practically everything to promote more even, less pock-marked skin.  </li>
            <li> I add a moisturizer on top (something scented slightly helps).  </li>
            <li> Overall there was some tingling but nothing that was unbearable and it quickly faded.</li>
            <li> However, after the initial period of adjustment, I now just feel a mild tingling sensation when the lotion is applied.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother, particularly on my forehead.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing facials regularly, which it&#x27;s helping tremendously.</li>
            <li> sure enough, my cystic acne comes back along my jaw line</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne and occasionally break out on my chin, but I am always looking for something to stop the breakouts even though my acne is mild.  </li>
            <li> I use NIVEA or Waxelene, but recommend something lighter like NEUTROGENA HEALTHY SKIN in the blue and white tube with SPF.  </li>
            <li> Comes in a convenient twisting pump that you can open and close, and you only need like a dime size at most for your face.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, be prepared that your skin may at first tingle/burn slightly and may dry out as it gets used to the formula~but you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the lotion.     </li>
            <li> The product had exploded inside the packaging, which being transported to a high altitude location (Colorado) is understandable.</li>
            <li> **: M2 High Potency Skin Refresh 20%.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as a OTC retinol product without a prescription.</li>
            <li> It works great for sun damaged skin and it lasts a really long time, my brown spots are fading though I would also like to add that I alternate between M2 and Retin-A every other night.</li>
            <li> I experimentally applied it on my UA and it brought my UA&#x27;s skin much fairer.</li>
            <li> So I only use M2 on days where my facial regimen consists of light washing with my fingertips and a gentle toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has really helped my skin stay consistently - clear.  </li>
            <li> so I will update this review in a few weeks when I&#x27;ve seen more results.    </li>
            <li> Blackheads that were in my skin are rising to the top and coming out without any trouble, redness or scarring.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I saw immediate results, my skin felt smooth and it seemed that my breakouts were less frequent.</li>
            <li> I have FINALLY found the right product.  </li>
            <li> Uses less of the product and keeps my skin from becoming too dependent on it.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> As a result, I began a new project on how to make some improvement and slowdown what is happening to my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s work from the bottom up to encourage new skin cell growth.</li>
            <li> I was putting off ordering it because I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $50 despite the great results but it would definitely have been a worse catastrophe to run out and have to wait for the new order to come in.</li>
            <li> My hyper pigmentation is slowly getting better but isn&#x27;t fading as fast as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> I then changed to using the &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; product line, such as their facial wash and their light moisturizer and</li>
            <li> I am blonde, blue eyed, slender and tall with somewhat sensitive skin which burns easily.</li>
            <li> I am African American and have light skin, but I produce a lot of melanin</li>
            <li> It is strong, smells odd and leaves a film on the skin, but--</li>
            <li> On nights that my skin feels especially dry, 30 minutes after Retinol or AHA application, I spread on a very light layer of German Nivea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to clear up my skin and even out my skin for years!</li>
            <li> Everything seems to be working so far!</li>
            <li> I put the refinish cream on before sleep and first thing in the morning followed by the moisturizer 15 mins later and have seen signifigant improvement of my pore size and scars.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and have suffered with acne (not HORRIBLE) but the occasional cystic big pimples or red scaring.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but find it&#x27;s a little too strong.</li>
            <li> so I slowed down on the use just to make it last longer.  :-)</li>
            <li> This is basically a watered down version of the original...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product &amp; used it in combination with the Obagi Clear.</li>
            <li> I used M2 all over my face, but used Obagi Clear to spot treat darker areas.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to keep at it and hope that all the breakouts will clear up, and I will again be awed by this product,</li>
            <li> I can clearly see visible results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping that in another 3 months, it&#x27;ll be completely clear.</li>
            <li> M2 works to clear up the hyperpigmentation and as a side-effect reduces your acne breaks out.</li>
            <li> it helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> You will need to get used to the stickiness of the product, but I only apply it at night time when I&#x27;m asleep away, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> No as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, I have hyper-pigmentation problem cause by too much ACTH in my system.</li>
            <li> As I have only had this product for 2 weeks I have yet to see any real results</li>
            <li> I am looking for a reduction in sunspots on my face that I have been self conscious about for a while-</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to chemical/environmental allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t suggest this product to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This has improved my skin so much since adding it to my nightly facial routine.  </li>
            <li> So far, this product has been awesome...outside of my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old, and I have been struggling with acne since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin so much that I should finally write a review.  </li>
            <li> Im using manoka honey to lighten my hyper pigmentation from old acne, and it works way</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stop it completely</li>
            <li> I use it also with the moisturizer and a sunscreen for sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> Drug store products,  home remedies, natural products, even adapalene gel.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have hyperpigmentation on my forehead and along the side of my face.  </li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old latina with adult acne and age spots, nothing, nothing i tried before worked(clinique, proactive, etc....)</li>
            <li> so I would put this on at night- completely cleared it up.</li>
            <li> Now, after a couple months, the skin on my face is glowing and feels SO INCREDIBLY soft..</li>
            <li> I plan to update this at the 6 month mark, but so far out of all of it, the Green Cream made the most drastic difference to my skin appearance and texture overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;polished from the benefits of using these natural acids on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M2</li>
            <li> Malic acid is a naturally occurring organic compound found in most&lt;br /&gt;unripe fruit.</li>
            <li> that these are natural.</li>
            <li> Most OTC products are a complete waste of time - it takes forever for even a tiny improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any significant change to my skin yet, its been almost a month of using, no matter how little I try to apply, it still feels sticky.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40s and prior to using this product, suffered from adult acne since my early 20s, particularly during my cycle.</li>
            <li> Melasma is stubborn and takes a long time to clear up, but this product really does help if you stick with it</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product was in 2006, I went through the last 6 years trying different things.</li>
            <li> Maybe I only gave four star because my expectations were so high.  </li>
            <li> is my daily routine now: washing my face with Q10 cleansing wipes, then I apply M2 High potency skin refinish 20%.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 54 year old male, and I do have wrinkles around my eyes, but this stuff has helped keep my skin tighter, brighter, and even toned and I used to live in Florida and tan all the time.</li>
            <li> I apply this in a similar manner to the Green Cream except that it is more fluid and seemsto spread easier.</li>
            <li> I had tried different face washes, proactiv+, toners, salicylic acid pads, a new birth control pill, etc.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate using a gentle jojoba oil facial massage (sometimes mixed with sugar in the shower during the winter) about once each week.     </li>
            <li> I use it on my face, back and chest and keeps my tone even, my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I overcame this by only using M2 on gentle facial days.</li>
            <li> Then I saw that it&#x27;s really meant as an overall facial serum for a myriad of problems (lines/discoloration, etc.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my whole life and finally at 31 I feel I found something that actually works.</li>
            <li> within 1-2 weeks my skin finally started to calm down and within 3-4 weeks the cystic acne was completely gone.  </li>
            <li> This has made my skin very smooth and glowing, no more uneven tones on my forehead and cheekbones, it has completely changed my skin though I would still like to see my brown spots go away completely.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking clear night in the Rocky Mts looking up at the stars number of spots on my back!</li>
            <li> It use to make my skin clear, but now all it does is make pimples I already have smaller(does not make them go away) and prevents future breakouts.</li>
            <li> Early 40s female who suffered from cystic acne as a teenager and, as a result, has pitted skin.  </li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, like me, this will sting alittle, but only temporarily.</li>
            <li> I barely get any breakouts, but the purpose of this is to specifically get rid of scarring and it does just that.</li>
            <li> I know my face is to get worse before it gets better,  </li>
            <li> However after that, I began developing small bumps everywhere which eventually became full blown inflamed acne.  </li>
            <li> I have had more deep cyst acne since I have started using both products, but that is happening less and less now.</li>
            <li> It was a miracle product for me for about the first month and a half.  </li>
            <li> but then little by little my skin got better.</li>
            <li> Stinging: Again, if an AHA product doesn&#x27;t sting, that has almost always been a dead giveaway for me that it is not potent enough to be effective.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it was clear the product had exploded prior to shipping because the serum had crusted and the entire contents had seeped out of the bottle and had coated the interior of the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> This works to resurface the skin, but it is a different type of Alpha Hydroxy acid which activates and exfoliates the uppermost layers of skin cells, while the Retinol in the Green Cream is absorbed to do</li>
            <li> I saw results in the first few days of using it.  </li>
            <li> Lately my skin has been a little more sensitive so now when I use the product it burns like hell, only for about 5-10 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> There is NO miracle lotion to take decades off your face, only surgery can do that; that said, this stuff is the most dramatic and affective face lotion I&#x27;ve ever used regardless of price.</li>
            <li> ,i will repurchase again,the con is that it is sticky, let it dry completely if you want to use another moisturizer on top,overall this is a product i would recommend.</li>
            <li> Allow to dry completely.</li>
            <li> I recieved this last month, I used it everyday at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because those treatments work to clear up your acne first and then wait for the slow healing process of the scars that cause the hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest starting use with this every other day before bedtime to allow your skin to adjust.</li>
            <li> As others have said it is a little sticky, so I just apply it in the evening, let in sink into the skin for a few minutes and then add a touch of moisturizer and its fine.</li>
            <li> My skin is very stubborn and using this daily in the mornings or after a hard work out my skin has stayed clear!</li>
            <li> It  can sting a little and be sticky if too much is used, so use a pea sized amount.  </li>
            <li> During the day, I always use sunscreen, because I have noticed that using M2 frequently makes my skin a little sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> Its not major acne but enough to annoy and be noticable.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been noticing that deep rooted black heads and clogged pores are surfacing.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear dark spots like before.</li>
            <li> the morning my skin feel soft but this product doesn&#x27;t help with my break out skin and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I dont know if I dont wait long enough between the serum and mositurizer but jeesum...</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell you if it cleared up my skin</li>
            <li> Also, it has helped clear brown post-acne marks much faster than usual, and I have had less acne since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a slight burning sensation when it is first applied to the face for a few seconds</li>
            <li> It is drying and it does cause the skin to pinken slightly, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay in exchange for a product that actually delivers...and at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> The packaging is downright terrible but the actual product itself is effective and gentle enough that I can use it every evening.</li>
            <li> This product was not good, after the first day i thought i saw results but after 3 weeks i saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care, as long as the product worked.  </li>
            <li> and my acne is almost gone, blackheads are few and far between, scarring and discoloration fading.</li>
            <li> I suffer with adult acne and this helps with cell turnover and sloughing off dead skin.</li>
            <li> I would even suggest doing that long term for as long as you use this</li>
            <li> I like to exfoliate my face with facial brushes, scrubs, and wet rags.</li>
            <li> This cleared up some minor acne i had,it also exfoliates the skin</li>
            <li> I have a long, slender neck</li>
            <li> I was a long time Proactiv user.  </li>
            <li> And I am currently on my period, where I break out with 7-10 cystic pimples on my chin usually, and currently I have one new pimple and its been there for only a few days</li>
            <li> I have medium sensitive skin and noticed minimal peeling and slight burning.</li>
            <li> I use it every third night instead of every other night.</li>
            <li> have already recommended it to other people who have the same problems as me.</li>
            <li> Pat dry.</li>
            <li> This is by no means, a miracle overnight disappearing cream/lotion, but after a few weeks, I hope that will make some major improvements.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single breakout since I started using M2, which has been around 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure my skin type either normal/combination or dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune trying to clear up my melasma/hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> 2) Use hands to wash face and neck with Shea Moisture African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read: if you stop using them your skin will get back to the previous state.</li>
            <li> This product completely eradicated the acne, and my skin seems a little less oily.</li>
            <li> noticed a dramatic difference after the first night use.  </li>
            <li> Along with my other products, this helps to keep my skin clear and pours small.</li>
            <li> I am half Asian and have learned that blacks, asians and other non-whites can have adverse scarring from laser and acid peels.</li>
            <li> Topical Anti-bacterials clear up the acne but makes the folliculitis worse...</li>
            <li> Although it has only been a few days, I can already see a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days, both my husband and I have seen a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> Not only does it stop acne dead in it&#x27;s tracks but it lightens scars and makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> It stings when applied but lasts only a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> After comparing several products, I took the plunge on AST Green Cream 9.</li>
            <li> Mandelic acid is an alpha hydroxy and is antibacterial in nature.&lt;br /&gt;It is extracted from the bitter almond.  </li>
            <li> Start using slowly,i used it every night and my skin became very dry and sensitive,so i changed it to every other night</li>
            <li> Ever since I was a child, I have had 2 fairly large horizontal neck rings, that I never really thought about until the last few years where they started to look darker, larger and unhappy.</li>
            <li> Although I have clear skin and don&#x27;t usually have skin trouble, I get a pimple or two</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My pores were a little smaller, the scarring from past pimples were less red.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything and spent a lot of money!</li>
            <li> this product WILL BLEACH your towels/pillowcases so be careful!     </li>
            <li> I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> put on M2, got a tiny tingling sensation and was anxious to see what would happen in the morning.</li>
            <li> it works extremely well for me.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a first time user.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have noticed some glow, and the big pimples are drying up, but it&#x27;s also giving me small breakouts.</li>
            <li> I wear it at night and my skin rejuvinites due to this serum.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate every other day, but tea tree products from the body shop have been my friend.</li>
            <li> However, I also suffer from extremely oily skin and post-menopausal cystic acne.</li>
            <li> EVERY OTHER NIGHT.</li>
            <li> This product every other day along with Retin A Micro has been a God send for my face.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have always had extremely oily/shiny skin.  </li>
            <li> I began researching what other alternatives there were and thought M2 mandelic acid treatment line might do the trick as it claims to treat acne as well as deal with hyperpigmentation and smoothing out lines/diminish pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> again though i do have COMBINATION skin, a few dry patches and acne</li>
            <li> skin, a few dry patches and acne</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, waited for previous container to run out before using, and after using for several weeks, noticed I was not getting same effect as previously, started looking at the ingredients and product was only the 12%.  </li>
            <li> After wasting so much money, I was skeptical about buying yet another product, but I did it anyway.  </li>
            <li> I always used it at night, with expectation my breakout skin and dark spots will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> This stuff fades dark acne marks.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman of color and sometimes we can have dark knees and elbows....</li>
            <li> Everything on my back and face seems to be slowly fading into the background.</li>
            <li> I love the serum, seen results almost immediately, but hate the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Start low go slow.</li>
            <li> Sticky and sour tasting, but works like a charm.</li>
            <li> If you have skin as bad as mine and are ready to splurge on something that actually works... try this product!</li>
            <li> I put it on and went to work, and when I came home I ALREADY noticed my skin looking brighter and less \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; from the folliculitis.</li>
            <li> so I welcomed some serious acne on my back and chest.</li>
            <li> I still have some acne scars, but can easily be hidden with a concealer-stick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a SLIGHT tingling sensation, but it goes away after like 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> It seems it have reduced my pore size slightly.</li>
            <li> I had black patches on both my cheeks, around my mouth, and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> and I feel like its a very active product on my skin.</li>
            <li> I still have a few dark spots here</li>
            <li> or if I was eating more crap than usual.</li>
            <li> I just started using this because I have developed adult acne :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a while, suggested by my mother, and I&#x27;ve seen a little bit of a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li> Now, what I&#x27;m thinking is that my skin, having been treatment-free since I arrived in the US a little over a year ago, is readjusting to the AHAs.</li>
            <li> Can be a little sticky if you over do it.</li>
            <li> The only con would be that it can be a little irritating at times (always wear sunscreen when going out).</li>
            <li> As for dark spots they have lightened very little, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the product or exfoliating or both.</li>
            <li> Clear, glowing skin...never fails.</li>
            <li> but I was never completely clear, always had at least 1-3 pimples on my face and my complexion was just not healthy or radiant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that skin has to adjust to AHAs, and while it&#x27;s doing so, breakouts can occur for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It only made my skin worse and dryyy...</li>
            <li> &quot; and I stop using it for a few days...</li>
            <li> GREEN CREAM</li>
            <li> COMBINE OR USE THE M2 AND THE GREEN CREAM</li>
            <li> I got the whole deal: small and large acne, cystic acne--just terrible skin.</li>
            <li> I started slow with this though, using it every other night, building up to every night over time.</li>
            <li> Over the last 6 months, I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic improvement in the tone and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I can say is that this product feels &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not greasy, there&#x27;s no strong scent</li>
            <li> First off let me start by saying I have had terrible skim since I was 8 years old.</li>
            <li> to start I was breaking out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> but it has been recommended by every derm I&#x27;ve ever gone to see) but bad enough that it is noticeable, red, inflamed and everywhere.</li>
            <li> Very badly designed bottle, hart to get the serum and brakes easy.</li>
            <li> It was very dull and rough in texture.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s very little that&#x27;ll do anything for hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Very sticky, sometimes so bad that I find myself stuck to my pillow in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are talking tons of raised red ouchy zits, tons of plugs and lots of angry white-heads.</li>
            <li> I plan to update this review in a few weeks to see if M2 is still in my life!</li>
            <li> In any case, I&#x27;ll be back in a couple of weeks or so to maybe change my rating if there are any changes, hopefully not for the worse, though!</li>
            <li> I made a mistake by getting lazy and laying off M2.</li>
            <li> I never go to sleep without using this and when I miss a day or two, I can feel the difference in my skin with the small pimples that would&#x27;ve been cleared out by this product continuing to grow.</li>
            <li> After many review on Sea Buckthorn oil, I decided to try it, well after about 1 month of using it, my chin broke out in terrible cystic acne which I never had before</li>
            <li> I try to wait at least 10 minutes here before doing the Green Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works for acne, but I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive and doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s exception. ..</li>
            <li> Seller didn&#x27;t give me a hard time with that</li>
            <li> Because it is an expensive lotion, I&#x27;ve just broken open the container to access the lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to share some tips to over come some of the negative things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Literally 1 pump for your face and neck will do, I even apply it before makeup because it sucks up the oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> but my skin is at least 70-80% clearer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this product because it&#x27;s sucks.  </li>
            <li> I admit, I&#x27;m a sucker for beauty products...</li>
            <li> Lately, my skin has felt so well</li>
            <li> i returned this because it is too oilly, and  too thick</li>
            <li> No more deodarants!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alot less risky and expensive than laser or acid peels for people with olive skin.  </li>
            <li> I moved from a tropical country, where it was humid all the time, to San Francisco, where it&#x27;s always dry and almost always cold.</li>
            <li> seriously, who cares?</li>
            <li> so I started using it a few nights a week all over (just a very thin layer, though --</li>
            <li> Definitely not a repurchase. :-(</li>
            <li> Looking at the ingredients, I noticed that there was algae extract, which I just found out is extremely comedogenic!!!!!  </li>
            <li> In just a few days I have noticed a difference and it has worked wonders on my acne and my hyperpigmentation around my eyes is already lightening!!!</li>
            <li> I have mild/moderate acne which gets worse towards the end of my cycle along with a very annoying and difficult-to-treat case of fungal folliculitis due to heavy use of antibiotics in the past year.</li>
            <li> Of 3 bottles, 2 have broken almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that commented on the poor design of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 months and all it has done has made it worse.</li>
            <li> feel sticky even I just apply a thin layer as instructed.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced stickiness after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I began to break out even worse.</li>
            <li> It has now been 2 weeks, and  my skin has barely broken out.</li>
            <li> My skin does seem brighter and my break outs may have been worse without it.</li>
            <li> I had broken out with rather bad acne around my chin and mouth after having to abruptly stop taking a birth control pill.</li>
            <li> and they say that you need to wait at least 8 to see a dramatic difference, so patience is a must!</li>
            <li> Since turning 30 years old (I&#x27;m 32 now) I have had terrible acne on my chin and here and there on my face.  </li>
            <li> sorry M2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells weird too.</li>
            <li> I am in my thirties and had horrible acne with big scars as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a very thin layer of M2 at night, after I have applied my toner.</li>
            <li> So as anyone whos desperate to find a cure, I ventured out and found this.</li>
            <li> When they say &amp;#34;refinish&amp;#34; - they mean it!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The BAD SIDE:</li>
            <li> and if you have no moisturizer in tow you are in bad luck.  </li>
            <li> From time to time I will get a bad acne breakout</li>
            <li> On particularly bad day I tried m2 out of desperation.</li>
            <li> I pick my face :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, the nosel is crap, needs to be improved on.</li>
            <li> I do hate the bottle itself</li>
            <li> and it stung like crazy!!  </li>
            <li> I used the product as stated and I have not seen any difference in my complexion at all, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> what was causing my face to look so terrible.  </li>
            <li> I have real bad acne prone skin and my scars are taken care by this serum.</li>
            <li> For 7-8 months my skin was terrible and I am person who never has suffered from acne.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  It exfoliates and minimizes break outs. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and I wish I found this product sooner.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed this for me to restore skin clarity as I had some allergies which manifested as rashes on my face and left marks when they healed. But the Amazon price is much lower than at the doctor&#x27;s clinic.</li>
            <li> Although I have clear skin and don&#x27;t usually have skin trouble, I get a pimple or two once a month. Just one use of this clears up my skin right away. You will need to get used to the stickiness of the product, but I only apply it at night time when I&#x27;m asleep away, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> I have mild/moderate acne which gets worse towards the end of my cycle along with a very annoying and difficult-to-treat case of fungal folliculitis due to heavy use of antibiotics in the past year. I have tried just about everything and spent a lot of money! Topical Anti-bacterials clear up the acne but makes the folliculitis worse...so I heard this works from another sufferer and ordered it.    I just got this product today, only 2 days after I ordered it with standard shipping. I put it on and went to work, and when I came home I ALREADY noticed my skin looking brighter and less \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; from the folliculitis. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in the morning :-)    I also have sun spots but of course that will take a while, so I will update this review in a few weeks when I&#x27;ve seen more results.    The bottle is quite large and that makes the price worth it. I expect this to last me for 4 to 6 months of daily use. The stinging is not bad and I normally have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> OK!  I can honestly say that I have tried lot&#x27;s and lot&#x27;s of products from fancy ($$$$) to drug store brands.  I didn&#x27;t care, as long as the product worked.  Well, my quest is over!  This serum is amazing!  I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in just days and now it&#x27;s been weeks and counting.  I suffer an occasional break out, have melasma from sun damage and am showing signs of fine lines and wrinkles.  Sounds like I would need a miracle, but this serum handles it.  In a short time, my skin is completely clear, smoother, pores are tighter, wrinkles are softened and my skin is now more even toned.  I just ordered the rest of the M2 line products too (out of curiosity), because the refinish serum works so well.  I&#x27;m also extremely happy that I am not spending a fortune!!!  YOU MUST WEAR A GOOD SUNSCREEN during the day when using this product.</li>
            <li> I used this to reduce my acne scars/hyper-pigmentation and it works! It sluffs off old skin super fast and allows your skin to regenerate. Can cause a bit of peeling when used twice a day but not bad. I have been using it over a month and I think the best approach is to use intensely for a week or two and then give your skin a day or two to recover so it doesn&#x27;t get fed up and start peeling. I also starting using Bobbi Brown&#x27;s intensive serum to help my skin not peel and regenerate some lovely new skin cells after the old ones were all gone and the combination is a match made in heaven! Do beware though- this product WILL BLEACH your towels/pillowcases so be careful!     Best product I have ever come across for acne-prone skin/scars. Unlike anything else so well worth the money! It&#x27;s actually a rather large bottle and since it works best in small amounts it&#x27;s a great value. I have had mine about a month and I haven&#x27;t even used 20% of it yet!    Four stars because I was expecting better results for my dry lines as well but it hasn&#x27;t made any difference whatsoever in that department.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties so I&#x27;m mostly using this for hyperpigmentation from the sun and not for wrinkles. It works great for sun damaged skin and it lasts a really long time, my brown spots are fading though I would also like to add that I alternate between M2 and Retin-A every other night. This has made my skin very smooth and glowing, no more uneven tones on my forehead and cheekbones, it has completely changed my skin though I would still like to see my brown spots go away completely. I have been using this product for 6 months and they say that you need to wait at least 8 to see a dramatic difference, so patience is a must!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks.  I use it every other night. Every night would be too much for my skin.  So far, I&#x27;ve been noticing that deep rooted black heads and clogged pores are surfacing.  My hyper pigmentation is slowly getting better but isn&#x27;t fading as fast as I thought it would.  Also, this product will cause excessive drying and peeling so make sure to wear moisturizer and SPF always!  Overall, the product seems to be doing well for my skin and I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Skin glows, keeps blemishes at bay, starting to see skin evenness. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this one is sticking around. I&#x27;ve used this for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I just received my first bottle of M2 and could not be more thrilled. Although it has only been a few days, I can already see a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#x27;s talk about my skin so you understand that intensity and severity that I have to work with here. Some people say they have acne, which means occasional bumps, white-heads and blackheads. People, I have ACNE - not cystic (so not horrible enough for me to choose Accutane - but it has been recommended by every derm I&#x27;ve ever gone to see) but bad enough that it is noticeable, red, inflamed and everywhere. On top of that, I&#x27;m pregnant so I welcomed some serious acne on my back and chest. We are talking tons of raised red ouchy zits, tons of plugs and lots of angry white-heads. No as if that wasn&#x27;t enough, I have hyper-pigmentation problem cause by too much ACTH in my system. So when I tan, I turn brown, when I scar it is even darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My loving, amazing husband has been &#x27;working on my back\\&quot; almost every night for 9 months. All that &#x27;work&#x27; has emptied out my back of plugged up goop but left me with tons of hyperpigemented spots on my back. We&#x27;re talking clear night in the Rocky Mts looking up at the stars number of spots on my back! Enough to make strangers make comments when I;m at the pool or gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on M2, got a tiny tingling sensation and was anxious to see what would happen in the morning. After a few days, both my husband and I have seen a definite improvement. Everything on my back and face seems to be slowly fading into the background. This is by no means, a miracle overnight disappearing cream/lotion, but after a few weeks, I hope that will make some major improvements. I plan to update this review in a few weeks to see if M2 is still in my life!</li>
            <li> I love the serum, seen results almost immediately, but hate the packaging.  Very badly designed bottle, hart to get the serum and brakes easy.</li>
            <li> I stopped using deodorant and anti-perpirant because of this product. This isn&#x27;t only for the face but for under arms too! I experimentally applied it on my UA and it brought my UA&#x27;s skin much fairer. No more deodarants!</li>
            <li> I got an email from a skincare website that I occasionally use advertising this product, I hopped over to amazon.com and found that it was $13 cheaper so I bought it here! As I have only had this product for 2 weeks I have yet to see any real results but I plan on continuing my review as needed. I am looking for a reduction in sunspots on my face that I have been self conscious about for a while- I&#x27;d like to try gentler means to get rid of them before going for intense chemical treatments from the dermatologist.  The first time I applied this product (after washing with my clarisonic) I had a tiny paper cut on my application finger and it stung like crazy!!  Likewise, if you have any abrasions or facial skin that is in any way compromised you will feel quite a sting for a minute. Overall there was some tingling but nothing that was unbearable and it quickly faded. The label states that if you apply too much product it can cause your face to be sticky feeling. The first application I put almost 2 pumps and it made my face incredibly sticky so the next time (and every time afterward) I have used only 1 pump and my face still feels a bit sticky, however I only use it at night just before bed so it really hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li> This lotion is excellent. It is the only thing I have found to be effective in evening out my skin tone and diminishing the appearance of hyperpigmentation. Consistency is important. I use this each evening on clean skin, and after 15 minutes apply a moisturizer. That last part is very important: use a moisturizer over this and be sure to wear sunscreen during the day. I begin to experience dryness if I skip the moisturizer and wear a hat/sunscreen every day outdoors. I started slow with this though, using it every other night, building up to every night over time. It is strong, smells odd and leaves a film on the skin, but--it works extremely well for me.    I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to chemical/environmental allergic reactions. I was very concerned that this lotion would be too strong for me. However, after the initial period of adjustment, I now just feel a mild tingling sensation when the lotion is applied. I exfoliate using a gentle jojoba oil facial massage (sometimes mixed with sugar in the shower during the winter) about once each week.     Over the last 6 months, I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic improvement in the tone and texture of my skin. Friends and family have asked me what I&#x27;ve been doing and my confidence is beginning to be restored. I highly recommend the lotion.     But--here is the downside: the packaging is ineffective. The design of the bottle is elegant and a fantastic idea in theory, but it does not work well. This is my 3rd bottle of M2 Skin Refinish 20%. Of 3 bottles, 2 have broken almost immediately. Because it is an expensive lotion, I&#x27;ve just broken open the container to access the lotion. However, I intend to contact the company about this, because I should not have to use a hammer and pliers to get to the product.</li>
            <li> Early 40s female who suffered from cystic acne as a teenager and, as a result, has pitted skin.  I&#x27;ve tried practically everything to promote more even, less pock-marked skin.  With this product, I experienced visible results after only the first week of use.  It is drying and it does cause the skin to pinken slightly, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay in exchange for a product that actually delivers...and at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for hyperpigmentation caused by sunburn. But it make my skin more sensitive to sun. So I don&#x27;t suggest this product to people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it really did me any good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and just put in an order for my second bottle. I am in my early 40s and prior to using this product, suffered from adult acne since my early 20s, particularly during my cycle. I have not had a single breakout since I started using M2, which has been around 6 months.  My skin looks smoother, particularly on my forehead.   On the downside, I have not noticed much difference with the one (rather large) age spot that I have.  Although, I must add that I have tried lasers at the dermatologist made specifically for age spots and the lasers did not work either.  I agree with others that commented on the poor design of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This product really does work well in both preventing and removing acne. It makes your face feel really sticky after using it but you can apply lotion on top once it dries and that fixes the problem.</li>
            <li> M2 Skin Care HP Skin Refinish 20% 50 ml. i returned this because it is too oilly, and  too thick</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC! It clears brown spots quickly with nightly use. It&#x27;s a bit tacky on the skin but does the trick. Once the spots are gone, just use a couple of times, weekly to maintain. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and find that it works better and cheaper than prescription creams or expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune trying to clear up my melasma/hyperpigmentation. Most OTC products are a complete waste of time - it takes forever for even a tiny improvement.  With this stuff, you will notice significant improvement within about a month.  Now, keep in mind that melasma runs \\&quot;deep\\&quot;.  If you think that the product isn&#x27;t working (because your melasma looks the same), see if your freckles and/or acne scars are getting better (these are more \\&quot;shallow\\&quot;).  Melasma is stubborn and takes a long time to clear up, but this product really does help if you stick with it (plus it is WAY cheaper than laser treatments).</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about M2.  This has improved my skin so much since adding it to my nightly facial routine.  Since turning 30 years old (I&#x27;m 32 now) I have had terrible acne on my chin and here and there on my face.  I had taken antibiotics (2 different ones) and cleansed my face regularly.  I had no idea what was causing my face to look so terrible.  The doctors I saw did not seem to care.  So, I researched the internet.  After weeks of looking at reviews, reading beauty articles, and researching each item I saw, I decided to order the M2.  After wasting so much money, I was skeptical about buying yet another product, but I did it anyway.  I saw results in the first few days of using it.  The product never burned my skin or even tingled.  It just seemed to help the blemishes I had and stop the new ones from getting large and unsightly.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and will continue to use this product in between my glycolic and pumpkin peels.  I really see just as much improvement with the M2 as I do these deeper peels, but I&#x27;m on a mission to have blemish free skin.  Everything seems to be working so far!</li>
            <li> Confesion: I have acne. Its not major acne but enough to annoy and be noticable. I am, unfortunatley a picker, yes I said it. I pick my face :( So I do have a couple of acne scars here and there. So as anyone whos desperate to find a cure, I ventured out and found this. Based on the reviews I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Prior to start I was breaking out pretty bad. I dont know if mother nature was being generous with her gifts during that precious time or if I was eating more crap than usual. Point is I was breaking out bad.****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so first off, I dont know if I was suppose to use all three products together (CLEANSER,SERUM AND MOISTURIZER), but I was only using the serum and mositurizer once a day, at night to be precise, after I washed for 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BIG BENEFIT: I instantly saw a difference. Maybe....MAYBE it was my mind but im pretty sure after the fisrt day I saw reduced redness and no new breakouts. I used it for a couple a weeks and saw a continues process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BAD SIDE: Its super super sticky. I dont know if I dont wait long enough between the serum and mositurizer but jeesum...its so stick i can feel my pillow glued to my face. Ok ok maybe im being dramatic but its really stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN i bought the cleanser because I realized that after a couple of weeks of success, nothing was changing. My skin wasnt clearing up, the scars were still there and I just wasnt doing much for me. So i started using all three and like before, a couple of weeks and it did wonders but than my skin started to get really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all. Its is a pretty good product. I use it everyother day. I switch it off with L&#x27;Oreals youth code texture perfector which is a MIRICLE IN A BOTTLE...sorry M2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deff give it a try, Im almost 100 percent sure it will work one way or another. You will see sometype of a difference and it might actually work better for you than it did for me....again though i do have COMBINATION skin, a few dry patches and acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you get the benefits you want! xoxoN skin, a few dry patches and acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you get the benefits you want! xoxo</li>
            <li> So far, this product has been awesome...outside of my acne. My skin has never looked better, as far as acne scarring and sun damage goes. If that&#x27;s what you are getting this product for, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to you with five stars! But, the downside to this product is that it doesn&#x27;t treat acne. I have not noticed any significant reduction in pimples. So, if you are buying it strictly for acne treatment, I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 years old, and I have been struggling with acne since I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve been doing facials regularly, which it&#x27;s helping tremendously. The M2 Skin Care 20% is complementing my routine regime, and I&#x27;m loving the results. My skin looks brighter, my pores seem smaller, and I my skin has a beautiful glowing appearance. I use a very thin layer of M2 at night, after I have applied my toner. Then I apple my moisturizer. During the day, I always use sunscreen, because I have noticed that using M2 frequently makes my skin a little sensitive to sunlight. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I would give this the amazing rave reviews that some have, but I have seen a slight improvement with my skins appearance. And that is better than nothing!</li>
            <li> I like the result after one night using it. I always used it at night, with expectation my breakout skin and dark spots will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning my skin feel soft but this product doesn&#x27;t help with my break out skin and dark spots. I don&#x27;t like the sensation while using this, it was tingling and burnt, especially after I cleaned my face. I&#x27;m not sure my skin type either normal/combination or dry and sensitive. By the way I bought packet which include mouisturizer and facial foam. The only thing that I like from this brand is facial foam.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about  3 weeks I see some change in my skin.  Hopfully I see more in the next week</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give it a fair rating since I do not use it as regularly as I should... I saw some difference when I first started using it but it runs out quickly so I slowed down on the use just to make it last longer.  :-)</li>
            <li> This product works and I have been using it for two years now.  When I turned 30, my skin chemistry dramatically changed and I was breaking out.  I saw improvements in my skin within 2 months of using this product.  This product not only cleared up by breakouts but it also erased my freckles.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The skin refinish serum is amazing. I use it on my acne prone skin, which is not severe acne, but just can be breakout prone if I am not careful, and it works awesome to help keep those little skin bumps away. It definitely has a slight burning sensation when it is first applied to the face for a few seconds but then it goes away and I feel like its a very active product on my skin. It is very smoothing to the texture and when I am good about using it several times a week I do get compliments on my skin. As others have said it is a little sticky, so I just apply it in the evening, let in sink into the skin for a few minutes and then add a touch of moisturizer and its fine. Would definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> From reading the reviews I was so excited to buy this.  Maybe I only gave four star because my expectations were so high.  After you put this on you can immediately feel your face tighten and if you have no moisturizer in tow you are in bad luck.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this but for the price I probably will not be buying it again anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the original product from skinstore rx before... Definitely not the same thing. This is basically a watered down version of the original... Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Purchase with the M2 Skin Technologies Skin Recovery Moisturizer and use daily. I put the refinish cream on before sleep and first thing in the morning followed by the moisturizer 15 mins later and have seen signifigant improvement of my pore size and scars. I have had more deep cyst acne since I have started using both products, but that is happening less and less now. I have been using both products for 2 months now.</li>
            <li> I used the product as stated and I have not seen any difference in my complexion at all, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a while, suggested by my mother, and I&#x27;ve seen a little bit of a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Less acne, clearer skin in certain areas. I still have some acne scars, but can easily be hidden with a concealer-stick.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, like me, this will sting alittle, but only temporarily.</li>
            <li> The product had exploded inside the packaging, which being transported to a high altitude location (Colorado) is understandable. HOWEVER, it was clear the product had exploded prior to shipping because the serum had crusted and the entire contents had seeped out of the bottle and had coated the interior of the plastic wrap. Boo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the M2 skin care product is great though, I have been using it for two years and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li> loved it during the summer too drying during the winter months in the northeast.  This product does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> From the great comments this had, I thought I would be acne free by now! I have been using this for almost 2 months and all it has done has made it worse. I still use it to hope that maybe once it will actually do me aswell as it has done to others. But no. I have been breaking out in places i rarely ever do, like my forehead and neck and sideburn area and nose.</li>
            <li> I used this product when it was in it&#x27;s original packaging. However, I feel that this product is less effective than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li> This is my new bby! It helped my skin so much. I use it three nights a week from Friday to Sunday night. It keeps my skin smooth and lightens my skin to only a bit. A bit of a sting but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the vivant mandelic much more! This was better than nothing at the time when I couldn&#x27;t afford vivant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and have not yet written a review.  This has helped my skin so much that I should finally write a review.  This stuff works.  From time to time I will get a bad acne breakout and I scar easily, esp. because I squeeze acne to get rid of puss.  This stuff fades dark acne marks.  I use it in conjuction with generic retin A at night.  It tightens pores also and makes my skin look smoother, more even toned and overall better/younger.  One to three bottles of this used every night usually is enough to get rid of scars.  It&#x27;s alot less risky and expensive than laser or acid peels for people with olive skin.  I am half Asian and have learned that blacks, asians and other non-whites can have adverse scarring from laser and acid peels.</li>
            <li> Good face wash out of so many face wash creams I tried using before, so thought sharing with you guyss.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old and have suffered with acne (not HORRIBLE) but the occasional cystic big pimples or red scaring. My skin is SUPER sensitive and I have literally tried EVERYTHING. I&#x27;m talking over the counter pills, proactive, EVERY cash wash. NOTHING worked. I then changed to using the &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; product line, such as their facial wash and their light moisturizer and that works great. BUT back to this product. GET IT! GET IT! GET IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL of the scaring I had is gone (or almost). I barely get any breakouts, but the purpose of this is to specifically get rid of scarring and it does just that. It does NOT smell at all, but once it dries it is super sticky, SO that&#x27;s when I put my simple moisturizer over it.&lt;br /&gt;There is a SLIGHT tingling sensation, but it goes away after like 20 seconds. This product is amazing and I HIGHLY suggest getting it!!!!! BEST DECISION EVER!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product &amp; used it in combination with the Obagi Clear. I used M2 all over my face, but used Obagi Clear to spot treat darker areas. GREAT COMBINATION &amp; GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This is a highly rated product, however for me someone with sensitive skin it stung and burned and it lasted for quite awhile before skin felt ok again.</li>
            <li> This product was not good, after the first day i thought i saw results but after 3 weeks i saw no difference. Im using manoka honey to lighten my hyper pigmentation from old acne, and it works way better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY, BUY MANOKA HONEY INSTEAD</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the original one. It smells weird too. No issues w/ returning though. Seller didn&#x27;t give me a hard time with that and I appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to clear up my skin and even out my skin for years! I am almost 30 and this is it! I rarely get a zit now, and my skin looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> My skin: oily acne skin. Purpose of use of this product: to fade acne mark.&lt;br /&gt;why I don&#x27;t like it: feel sticky even I just apply a thin layer as instructed. also, I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I only got the M2 20% Skin Refinish about 3 days ago, so my rating isn&#x27;t final yet. I&#x27;m still in the process of observing for changes. I&#x27;m not a first time user. In 2011, when I was still in the Philippines, this was part of a regimen (that included tretinoin .05%) prescribed by my dermatologist. Let me tell you that when I first used M2, my skin LITERALLY changed overnight! It glowed, my acne was reduced, and my skin felt really smooth...overnight! Fast forward to today: It isn&#x27;t working as quickly for me as it did back then. Yes, I have noticed some glow, and the big pimples are drying up, but it&#x27;s also giving me small breakouts. Now, what I&#x27;m thinking is that my skin, having been treatment-free since I arrived in the US a little over a year ago, is readjusting to the AHAs. I&#x27;ve read that skin has to adjust to AHAs, and while it&#x27;s doing so, breakouts can occur for a few weeks. So I&#x27;m going to keep at it and hope that all the breakouts will clear up, and I will again be awed by this product, like I was in 2011. I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also wondering if it has something to do with the climate. I moved from a tropical country, where it was humid all the time, to San Francisco, where it&#x27;s always dry and almost always cold. I&#x27;m thinking of incorporating tretinoin again into my skin care routine; have to talk to my PCP about that. In any case, I&#x27;ll be back in a couple of weeks or so to maybe change my rating if there are any changes, hopefully not for the worse, though!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used, it is a bit pricey but totally worth it. In just a few days I have noticed a difference and it has worked wonders on my acne and my hyperpigmentation around my eyes is already lightening!!! Best thing I have ever used on my face. I have very oily skin and have had problems with acne, blackheads, whiteheads, follicular issues, scarring and discoloration. I have only been using it over the last week or so and my acne is almost gone, blackheads are few and far between, scarring and discoloration fading. Totally worth the expense!!!</li>
            <li> The packaging is downright terrible but the actual product itself is effective and gentle enough that I can use it every evening. My pores are notably cleaner, which means they&#x27;re no longer inflamed. Also, it has helped clear brown post-acne marks much faster than usual, and I have had less acne since I&#x27;ve started using it. It doesn&#x27;t stop it completely (hormonal acne is a beast like that) but it does help heal it faster.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have real bad acne prone skin and my scars are taken care by this serum. I wear it at night and my skin rejuvinites due to this serum. I have been using this for a year now and I just cant stop buying it over and over again. I ordered the whole line of products. The cleaners and moisturizers is great as well. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great skin in a short time. If you have sensitive skin then start with 12% then go to 20% if you want more effect. Start low go slow. Be patient and you will see the rewards.</li>
            <li> I;m a guy and i love using this at night for acne and scars</li>
            <li> Works great but is sticky.</li>
            <li> Stung and burned my face. Definitely not a repurchase. :-(</li>
            <li> WOW! Fast delivery and product looked as advertised. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I totally love this product! It keeps my face mostly blemish free and smooth. The only con would be that it can be a little irritating at times (always wear sunscreen when going out). Overall, I would recommend this to anyone with oily acne prone skin. It worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake by getting lazy and laying off M2. So glad I&#x27;ve come to my senses, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in over a year, the last time I used M2. I can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
            <li> Ordered 20% M2 and paid much higher cost!!  Unfortunately, waited for previous container to run out before using, and after using for several weeks, noticed I was not getting same effect as previously, started looking at the ingredients and product was only the 12%.  Very dissapointed in Amazon!!!  Never ship a inferior or less effective product and try to pass for more expensive and potent product.  You are paying for the % of Mandelic Malic acid in this product.  Along with this and no apps for moveies ect for apple products, may be dumping some stock.</li>
            <li> Clear, glowing skin...never fails.Sticky and sour tasting, but works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product was in 2006, I went through the last 6 years trying different things. Ultimately I have returned to buy more because it really does work. I use it on my face, back and chest and keeps my tone even, my skin clear and soft. I love it and would definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I saw immediate results, my skin felt smooth and it seemed that my breakouts were less frequent. Now I&#x27;ve begun to breakout more, and in places like my forehead where I never breakout. I&#x27;ve only been using this three weeks, so I&#x27;ll report back later if it is more/less successful.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. It seems it have reduced my pore size slightly. That what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews I thought I would take this and boy am I happy! Wonderful product. I can clearly see visible results. My acne marks have definitely reduced. Wonderful product. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I suffer with adult acne and this helps with cell turnover and sloughing off dead skin. Along with my other products, this helps to keep my skin clear and pours small. It  can sting a little and be sticky if too much is used, so use a pea sized amount.  Cannot do without this in my beauty regime.</li>
            <li> Love this treatment. It is not for everyone as some may not be familiar with AHA products. They can sting, feel spongy on the face, and cause skin peeling. Of course, these are all things to show the product is actually working! Regardless, some still may be put off by some aspects of it. I&#x27;ll try to share some tips to over come some of the negative things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1). Skin peeling: I used to apply M2 daily but it was too much in terms of the peeling aspect. I highly suggest starting use with this every other day before bedtime to allow your skin to adjust. I would even suggest doing that long term for as long as you use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2). The sticky/spongy feeling: The first night I used it, it made my face feel so sticky I felt like my skin was sticking to my pillowcase. Yuck! The stickiness is actually a good thing because what that is, is the AHA&#x27;s breaking down the damaged outer layer of skin. However, the feeling was still grossing me out. So what I do is I will apply M2 to a clean face right before bedtime. Allow it to sit on the skin for about 5-10 minutes. Then apply an evening cream. I have not experienced stickiness after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3). Stinging: Again, if an AHA product doesn&#x27;t sting, that has almost always been a dead giveaway for me that it is not potent enough to be effective. Many women enjoy the concept of what AHA&#x27;s can do but have a hard time accepting the pain it takes to get there. So, many formulations may contain AHA but in ineffective trace amounts to keep their customers happy. I overcame this by only using M2 on gentle facial days. I like to exfoliate my face with facial brushes, scrubs, and wet rags. I also like to use clay masks and I use derma rollers on my face. On days I do that, I do NOT use M2! It would be too much on the face at once. So I only use M2 on days where my facial regimen consists of light washing with my fingertips and a gentle toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BENEFITS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can overcome the rougher aspects of this product, it will definitely be worth it. My skin tone looks lighter, brighter, and more even when I use this regularly. My pores are noticeably smaller, I&#x27;m 35 but have no crows feet or facial wrinkles at all, and this helps give my skin a dewy appearance to it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very stubborn and using this daily in the mornings or after a hard work out my skin has stayed clear! I use it also with the moisturizer and a sunscreen for sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> It worked for two weeks then all of a sudden I began to break out even worse. Also, the nosel is crap, needs to be improved on.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked better since before puberty! Haha. I started using it almost a month ago and my skin looks great. I use it every third night instead of every other night. Uses less of the product and keeps my skin from becoming too dependent on it.&lt;br /&gt;Even helps to lighten underarms!</li>
            <li> The wife loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews for products I purchase. But this one I had to make an exception. This product is a life saver. I had broken out with rather bad acne around my chin and mouth after having to abruptly stop taking a birth control pill. For 7-8 months my skin was terrible and I am person who never has suffered from acne. I had tried different face washes, proactiv+, toners, salicylic acid pads, a new birth control pill, etc. Nothing was working. I literally noticed differences within the first day of use. My pores were a little smaller, the scarring from past pimples were less red. It has now been 2 weeks, and  my skin has barely broken out. My pores are much much smaller. Blackheads that were in my skin are rising to the top and coming out without any trouble, redness or scarring. And I am currently on my period, where I break out with 7-10 cystic pimples on my chin usually, and currently I have one new pimple and its been there for only a few days and it is already smaller and painless to the touch. It&#x27;s safe to say that I LOVE this product and will definitely keep purchasing! I have medium sensitive skin and noticed minimal peeling and slight burning. Nothing intolerable. Completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I gave a start amount just because it&#x27;s required. Don&#x27;t pay attention to that too much just read. I recieved this last month, I used it everyday at first. If your skin is stinky and not drying your using too much. Literally 1 pump for your face and neck will do, I even apply it before makeup because it sucks up the oil on my skin. If you use it before make up make sure it dries and you have a primer with SPF and your foundation or whatever you use has SPF. My skin texture did improve rather quickly, I used it nightly and exfoliated in the mornings. I did that because my skin can take it and unlike most I didn&#x27;t recieve that burning sensation. As for dark spots they have lightened very little, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the product or exfoliating or both. Either way since then I&#x27;ve kind of dropped off with my use. I exfoliate every other day, but tea tree products from the body shop have been my friend. Lately my skin has been a little more sensitive so now when I use the product it burns like hell, only for about 5-10 seconds or so. It doesn&#x27;t bother me but I will continue use to actually be able to judge the product!</li>
            <li> Must be used everyday but it exfoliates and smoothes skin wonderfully,</li>
            <li> I have waited a long time to write this review to make sure I have reaped all of the benefits. First off let me start by saying I have had terrible skim since I was 8 years old. When I hit my twenties I got the whole deal: small and large acne, cystic acne--just terrible skin. I tried everything. Drug store products,  home remedies, natural products, even adapalene gel. None of it worked. On particularly bad day I tried m2 out of desperation. The serum is sticky and smells like burnt hair and it does burn any open wounds you have but you get passed that. It gave me a  initial purge breakout but then little by little my skin got better. No cystic acne,  smooth skin and my scarring started fading. If you have skin as bad as mine and are ready to splurge on something that actually works... try this product!</li>
            <li> This cleared up some minor acne i had,it also exfoliates the skin and i noticed after using it for a while that my skin was clearer,more matt and even and it looked good. I did not notice any effect on wrinkles,maybe it needs more time,im not sure,however if you have oily,acne prone skin,it absolutely works to clear up the skin.Start using slowly,i used it every night and my skin became very dry and sensitive,so i changed it to every other night and it worked very well,i will repurchase again,the con is that it is sticky, let it dry completely if you want to use another moisturizer on top,overall this is a product i would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but felt compelled to write one for this product simply because it works! I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have hyperpigmentation on my forehead and along the side of my face.  This is the ONLY product that has actually made them fade! I still have the melasma but it is noticeably fading.  I have only been using it for a month so I am excited to see what a year does.  It is sticky but don&#x27;t let that deter you. Apply moisturizer 15 min later and it will take care of that.  I have yet to see any real progress with the fine lines on my forehead but if you suffer from melasma and/or hyperpigmentation, you must try this! Great product!</li>
            <li> Not well known and I didn&#x27;t know really what to expect when I ordered it.  I am 63 but am blessed with very &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; skin...however, I am still prone to the occasional breakouts, especially around my chin/nose.  I bought this when I saw in a Facebook ad that it was great for treating acne.  Tried it just for the affected area and it made a HUGE difference overnight!  Then I saw that it&#x27;s really meant as an overall facial serum for a myriad of problems (lines/discoloration, etc.) so I started using it a few nights a week all over (just a very thin layer, though -- it&#x27;s strong and it tends to be somewhat sticky).  It has really helped my skin stay consistently - clear.  I alternate this with AHA and Glycolic acid based serums.  Might not be suitable for particularly sensitive skin - would recommend a &amp;#34;patch test&amp;#34; first.  But this is a product that I would not be without!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any significant change to my skin yet, its been almost a month of using, no matter how little I try to apply, it still feels sticky.</li>
            <li> I never saw results.  I know my face is to get worse before it gets better,  but it wasn&#x27;t healing at all. I went to the doc,  got a prescription for retin-a, and now I am seeing results.  I wish I had done this in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from Blue light therapy to Accutane. Over the Counter products were always symptomatic. I have only been using the product for about 2 weeks and my face has never looked better. Not only does it stop acne dead in it&#x27;s tracks but it lightens scars and makes my skin feel incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, which I don&#x27;t even care about, is the residue it leaves on your skin. Very sticky, sometimes so bad that I find myself stuck to my pillow in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, who cares? I went out for the first time in 27 years without make up on my face. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product. AMAZING BUY.</li>
            <li> I am a 41 year old latina with adult acne and age spots, nothing, nothing i tried before worked(clinique, proactive, etc....) M2 works amazing! My skin looks better than in the last 20 years! I use the cleanser, skin refinisher 20%and the moisturizer, i will use these products forever!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff- it is great. my skin was breaking out so I would put this on at night- completely cleared it up. it is sticky but its worth it. HIGHLY recommend! have been using for years!</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 11. I am now 24. More than the acne, my problem has been the hyperpigmentation. I had black patches on both my cheeks, around my mouth, and on my forehead. It was horrible. I lived like that for 13 years. I could never understand why everyone else was able to find over the counter products that worked for them and made their skins so beautiful. It&#x27;s because those products treat acne. There&#x27;s very little that&#x27;ll do anything for hyperpigmentation. I didn&#x27;t even realize that what I had was called hyperpigmentation till about a year ago. Finally, I came across this amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using it since March. I&#x27;m about to finish my first bottle and already ordered my second, so glad to see that the price has dropped. I was putting off ordering it because I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $50 despite the great results but it would definitely have been a worse catastrophe to run out and have to wait for the new order to come in. For me, I feel like even one night of not using it causes the un-doing of the positive results. Can&#x27;t have that happening!&lt;br /&gt;It not only cleared up the patches but also minimized my breakouts. I never go to sleep without using this and when I miss a day or two, I can feel the difference in my skin with the small pimples that would&#x27;ve been cleared out by this product continuing to grow. I still have a few dark spots here and there but my skin is at least 70-80% clearer and I&#x27;m hoping that in another 3 months, it&#x27;ll be completely clear. I use this right before I go to sleep over the targeted dark spots, and make sure to use a moisturizer with SPF in the day (Alpha Hydroxy Moisturizer). It does cause peeling but never to the point that I felt self-conscious about it in public. On the contrary, the peeling has always made me feel happy that the serum is doing it&#x27;s job where it needs to.&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended it to other people who have the same problems as me. I could never afford to go to a dermatologist butthey complain about how they&#x27;ve tried everything with the dermatologist and nothing works. It&#x27;s because those treatments work to clear up your acne first and then wait for the slow healing process of the scars that cause the hyperpigmentation. M2 works to clear up the hyperpigmentation and as a side-effect reduces your acne breaks out. I&#x27;m tempted to buy 4-5 bottles and keep them in case the company stops making them or something, God forbid! This has done so much for me! I&#x27;m recommended it 200%</li>
            <li> I do think I like this product.  My face has not completly cleared up but I have very problem skin.  My skin does seem brighter and my break outs may have been worse without it. I do hate the bottle itself I cannot tell when I am getting low and most of the time I have to really work at it to get it to squirt out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I just started using this because I have developed adult acne :(&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell you if it cleared up my skin - I&#x27;ll update my review if it does (or doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that this product feels &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not greasy, there&#x27;s no strong scent and you can tell its working.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strong - they describe it as a tingling sensation when you apply it, but that&#x27;s an understatement - it kind of burns. You HAVE to apply moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;All told I really like this product &amp; hope it helps clear up my skin. So far I can tell its doing something since my skin looks better already.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  There are lots of products that I use.  I am definitely an experimenter.  I keep reordering this and that says alot.&lt;br /&gt;I use it a lot more in the summer as it can be drying.  In the winter I am sure to follow it up with a great night cream like Cetaphil</li>
            <li> I purchased this product more for hyperpigmentation, and so far it has done nothing for that. However, I also suffer from extremely oily skin and post-menopausal cystic acne. This product completely eradicated the acne, and my skin seems a little less oily. I use it every night, without fail, and I love it for the acne fighting capabilities alone. Will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying this product because it&#x27;s sucks.  It&#x27;s very expensive and doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s exception. .. It only made my skin worse and dryyy... I would not recommend this product..</li>
            <li> This works ok for me, it does cause a lot of peeling.  It stings when applied but lasts only a few minutes.  If you use too much, has a sticky feeling on your skin.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but find it&#x27;s a little too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff is derived from the fountain of youth. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years. No more adult acne and my skin just looks smooth, almost flawless. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months, but it got rid of my blemishes after the first use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference in my skin. What I don&#x27;t like is that the product is sticky for an hour after I&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using M2 for about 4 years now. I admit, I&#x27;m a sucker for beauty products...I love trying all kinds of new ones, but this one I keep going back to. Every 6 months or so I seem to think, \\&quot;maybe this doesn&#x27;t work as well as I think it does\\&quot; and I stop using it for a few days...sure enough, my cystic acne comes back along my jaw line and I truly notice an immediate difference in the brightness and pore size. This really is a product that lives up to what it says it will do, and in a vast ocean of products that make big big claims, the fact that this one actually does what the company claims is pretty magnificent! Give it a try, be prepared that your skin may at first tingle/burn slightly and may dry out as it gets used to the formula~but you&#x27;ll love the results!</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago when it was called Mama lotion and it worked great, but I can&#x27;t say the same about this purchase. It doesn&#x27;t clear dark spots like before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my whole life and finally at 31 I feel I found something that actually works. It took a couple months for my skin to start looking clear but my scars have faded and I don&#x27;t get nearly as many breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne and occasionally break out on my chin, but I am always looking for something to stop the breakouts even though my acne is mild.  After many review on Sea Buckthorn oil, I decided to try it, well after about 1 month of using it, my chin broke out in terrible cystic acne which I never had before and it would not go away.  I purchased the M2 Skin Care HP Skin Refinish 20% along with M2 Skin Technologies Skin Recovery Moisturizer after reading great reviews on the products and within 1-2 weeks my skin finally started to calm down and within 3-4 weeks the cystic acne was completely gone.  I have been using this for about 3 months and I rarely get break outs anymore and when I do, they seem to go away faster.  I will never use Sea Buckthorn oil again, but will continue with M2 products.</li>
            <li> I am blonde, blue eyed, slender and tall with somewhat sensitive skin which burns easily. Ever since I was a child, I have had 2 fairly large horizontal neck rings, that I never really thought about until the last few years where they started to look darker, larger and unhappy. I have a long, slender neck and I guess it has to bend somewhere - in the front of all places. Along with this, the skin on my face didn&#x27;t feel good anymore. It was very dull and rough in texture. As a result, I began a new project on how to make some improvement and slowdown what is happening to my skin. After comparing several products, I took the plunge on AST Green Cream 9. I did experience a 3 week period where my skin went through almost a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; from the product, but now I can honestly say, my face feels INCREDIBLE and remarkably improved. I wish I had started with this 5 years ago. I am so impressed and pleased with my skin care routine/products, that I wanted to share and possibly help some of you that are looking for the right skin care routine in their 40&#x27;s. Nighttime: 1) Remove makeup with Waxelene and tissue. 2) Use hands to wash face and neck with Shea Moisture African Black Soap. Pat dry. 3) Lightly wipe washed skin with Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel on cotton ball/pad. Allow to dry completely. I try to wait at least 10 minutes here before doing the Green Cream. 4) GREEN CREAM NO. 9. EVERY OTHER NIGHT. Squeeze out a pea size. Really folks, don&#x27;t go wild here, you don&#x27;t need much! I make teeny-tiny dots of the product on my forehead first and then rub in. Moving to the cheeks, nose, chin and finally neck (especially the rings!!!) as I rotate around my face and rub in. I do not put this on my eyelid area but do apply on the under eye area above my cheekbones. If I have ANY left over, I rub this into the back of my hands. ****ALTERNATE NIGHTS*****: M2 High Potency Skin Refresh 20%. I apply this in a similar manner to the Green Cream except that it is more fluid and seemsto spread easier. This works to resurface the skin, but it is a different type of Alpha Hydroxy acid which activates and exfoliates the uppermost layers of skin cells, while the Retinol in the Green Cream is absorbed to do it&#x27;s work from the bottom up to encourage new skin cell growth. WOW!  5) On nights that my skin feels especially dry, 30 minutes after Retinol or AHA application, I spread on a very light layer of German Nivea. Only the German Nivea tin which is closest to begin La Mer, without the price tag. I also sometimes use the Waxelene or even Coconut oil, depending upon my mood. Lately, my skin has felt so well, I have gone to bed without a layer of moisturizer.  MORNING ROUTINE: 1) Splash my face and neck with water 2) Lightly wipe skin with Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel on cotton ball/pad. 3) Moisturize - I use NIVEA or Waxelene, but recommend something lighter like NEUTROGENA HEALTHY SKIN in the blue and white tube with SPF.  2X a week in the morning before applying my moisturizer, I do a Japanese Beauty mask on my face and neck with Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion (Moist) and Selena Multi-layer Cotton Puffs. This really helps my skin seem to retain moisture and it&#x27;s fun and quick to do.  Now, after a couple months, the skin on my face is glowing and feels SO INCREDIBLY soft.. I plan to update this at the 6 month mark, but so far out of all of it, the Green Cream made the most drastic difference to my skin appearance and texture overall. I highly recommend it as a OTC retinol product without a prescription. Just be smart with it for certain, since your using this at home without a doctor&#x27;s supervision.  Please note: I NEVER EVER COMBINE OR USE THE M2 AND THE GREEN CREAM ON THE SAME NIGHT. Don&#x27;t mistake severe redness and/or peeling or flaking for exfoliation, whether from retinol or AHAs. These are a sign of irritation, and if it persists you will need to reduce frequency of use or consider stopping altogether.  Best wishes to all you beautiful people out there!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff in FABULOUS!!  Tightens up your skin and leaves it smooth and delicious to the touch the next morning!  I see that some have said it is sticky, but if you read the instructions they say to put a moisturizer over it and that REALLY works!  Worth every penny!  LOVE IT!  When they say &amp;#34;refinish&amp;#34; - they mean it!!!</li>
            <li> This product is stunning.  I am in my thirties and had horrible acne with big scars as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read a lot of reviews on Acne.org.  Laser therapy is too risky and doesn&#x27;t always the wanted results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my daily routine now: washing my face with Q10 cleansing wipes, then I apply M2 High potency skin refinish 20%.  Before going to sleep I apply Bioderma Photoderm Max SPF 50+ (helps too, seems to lift the skin a bit so the scars fade more)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persistency is key: be patient.  My face became better and better after months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However: there is no such thing like scar removal.  But they have faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a big stock.  Hopefully these products will be produced forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read: if you stop using them your skin will get back to the previous state.</li>
            <li> Best thing for my 40 somethingish skin. I tend to have hormonal breakouts and this has been the best so far to help with that. I also feel like my skin looks better and tighter. Stuff is sticky after you put it on but doesn&#x27;t bother me. Will buy again. Shipping prompt.</li>
            <li> If you are a person of a certain age and struggle with acne, breakouts, even rosacea breakouts&lt;br /&gt;you will adore this product.  It keeps the breakouts in check as well as keeps your skin slightly&lt;br /&gt;polished from the benefits of using these natural acids on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M2 stands for Mandelic and Malic acids. Mandelic acid is an alpha hydroxy and is antibacterial in nature.&lt;br /&gt;It is extracted from the bitter almond.  Malic acid is a naturally occurring organic compound found in most&lt;br /&gt;unripe fruit. It is a key ingredient to add tartness to many foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that these are natural. Love what they do for my skin which is not getting younger. Would rather&lt;br /&gt;use good and natural products like this than go the botox route or under the knife.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes it would help with my acne.  Although my acne is not severe, it is moderate and I have had it since I was 14 and I am now 34.  I have tried just about everything out there except accutane.  I have been on Retin A numerous times, antiobiotics, birth control, differin gel, tea tree oil, sulfur soaps, salicylic acid products, alpha hydroxy acid products and so much more.  I have FINALLY found the right product.  This product every other day along with Retin A Micro has been a God send for my face.  I am African American and have light skin, but I produce a lot of melanin and I always have hyperpigmentation after the blemishes heal.  I am noticing a HUGE difference with exfoliation and lightening of these scars with the products I listed above.  I found out about the product during a google search looking for acne solutions.  If you are like me and have tried everything, please give this a try it might be the product for you.  Also, I have always had extremely oily/shiny skin.  That also has gotten better.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin,and I use this overnight.  It is tacky and smells kind of funny, so I add a moisturizer on top (something scented slightly helps).  But it works very well for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> 1) It does help&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s pretty cheap&lt;br /&gt;3) Works better if you use moisturizer after applying&lt;br /&gt;4) Works even for damaged skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works for acne, but I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should. I do notice that the night after I use it, my skin feels a lot smoother and softer, and helps with my oily skin. Comes in a convenient twisting pump that you can open and close, and you only need like a dime size at most for your face. Can be a little sticky if you over do it.</li>
            <li> There is NO miracle lotion to take decades off your face, only surgery can do that; that said, this stuff is the most dramatic and affective face lotion I&#x27;ve ever used regardless of price. I&#x27;ve used Retin A before laser re-surfacing, and didn&#x27;t notice any more difference than using M2. The lady who did my laser re-surfacing read the ingredients and she had a very favorable opinion of M2 even though she was promoting their own line of products. I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin and get razor burn easily, this stuff eliminates it. I&#x27;m a 54 year old male, and I do have wrinkles around my eyes, but this stuff has helped keep my skin tighter, brighter, and even toned and I used to live in Florida and tan all the time. People compliment my skin often. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since it was called MaMa Lotion and until I find something better I will continue to use it. It probably doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it can do wonders if it&#x27;s compatible with your skin.</li>
            <li> I put a good deal of research into buying face creams . . . This one looked good.  The cleanser is quite nice ...especially when used with a  Clarisonic brush.  Moisturizer however is very tacky and stays that way. No glow on my skin, no softness  nor moisturized feel.&lt;br /&gt;Good for night use only.</li>
            <li> I used a another brand of this or same manufacturer different formula. I didn&#x27;t use on my face I used on my knees and elbows and both my knees and elbows got lighter. I ran out and since I am again on my beauty kick I started looking for this again. I will certainly try on my face but it works great on dark knees and elbows. I am a woman of color and sometimes we can have dark knees and elbows....great product!</li>
            <li> I was a long time Proactiv user.  It kept most of my acne at bay but I was never completely clear, always had at least 1-3 pimples on my face and my complexion was just not healthy or radiant.  I began researching what other alternatives there were and thought M2 mandelic acid treatment line might do the trick as it claims to treat acne as well as deal with hyperpigmentation and smoothing out lines/diminish pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a dramatic difference after the first night use.  Smoother and more radiant complexion.  After a week, I was completely clear of acne for the first time ever since I was a pre-teen (approx 20 years ago).  It was a miracle product for me for about the first month and a half.  However after that, I began developing small bumps everywhere which eventually became full blown inflamed acne.  Looking at the ingredients, I noticed that there was algae extract, which I just found out is extremely comedogenic!!!!!  The mandelic acid is great, but the algae extract, for those of us acne prone, is death.  I am still dealing with the acne and aftermath from this 6 month later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for those of us trying this and breaking out, it is probably the algae extract.  If only they would take that ingredient out, I would be a user for life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product. It use to make my skin clear, but now all it does is make pimples I already have smaller(does not make them go away) and prevents future breakouts. Maybe it&#x27;s because my skin is getting use to the strength, so I probably need something stronger now. Only problem with this product is that it never made my skin tone even.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this only 4 stars is because of the pump dispenser. I almost sent it back because I could not get the pump to dispense correctly. I found that if I pulled it out of the outer plastic bottle I could actually make it work. The product itself...tingles when you apply it and my skin feels sticky afterward. However, when I wake up in the morning I love how soft and smooth my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Nothing&#x27;s ever really worked for me til I found M2. I use this &amp; the skin recovery moisturizer and it works amazingly.  I almost never have a breakout, and I&#x27;ve struggled with breakouts and acne all my life.  I also have hyperpigmentation from when I was pregnant and it is clearing that up too.  Yes, it can feel sticky after you put it on, so don&#x27;t overdo it and DO use a moisturizer after it dries, and you&#x27;ll be impressed!  Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
