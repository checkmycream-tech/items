            <li>There are many better options out there.</li>
            <li>I could say more</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It works better than any nose trimmer I have had.</li>
            <li>I love that is trimmer</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied .</li>
            <li>Quite pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li>My husband was pleased with the performance of the Kemei Hair trimmer</li>
            <li>Wider cutter head than many others, works well.</li>
            <li>Excellent  product, tried a few more before but this one is the best i have got so far.</li>
            <li>Which is great, because normally I have to monitor his use of all razors, trimmers ect.</li>
            <li>At first glance it seems to be made of good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However if you are just using it as a nose trimmer than it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Despite the inexpensive cost and kinda cheap/cheesy look, it seems to work great so far.</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean after every use to get out excess hair.</li>
            <li>It works ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li>It trims very close, very fast and does a GREAT job.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have sufficient power and speed to do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>The instructions said to charge it for 10 hours, but it was charged when it arrived cause he gave it a quick try!</li>
            <li>Having a built in rechargeable battery is also a huge plus.</li>
            <li>but I think it is important that Amazon customers hear from all sides.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good; quality product</li>
            <li>After reading so many good reviews, I thought I finally found a solution.</li>
            <li>Possibly getting it free might have promoted the good reviews.</li>
            <li>great value and works better than many more expensive</li>
            <li>It fits right in your hand and is easy to manuever with.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my battery-operated trimmer that I got for 6 bucks at Ross, but that trimmer is superior to the this one because it actually works.</li>
            <li>and you cant cute the hair in the ears very well.</li>
            <li>The attachments on this trimmer are cheaply made and just pop right off at the slightest touch.</li>
            <li>It works great and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done quickly for him.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was as-described.</li>
            <li>First, this is a fantastic looking trimmer compared to the others my husband already owns.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof/washable and the head detaches that allows for a quick and easy cleaning - the Vacuum System whisks away hair clippings quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>(I call it Bronze cool sleek look) to it and has a small profile which is great for him for his travel bag.</li>
            <li>When I received the Kemei trimmer tried right away</li>
            <li>I am charging it for 10 Hours right now.</li>
            <li>As soon as this came in right on time, I couldn&#x27;t wait for my son to arrive home from school.</li>
            <li>I got this nose and ear hair trimmer for my boyfriend and he really likes it!</li>
            <li>but it never turned on after the first charge.</li>
            <li>The product looks &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but I am willing to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>In all the years I  have done business with Amazon, I have been satisfied -  until my last buy - the Kemei Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer KM-6629.  </li>
            <li>and wow what a difference it trimmed my hairs fast and comfortably.</li>
            <li>It comes with two different attachments that are pretty easy to take off and put on.</li>
            <li>I got this product at a promotional price and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Prompt ship by sender - Thanks.</li>
            <li>I recommend this trimmer to any one that needs a nose trimmer it really works and</li>
            <li>When he walked in the door, straight to the wash room</li>
            <li>I would recommend this trimmer to men and women alike, who wants to rid their self of that unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>It has a loud motor which you would think means it is powerful to get the performance for ears, nose and eyebrow trimming.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>He has used the Kemei three times so far and says it is simple, quick and clean.</li>
            <li>It does not cut very well and sometimes pulls the hair.</li>
            <li>works better than other products</li>
            <li>Blade is not particularly sharp right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I opened it and found a new trimmer in the BOX!</li>
            <li>Works better than two trimmers I had before (both were more expensive).</li>
            <li>It needs some Decent operating instructions.</li>
            <li>He is sensitive to loud sounds, this hair trimmer is very quite, and light weight in your hand, I started showing him how to use it, which he needs very simple instructions.</li>
            <li>so far it has been working very well.</li>
            <li>Also, the seller was kind enough to send me a replacement, for I misplaced a part of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic connectors on accessory pieces, which I don&#x27;t anticipate will last all that long.</li>
            <li>It works great and it&#x27;s quieter than other similar products we&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>My old sharper Image which is probably 15 years old although noisy, works just as well.</li>
            <li>So far , so good.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>even more important the Manufacture stands behind their product!!</li>
            <li>I get better hair removal with my $2.99 Clio trimmer, and I thought *that* was getting dull!</li>
            <li>So, my advise is if you are looking for a TOP- NOTCH trimmer that does what it was designed to do, buy this one, but go very slow when trimming nose hairs until you get adjusted to it.  </li>
            <li>As I continue to use/recharge it, will it hold up as far as sufficient power and speed after multiple uses and recharges.</li>
            <li>Was OK while it was working but actually not powerful enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li>and he said he couldn&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s been using a funny little scissor all his life.</li>

            <li> I get better hair removal with my $2.99 Clio trimmer, and I thought *that* was getting dull!</li>
            <li> So, my advise is if you are looking for a TOP- NOTCH trimmer that does what it was designed to do, buy this one, but go very slow when trimming nose hairs until you get adjusted to it.  </li>
            <li> As I continue to use/recharge it, will it hold up as far as sufficient power and speed after multiple uses and recharges.</li>
            <li> Was OK while it was working but actually not powerful enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and he said he couldn&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s been using a funny little scissor all his life.</li>
            <li> and we started to rid his face and other areas of that wild looking hair.</li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly and quickly with no heat problem or annoying noise.  </li>
            <li> The motor is not as powerful and the blade is not sensitive enough to trim some thin nose hair.</li>
            <li> The only other thing I will be looking for going forward is the long term reliability.</li>
            <li> Be advised that there is no stand or pouch for it, so the one assessory for it becomes a loose item to keep up with.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the hair down as short as I want but it works.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only worked for less then five weeks.  </li>
            <li> You can also trim your beard, mustache, sideburns, and the little hairs on the back of your neck!</li>
            <li> Having used the Kemei Rechargeable Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer for a few weeks now, I feel I need to upgrade my initial assessment of the device.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> In fact, I could carefully touch the blade and feel no vibration.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few different trimmers..</li>
            <li> Not very well designed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the exchangeable heads but that certainly not a selling point on the Kemel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previous nose hair trimmers have lost  their &amp;#34;Oomph&amp;#34; over the long haul and I have eventually had to junk them.</li>
            <li> However, IT DOES pull on the sensitive nose hairs, if you go too fast, which can be very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I did NOT receive product at a discounted price or any other concessions for my non-biased review, as others have.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s only 15 and has had all this excessive hair since he was 12, time to get rid of it and this nose ear and face trimmer</li>
            <li> One attachment is for your hair and the other one is for your nose and ear.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth $18.</li>
            <li> NO instructions (at least not in English).</li>
            <li> not worth .01 cent...</li>
            <li> Seems to be able to reach every annoying nose hair and cut about as close as you want.</li>
            <li> , really doesnt do the job, poor trimming hair in ears and nose and the other trimmer is not very good, waste of money.</li>

            <li> Recently I saw this during a promotion and I jumped at the chance to get this.  My husband is always trimming his moustache with scissors so I got this for him.  We tried it and he loves it.  It fits right in your hand and is easy to manuever with.  We trimmed my son&#x27;s stray neck hairs and it worked like a dream.  LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Everybody knows how embarrassing the unwanted facial hair could be for both ladies and the gents! I got this nose and ear hair trimmer for my boyfriend and he really likes it! It works great and it&#x27;s quieter than other similar products we&#x27;ve tried in the past. It&#x27;ll take care of the unwanted hair in your nose, ears, on your neck, and brows. You can also trim your beard, mustache and sideburns with this little device. It looks much more expensive than it is. It&#x27;s a high quality product and works great! It comes with 2 additional attachments for all your trimming and grooming needs. I got this product at a promotional price and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item. Blade is not particularly sharp right out of the box. Cheap plastic connectors on accessory pieces, which I don&#x27;t anticipate will last all that long. Definitely not worth $18. I get better hair removal with my $2.99 Clio trimmer, and I thought *that* was getting dull!</li>
            <li> Works better than two trimmers I had before (both were more expensive). Also, the seller was kind enough to send me a replacement, for I misplaced a part of the trimmer. It has been a great buy.</li>
            <li> At first glance it seems to be made of good quality. Its performance was sub par in total.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  He really loved it but it&#x27;s only worked for less then five weeks.  Don&#x27;t know what to get now.</li>
            <li> It works ok, nothing special. My old sharper Image which is probably 15 years old although noisy, works just as well.</li>
            <li> It is well made except for the plastic rotating square gear.  It interfaces with the Nose trimmer and Ear Trimmer, The razor looking trimmer does not do mustaches it is fairly weak, and it keeps coming lose from the body.  I actually had the plastic fall out of the nose trimmer and had to put it back together when exchanging parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However if you are just using it as a nose trimmer than it is pretty good. The body is heavy and made of metal. It is rechargeable and you can plug it in a wall socket with a very short cord supplied. I do prefer the panasonic trimmer it runs on one AA battery seeming forever. It is quieter and lighter and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the exchangeable heads but that certainly not a selling point on the Kemel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When every one rates it a 5 star you know that this post is not going to be popular but I think it is important that Amazon customers hear from all sides.  It deserves four stars.</li>
            <li> Prompt ship by sender - Thanks. Product is sturdy and compact. I&#x27;ve owned a couple before and this one is nicer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the reviews I read. I have purchased several nose hair trimmers hopping to find one that will actually work on my nose hairs. When I received the Kemei trimmer tried right away and wow what a difference it trimmed my hairs fast and comfortably. I used it for several days until I needed to charge. After I charged it the trimmer never turned back on.... I was pissed and bummed. I even thought of buying another to avoid the hassle of returning this one. I just let it go and I recieved an email from the maker asking how the trimmer was. I answered that I loved it but it never turned on after the first charge. I never got a reply from my email so, I just let it go... Until today when I got to my office there was box on my desk from My Lifestyle Products! I opened it and found a new trimmer in the BOX! I am truly blown away with the amount of customer service I recommend this trimmer to any one that needs a nose trimmer it really works and even more important the Manufacture stands behind their product!!</li>
            <li> The product looks &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; but I am willing to give it a chance. NO instructions (at least not in English). It would be nice to know something about the product like charging information, Etc. I had to assume the &amp;#34;10h&amp;#34; that appears in tiny letters on the box is the charging time. It needs some Decent operating instructions.I am charging it for 10 Hours right now. I may have more questions, complaints, Etc. when I get a chance to use it.  Update: Having used the Kemei Rechargeable Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer for a few weeks now, I feel I need to upgrade my initial assessment of the device. Despite the inexpensive cost and kinda cheap/cheesy look, it seems to work great so far. It seems to have sufficient power and speed to do the job just fine. The only other thing I will be looking for going forward is the long term reliability. As I continue to use/recharge it, will it hold up as far as sufficient power and speed after multiple uses and recharges. Previous nose hair trimmers have lost  their &amp;#34;Oomph&amp;#34; over the long haul and I have eventually had to junk them. Lets see how the Kemei does over a six month to one year time period!</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money. The attachments on this trimmer are cheaply made and just pop right off at the slightest touch. Your experience with this product will only yield frustration. I bought it to replace my battery-operated trimmer that I got for 6 bucks at Ross, but that trimmer is superior to the this one because it actually works.</li>
            <li> I did NOT receive product at a discounted price or any other concessions for my non-biased review, as others have.  This is a great compact nose and ear hair trimmer. Love the fact that it is compact and rechargeable. It trims very close, very fast and does a GREAT job.  However, IT DOES pull on the sensitive nose hairs, if you go too fast, which can be very uncomfortable. I attribute this to the double blades and the speed at which it runs.  Now that I am used to it, i can use it with no pulling whatsoever. So, my advise is if you are looking for a TOP- NOTCH trimmer that does what it was designed to do, buy this one, but go very slow when trimming nose hairs until you get adjusted to it.  Swapping the heads out, as some others have said, where parts fall out, just put it back together and its no big deal.</li>
            <li> I charged it and it didn&#x27;t work so I threw it away</li>
            <li> works better than other products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s hair this is meant for, but it sure isn&#x27;t mine. The trimmer portion doesn&#x27;t even cut or line my beard and the nose trimmer is so weak it just rips your hairs out instead of cutting them. Do not recommend unless you have really really really thin facial hair and even then in not sure it would work. But hey I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Be advised that there is no stand or pouch for it, so the one assessory for it becomes a loose item to keep up with.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Product seems to work after about three weeks. Stand by for updates. This is an update: The Kemei Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer for Men and Women with Micro-Groomer Attachment for Beard and Mustache Grooming broke after 6 months. The nose trimmer no longer works and the cutting device actually detached from the unit. So basically it is not functioning for what I bought it for. Was OK while it was working but actually not powerful enough for everyday use. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a well made trimmer. However, it said it was also for eyebrows. It does NOT have an attachment for trimming eyebrows which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> My husband  does not like it, it tickles the nose and you cant cute the hair in the ears very well. He is not happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this for trimming a beard - Could be the single worst product I have purchased on Amazon. When the shaving head doesn&#x27;t fall off you get to experience the unwelcome sensation of each hair being pulled from your face. Simply doesn&#x27;t cut. There are many better options out there. Avoid this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer.  Seems to be able to reach every annoying nose hair and cut about as close as you want.</li>
            <li> Worked for 3 days then died.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product, tried a few more before but this one is the best i have got so far.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he likes it a lot, especially the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I ever used!</li>
            <li> so far so good; quality product</li>
            <li> great value and works better than many more expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> In all the years I  have done business with Amazon, I have been satisfied -  until my last buy - the Kemei Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer KM-6629.  That is the worse trimmer I have ever purchased. After charging it for 10 - 12 hours (as recommended) I brought it against a hair outside my nose and it did nothing to it.  In fact, I could carefully touch the blade and feel no vibration.  I could say more but it&#x27;s not necessary.  It is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon!.</li>
            <li> This was a great tool for my son, who has more hair than carter has peanuts! He&#x27;s only 15 and has had all this excessive hair since he was 12, time to get rid of it and this nose ear and face trimmer did the job! He has a lot of hair on his neck, ears nose and one heck of a uni brow! As soon as this came in right on time, I couldn&#x27;t wait for my son to arrive home from school. He can use his dad&#x27;s razor and beard trimmer, but that&#x27;s just not doing it at this point. When he walked in the door, straight to the wash room and we started to rid his face and other areas of that wild looking hair. He is sensitive to loud sounds, this hair trimmer is very quite, and light weight in your hand, I started showing him how to use it, which he needs very simple instructions. He had no problems using this trimmer. Which is great, because normally I have to monitor his use of all razors, trimmers ect. This comes with 2 heads to trim different parts, which is very simple to change when you need to. It&#x27;s very sharp and removes the targeted hair in one swipe. This just isn&#x27;t a trimmer for men, women can also find that it will aid them in removing unwanted hair! With this I feel very confident he can manage all his needs with this great trimmer by My Lifestyles.It also comes with a triple satisfaction guarantee! I would recommend this trimmer to men and women alike, who wants to rid their self of that unwanted hair. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Not very good sorry I bought it, really doesnt do the job, poor trimming hair in ears and nose and the other trimmer is not very good, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the product performance. It has a loud motor which you would think means it is powerful to get the performance for ears, nose and eyebrow trimming.I will have to keep looking for a replacement to buy since this item is useless.</li>
            <li> My husband used this for nose hair and side trimming of his hair.  It works great and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> not worth .01 cent...could not cut hair....do not buy</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND LIKES IT SAYS IT WORKS GOOD</li>
            <li> product arrived as described</li>
            <li> It works better than any nose trimmer I have had.</li>
            <li> I like it. I have been using it for two weeks. It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a must have tool for any man! My fiance loves this nose, ear, and hair trimmer by Kemei. It gets the job done quickly for him. I have used this trimmer on him and it felt very comfortable in my hand. It comes with two different attachments that are pretty easy to take off and put on. When you get this trimmer set it will come in a box where you will keep it after use. One attachment is for your hair and the other one is for your nose and ear. Make sure you clean after every use to get out excess hair. I love that is trimmer is for men and woman. I have used this is on my legs and under arms. It doesn&#x27;t get the hair down as short as I want but it works. I think this hair trimmer is best for men. The nose trimmer works good for me tho. It is waterproof/washable and the head detaches that allows for a quick and easy cleaning - the Vacuum System whisks away hair clippings quickly and easily. With this trimmer you can trim your mustache, beard, goatee, and side burns. The ideal grooming tool for any man.  It has a solid brushed aluminum case that protects the trimmer from accidental damage and provides a no-rust, solid housing. I would recommend this trimmer to any man. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Total junk.  Don&#x27;t buy this.  Horrible low charge, no power.  Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> finally a nose hair trimmer that works.  only bad is it has to be charged with AC once in a while and the trimmer does not have an adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> My husband is sooooo happy that I got this for him! First, this is a fantastic looking trimmer compared to the others my husband already owns. Having a built in rechargeable battery is also a huge plus. The instructions said to charge it for 10 hours, but it was charged when it arrived cause he gave it a quick try! It has a (I call it Bronze cool sleek look) to it and has a small profile which is great for him for his travel bag. It takes care of the unwanted hair in your nose, ears, on your neck, and he uses it to even trim his eyebrows. You can also trim your beard, mustache, sideburns, and the little hairs on the back of your neck! He says he loves it! I am glad I was given the opportunity to receive these at a free or discounted price in return for my 100% honest and unbiased review!</li>
            <li> Works well for me , does as advertised .</li>
            <li> poor quality didn&#x27;t work - dont buy it -  the seller subsequently sent me a repacement so I will test this product again and asign a grade of neutral and test this product for the next 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few different trimmers.. Cuts smoothly and quickly with no heat problem or annoying noise.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s in the garbage</li>
            <li> My husband and I think the Kemei Nose Trimmer works great! I bought it for my husband and he said he couldn&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s been using a funny little scissor all his life. He has used the Kemei three times so far and says it is simple, quick and clean. He also likes that it is rechargeable - me too, because I never have batteries when we need them. I liked the inserts of instructions and thank you for your business card with My Life Style Products phone and email and guarantee.  Very Good Quality! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The motor is not as powerful and the blade is not sensitive enough to trim some thin nose hair. I did not like it, so had to return this item.</li>
            <li> It was bought as a gift and we have not heard back from the recipient. Looked to be a good product.</li>
            <li> I really like, it does a very good job, and it&#x27;s very good quality.  Completely satisfied .</li>
            <li> So far , so good.&lt;br /&gt;Good little trimmer, works well, appears to be well made.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was as-described. Quite pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> My husband was pleased with the performance of the Kemei Hair trimmer</li>
            <li> Wider cutter head than many others, works well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do a great job,; maybe my husband is just a challenge. He is disabled and I have done his grooming for years. Ears, nose and mustache have always been issues and I&#x27;m constantly looking for improvement.  After reading so many good reviews, I thought I finally found a solution. Possibly getting it free might have promoted the good reviews.</li>
            <li> so far it has been working very well.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> Very nice. We appreciate that it is rechargeable. It is neat and compact.</li>
            <li> Not very well designed. It does not cut very well and sometimes pulls the hair.</li>
