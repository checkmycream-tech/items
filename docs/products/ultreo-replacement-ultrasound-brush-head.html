    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Ultreo electric toothbrush is wonderful, but why are the replacement heads $75 each?  </li>
            <li>This product is awesome!  </li>
            <li>AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT BUT</li>
            <li>AND VERY HAPPY WITH THAT</li>
            <li>Ultreo toothbrush is very good.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, however, the manufacturer has gone out of business</li>
            <li>Welcome to business tactics in America........</li>
            <li>Great customer service with return.</li>
            <li>It is susposed to be good for 6 months and it is already defective and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic and I was very happy with it until I saw the replacement cost of Brush head.</li>
            <li>Now I find out the company is not making them any more.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>So no warranty or any more replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>You were able to find it cheaper before the company went out of business.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten how clean my teeth can feel with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Can no longer use my brush, no replacement available.</li>
            <li>DENTIST IS HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS IN MY LAST EXAM.</li>
            <li>I work for a dental laboratory and originally bought the Ultreo at a dental conference and was so excited to use my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Try it, read the instructions and fix your gums and clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed people are still writing good reviews for this product - the company has closed it&#x27;s doors and WILL NOT be producing more replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>The brush head mounting design of Ultreo is super neat, and I&#x27;ve not noticed any significant accumulation of gunk beneath the brush head-handle interface (which was a problem when I used sonicare).  </li>

            <li>When I first installed it, I noticed it slipped on just a bit too easy</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean and squeaky.</li>
            <li>Cost is an issue, but these brush heads are high tech and high quality, and they hold up amazingly well with use.</li>
            <li>Who in their right mind would pay $250 for a REPLACEMENT BRUSH for Ultreo.  </li>
            <li>However, after just _one_ use of the ULTREO, I was convinced the higher price was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, I get lots of compliments on my white teeth and all I&#x27;m using is the brush and regular toothpaste!  </li>
            <li>This extra toothbrush head is great, as the container for the toothbrush has a spot for an extra brush head, allowing 2 people to share the toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Also, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered the Ultreo, I had been a die-hard fan of the previously-most-highly-rated brand (wink-wink--just-not-sure-if-one-should-use-brand-names-here) of electronic toothbrush that used one of the two types of technologies that ULTREO uses.</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased worked a lot longer but eventually it too would not charge up or power on.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately hurting the consumer and putting innovative companies like Ultreo out of business.</li>
            <li>HAVE HAD THIS TOOTH BRUSH SINCE THEY FIRST STARTED THE BUSINESS</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t be able to get replacement brush heads for very long - the ones advertised are way over priced.</li>
            <li>After learning how to change the brush head, I&#x27;ve found it very simple and easy to do.      </li>
            <li>I really like the feel of my teeth after using the Ultreo toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It cleans teeth very well,</li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH MUCH LOUDER.</li>
            <li>Just not the same feel or quality of the original heads</li>
            <li>Clean and white teeth.</li>
            <li>High frequency vibrations work very well</li>
            <li>The main reason this review is not 5-stars is the exorbitant price.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money even at closeout prices.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t have this problem with my old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The bristles become too soft and do not work as designed.</li>
            <li>Yes, I loved mine, but I&#x27;m now stuck with a useless device</li>
            <li>Im getting dental work done and again the concern is not on a flat surface but at the gum line the instructions are dentist accurate for brushing methods and not up and down as we used to, that damages the gums.  </li>
            <li>Gonna switch back to the Sonicare or maybe try out the new Oral B.</li>
            <li>It never powered up completely and after the second use, it wouldn&#x27;t even power on.  </li>
            <li>and I will have to go back to the old technology.  </li>
            <li>I do love my ultreo, but when the brush head needs to be replaced approximately every 3-4 months, there is no way I&#x27;ll continue to use it and pay $60 to replace the head.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too bad the company couldn&#x27;t make it, but if they really want to get rid of the replacements while people ARE still using the product, it should be made affordable.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a ridiculous price.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product, however, the manufacturer has gone out of business so you won&#x27;t be able to get replacement brush heads for very long - the ones advertised are way over priced. so caveat emptor (let the buyer beware!)</li>
            <li> I switched from Sonicaire to the Ultreo and my teeth are cleaner, whiter, and healthier.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of my teeth after using the Ultreo toothbrush. I replaced the toothbrush head within a few weeks of the handle warning me of the need for replacement and could definitely tell the difference with the new head. I had forgotten how clean my teeth can feel with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The Ultreo electric toothbrush is wonderful, but why are the replacement heads $75 each?  Outrageous!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000V4T8MG Ultreo Replacement Ultrasound Brush Head]]    This product is awesome!  I understand they are discontinued so if you want one (or 4)buy them before they are gone forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing about the ULTREO itself, since reviewing a replacement brush-head would be sort-of strange. When I first ordered the Ultreo, I had been a die-hard fan of the previously-most-highly-rated brand (wink-wink--just-not-sure-if-one-should-use-brand-names-here) of electronic toothbrush that used one of the two types of technologies that ULTREO uses. I am skeptical about any product that is marketed with claims that imply that is has scientifically proven benefits that ultimately explain why the product has such a high price point relative to other products of its type. However, after just _one_ use of the ULTREO, I was convinced the higher price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read the ad carefully.  It was worded in such a way one would presume you received two brush heads for the price.  But when it arrived there was only one.  Looking back on the ad, I can see now that it was deceitfully written to leave the impression you recieved two but also can be read that there are 2 at the price.  My bad, but on the other hand Mr. Holy HisSon1957 will answer to his Christian maker for the deceit and I am only out the money.  Another con artist hiding behind religion.</li>
            <li> This is the second Ultreo I&#x27;ve purchased.  And, it is the second one that has \\&quot;gone south\\&quot; on me.  It never powered up completely and after the second use, it wouldn&#x27;t even power on.  The first one I purchased worked a lot longer but eventually it too would not charge up or power on.  The company has since \\&quot;closed its doors\\&quot;.  I wonder why?</li>
            <li> Used it for about two weeks and it died on me. Now I find out the company is not making them any more. Wonder why? DO NOT waste your money even at closeout prices.</li>
            <li> I had an oral B toothbrush and this works completely different as they state.  High frequency vibrations work very well but you cant press hard nor brush in a normal manner. It cleans teeth very well, Im getting dental work done and again the concern is not on a flat surface but at the gum line the instructions are dentist accurate for brushing methods and not up and down as we used to, that damages the gums.  Try it, read the instructions and fix your gums and clean your teeth. We love it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, I get lots of compliments on my white teeth and all I&#x27;m using is the brush and regular toothpaste!  Not cheap though.</li>
            <li> What the heck happened with Ultreo?  Did they go out of business, replacement heads defective?  Who in their right mind would pay $250 for a REPLACEMENT BRUSH for Ultreo.  I used to pay $25.00.  I have been ripped off royally.  Can no longer use my brush, no replacement available.</li>
            <li> This extra toothbrush head is great, as the container for the toothbrush has a spot for an extra brush head, allowing 2 people to share the toothbrush! Took me a little while to get used to the toothbrush, but I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a plain toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I have owned both the Sonic care tooth brush and now the Ultreo tooth brush. The Ultreo definitely out performs the Sonic care in cleaning quility !</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush is like no other--and I have tried them all. Your teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean and squeaky. It does take time to get used to the new type of brush with the hard ultrasound disc in the center--but you get it after a few uses and don&#x27;t even notice it. Also, it is very gentle. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Ultreo toothbrush is very good. I have been using it for 6 months and I can see and feel the results. Clean and white teeth. Buy, you will like it.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why a single Treo replacement brushhead is $60, it typically sells for less than 1/2 this price. Amazon even has twin packs for about $40 (but out of stock at the moment).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately companies like Proctor and Gamble (Sonicare) use frivolous law suits to suppress new and improved technology. Ultimately hurting the consumer and putting innovative companies like Ultreo out of business. Welcome to business tactics in America........</li>
            <li> tooth paste gets stuck in the bristles and it takes forever to get it out. i didn&#x27;t have this problem with my old electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is susposed to be good for 6 months and it is already defective and needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Ultreo powerbrush for a year.  I&#x27;ve replaced the brush head 3 times, getting about 4 months of use per brush head before I see visible signs of bristle wear.  The \\&quot;Replace Brush Head\\&quot; light on the handle base comes on after 3 months of 2x daily use because the brush is programmed to do so.  Its a nice reminder, but you can override this message and reset the program by holding the on/off button down for a couple of seconds while the handle is in its plugged-in charger base.  After learning how to change the brush head, I&#x27;ve found it very simple and easy to do.      The brush head mounting design of Ultreo is super neat, and I&#x27;ve not noticed any significant accumulation of gunk beneath the brush head-handle interface (which was a problem when I used sonicare).  Cost is an issue, but these brush heads are high tech and high quality, and they hold up amazingly well with use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed people are still writing good reviews for this product - the company has closed it&#x27;s doors and WILL NOT be producing more replacement heads.  Yes, I loved mine, but I&#x27;m now stuck with a useless device and I will have to go back to the old technology.  You are wasting your money if you purchase one of these!</li>
            <li> I work for a dental laboratory and originally bought the Ultreo at a dental conference and was so excited to use my toothbrush.  A few weeks ago it was time to replace my brush head and I was upset to find that the company went under and I can no longer use the Ultreo unless I want to shell out $60.  I&#x27;ll pass....Gonna switch back to the Sonicare or maybe try out the new Oral B.</li>
            <li> Had to return it. Did not work. Great customer service with return.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product.  Ultreo has gone out of business.  So no warranty or any more replacement brush heads. Google \\&quot;Ultreo and WSJ\\&quot; (Wall Street Journal) for the full story. Amazon won&#x27;t allow weblinks in reviews.</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD THIS TOOTH BRUSH SINCE THEY FIRST STARTED THE BUSINESS</li>
            <li> I do love my ultreo, but when the brush head needs to be replaced approximately every 3-4 months, there is no way I&#x27;ll continue to use it and pay $60 to replace the head.  It&#x27;s too bad the company couldn&#x27;t make it, but if they really want to get rid of the replacements while people ARE still using the product, it should be made affordable.  That&#x27;s a ridiculous price.  I will switch to a different product.</li>
            <li> AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT BUT THE ULTREO COMPANY WAS SQUEEZED OUT OF THE MARKET BY THE LARGER CORPORATION. THE PRODUCT LASTED THREE YEARS. BOUGHT THE PHILIPS SONIC CARE ULTRA-SOUND TOOTHBRUSH (BASIC MODEL) AND VERY HAPPY WITH THAT, ALTHOUGH MUCH LOUDER. DENTIST IS HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS IN MY LAST EXAM.</li>
            <li> The replacement head I received was a joke.  When I first installed it, I noticed it slipped on just a bit too easy but it felt like it was on sturdy enough for the job.  Well after 2 weeks, the replacement head is now slipping off while trying to use it.  Just not the same feel or quality of the original heads but I had a feeling this would be the case when I ordered so my fault.  The head is now useless.</li>
            <li> I have the cleanest teeth in town, even my dentist cannot believe how well this works. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> In order for the brush to work as described in the literature you do have to replace the brush head every 3 to 4 months. The bristles become too soft and do not work as designed. The product is fantastic and I was very happy with it until I saw the replacement cost of Brush head. You were able to find it cheaper before the company went out of business. Yes you read correctly, no more product will be made, so what ever is for sale out there is all that is left on the market. The main reason this review is not 5-stars is the exorbitant price. But I still like the product and will use it until remaining supplies are sold out.</li>
