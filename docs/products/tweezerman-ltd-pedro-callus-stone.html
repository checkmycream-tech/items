            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take any more skin off then you want.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this Tweezerman Pedro stone.</li>
            <li>This is a great replacement for a pumice stone -- the handle is easy to hold, the stone does not crumble, and the design is pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I think it will work best for people who don&#x27;t have severely dry and cracked heels, as I do.</li>
            <li>She said the extended handle helped her reach better than others she&#x27;d tried and after just once use, she was much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Excellent for removing light patches of dry skin with the curved finer abrasive side.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>this stone does the trick quickly and easily!  </li>
            <li>Tweezerman always has good tools, this really does the job, has two different surfaces, works beautifully.</li>

            <li>Amazing results after just the first use.</li>
            <li>I have bought many different Callus Stones over the years and this is the best one I have ever used and the only one I really liked.</li>
            <li>handle is comfortable and the contour makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>works quickly and your feet look better in one use.</li>
            <li>The best ever,I use mine everyday in the shower.</li>
            <li>My feet never looked to smooth.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a file that would make my feet smooth without a lot of fuss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes skin off evenly and smoothly, but never seems to dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the flat coarser abrasive side, it is excellent for removing thicker areas of dry heel skin after soaking feet in warm water for 10 to 15 mins.</li>
            <li>I keep in the original packaging in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>This callus stones smoothes away my callus and makes my feet squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Also,  It discolors over time (which doesn&#x27;t affect its function) and there may be a way to clean it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants nice smooth sandal ready feet for summer.</li>
            <li>and I love how much softer her skin is.</li>
            <li>This will be a gift, as my first stone is just fine after a year of use.</li>
            <li>I was familiar with Tweezerman brand from their tweezers, so I had high expectations for this product, and it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>My wife loves how great this callus stone is at removing dried skin</li>
            <li>and I like to have a buffer to treat them right once in a while.  </li>
            <li>But, I still want them to be pain free and look decent in sandals.</li>
            <li>I like the two sides (Rough and Smooth) and totally love the handle.</li>
            <li>has lasted about a month so far looks fine</li>
            <li>After using this, it doesn&#x27;t get as clean as it was brand new.  </li>
            <li>and it works so well that my feet are much softer than before!</li>
            <li>First some background.</li>
            <li>I think I bought my first one at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable in your hand, and the product is easy to use in the shower, the handle does not get slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li>Works great to take off dead skin and smooth out the rough edges.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to lather your feet with foot cream after using the stone to keep your feet smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li>This works great on my dry and rough heals</li>
            <li>I never have rough heels any more.</li>
            <li>I did not purchase this product on amazon, I purchased in Marshall&#x27;s for $ 7.99, but I would still have paid 20 bucks for it because it works very well.</li>
            <li>Love the rough and not-so-rough sides....</li>
            <li>, so your heels really take a beating.</li>
            <li>so you ave to be gentle</li>
            <li>To be totally honest, I&#x27;d looked at it online here and planned to order, but the same afternoon I found it in a local Kohl&#x27;s, so bought it there (</li>
            <li>This is much better than any other hand held stone.</li>
            <li>I was able to feel the rough spots before using and after, they were gone!  </li>
            <li>Refine the abraded area after feet are totally dry with the fine side again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews and horror stories about the other electric products available, I decided to go with this.  </li>
            <li>When taking a hot shower I use this callus stone and I can literally see the dirt from my from my feet being washed away from even getting through the deep cracks in my foot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid pumice user and this doesn&#x27;t even compare with the traditional oval stone.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to hold onto instead of being short handled, small, or really</li>
            <li>I get calluses even when I wear soft slippers or tennis shoes.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower when the skin is soft and just scrub away.</li>
            <li>The handle makes it so much easier to grasp, especially for feet.</li>
            <li>Far exceeds what is done via professional pedicure.</li>
            <li>The one side is to get the major amount of surface area down with the rest of the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>The other side then smooths it out until you can&#x27;t tell that there was any problem it the first place.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but if it works, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>The rough side really works</li>
            <li>My feet haven&#x27;t felt this soft since I was much younger, and  no soreness!</li>
            <li>If you let your feet go too long, use it dry in a tub rough side first, then softer side.</li>

            <li> If you let your feet go too long, use it dry in a tub rough side first, then softer side.</li>
            <li> I think the key to having soft skin on your heels is taking off this dead skin a little bit at a time, because I used the Tweezerman Pedro for a week, in the shower, rubbing circular motion on the rough spots and then following the shower with a little bit of moisturizer, and I can truly say that for the first time in a couple of years my feet feel baby soft!</li>
            <li> the automatic files, the egg files, the microplane type, the razor (blades) type, and the flat 2 sided types.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience to stand on one foot and use it as long as I need to, but that&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need anything else, as this is the ULTIMATE product for fixing up your rough heels.</li>
            <li> but those are the only down sides.  </li>
            <li> so I could compare to the other once I was dry.  </li>
            <li> I gave one as a gift...very practical and feminine with the pink handle</li>
            <li> (hot, dry, always in sandals), MN (cold, humid summers, dry winters) and Missouri.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of these in the past years.</li>
            <li> The product is well-made, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me like I&#x27;m reading in the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t take off enough dry and dead skin, no matter how hard I work the stone onto my heels.</li>
            <li> The fact that one side removes the dead skin and the other smooths it out makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;ve had to replace them is because they have fallen off hooks in my shower and the handles have broken.</li>
            <li> This guy is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of flip flops and my feet get filthy and have hard callus with cracks from walking outside so much .</li>
            <li> I usually use it in the shower as part of my routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also I don&#x27;t see the dramatic results that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about getting one of the battery powered callus removers, but tons of negative comments about their battery and stone life (or lack thereof).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for at least 10 years now.</li>
            <li> They use it everyday (they had really bad calluses on their feet!).</li>
            <li> so I always had to deal with tearing and painful calluses.</li>

            <li> I did not purchase this product on amazon, I purchased in Marshall&#x27;s for $ 7.99, but I would still have paid 20 bucks for it because it works very well. I wear a lot of flip flops and my feet get filthy and have hard callus with cracks from walking outside so much . When taking a hot shower I use this callus stone and I can literally see the dirt from my from my feet being washed away from even getting through the deep cracks in my foot. This callus stones smoothes away my callus and makes my feet squeaky clean. My suggestion is to lather your feet with foot cream after using the stone to keep your feet smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> Great tool for our heels.  My sister has one, and I tried her&#x27;s and I liked how it worked, so I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done! My feet never looked to smooth.  Now I save money at the nail salon and never get the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; callous remover since this does the job whenever I want!</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement for a pumice stone -- the handle is easy to hold, the stone does not crumble, and the design is pretty sturdy.  Much better than the Amope foot file.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle. Works well.</li>
            <li> THE BEST at keeping the heels smooth!</li>
            <li> Perfect time of year to own this item! Well know Tweezerman brand coming from trustlyworth Amazon! Don&#x27;t hesitate, purchase now!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my partner and they love it! They use it everyday (they had really bad calluses on their feet!). Got the feet feeling nice and smooth in no time!</li>
            <li> I returned this as it felt like microscopic glass shards in my fingers when I touched it.</li>
            <li> Perfect shape.  Easy to hold and use in the shower.  Love the rough and not-so-rough sides....choices!  The curve of the pumice stone is perfect for heels and the sides of one&#x27;s heels.  I made a good choice.  And for a great price.</li>
            <li> My wife loves how great this callus stone is at removing dried skin and I love how much softer her skin is.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and horror stories about the other electric products available, I decided to go with this.  Glad I did.  The one side is to get the major amount of surface area down with the rest of the skin quickly.  The other side then smooths it out until you can&#x27;t tell that there was any problem it the first place.  I see no way that one could get injured with this</li>
            <li> After using this, it doesn&#x27;t get as clean as it was brand new.  Also I don&#x27;t see the dramatic results that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it performs well enough to cost 20 dollars. The results seem about the same as a 2 dollar stone. I do like the handle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my elderly grandmother who was complaining of a callus on her foot.  The next day she called to tell me that she was on &amp;#34;cloud 9&amp;#34;.  She said the extended handle helped her reach better than others she&#x27;d tried and after just once use, she was much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is the best tool for the foot!! Will recommend to everyone. Like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used. Must have item.</li>
            <li> worth the price--durable, easy to clean, effective. Forget the cheaper versions. Love this ped stone!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need anything else, as this is the ULTIMATE product for fixing up your rough heels. Trust the Tweezerman!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working!!! I used it twice a week and it works so well that my feet are much softer than before!</li>
            <li> Excellent for removing light patches of dry skin with the curved finer abrasive side.&lt;br /&gt;With the flat coarser abrasive side, it is excellent for removing thicker areas of dry heel skin after soaking feet in warm water for 10 to 15 mins. Refine the abraded area after feet are totally dry with the fine side again.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable and the contour makes it easy to use. One I keep at home; another I keep in the original packaging in my suitcase. This is much better than any other hand held stone. I gave one as a gift...very practical and feminine with the pink handle</li>
            <li> I was familiar with Tweezerman brand from their tweezers, so I had high expectations for this product, and it has not disappointed. I was impressed immediately by how durable and sturdy the product is, high quality plastic handle. The handle is comfortable in your hand, and the product is easy to use in the shower, the handle does not get slippery when wet.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants nice smooth sandal ready feet for summer.</li>
            <li> The coarse side of this stone is *really* coarse!  I was going to do just one heel while in the shower so I could compare to the other once I was dry.  But no need...I was able to feel the rough spots before using and after, they were gone!  I had been thinking about getting one of the battery powered callus removers, but tons of negative comments about their battery and stone life (or lack thereof).  Well, no need...this stone does the trick quickly and easily!  As a side note...I already had a callus stone, and it had never done a very good job.  Came from the beauty supply store, which goes to show you that there are definitely differences in the qualify of callus stones!  I life in California where we can/do wear sandals for months on end, so your heels really take a beating.</li>
            <li> Great, gets the job done without pain because you control the level of pressure applied. has lasted about a month so far looks fine</li>
            <li> I have bought many different Callus Stones over the years and this is the best one I have ever used and the only one I really liked.</li>
            <li> Seems good.  Have only used it once.  A little pricey, but if it works, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman always has good tools, this really does the job, has two different surfaces, works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of these in the past years. Best I&#x27;ve found to smooth feet between pedis. The only reason I&#x27;ve had to replace them is because they have fallen off hooks in my shower and the handles have broken. With it was made with another up breakable material, the for the price and the quality of the stone, I don&#x27;t mind replacing!</li>
            <li> First some background. I&#x27;m 35 and have always had feet prone to calluses and cracking, especially in sandals and flip flops. I get calluses even when I wear soft slippers or tennis shoes.  I used this file living in Arizona (hot, dry, always in sandals), MN (cold, humid summers, dry winters) and Missouri.  I&#x27;ve tried many kinds over the years- the automatic files, the egg files, the microplane type, the razor (blades) type, and the flat 2 sided types. I&#x27;ve tried every callus cream and lotion ever made. I wanted a file that would make my feet smooth without a lot of fuss. I don&#x27;t like applying lotion or spending a lot of time on my feet. But, I still want them to be pain free and look decent in sandals. I&#x27;ve been using this one for at least 10 years now. I think I bought my first one at Walgreens. This is my favorite for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to hold onto instead of being short handled, small, or really flat.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts years. The only reason I replaced mine is because my kids dropped it on the tile floor and it cracked. It still worked though.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take any more skin off then you want. Some of the metal types or automated ones dig too deep to easily.&lt;br /&gt;It takes skin off evenly and smoothly, but never seems to dull.&lt;br /&gt;It works quickly and your feet look better in one use. If you let your feet go too long, use it dry in a tub rough side first, then softer side. Then follow up with washing your feet. If you use a moisturizer (no fancy stuff needed) overnight, your feet will look awesome in days. I usually use it in the shower as part of my routine.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripes. If dropped on tile, it may get a crack. Also,  It discolors over time (which doesn&#x27;t affect its function) and there may be a way to clean it. I;ve never cared enough to look into it. I hope that this review helps someone out there who doesn&#x27;t care to buy and try a ton of products.</li>
            <li> Thank you Tweezerman, for being the only company that cares about making a well made product that outperforms my expectations each and every time.</li>
            <li> The product is well-made, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me like I&#x27;m reading in the other reviews. I think it will work best for people who don&#x27;t have severely dry and cracked heels, as I do. It just doesn&#x27;t take off enough dry and dead skin, no matter how hard I work the stone onto my heels.</li>
            <li> This guy is a bit heavy and I worry about it dropping and cracking but those are the only down sides.  The rough side really works so you ave to be gentle and then the fine side does a very nice polish.  I walk and hike a lot so my feet get the brunt of the situation and I like to have a buffer to treat them right once in a while.  This product does a great job and I have thrown out my egg and others for this one.</li>
            <li> I got recommended to buy a pumice stone for the calluses on my hands. I&#x27;m a power lifter so I always had to deal with tearing and painful calluses. I bought this item and I&#x27;ve stopped having problems with my calluses ever since. I use it in the shower when the skin is soft and just scrub away. The fact that one side removes the dead skin and the other smooths it out makes all the difference. The handle makes it so much easier to grasp, especially for feet. It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Love It. I like the two sides (Rough and Smooth) and totally love the handle. It feels like a nice quality tool.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Tweezerman Pedro stone. To be totally honest, I&#x27;d looked at it online here and planned to order, but the same afternoon I found it in a local Kohl&#x27;s, so bought it there (same price). The heels on both of my feet had felt like barbed wire, and I&#x27;d used one of those sort of grater things to try to take away some of the roughness, but that thing just ended up making my heels feel like they&#x27;d been tortured (sore and hurting for a couple of days after doing this). I think the key to having soft skin on your heels is taking off this dead skin a little bit at a time, because I used the Tweezerman Pedro for a week, in the shower, rubbing circular motion on the rough spots and then following the shower with a little bit of moisturizer, and I can truly say that for the first time in a couple of years my feet feel baby soft! You have to be patient...it does take a bit of time to get all the old barbed-wire skin off, but the difference was quite wonderful. I use it in the shower now every day, and follow with some foot moisturizer on the heels. My feet haven&#x27;t felt this soft since I was much younger, and  no soreness!</li>
            <li> This works great on my dry and rough heals</li>
            <li> Amazing results after just the first use.</li>
            <li> Best pumice stone I have ever used. Far exceeds what is done via professional pedicure. I undid 30 years of callus in 2 attempts. Amazing. I&#x27;m an avid pumice user and this doesn&#x27;t even compare with the traditional oval stone. I have to cut back from daily use because it&#x27;s not necessary to use daily anymore.</li>
