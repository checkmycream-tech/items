            <li> Good color line. I don&#x27;t think it has &amp;#34;no ammonia&amp;#34; as it states, though because I can CLEARLY SMELL IT. So they must able to say that if it is below a certain amount or something. I works fine if you don&#x27;t have a lot of grey but there is definitely ammonia in this brand even though they say it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have used others in the past, but this works very well with the color I currently use. Very stable.</li>

            <li> The best developer to use with Matrix color. great product. Shipped fast and in good shape.</li>
            <li> This developer is a waste of time, effort, and money. Unless you like looking like a pumpkin, do yourself a favor and avoid this product.</li>
