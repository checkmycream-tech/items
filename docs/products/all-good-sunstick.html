    <ol>
            <li>The best face stick.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, a mix of cocoa butter and coconuts.</li>
            <li>It seems to work great.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of preventing sunburn too.</li>
            <li>I am fair haired and skin and it protects me the way I need.</li>
            <li>Anyway, definitely a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until I find something even better, this is the stick for me!</li>
            <li>kind of...</li>
            <li>The coconut scent is nice, not too strong, and I had no problems using it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>We used this sunstick a lot last summer and it worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>So, I thought it would be a safe order.  </li>
            <li>If they could could make the texture better somehow, I would be buying bulk of these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more convenient than the lotion or spray bottles when you need something you can carry around in your purse or diaper bag.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil is my favorite for many cosmetics and shampoos so this suits me fine.</li>
            <li>Smelled great, nice texture, didn&#x27;t go on white.  </li>
            <li>I got this in an a subscription beauty box that features more environmentally friendly products and it was my favorite find of all the items.  </li>
            <li>After putting some on her face she rubs it in easily and it doesn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and is chemical free.</li>
            <li>They REALLY need to make it smoother and more spreadable.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find a chemical-free sunscreen stick that goes on clear and not white.</li>
            <li>We live chemical free as much as possible and so far, this has been the best all natural sunblock I could find.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my face, neck, hands and arms when I&#x27;m planning to be outside for a while.</li>
            <li>They go on smooth and as clear as you can get with a zinc based formula.</li>
            <li>This is a smooth, almost clear lotion in a stick.</li>
            <li>We bought this same brand stick last summer from a sports store and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It has an unusual feeling on my skin, but I imagine that&#x27;s the zinc.</li>
            <li>you really can&#x27;t use it on anyone who&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t already leathery because it would HURT them to put it on.  </li>
            <li>It is rather stiff, but if you warm it up in your pocket for a while before putting it on, it goes on much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, It&#x27;s not messy</li>
            <li>I only wish it were available locally</li>
            <li>It was great in the beginning but it dried up too fast making it really hard to apply.</li>
            <li>It has a hard layer on top, once scraped off</li>
            <li>Is is clear?  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the company&#x27;s effort to make a clear formula, but we can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if the batch I received was old or if they changed the formula.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old daughter loves this sunscreen for her face.</li>
            <li>This one is quite soft in comparison and is softer than the Neutrogena Baby sunscreen stick.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work really well initially when new, but after a while it gets either rock hard or grainy and the kids do not like it anymore.</li>
            <li>The label claims this &amp;#34;goes on clear.&amp;#34; It does leave a slight whitish tinge to my face--but it&#x27;s so much lighter than, for instance, the Badger sun screen, which is just completely white.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the stick is old or  broken or what,</li>
            <li> Lotions irritate her eyes and she previously used California Baby&#x27;s sunscreen stick.</li>
            <li> But it does have a little texture.</li>
            <li> Lived a year in Hawaii and went through a million of these surfing everyday.</li>
            <li> This was totally dried out when it arrived at my house.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no easy way to &amp;#34;turn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s related, but I&#x27;ve certainly not had a cold since I began to use this stick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faint fragrance is acceptable to me as I don&#x27;t like extra fragrances in my cosmetics and hygiene items.</li>
            <li> Once in a while we got a dud that was hard and not creamy so it wouldn&#x27;t apply.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too hard, like a crayon or a candle.  </li>
            <li> Like rubbing hard wax on to your face.</li>
            <li> The stick is hard as a rock and scratchy....</li>
            <li> it hard to put on?  </li>
            <li> - you have to push hard</li>
            <li> That one is very hard.</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Well... too bad because the consistency is so thick it is impossible for my kids to spread on their faces.</li>
            <li> Trying to apply this lotion to your skin is unpleasant, difficult and inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> This was so bad.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> My kids hate it and so do I.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I should have listened...</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else now that I&#x27;ve found this Sunstick. It&#x27;s faint fragrance is acceptable to me as I don&#x27;t like extra fragrances in my cosmetics and hygiene items. Coconut oil is my favorite for many cosmetics and shampoos so this suits me fine. It seems to work great. I am fair haired and skin and it protects me the way I need. It also checks out with Environmental Working Group&#x27;s list of acceptable sun protection for our skin. I have recommended it and have given one to my daughter. The stick is a little hard to smear on when it&#x27;s cold outside, so you may want to warm the stick up in your pocket before applying. I also have just pressed it on my skin and let it melt into my skin before trying to spread it. One stick lasts a while. I use it mostly on my face, neck, hands and arms when I&#x27;m planning to be outside for a while. It has an unusual feeling on my skin, but I imagine that&#x27;s the zinc. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s related, but I&#x27;ve certainly not had a cold since I began to use this stick. Zinc kills bacteria, so may be it&#x27;s related. Anyway, definitely a good product. Works. No sun burns now!</li>
            <li> The best face stick. Lived a year in Hawaii and went through a million of these surfing everyday. They go on smooth and as clear as you can get with a zinc based formula. Once in a while we got a dud that was hard and not creamy so it wouldn&#x27;t apply. Maybe 2 out of 10...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it - it&#x27;s too hard, like a crayon or a candle.  Perhaps I was sent an expired stick??  Next step is to figure out if I can return it.</li>
            <li> This is like rubbing a candle on your kids&#x27; faces.  My kids hate it and so do I.  I am stuck with 3 sticks of it.  They REALLY need to make it smoother and more spreadable.</li>
            <li> I got this in an a subscription beauty box that features more environmentally friendly products and it was my favorite find of all the items.  I love the smell and I had no problem applying it to my son&#x27;s face.  It didn&#x27;t run into his eyes and kept him from getting burned during a week of camp in the Southern July heat.</li>
            <li> This was so bad. Like rubbing hard wax on to your face. AND does not protect against sun that well-- It attract dirt, that will stick to it and then I was covered in waxy dirt. It has a hard layer on top, once scraped off it worked...kind of... We retured to the store.</li>
            <li> We used this sunstick a lot last summer and it worked wonderfully.  However, when I re-ordered a bunch for this summer, the sticks were incredibly dry.  Virtually no sunscreen came off the stick and onto skin.  Not only that, but the dryness irritated my kld&#x27;s skin.  There&#x27;s no expiration date on the stick so I don&#x27;t know if the batch I received was old or if they changed the formula.  I think they may have changed the formula because when I bought a stick recently at the store (hoping it would work), it was the same.  We&#x27;re trying another brand now.  Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, It&#x27;s not messy I can apply multiples times if needed.  It last a long time.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter loves this sunscreen for her face. Lotions irritate her eyes and she previously used California Baby&#x27;s sunscreen stick. That one is very hard. This one is quite soft in comparison and is softer than the Neutrogena Baby sunscreen stick. But it does have a little texture. After putting some on her face she rubs it in easily and it doesn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> I agree with other comments.  Trying to apply this lotion to your skin is unpleasant, difficult and inconsistent.  Simply it does not work because it does not apply to skin well.  It crumbles off when you apply pressure, and you need to apply pressure in order to get any of it on.</li>
            <li> This was totally dried out when it arrived at my house.</li>
            <li> We bought this same brand stick last summer from a sports store and loved it.  Smelled great, nice texture, didn&#x27;t go on white.  So, I thought it would be a safe order.  I don&#x27;t know if the stick is old or  broken or what, but there&#x27;s no easy way to &amp;#34;turn it up&amp;#34; like a chapstick would have.  The stick is hard as a rock and scratchy....you really can&#x27;t use it on anyone who&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t already leathery because it would HURT them to put it on.  I would maybe buy again but only from a sports store down the street so that if the formula has indeed changed, I can just take it back.  Wouldn&#x27;t EVER risk buying this product online with shipping hassle again.</li>
            <li> Is is clear?  The label claims this &amp;#34;goes on clear.&amp;#34; It does leave a slight whitish tinge to my face--but it&#x27;s so much lighter than, for instance, the Badger sun screen, which is just completely white. When I put this sunstick on, my family doesn&#x27;t even notice I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it hard to put on?  It is rather stiff, but if you warm it up in your pocket for a while before putting it on, it goes on much easier. Personally, I&#x27;ve found that if I just have a little patience while I&#x27;m putting it on, I don&#x27;t have a problem. If any pieces crumble off the edges, I just rub them into my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it smell?  Yes, like coconut. My husband says it smells like Coppertone.  After a while, either I don&#x27;t notice the scent or the scent diminishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I find something even better, this is the stick for me!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find a chemical-free sunscreen stick that goes on clear and not white. Well... too bad because the consistency is so thick it is impossible for my kids to spread on their faces. It has the consistency of tar - you have to push hard and then it just crumbles. I appreciate the company&#x27;s effort to make a clear formula, but we can&#x27;t even use it. waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of its &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; rating on EWG. Everyone in my family loves this product! It is so easy to use and is chemical free. Does a great job of preventing sunburn too.</li>
            <li> This is a smooth, almost clear lotion in a stick. The coconut scent is nice, not too strong, and I had no problems using it. It does the job without spreading toxic chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients of this sunscreen and the kids like the smell of it. It also does not make the kids white. It seemed to work really well initially when new, but after a while it gets either rock hard or grainy and the kids do not like it anymore. It is unfortunate. If they could could make the texture better somehow, I would be buying bulk of these.</li>
            <li> We live chemical free as much as possible and so far, this has been the best all natural sunblock I could find. It&#x27;s much more convenient than the lotion or spray bottles when you need something you can carry around in your purse or diaper bag. Smells wonderful, a mix of cocoa butter and coconuts. I only wish it were available locally</li>
            <li> It was great in the beginning but it dried up too fast making it really hard to apply.</li>
