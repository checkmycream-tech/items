            <li>I think it was a very effective makeup remover.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for traveling as it&#x27;s under 4oz and has a screw top</li>
            <li>They work just as good however.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to remove foundation Eyeshadows and powder and things like that</li>

            <li>good price, would buy again</li>
            <li>Frankly, it isn&#x27;t a good makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I have used this remover for many years and it works great.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to see it&#x27;s available on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup nicely.  </li>
            <li>Not as effective as Mary Kay&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that for this product to be effective, you have to soak a cotton pad and press it on your eye for 20+ seconds for it to work.</li>
            <li>This works ok, but not as good as Mary Kay&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li>Really nice product...removes makeup without the oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Make Up Remover for over 5 years and find it is the absolute best product to remove stubborn non-permanent mascara and eye make up.  </li>
            <li>It used to be *the best* and would remove any eye makeup gently.</li>
            <li>I use the new Maybelline mascara which is awesome</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and is soothing to your skin.</li>
            <li>Best product for sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>This works good but the Clean Express Remover works better.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many, many years</li>
            <li>I love this product because is not oily.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it with cotton.</li>
            <li>I have to use cotton pads to remove most of it, and then a Q-tip to get the rest.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have used this for more than a month.</li>
            <li>You have to rub more to get the make up all off.</li>
            <li>I assume soap, water and a washcloth would have done a better job.  </li>
            <li>My favorite eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for more years than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years for removing my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to try a more \\&quot;oily\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li>It does not contain mineral oil, which puffs up the eye area and would create more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this Maybelline product for many years; no complaints.</li>
            <li>Better than most higher-priced eye makeup removers; why pay more?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important because I wear contacts!</li>
            <li>I love that when it didn&#x27;t get into my eyes (always happens)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a flip top cap, so</li>
            <li>, it gets most of what i have on my eyes off, but not all</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline</li>
            <li>Great for regular mascara, not for the waterproof kind ( they have another version for that).</li>
            <li>Best remover for a clean feel, no oily residue, the only one I have found that can be used before putting makeup on again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure soap would be just as effective.</li>
            <li>I added this on to an order because I needed about 3 more dollars of product to get free shipping.</li>
            <li>This product was so good and works very well</li>
            <li>I us.ed this and loved it, now not so much.  </li>
            <li>SO EASY TO BUY A YEARS</li>
            <li>W/O ANY OIL OR GREASE MAKING IT EASY TO REAPPLY AGAIN.</li>
            <li>This product is able to completely clean lashes without rubbing too, no matter how loaded was the makeup. ..</li>
            <li>No oiliness after, gets all mascara and eye shadow off easily.</li>
            <li>it would easily come</li>
            <li>Easy on the eyes and gets the job done while not breaking the pockets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; version, but I don&#x27;t like the residual effect of the oil-based makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>This is the best liquid eye make-up remover I&#x27;ve found so far, and it&#x27;s conveniently cheap, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about how much I use.</li>
            <li>Works just fine</li>
            <li>This product quickly takes off liner and mascara without leaving a greasy residue!</li>
            <li>This oil free make up remover is for mascara that is NOT waterproof.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Expert Eye 100% Oil Free Eye</li>
            <li>I was looking to switch all my products to oil free thinking</li>
            <li>I have found out it is important to rinse your eyes with water after using eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>make sure you get the right stuff.)</li>
            <li>I usually use Clinique makeup remover, but this stuff, is great!</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Not oily, very light and works fast.</li>
            <li>By participating in your special shipping program I never have to worry about running out.  </li>
            <li>I think I have found a new makeup remover!! :)</li>
            <li>This product is great and works as expected.</li>
            <li>It will be nice to have it shipped directly to my door as part of the subscribe and save program</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product nightly for many years, but it doesn&#x27;t really dissolve all the mascara I&#x27;ve applied in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the disposable wipes for my full face and the eyes and there was residual eye make up</li>
            <li>yeah, not bad</li>
            <li>I dab some on a q-tip and it cleans everything up really quickly.</li>
            <li>The mascara comes right off easily and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazing low cost product</li>
            <li>WORTH AT A TIME</li>
            <li>This is my favorite remover so far, i dont like oily ones (meant for water-proof stuff)</li>
            <li>I do not wear mascara very often, but when I do, I appreciate have this product to clean my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different kinds of makeup remover and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Very oily and ran out so quick.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really deep cleanse to get the make up off, more of a superficial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Even with that, I was still left with eye makeup on, and on top of that?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would have rated it higher, but it stung my eyes.</li>
            <li>Does the job exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>The only downside is you need to use more of it than if it was oil-based</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear waterproof makeup at all, but still find I have to wipe &amp; wipe &amp; wipe with this product which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want to be doing around your eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d put this in my bag and it would spill everywhere even if I close the top it would still open</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap, and works with a little more effort</li>
            <li>No oily residue and leaves a nice, fresh and clean feeling behind.</li>
            <li>No irritation even though I&#x27;m sensitive, no residue, only pure makeup removing magic.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother my wife&#x27;s eyes but it doesn&#x27;t remove her eye makeup very well either.</li>
            <li>This is a wonder product, and gentle on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Requires too much tugging to ensure all eye make-up is removed.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful when you need to take off your mascara, not greasy or slimy.</li>
            <li>Gentle, but it works and it is cheaper than the department store brands.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>This Maybelline remover works so very well, removes all of my makeup</li>
            <li>The pink maybelline is better</li>
            <li>Did not work very well at all.</li>
            <li>Gentle on your eyes but gets every trace of non-waterproof eye makeup (and that&#x27;s all I wear) off with one swipe.  </li>
            <li>This is not irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li>removes makeup faster and is gentle on skin</li>
            <li>However, I do not feel this works very well.  </li>
            <li>Wife has used this for a decade and loves it so much we have it on scheduled delivery.</li>
            <li>Other than that i love it, been using it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine, I just didn&#x27;t like how it made my eyes feel or how long is lasted.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous brands of eye make up remover over the years but stay true to this Maybelline Expert Eyes.  </li>
            <li>I wish the bottle was larger, it costs around 5$ at a store for one, I&#x27;d pay 7-9 if it was bigger, just so that i dont have to get it so often or so many of them at once.</li>
            <li>I have spent many years and a lot of money on eye make-up removers, and I consistently come back to this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for any person whether young or old because its very gentle on the eyes</li>
            <li>, even though it&#x27;s only about $3, I still felt like there wasn&#x27;t very much product.</li>
            <li>but yeah if you need a little make-up remover this works just fine.</li>
            <li>I used Lancome for a while, and honestly, this works better and is so much less expensive.  </li>
            <li>I still had some of my Neutrogena eye makeup remover left, so I would use this most days and just deal with the stinging, and if I had dry  or sensitive eyes due to allergies on a certain day, I&#x27;d use the neutrogena eye makeup</li>
            <li>it would help keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>It completely removes the mascara.</li>
            <li>AND DOESNT REMOVE IT COMPLETELY</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>The only product I&#x27;ll use and it really works.</li>
            <li>but this was no different than applying straight water to the face.</li>
            <li>The current formula doesn&#x27;t work better than plain water.</li>
            <li>I buy several of these at a time because I seriously NEVER want to run out.</li>
            <li>Gets off all the black smudges in an instant, and cheap to boot.</li>
            <li>Disappointing, as the regular oil maybelline makeup remover works great.</li>
            <li>but I would rather use an eye make up remover that barely works than one that causes pain.</li>
            <li>It barely gets the product off, and I have to rub repeatedly to get it to work.</li>
            <li>One would assume that the company that made the mascara would design the makeup remover to work especially well on their own products but it still was tedious to get off.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you would expect from this brand for less than I can get it in the local big box.</li>
            <li>I tried this in the towelette formula and like it for travel as you don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling but the cloths are so large, it seems like a waste to me.  </li>

            <li> Leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Not oily, very light and works fast.</li>
            <li> By participating in your special shipping program I never have to worry about running out.  </li>
            <li> I think I have found a new makeup remover!! :)</li>
            <li> This product is great and works as expected.</li>
            <li> It will be nice to have it shipped directly to my door as part of the subscribe and save program</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product nightly for many years, but it doesn&#x27;t really dissolve all the mascara I&#x27;ve applied in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the disposable wipes for my full face and the eyes and there was residual eye make up</li>
            <li> yeah, not bad</li>
            <li> I dab some on a q-tip and it cleans everything up really quickly.</li>
            <li> The mascara comes right off easily and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazing low cost product</li>
            <li> WORTH AT A TIME</li>
            <li> This is my favorite remover so far, i dont like oily ones (meant for water-proof stuff)</li>
            <li> I do not wear mascara very often, but when I do, I appreciate have this product to clean my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds of makeup remover and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Very oily and ran out so quick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really deep cleanse to get the make up off, more of a superficial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Even with that, I was still left with eye makeup on, and on top of that?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have rated it higher, but it stung my eyes.</li>
            <li> Does the job exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> The only downside is you need to use more of it than if it was oil-based</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear waterproof makeup at all, but still find I have to wipe &amp; wipe &amp; wipe with this product which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want to be doing around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put this in my bag and it would spill everywhere even if I close the top it would still open</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheap, and works with a little more effort</li>
            <li> No oily residue and leaves a nice, fresh and clean feeling behind.</li>
            <li> No irritation even though I&#x27;m sensitive, no residue, only pure makeup removing magic.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my wife&#x27;s eyes but it doesn&#x27;t remove her eye makeup very well either.</li>
            <li> This is a wonder product, and gentle on the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Requires too much tugging to ensure all eye make-up is removed.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful when you need to take off your mascara, not greasy or slimy.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but it works and it is cheaper than the department store brands.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> This Maybelline remover works so very well, removes all of my makeup</li>
            <li> The pink maybelline is better</li>
            <li> Did not work very well at all.</li>
            <li> Gentle on your eyes but gets every trace of non-waterproof eye makeup (and that&#x27;s all I wear) off with one swipe.  </li>
            <li> This is not irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> removes makeup faster and is gentle on skin</li>
            <li> However, I do not feel this works very well.  </li>
            <li> Wife has used this for a decade and loves it so much we have it on scheduled delivery.</li>
            <li> Other than that i love it, been using it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> It worked just fine, I just didn&#x27;t like how it made my eyes feel or how long is lasted.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous brands of eye make up remover over the years but stay true to this Maybelline Expert Eyes.  </li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was larger, it costs around 5$ at a store for one, I&#x27;d pay 7-9 if it was bigger, just so that i dont have to get it so often or so many of them at once.</li>
            <li> I have spent many years and a lot of money on eye make-up removers, and I consistently come back to this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for any person whether young or old because its very gentle on the eyes</li>
            <li> , even though it&#x27;s only about $3, I still felt like there wasn&#x27;t very much product.</li>
            <li> but yeah if you need a little make-up remover this works just fine.</li>
            <li> I used Lancome for a while, and honestly, this works better and is so much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I still had some of my Neutrogena eye makeup remover left, so I would use this most days and just deal with the stinging, and if I had dry  or sensitive eyes due to allergies on a certain day, I&#x27;d use the neutrogena eye makeup</li>
            <li> it would help keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> It completely removes the mascara.</li>
            <li> AND DOESNT REMOVE IT COMPLETELY</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ll use and it really works.</li>
            <li> but this was no different than applying straight water to the face.</li>
            <li> The current formula doesn&#x27;t work better than plain water.</li>
            <li> I buy several of these at a time because I seriously NEVER want to run out.</li>
            <li> Gets off all the black smudges in an instant, and cheap to boot.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, as the regular oil maybelline makeup remover works great.</li>
            <li> but I would rather use an eye make up remover that barely works than one that causes pain.</li>
            <li> It barely gets the product off, and I have to rub repeatedly to get it to work.</li>
            <li> One would assume that the company that made the mascara would design the makeup remover to work especially well on their own products but it still was tedious to get off.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you would expect from this brand for less than I can get it in the local big box.</li>
            <li> I tried this in the towelette formula and like it for travel as you don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling but the cloths are so large, it seems like a waste to me.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t loose it when you open it!</li>
            <li> I literally only use this to remove my other, oily make up remover after I&#x27;ve taken make up off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Removes well without oil but doesn&#x27;t seem to dry skin.</li>
            <li> and this one seems to get rid of even very stubborn make up (such as several, dried layers of mascara, thick black eye liner, eye shadow stick, even lipsticks and lip stains).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 15 years and have tried others if this was no available, but always go back to this one.  </li>
            <li> It is not an oil based make-up remover, so its effectiveness is minimal.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting (be careful the waterproof removal version did sting me...)</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> It is non irritating and really does the job.  .  </li>
            <li> It minimally removes the eye makeup and stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> This eye makeup remover works well with only a few strokes with a dampened cotton square.</li>
            <li> A few years back they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave any unpleasant residue, unlike the oil based version.</li>
            <li> This was NOT waterproof mascara, so this was pretty much useless.  </li>
            <li> This may work for Maybelline products or other &amp;#34;grocery store&amp;#34; make up brands</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the other reviewers...</li>
            <li> I could only use a small portion.</li>
            <li> I have tried all different eye makeup removers, either they are greasy or don&#x27;t remove enough eye makeup or leave mascara behind.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybelline Expert Eyes will kinda sorta remove this residue, but only with hard rubbing.</li>
            <li> Ugh - not worth it.</li>
            <li> While there is nothing wrong with this product, only buy it online if you can&#x27;t get it at your local store.</li>
            <li> Gets the yucky black remnants of the mascara off from the lids and under the lower lid.</li>
            <li> Works but have to rub a little harder then my usual brand.</li>
            <li> It has a little hole that you can squirt it out of~which equals less waste~</li>
            <li> i should since i do go to bed with that little make-up on</li>
            <li> I tried to cover my eye lids with the soaked cotton rounds for few seconds before rubbing but it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> One tip that I will share is to use the cotton squares or rounds instead of cotton balls and hold it against your eyes for a few seconds before wiping the make-up off.  </li>
            <li> This is only for washable makeup not waterproof makeup learned thr hard way still not a good buy</li>
            <li> I usually use Clinique Take the day off but had run out and needed a little bit before I could make it to the mall.</li>
            <li> Useless - doesn&#x27;t work on washable makeup, mineral makeup, matte or moist makeup - overall a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile and usually buy at drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Small and convenient to take。</li>
            <li> Not much better</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take off all my eye makeup no matter how hard I try.</li>
            <li> but it sucks when it comes to mascara and eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I had some mascara (NOT waterproof) on my delicate under-eye skin.  </li>
            <li> Its awful, doesn&#x27;t even take make off, cheaply made</li>
            <li> Bought the least expensive makeup remover &amp; it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is not a good makeup remover.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes greasy or leave remnants of mascara behind.  </li>
            <li> Everyone should at least try it before buying expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced burning or greasy feelings while using this.</li>
            <li> It works on eyes and lips, and is not greasy (YUCK!) or irritating.  </li>
            <li> I usually trust maybelline products but was extremely disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> it seems like im just using soapy water ill stick to my almond oil</li>
            <li> ( i think i need one for waterproof) unless im doing it wrong idk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Shipping makes buying it online a bad deal and you can&#x27;t use your Prime shipping for it.</li>
            <li> and i keep reading and hearing its bad for the skin somehow.</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I hate this makeup remover!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this make-up remover for years and I love it! I dab some on a q-tip and it cleans everything up really quickly. No oily residue and leaves a nice, fresh and clean feeling behind.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well even with maybelline makeup. Nothing seems to work as good as Mary Kay eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I literally only use this to remove my other, oily make up remover after I&#x27;ve taken make up off. It doesn&#x27;t really deep cleanse to get the make up off, more of a superficial cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product was so good and works very well I recommend this for any person whether young or old because its very gentle on the eyes</li>
            <li> Excellent eye make-up remover.  The ones with oil leave me blinking all night, stumbling my way to bed through bleary eyes.  This product quickly takes off liner and mascara without leaving a greasy residue!</li>
            <li> I have used this remover for many years and it works great.  I have never had any irritation or issues at all.</li>
            <li> While there is nothing wrong with this product, only buy it online if you can&#x27;t get it at your local store. Shipping makes buying it online a bad deal and you can&#x27;t use your Prime shipping for it.</li>
            <li> Best product for sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I like the ease of removing makeup with this product.  Doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes when.  It completely removes the mascara.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my wife&#x27;s eyes but it doesn&#x27;t remove her eye makeup very well either. She got Cetaphil Skin Cleanser recently and uses that for all her makeup and doesn&#x27;t even use this eye makeup remover anymore.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take makeup off</li>
            <li> Works but have to rub a little harder then my usual brand.</li>
            <li> Burns your eyes!! Works just fine but I would rather use an eye make up remover that barely works than one that causes pain.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for what it is I will order again and again and tell my best friends</li>
            <li> This is a wonder product, and gentle on the eyes.  Removes makeup nicely.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 15 years and have tried others if this was no available, but always go back to this one.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Got it for a really low price, but would not purchase it again.  Requires too much tugging to ensure all eye make-up is removed.  It is not an oil based make-up remover, so its effectiveness is minimal.</li>
            <li> Very helpful when you need to take off your mascara, not greasy or slimy. Leaves your skin feeling clean. Last words</li>
            <li> keeps my eye hydrated after removing my makeup.</li>
            <li> Works but it hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile and usually buy at drugstore.  It will be nice to have it shipped directly to my door as part of the subscribe and save program</li>
            <li> The product was delivered with the cap open and all the contents leaked out into the box. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> SO EASY TO BUY A YEARS WORTH AT A TIME</li>
            <li> Small and convenient to take。</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS NOW, I DO NOT USE IT FOR MAKEUP REMOVAL AT THE END OF THE DAY,,I USE IT FOR SPOT ERRORS WHILE APPLYING MY MAKEUP. EXCELLENT FOR A SLIP WITH THE MASCARA WAND,OR&lt;br /&gt;EYELINER SLIP UP.  CLEANS UP THE SPOT IMMEDIATELY W/O ANY OIL OR GREASE MAKING IT EASY TO REAPPLY AGAIN. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but it works and it is cheaper than the department store brands.</li>
            <li> This product did not remove waterproof mascara; I discarded it after one use.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as Mary Kay&#x27;s but it&#x27;s cheap, and works with a little more effort</li>
            <li> This is probably the 6th bottle I&#x27;ve ordered over the years.  Gets the yucky black remnants of the mascara off from the lids and under the lower lid.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting (be careful the waterproof removal version did sting me...) and it really works.</li>
            <li> This product is able to completely clean lashes without rubbing too, no matter how loaded was the makeup. .. Ah! And it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye makeup remover for years and I&#x27;m happy to see it&#x27;s available on subscribe and save. Cheaper and convenient!</li>
            <li> This is not a good makeup remover. Need multiple applications and will not remove everything</li>
            <li> Might as well review one of my long-standing, best beauty products. I buy several of these at a time because I seriously NEVER want to run out. No oiliness after, gets all mascara and eye shadow off easily. Love this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  I like that it is not oily.  I like that I can subcribe and save.</li>
            <li> Amazing low cost product</li>
            <li> My wife is writing this review for me:  I have tried all different eye makeup removers, either they are greasy or don&#x27;t remove enough eye makeup or leave mascara behind.  This Maybelline remover works so very well, removes all of my makeup, doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes greasy or leave remnants of mascara behind.  It even removes waterproof mascara.  I used Lancome for a while, and honestly, this works better and is so much less expensive.  Everyone should at least try it before buying expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I do not wear mascara very often, but when I do, I appreciate have this product to clean my lashes.  It is soothing as well as cleansing.</li>
            <li> I (Ross&#x27; wife) bought this be I use the new Maybelline mascara which is awesome but it&#x27;s like trying to remove tar from your eyelashes. One would assume that the company that made the mascara would design the makeup remover to work especially well on their own products but it still was tedious to get off. I gave up and went back to coconut oil to remove it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous brands of eye make up remover over the years but stay true to this Maybelline Expert Eyes.  I can&#x27;t use the oily ones as they bother my eyes.  For a non-oil based remover, this works excellent.  I tried this in the towelette formula and like it for travel as you don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling but the cloths are so large, it seems like a waste to me.  They work just as good however.  I think I&#x27;ll just stick to this from now on.</li>
            <li> Works well and does not irritate my eyes.  This is my go-to eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many, many years and it&#x27;s great.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and does a great job taking mascara off.</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes and my daughter&#x27;s eyes. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> TAKES FOREVER TO REMOVIE THE MAKE UP AND DOESNT REMOVE IT COMPLETELY :((</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to remove foundation Eyeshadows and powder and things like that but it sucks when it comes to mascara and eyeliner. The pink maybelline is better but I just don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid eye make-up remover I&#x27;ve found so far, and it&#x27;s conveniently cheap, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about how much I use. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I hate this makeup remover!!!!! IT STUNG MY EYES WHEN I WOULD USE IT TO REMOVER MASCARA OR EYELINER ON MY WATERLINE!! I usually trust maybelline products but was extremely disappointed with this one. Save your money. I don&#x27;t recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This oil free make up remover is for mascara that is NOT waterproof. This product is great and works as expected. The size is perfect for traveling as it&#x27;s under 4oz and has a screw top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If you are trying to remove waterproof mascara make sure you get the right stuff.)</li>
            <li> I love this product because is not oily. It removes the make up really good. Just make sure you use it with cotton. It does not work properly with facial tissue like Kleenex.</li>
            <li> it is not for water proof make ups.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup. I wear Revlon Colorstay eyeliner above my upper lashes, but do not use it below my eyes at all. Soap removes all of my makeup, but somehow a bit of Revlon Colorstay residue gets under my bottom lashes. This is the only thing I use makeup remover for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline Expert Eyes will kinda sorta remove this residue, but only with hard rubbing. I have to use cotton pads to remove most of it, and then a Q-tip to get the rest. I&#x27;m pretty sure soap would be just as effective. The rubbing leaves my bottom eyelid red and sore. Then my eyes start watering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear Revlon Colorstay, this product won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that for this product to be effective, you have to soak a cotton pad and press it on your eye for 20+ seconds for it to work. Even with that, I was still left with eye makeup on, and on top of that? My eyes sting and are bloodshot every time I use it. Ugh - not worth it.</li>
            <li> I added this on to an order because I needed about 3 more dollars of product to get free shipping. I think it was a very effective makeup remover. I just would put the product on a cotton pad and hold the cotton pad against my eye for about 15 seconds. All eye makeup would be removed, and if not, loosened so when I washed my face it would easily come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated it higher, but it stung my eyes. I still had some of my Neutrogena eye makeup remover left, so I would use this most days and just deal with the stinging, and if I had dry  or sensitive eyes due to allergies on a certain day, I&#x27;d use the neutrogena eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though it&#x27;s only about $3, I still felt like there wasn&#x27;t very much product. I couldn&#x27;t have used this for more than a month. It worked just fine, I just didn&#x27;t like how it made my eyes feel or how long is lasted. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes and you&#x27;re in a financial pinch, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds of makeup remover and this is by far my favorite. Doesn&#x27;t leave that oily feeling afterwards. It feels like water and does the job!</li>
            <li> This works ok, but not as good as Mary Kay&#x27;s product.  You have to rub more to get the make up all off.</li>
            <li> Does the job exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several oil-free eye make-up removers that actually remove make-up. Not this one. Won&#x27;t remove a thing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite remover so far, i dont like oily ones (meant for water-proof stuff) and this one seems to get rid of even very stubborn make up (such as several, dried layers of mascara, thick black eye liner, eye shadow stick, even lipsticks and lip stains). It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave any unpleasant residue, unlike the oil based version. The only downside is you need to use more of it than if it was oil-based, i use it every night, sometimes twice a day, so i run out every 2-3 weeks. I wish the bottle was larger, it costs around 5$ at a store for one, I&#x27;d pay 7-9 if it was bigger, just so that i dont have to get it so often or so many of them at once. Other than that i love it, been using it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> This removes eye makeup without leaving greasy feeling on eyelids.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well at all.</li>
            <li> I had some mascara (NOT waterproof) on my delicate under-eye skin.  I tried getting it off using this eye makeup remover over and over again rubbing the cotton swab back and forth.  It took forever.  This was NOT waterproof mascara, so this was pretty much useless.  I assume soap, water and a washcloth would have done a better job.  I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought the least expensive makeup remover &amp; it was a waste of money. I don&#x27;t wear waterproof makeup at all, but still find I have to wipe &amp; wipe &amp; wipe with this product which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want to be doing around your eyes. I&#x27;m taking the time to write a review to save others from wasting their time trying this crappy product.</li>
            <li> Really nice product...removes makeup without the oily residue.  Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline Expert Eye 100% Oil Free Eye Make Up Remover for over 5 years and find it is the absolute best product to remove stubborn non-permanent mascara and eye make up.  It is non irritating and really does the job.  .  By participating in your special shipping program I never have to worry about running out.  The only product I&#x27;ll use and it really works.</li>
            <li> This does not do it for me. I usually use Clinique Take the day off but had run out and needed a little bit before I could make it to the mall. I bought this as an inexpensive add on to get me through. You have to use a LOT of this to get your make up off. I wear MAC, UrbanDecay and colourpop and would go through 1/6 of the bottle in one day to scrub the make up off my face and my eyelids became red and irritated. This may work for Maybelline products or other &amp;#34;grocery store&amp;#34; make up brands but this was no different than applying straight water to the face.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye makeup remover.  I have been using this for more years than I care to admit.  Gentle on your eyes but gets every trace of non-waterproof eye makeup (and that&#x27;s all I wear) off with one swipe.  Can&#x27;t beat it.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years for removing my eye makeup. It is very easy to use and is soothing to your skin. The mascara comes right off easily and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work.. I used cotton rounds and soak them in this solution. I tried to cover my eye lids with the soaked cotton rounds for few seconds before rubbing but it just doesn&#x27;t work. It minimally removes the eye makeup and stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product nightly for many years, but it doesn&#x27;t really dissolve all the mascara I&#x27;ve applied in the morning.  It&#x27;s not as strong as the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; version, but I don&#x27;t like the residual effect of the oil-based makeup remover.  Perhaps Maybelline has changed the formula of this Expert Eyes item.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t sting eyes</li>
            <li> I agree with one of the other reviewers...you have to wipe and wipe, and it STILL doesn&#x27;t remove all the makeup! I guess I&#x27;ll have to try a more \\&quot;oily\\&quot; one.</li>
            <li> Does not work! Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I had been using the disposable wipes for my full face and the eyes and there was residual eye make up so I tried this.  Not much better but now I wash my face with dove soap and use this around my eyes as the face wipes caused some irritation.  This is not irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is only for washable makeup not waterproof makeup learned thr hard way still not a good buy it seems like im just using soapy water ill stick to my almond oil removes makeup faster and is gentle on skin</li>
            <li> Great product, have used for years.</li>
            <li> does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Great for regular mascara, not for the waterproof kind ( they have another version for that). Not oily, very light and works fast. I&#x27;ve tried other products and come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Best remover for a clean feel, no oily residue, the only one I have found that can be used before putting makeup on again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you would expect from this brand for less than I can get it in the local big box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put this in my bag and it would spill everywhere even if I close the top it would still open I could only use a small portion. In exception to that the product does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup.  like at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been the best for my eyes. I wear contacts and it doesn&#x27;t bother them. I&#x27;ve never experienced burning or greasy feelings while using this.</li>
            <li> works as it says it does, feels non-greasy and takes off waterproof mascara. good price, would buy again</li>
            <li> I was looking to switch all my products to oil free thinking it would help keep my skin clear.  However, I do not feel this works very well.  It doesn&#x27;t take off all my eye makeup no matter how hard I try.</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover ever.  Won&#x27;t use anything else. Removes well without oil but doesn&#x27;t seem to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Frankly, it isn&#x27;t a good makeup remover. It barely gets the product off, and I have to rub repeatedly to get it to work. Disappointing, as the regular oil maybelline makeup remover works great. I will not be purchasing this one again.</li>
            <li> This eye makeup remover works well with only a few strokes with a dampened cotton square. It does not contain mineral oil, which puffs up the eye area and would create more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have spent many years and a lot of money on eye make-up removers, and I consistently come back to this product.  It works on eyes and lips, and is not greasy (YUCK!) or irritating.  One tip that I will share is to use the cotton squares or rounds instead of cotton balls and hold it against your eyes for a few seconds before wiping the make-up off.  This is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Very oily and ran out so quick. NExt time, I would buy the generic brand over name.</li>
            <li> A few years back they changed the formula. It used to be *the best* and would remove any eye makeup gently. The current formula doesn&#x27;t work better than plain water. It&#x27;s so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Its awful, doesn&#x27;t even take make off, cheaply made</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> Awful!  Years ago I us.ed this and loved it, now not so much.  Threw it away.</li>
            <li> Wife has used this for a decade and loves it so much we have it on scheduled delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Maybelline product for many years; no complaints. Better than most higher-priced eye makeup removers; why pay more?</li>
            <li> I had not tried this brand of remover before, and it&#x27;s about the same as others I have tried.  I have found out it is important to rinse your eyes with water after using eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This works good but the Clean Express Remover works better.</li>
            <li> Useless - doesn&#x27;t work on washable makeup, mineral makeup, matte or moist makeup - overall a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for almost twenty years, and it works just as well as it always has. No irritation even though I&#x27;m sensitive, no residue, only pure makeup removing magic. Gets off all the black smudges in an instant, and cheap to boot.</li>
            <li> This is the best at removing Mascara/coverup makeup. Not oily at all and does&#x27;nt irritate the eyes. That&#x27;s important because I wear contacts!</li>
            <li> I usually use Clinique makeup remover, but this stuff, is great! There was an Amazon coupon to it, so it was a couple of bucks, so why not?  I used a cotton pad, and I have to say this stuff is really great! I love that when it didn&#x27;t get into my eyes (always happens) it didn&#x27;t burn or hurt...it removes all the makeup in a couple of swipes. I also LOVE the cap!! It has a little hole that you can squirt it out of~which equals less waste~ and it&#x27;s a flip top cap, so you can&#x27;t loose it when you open it! I think I have found a new makeup remover!! :)</li>
            <li> This is a go to. Easy on the eyes and gets the job done while not breaking the pockets. I subscribed for auto delivery so I get a discount!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up.. just mascara and eyeliner so I didn&#x27;t think I needed this but I got it just because i felt it i should since i do go to bed with that little make-up on and i keep reading and hearing its bad for the skin somehow. so yeah i got and its alright, it gets most of what i have on my eyes off, but not all ( i think i need one for waterproof) unless im doing it wrong idk. but yeah if you need a little make-up remover this works just fine. No itchiness, no irritation, no blurred vision (obvs don&#x27;t rub it into your eyeballs) and i always rinse it off. its also convenient which is the No.1 thing for me. I love Maybelline so yeah, not bad</li>
