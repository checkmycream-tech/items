            <li>But it&#x27;s rather a nice air refresher to me than a perfume.(just because the scent is not my type, I was expecting some very sweet scent.)</li>

            <li>The scent is so nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>and there is a pocket mirror as a gift from the seller, sweet!</li>
            <li>I was so excited because I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Many perfumes have a cheap, sort of alcohol smell, and it smells cheap.  </li>
            <li>Received A great big bottle of one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>It is so easy.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more soon!! :)</li>
            <li>Lucky you smell ls good but nothing to go wild about, well not on me anyway!!!!</li>
            <li>I constantly receive compliments on the smell, and the bottle is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Lucky you have always been my favorite scent, they stop selling it at store</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li>This is the very best price I have found for such a large bottle.  </li>
            <li>Huge bottle.</li>
            <li>and the container is somehow cheap.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped the item extremely fast, and this bottle is huge- definitely not a travel size, but perfect for the house.  </li>
            <li>the only great thing about this perfume.</li>
            <li>I have to agree this is a huge bottle for the price and with the light scent it is definately wearable.</li>
            <li>It is great for daily wear and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Great price for a big 6oz plus bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light flowery scent with maybe a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and it&#x27;s the kind of scent you can wear everyday.</li>
            <li>I love this light crisp scent.</li>
            <li>okay, when you first spray it, it smells like hairspray.</li>
            <li>The smell was  unique  and  indescribable.</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I came across this product.</li>
            <li>I keep this in its original box away from sunlight and use it as my work wear frag.</li>
            <li>Sexy, not too strong, and maintained a sort of elegance, yet not pretentious.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was huge and smells exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance so much.  </li>
            <li>EDT Spray has a sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>(it really is just a heavy glass bottle), but all in all, its an awesome buy!</li>
            <li>My mom loves lucky you perfume .  </li>
            <li>Lucky You by LB 200ml 6.8Oz</li>
            <li>I love this smell, it&#x27;s got a soft sweet smell and clean smell too.</li>
            <li>(well honestly I forgot to write a review)  but this hugh bottle is still going strong after this long.  </li>
            <li>It really is a pretty huge bottle of perfume.  </li>
            <li>I was overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>The scent was like freshly grown flowers full of youthful passion.</li>
            <li>I used to wear YSL&#x27;s \\&quot;Young,Sexy,Lovely\\&quot; or Christian Dior&#x27;s \\&quot;Miss Dior\\&quot;(EDToilette,not EDParfum), but one day when I was in supermarket, there was a \\&quot;lucky you\\&quot; sample, and I do love its scent!</li>
            <li>I was really looking for a more sultry, smokier fragrance (I generally lean more towards that end of the scent spectrum anyway), but just got this on a whim because of the Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to come as the spray or something, but it came exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>Product was of great quality and exactly what was expected!</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle of the perfume</li>
            <li>but once I opened the box it was definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just perfect for middle aged women.</li>
            <li>It is definately worth the price.</li>
            <li>Fresh and floral feminine perfume, a must buy.</li>
            <li>Ordrered and shipped quickly and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly and efficiently and the company included extra free perfume samples.</li>
            <li>I checked other places and it was a good bit higher than this 6.8 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle of Lucky You perfume and</li>
            <li>this is the right stuff, not fake.</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Kind of like citrus + flowers + clean laundry, but just a little bit spicy and smoky.</li>
            <li>Was very surpised how fast I recived this, and so close to christmas!!</li>
            <li>Huge bottle and great price .....wasnt able to use it long though due to neighbor stealing it after only 4 uses!</li>
            <li>This one only stays mostly a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume that she wears daily.  </li>
            <li>I used this back in school, after a trip to a store that had it my husband fell in love with it</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find the same size bottle for the price since then and because of this, my only regret is not buying more than two when I did find this deal.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>and well worth the money the seller is now asking, but still very upsetting to find the price has went up so much.</li>
            <li>But the price is low, too, it&#x27;s a good purchase overall.</li>
            <li>Perfume is mainly used as a pheromone to attract men, right?  </li>
            <li>i had purchased tis bottle along wit a 3.4oz other one i was thinking i was getting a great deal they both arrived same day</li>
            <li>She used to wear Chanel 19 and says this is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how large the bottle really was.</li>
            <li>The scent was very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably get guilted about how much you paid, which wasn&#x27;t much from Amazon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very floral, smells like summer or spring time flower.</li>
            <li>I thought because of the price that it wasn&#x27;t the real bottle of \\&quot;Lucky\\&quot; perfume but a knock off of some sort.</li>
            <li>2go by and still gross cheap smell</li>
            <li>no you&#x27;re guaranteed the real thing</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I purchased the larger bottle because of the price and the free amazon prime delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a Hugh bottle and is an excellent blind buy for that young lady trying to grow up.</li>
            <li>Lucky in general is a yummy smell....</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like spritzy scents like this, but it somehow smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the exact product that i was looking for, and the price is completely unbeatable anywhere else in stores or online.</li>
            <li>Great price was the real scent and not a water down fake from most distributors.</li>
            <li>jus stick 2spending a lil more for a lil less @walmart or target wherever its sold</li>
            <li>She knew she was getting a bottle of Lucky You, but didn&#x27;t think she was opening it at the time, because the box was so big.  </li>
            <li>If you know anyone that likes this particular scent, this will go over well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but I definitely recommend trying out a sample size before you spend money on this giant bottle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Saving money was a plus, but when I got the perfume, I was pleasently surprised!!</li>
            <li>This is a great soft scent, that lasts a lot longer than other more expensive scents.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall for this product is the spray is quite large as well, so a lot of product comes out at once, but I really don&#x27;t care too much.</li>
            <li>I love~ sweet,soft,crisp...and last for a long time~       </li>
            <li>The price is amazing; I bought this eight months ago and still have far over half a bottle left.</li>
            <li>From reviewing the scent in my head, I say it&#x27;s perfect for women in their late 20&#x27;s to late 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This kind of smells like baby powder, but not really in a good way.</li>
            <li>Really clean fresh scent is a must for anyone who loves that crisp sharp everyday scent</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried it before, I would get a little bottle first and try the smell, because it&#x27;s a huge bottle and it last forever.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cologne and you can&#x27;t hardly find it in stores around here</li>
            <li>Not t0o old lady and not t0o young kid</li>
            <li>I received it in a timely matter and it was well worth the money i spent on it.</li>
            <li>Wish the \\&quot;lucky you\\&quot; could last as long as the Guerlain one.</li>
            <li>so I priced it several places and locally and found more ounces for less money on your site.    </li>
            <li>arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume of all time and it is fairly expensive especially for the large size bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased this purchase this exact same fragrance at a perfume shop and paid $25 for half the size of this bottle.</li>
            <li>I never expected it to be that big.</li>

            <li> VERY fast delivery &amp; packaged very safely!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s rather a nice air refresher to me than a perfume.(just because the scent is not my type, I was expecting some very sweet scent.)</li>
            <li> Great shipping price and so fast!  </li>
            <li> The scent is very light.</li>

            <li> She has worn it for years, and always smells lovely.</li>
            <li> We were both well pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> The price is much better than in the stores too</li>
            <li> Overall a great experience !</li>
            <li> So do guys :)</li>
            <li> but as soon as im done i will order more</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> The price is right and my wife loved it.</li>
            <li> The price was very cheap &amp; the shipping was free.</li>
            <li> On top of that I received it in quick time!</li>
            <li> The scent is so nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> and there is a pocket mirror as a gift from the seller, sweet!</li>
            <li> I was so excited because I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Many perfumes have a cheap, sort of alcohol smell, and it smells cheap.  </li>
            <li> Received A great big bottle of one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> It is so easy.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more soon!! :)</li>
            <li> Lucky you smell ls good but nothing to go wild about, well not on me anyway!!!!</li>
            <li> I constantly receive compliments on the smell, and the bottle is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Lucky you have always been my favorite scent, they stop selling it at store</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li> This is the very best price I have found for such a large bottle.  </li>
            <li> Huge bottle.</li>
            <li> and the container is somehow cheap.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped the item extremely fast, and this bottle is huge- definitely not a travel size, but perfect for the house.  </li>
            <li> the only great thing about this perfume.</li>
            <li> I have to agree this is a huge bottle for the price and with the light scent it is definately wearable.</li>
            <li> It is great for daily wear and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Great price for a big 6oz plus bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light flowery scent with maybe a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and it&#x27;s the kind of scent you can wear everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this light crisp scent.</li>
            <li> okay, when you first spray it, it smells like hairspray.</li>
            <li> The smell was  unique  and  indescribable.</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I came across this product.</li>
            <li> I keep this in its original box away from sunlight and use it as my work wear frag.</li>
            <li> Sexy, not too strong, and maintained a sort of elegance, yet not pretentious.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was huge and smells exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance so much.  </li>
            <li> EDT Spray has a sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> (it really is just a heavy glass bottle), but all in all, its an awesome buy!</li>
            <li> My mom loves lucky you perfume .  </li>
            <li> Lucky You by LB 200ml 6.8Oz</li>
            <li> I love this smell, it&#x27;s got a soft sweet smell and clean smell too.</li>
            <li> (well honestly I forgot to write a review)  but this hugh bottle is still going strong after this long.  </li>
            <li> It really is a pretty huge bottle of perfume.  </li>
            <li> I was overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> The scent was like freshly grown flowers full of youthful passion.</li>
            <li> I used to wear YSL&#x27;s \\&quot;Young,Sexy,Lovely\\&quot; or Christian Dior&#x27;s \\&quot;Miss Dior\\&quot;(EDToilette,not EDParfum), but one day when I was in supermarket, there was a \\&quot;lucky you\\&quot; sample, and I do love its scent!</li>
            <li> I was really looking for a more sultry, smokier fragrance (I generally lean more towards that end of the scent spectrum anyway), but just got this on a whim because of the Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to come as the spray or something, but it came exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> Product was of great quality and exactly what was expected!</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle of the perfume</li>
            <li> but once I opened the box it was definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just perfect for middle aged women.</li>
            <li> It is definately worth the price.</li>
            <li> Fresh and floral feminine perfume, a must buy.</li>
            <li> Ordrered and shipped quickly and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and efficiently and the company included extra free perfume samples.</li>
            <li> I checked other places and it was a good bit higher than this 6.8 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> Large bottle of Lucky You perfume and</li>
            <li> this is the right stuff, not fake.</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Kind of like citrus + flowers + clean laundry, but just a little bit spicy and smoky.</li>
            <li> Was very surpised how fast I recived this, and so close to christmas!!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle and great price .....wasnt able to use it long though due to neighbor stealing it after only 4 uses!</li>
            <li> This one only stays mostly a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume that she wears daily.  </li>
            <li> I used this back in school, after a trip to a store that had it my husband fell in love with it</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to find the same size bottle for the price since then and because of this, my only regret is not buying more than two when I did find this deal.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> and well worth the money the seller is now asking, but still very upsetting to find the price has went up so much.</li>
            <li> But the price is low, too, it&#x27;s a good purchase overall.</li>
            <li> Perfume is mainly used as a pheromone to attract men, right?  </li>
            <li> i had purchased tis bottle along wit a 3.4oz other one i was thinking i was getting a great deal they both arrived same day</li>
            <li> She used to wear Chanel 19 and says this is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how large the bottle really was.</li>
            <li> The scent was very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably get guilted about how much you paid, which wasn&#x27;t much from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very floral, smells like summer or spring time flower.</li>
            <li> I thought because of the price that it wasn&#x27;t the real bottle of \\&quot;Lucky\\&quot; perfume but a knock off of some sort.</li>
            <li> 2go by and still gross cheap smell</li>
            <li> no you&#x27;re guaranteed the real thing</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I purchased the larger bottle because of the price and the free amazon prime delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a Hugh bottle and is an excellent blind buy for that young lady trying to grow up.</li>
            <li> Lucky in general is a yummy smell....</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like spritzy scents like this, but it somehow smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product that i was looking for, and the price is completely unbeatable anywhere else in stores or online.</li>
            <li> Great price was the real scent and not a water down fake from most distributors.</li>
            <li> jus stick 2spending a lil more for a lil less @walmart or target wherever its sold</li>
            <li> She knew she was getting a bottle of Lucky You, but didn&#x27;t think she was opening it at the time, because the box was so big.  </li>
            <li> If you know anyone that likes this particular scent, this will go over well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but I definitely recommend trying out a sample size before you spend money on this giant bottle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Saving money was a plus, but when I got the perfume, I was pleasently surprised!!</li>
            <li> This is a great soft scent, that lasts a lot longer than other more expensive scents.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall for this product is the spray is quite large as well, so a lot of product comes out at once, but I really don&#x27;t care too much.</li>
            <li> I love~ sweet,soft,crisp...and last for a long time~       </li>
            <li> The price is amazing; I bought this eight months ago and still have far over half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> From reviewing the scent in my head, I say it&#x27;s perfect for women in their late 20&#x27;s to late 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This kind of smells like baby powder, but not really in a good way.</li>
            <li> Really clean fresh scent is a must for anyone who loves that crisp sharp everyday scent</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried it before, I would get a little bottle first and try the smell, because it&#x27;s a huge bottle and it last forever.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne and you can&#x27;t hardly find it in stores around here</li>
            <li> Not t0o old lady and not t0o young kid</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely matter and it was well worth the money i spent on it.</li>
            <li> Wish the \\&quot;lucky you\\&quot; could last as long as the Guerlain one.</li>
            <li> so I priced it several places and locally and found more ounces for less money on your site.    </li>
            <li> arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time and it is fairly expensive especially for the large size bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this purchase this exact same fragrance at a perfume shop and paid $25 for half the size of this bottle.</li>
            <li> I never expected it to be that big.</li>
            <li> One reviewer said it&#x27;s not \\&quot;old Lady smell\\&quot; and it certainly is not.</li>
            <li> The size of this bottle blew me away, For under 30.00 dollars delivered and something I adore and don&#x27;t have to hunt down, WOW!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too long on my skin..</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it as long as they keep making it</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and it&#x27;s much larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> A few years later I heard her mention</li>
            <li> It did take a few extra days than I expected to get it</li>
            <li> I recieved the package soon enough, and it was exactly as I expected it to be, if not better.</li>
            <li> Only wish it stayed a little longer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product several times on amazon and paid no more than $20, now I look for it again to buy and see price has risen to almost $60.</li>
            <li> Other thought:</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use any other perfume now.  </li>
            <li> The 6.8 oz bottle should last me for at least two years and Amazon&#x27;s price was less than other online perfume sales companies...</li>
            <li> you have to wait like 30seconds for it to claim down and settle on ur skin</li>
            <li> so I would suggest just driving down to Target or something like that and testing the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Just do half a squirt.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not sweet, but if you like floral you&#x27;ll like this</li>
            <li> Personally this fragrance is not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> All I do is look it up, submit my order and wait for a few days</li>
            <li> My 24 y.o. daughter wears this year round.</li>
            <li> The one in supermarket is too small</li>
            <li> ( so it will be too hard to remove the dust on it...and low-quality feel...        </li>
            <li> at least u</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at describing smells</li>
            <li> It goes well with summer, winter, fall, and spring clothes, whether they&#x27;re dressy or casual.</li>
            <li> Needless to say she goes through a lot of it!  </li>
            <li> Will still be buying, but with a :(</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my fav perfume.. IThis is a great size for the price.... I even bought one from my friend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product several times on amazon and paid no more than $20, now I look for it again to buy and see price has risen to almost $60. Yes its almost 7oz. and well worth the money the seller is now asking, but still very upsetting to find the price has went up so much. Will still be buying, but with a :(</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 10 years now!! This was a great deal as well for the perfume so I jumped on it! Thank for the fast and speedy service and the great product!!!</li>
            <li> arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what i expected. in the box and wrapped.</li>
            <li> I used to work with this girl that I had a MASSIVE crush on (Still do) and she always smelled so good.  The scent was very pleasing.  Sexy, not too strong, and maintained a sort of elegance, yet not pretentious.  Perfect.  A few years later I heard her mention she loved Lucky You in passing, and her birthday was coming up, so I ordered a bottle.  When I took a whiff, the scent took me back in time to the days she and I used to work together.  This scent sticks with you.  Truly amazing.  Many perfumes have a cheap, sort of alcohol smell, and it smells cheap.  Not an attractive smell.  This one is top of the line.  Perfume is mainly used as a pheromone to attract men, right?  Well, as a man I can tell you that I have yet to find a sexier scent.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Lucky You for years and this is the best price anywhere--plus free shipping!  The scent is so nice and fresh. Love it!  One reviewer said it&#x27;s not \\&quot;old Lady smell\\&quot; and it certainly is not. I get a lot of compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this.</li>
            <li> The price is right and my wife loved it. She used to wear Chanel 19 and says this is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light. But it&#x27;s rather a nice air refresher to me than a perfume.(just because the scent is not my type, I was expecting some very sweet scent.) and the container is somehow cheap. But the price is low, too, it&#x27;s a good purchase overall. and there is a pocket mirror as a gift from the seller, sweet!</li>
            <li> Received A great big bottle of one of my favorite scents. Just as described. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t last too long on my skin..but maybe it&#x27;s just me?</li>
            <li> This was a Very good sale item, an it arrived so quickly! Great for every day use, scent is light and flowery. Huge bottle. Was packaged nice and neat</li>
            <li> The 6.8 oz bottle should last me for at least two years and Amazon&#x27;s price was less than other online perfume sales companies...so just added on to an already existing order and BAM no shipping either!!!</li>
            <li> Was very surpised how fast I recived this, and so close to christmas!! Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  This is a great soft scent, that lasts a lot longer than other more expensive scents.  The seller shipped the item extremely fast, and this bottle is huge- definitely not a travel size, but perfect for the house.  By the smaller size for the road.  The price?  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle and great price .....wasnt able to use it long though due to neighbor stealing it after only 4 uses!</li>
            <li> I bought it by a chance. I used to wear YSL&#x27;s \\&quot;Young,Sexy,Lovely\\&quot; or Christian Dior&#x27;s \\&quot;Miss Dior\\&quot;(EDToilette,not EDParfum), but one day when I was in supermarket, there was a \\&quot;lucky you\\&quot; sample, and I do love its scent! Sort of close to YSL or Miss Dior...flory aroma...The one in supermarket is too small so I went home to search on Amazon. To my big surprise, it has 6.8oz product and with such an unbeatable price!!! Great!    Pros:just the scent I love~ sweet,soft,crisp...and last for a long time~       Great great huge bottle with great great cheap price~    cons: I don&#x27; like its cap...it&#x27;s made of rubber:( so it will be too hard to remove the dust on it...and low-quality feel...        Only several days after I bought it, Amazon changes price from 21.18 to 20.81,oh...    Other thought: This is the best best best parfum you can ever have as long as you&#x27;re not a fanatical brand-name pursuer...</li>
            <li> This was given as a Christmas present, and went over quite well.  She knew she was getting a bottle of Lucky You, but didn&#x27;t think she was opening it at the time, because the box was so big.  It really is a pretty huge bottle of perfume.  If you know anyone that likes this particular scent, this will go over well.  You&#x27;ll probably get guilted about how much you paid, which wasn&#x27;t much from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle of the perfume my daughter asks for about once a year.  Came in timely and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for a more sultry, smokier fragrance (I generally lean more towards that end of the scent spectrum anyway), but just got this on a whim because of the Prime shipping. I usually don&#x27;t like spritzy scents like this, but it somehow smells amazing. Kind of like citrus + flowers + clean laundry, but just a little bit spicy and smoky. I wish the packaging was a tad easier to handle though (it really is just a heavy glass bottle), but all in all, its an awesome buy!</li>
            <li> this is the right stuff, not fake. It is a great price and a great buy. Very nice smell. If you&#x27;ve never tried it before, I would get a little bottle first and try the smell, because it&#x27;s a huge bottle and it last forever. Great smell. Great Buy</li>
            <li> nice smell but once you put it on smell is gone within minutes would not but this ever again</li>
            <li> What a great deal. Lucky in general is a yummy smell.... with out a doubt. The size of the bottle is awesome! It did take a few extra days than I expected to get it but once I opened the box it was definitely worth the wait. I wont need to buy another bottle for a while but with the price and the amazing deal(size) I will def be purchasing it again through Amazon... there needs to be more deals like this one</li>
            <li> Great! And the price is very reasonable. Wish the \\&quot;lucky you\\&quot; could last as long as the Guerlain one. This one only stays mostly a day. But anyways... still smells great! Love it</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to come as the spray or something, but it came exactly as pictured! i was soooo happy! can not believe this is such a low price. ITS MY FAVV&lt;3 thank you sooo much for a great deal! :D</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of this, it smells okay, when you first spray it, it smells like hairspray. you have to wait like 30seconds for it to claim down and settle on ur skin then it smells good..it&#x27;s very floral, smells like summer or spring time flower. it&#x27;s not sweet, but if you like floral you&#x27;ll like this</li>
            <li> It was a  wonderful aroma for a perfume. The smell was  unique  and  indescribable.The scent was like freshly grown flowers full of youthful passion.Inside the box it came in,was a glass bottle with a rubber cap.I took the cap off and took one good smell of it. After that one sniff I was hooked. The sleek design of the bottle  definitely was&#x27;nt the only great thing about this perfume. It&#x27;s one of a kind. Not t0o old lady and not t0o young kid, it&#x27;s just perfect for middle aged women. From reviewing the scent in my head, I say it&#x27;s perfect for women in their late 20&#x27;s to late 50&#x27;s. Any one can have it but that&#x27;s just my  opinionated  age group. I got it as a gift for my step-mom. I&#x27;m not one to buying things I can&#x27;t wear or smell. But taking a Christmas risk was one of the things I considered. It turned out  magnificent. I truly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have to agree this is a huge bottle for the price and with the light scent it is definately wearable. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best price for this perfume by far.  The 3 oz bottle at WalMart was $25.  I checked other places and it was a good bit higher than this 6.8 oz bottle.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> great smell very fresh  and a good summer fragrance.  A ton of product for the price.  Only wish it stayed a little longer!</li>
            <li> I thought because of the price that it wasn&#x27;t the real bottle of \\&quot;Lucky\\&quot; perfume but a knock off of some sort. It&#x27;s the real deal! Thank you AMAZON for your great prices!  :)</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely matter and it was well worth the money i spent on it. I have been a lucky user for many years and this the best deal I have ever gotten for a bottle of perfume. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Lucky you have always been my favorite scent, they stop selling it at store and I was glad I found it here. I&#x27;ve been ordering this product for years. I&#x27;ve never had a problem, always get it on time. and its an awesome price :)</li>
            <li> this smells great bought it for the wife and she wears it well, leaves a lingering sweet presence and allows me to daydream in her scent.....Baby where you at</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and efficiently and the company included extra free perfume samples.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume that she wears daily.  Needless to say she goes through a lot of it!  This is the very best price I have found for such a large bottle.  I was pleased with the quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li> I started to purchase this by chance, I always wore Anne Klein, then it was dicontined and costly if I did find it. I LOVE this scent, I went by the description of ingredients and took a chance. The size of this bottle blew me away, For under 30.00 dollars delivered and something I adore and don&#x27;t have to hunt down, WOW! I love Amazon and it&#x27;s products. Thank you for a deal that makes me happy. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> You receive a 200ml bottle!  It will last years.  The smell is not too overpowering or underwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value.</li>
            <li> I used this back in school, after a trip to a store that had it my husband fell in love with it</li>
            <li> Lucky you smell ls good but nothing to go wild about, well not on me anyway!!!! May just keep it to wear around the house</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time and it is fairly expensive especially for the large size bottle. I will continue to buy it as long as they keep making it</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered! On top of that I received it in quick time! The bottle was huge and smells exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to! FANTASTIC PRICE!</li>
            <li> I recieved the package soon enough, and it was exactly as I expected it to be, if not better. I didn&#x27;t realize how large the bottle really was. It is definately worth the price. It smells great, and it&#x27;s the kind of scent you can wear everyday. It goes well with summer, winter, fall, and spring clothes, whether they&#x27;re dressy or casual.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife, because, I know that it&#x27;s one of her favorites. The price on Amazon was the best around, and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted.  Large bottle of Lucky You perfume and the price is the lowest I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.  Great shipping price and so fast!  Def recommend it!</li>
            <li> Item came as described, safe and fast shipping, and wonderful price! Love this perfume and bought this as a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> So this bottle is MASSIVE. The perfume smells amazing too. My husband got me a 1.6 oz bottle from Walmart, and he gave it to me. I was excited. He said that he wanted to check amazon and see if there was a cheaper one, before I opened it. We looked, and this 6.8 oz bottle was $5 cheaper than the 1.6 oz bottle at walmart. I was so excited because I absolutely love this perfume. The bottle is large, so it will last a long time. The only downfall for this product is the spray is quite large as well, so a lot of product comes out at once, but I really don&#x27;t care too much. Just do half a squirt. LOVE LOVE LOVE this present!</li>
            <li> This kind of smells like baby powder, but not really in a good way. It&#x27;s not horrible, but I definitely recommend trying out a sample size before you spend money on this giant bottle. (On the bright side, if you do like the scent, you&#x27;re getting a TON of it.)</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I came across this product. The price was very cheap &amp; the shipping was free. I purchased this purchase this exact same fragrance at a perfume shop and paid $25 for half the size of this bottle. Imagine my thoughts when I saw this product and the price. I had to get it. Oh yeah, I&#x27;ve always love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> This is my absolutely favorite scent. I do not wear anything else and ALWAYS get compliments on how good it smells. I have not been able to find the same size bottle for the price since then and because of this, my only regret is not buying more than two when I did find this deal. At any rate, as stated, this is a terrific scent.... not too woodsy and def not too flowery..... its amazing!!</li>
            <li> i had purchased tis bottle along wit a 3.4oz other one i was thinking i was getting a great deal they both arrived same day but once i sprayed this one i thought maybe u hav2 let it settle but i let over 1hr. 2go by and still gross cheap smell both bottles look authentic but upon closer inspection i noticed sum sort of particles floating jus stick 2spending a lil more for a lil less @walmart or target wherever its sold at least u no you&#x27;re guaranteed the real thing</li>
            <li> I tested this smell out at Target before deciding to buy it. The price is amazing; I bought this eight months ago and still have far over half a bottle left. I constantly receive compliments on the smell, and the bottle is beautiful. I&#x27;m not good at describing smells so I would suggest just driving down to Target or something like that and testing the fragrance. I know that I put it on every morning and the smell lasts until the end of the day; it&#x27;s also not an overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> Great price was the real scent and not a water down fake from most distributors. Really clean fresh scent is a must for anyone who loves that crisp sharp everyday scent</li>
            <li> This one of my favorite perfumes! It smells awesome! And this is the cheapest I have ever found a big bottle for</li>
            <li> My mom loves lucky you perfume .  She was very happy with this gift.  She has worn it for years, and always smells lovely.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law wanted this for Christmas so I priced it several places and locally and found more ounces for less money on your site.    We were both well pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this light crisp scent. I wear this daily and have for years and always get compliments. It is great for daily wear and not overpowering at all. And this price, What a deal....</li>
            <li> This is the exact product that i was looking for, and the price is completely unbeatable anywhere else in stores or online.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my fiance as a gift and she absolutely loves it!  She doesn&#x27;t use any other perfume now.  It&#x27;s fantastic!  Also, the perfume arrived in a timely manner and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> This delightful fragrance is a steal at $20.00 with free shipping.  I love this fragrance so much.  It lifts my mood when I put it on.  My fragrance for 2010 was Burberry London, forget that.  My fragrance for 2011 is Lucky You!!!!</li>
            <li> Best fragrance ever, I waited 5 years  before giving this review (well honestly I forgot to write a review)  but this hugh bottle is still going strong after this long.  I keep this in its original box away from sunlight and use it as my work wear frag. This is a Hugh bottle and is an excellent blind buy for that young lady trying to grow up. Fresh and floral feminine perfume, a must buy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne and you can&#x27;t hardly find it in stores around here anymore but now that I have found it here I will never go looking in town.  It is so easy.  All I do is look it up, submit my order and wait for a few days and it is delivered to my front door.  The price is much better than in the stores too so it is a win-win situation for me.</li>
            <li> Lucky You by LB 200ml 6.8Oz EDT Spray has a sweet scent.  I liked it but my boyfriend thought it was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Great product! Ordrered and shipped quickly and fast delivery! Very happy with this order! Product was of great quality and exactly what was expected! Overall a great experience !</li>
            <li> love it !! So do guys :)</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Birthday gift &amp; my Daughter LOVES LOVES LOVES IT!!!! Biggest bottle &amp; GREAT price! VERY fast delivery &amp; packaged very safely! Will definitely be buying more soon!! :)</li>
            <li> I recieved my perfume rather quickly, and I was very impressed with the size of the bottle for the price. Saving money was a plus, but when I got the perfume, I was pleasently surprised!! Wonderful communication on the sellers part.. I was overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> The description totally did not match the smell of the product. Personally this fragrance is not pleasant at all. It didn&#x27;t reflect the description at all.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe the price of this bottle, what a great buy! This bottle is lasting me forever. It&#x27;s the same thing you would buy in the store and I received a lot of coupons with my purchase also. MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price</li>
            <li> this smells great my husband loves it on me im almost done with it but as soon as im done i will order more</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great price for a big 6oz plus bottle.  Packaged well to protect the perfume. This is the best deal anywhere for this perfume. This is my 2nd order and will order again. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Was happy to find this size bottle this is my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> Great value for price paid. I shopped around and this was the best price around. I gave as a gift.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and it&#x27;s much larger than I expected. I purchased the larger bottle because of the price and the free amazon prime delivery. I never expected it to be that big. She won&#x27;t be running out of this perfume for a while. This was her birthday present and I think I delivered on it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> My 24 y.o. daughter wears this year round. She gets multiple compliments on it. I have worn it and received compliments (I&#x27;m &gt;50 y.o.). It&#x27;s a light flowery scent with maybe a hint of citrus. There may be an undertone of musk, but not enough to discern as such. For us, it seems to last without having to reapply through out the day. Has been a nice scent to share with my daughter (when she doesn&#x27;t take mine with her when she goes home).</li>
            <li> I love this smell, it&#x27;s got a soft sweet smell and clean smell too. I have had several bottles of it and I keep going back to it.</li>
