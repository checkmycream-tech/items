            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried lots of mascara, but this is my favorite,  </li>
            <li>and I both use this, mostly because we get it free with clinique bonus days.</li>
            <li>great eyelash mascara;  really love it; will buy only this brand</li>
            <li>The mascara wand has a Christmas tree shape which makes it extremely easy to apply and efficient in</li>
            <li>It stays put even if you have oily lids and still washes off easily when you want to remove it.</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>Fast service, love the mascara.</li>
            <li>The shipping was the only thing good, as in the fastness.</li>
            <li>it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that it tends to do the &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; thing as the day goes on - but it&#x27;s nice because it doesn&#x27;t irritate so tradeoffs are worth it.</li>
            <li>So far, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Super fast service and</li>
            <li>I also believe the product contains a higher quality of ingredients and considering it goes so close to the eyes</li>
            <li>I never use a full tube of mascara before it seems to clump on me--so far I haven&#x27;t had that problem with this one.</li>
            <li>I only used it because it was a free gift... would not recommend.</li>
            <li>I really miss this mascara as Clinique isn&#x27;t carrying it anymore and their replacement mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to give you the longer, separated lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this Clinique mascara and won&#x27;t buy any other.</li>
            <li>This particular retailer/seller was prompt in shipping and the product was what I was expecting to receive.</li>

            <li>Also, Clinique mascara is well tolerated by my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>This may be a few dollars more expensive, but in this instance it is well worth it to me!</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive eyes and this has not caused the normal irritation I get from other products.  </li>
            <li>I have used Clinique mascara for a long time, and no other mascara stands up to it.  </li>

            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t dry up like the others.</li>
            <li> i have very thin &amp; short eyelashes, but this mascara really makes them looks long and thick</li>
            <li> This mascara does not create long thick lashes and runs down your face if you get a drop of water on your eyes (that means tears, sweat, humidity)</li>
            <li> It also seemed to apply messy.</li>
            <li> It extends and thickens my lashes which have grown thin as I have aged.</li>
            <li> No problems with smudging, which is one of my worst complaints with most mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I normally love Clinique products but this one is horrible.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice-looking eye lash without being overly dramatic during the day.</li>
            <li> It has not &amp;#34;doubled&amp;#34; my lashes, and it clumps badly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for anyone who paid $20 for this.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Something in this mascara makes my eyes water and burn every time I used it, so I had to give it away. The formula and overall effect/look was okay, nothing special. It also seemed to apply messy. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> great eyelash mascara;  really love it; will buy only this brand</li>
            <li> The mascara wand has a Christmas tree shape which makes it extremely easy to apply and efficient in it&#x27;s coverage.  Also, Clinique mascara is well tolerated by my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome mascara! It extends and thickens my lashes which have grown thin as I have aged. This is my mascara for life</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I love this Clinique mascara and won&#x27;t buy any other. It stays put even if you have oily lids and still washes off easily when you want to remove it. I read some of the reviews and I think this is a standard size mascara (I&#x27;ve always purchased name-brand mascara and they are normally this size). I also believe the product contains a higher quality of ingredients and considering it goes so close to the eyes it is worth the price. This particular retailer/seller was prompt in shipping and the product was what I was expecting to receive.</li>
            <li> The best mascara so far, it doesn&#x27;t dry up like the others.</li>
            <li> I have used Clinique mascara for a long time, and no other mascara stands up to it.  It doesn&#x27;t clump and it seems to last a long time.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>

It provides a nice-looking eye lash without being overly dramatic during the day. I also have sensitive eyes and this has not caused the normal irritation I get from other products.  This may be a few dollars more expensive, but in this instance it is well worth it to me!</li>
            <li> Fast service, love the mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Lengthens and adds volume. No problems with smudging, which is one of my worst complaints with most mascara&#x27;s. Will by this line of mascara again and again.</li>
            <li> Used to be amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother and I both use this, mostly because we get it free with clinique bonus days. The quality has gone downhill. It has not &amp;#34;doubled&amp;#34; my lashes, and it clumps badly. The brush makes it a pain to apply, often smearing mascara on my eyelid and forehead.... Lasts a couple hours. It will run off at any sign of moisture, ie tears, rain. It flakes and gets into my eyes, and it gets all over my contact lenses,.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for anyone who paid $20 for this. I only used it because it was a free gift... would not recommend. Still on the search for the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> great stuff. one if my favorites!!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara. Only downside is that it tends to do the &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; thing as the day goes on - but it&#x27;s nice because it doesn&#x27;t irritate so tradeoffs are worth it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with delivery time and the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about the mascara I use. So far, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered for my wife</li>
            <li> $20 for a sample size mascara is unreasonable. I don&#x27;t recall seeing that it was a sample size in the description of the product.</li>
            <li> I normally love Clinique products but this one is horrible. The shipping was the only thing good, as in the fastness. This mascara does not create long thick lashes and runs down your face if you get a drop of water on your eyes (that means tears, sweat, humidity) I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> AWESOME COLOR, NO ALLERGIES, NO CLUMPING!  Super fast service and this will be my mascara for life!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried lots of mascara, but this is my favorite,  i have very thin &amp; short eyelashes, but this mascara really makes them looks long and thick</li>
            <li> I really miss this mascara as Clinique isn&#x27;t carrying it anymore and their replacement mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to give you the longer, separated lashes.</li>
