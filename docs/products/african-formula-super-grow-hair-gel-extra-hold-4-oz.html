            <li> When I bought it I opened it up and noticed it looked like the consistency of a jar of thick grease and thought to myself this is just going to be mostly petroleum jelly and fragrance and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually grows my hair but certainly</li>
            <li> It has all the required nutrients I need without the use of other natural products on the market.</li>
            <li> probably the same reason I&#x27;ve purchased countless other hair products before, hoping it does what it says or live up to the commercial hype only to be let down.</li>
            <li> As long as it is sold I will definitely be a customer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the ingredients and for the purpose of smoothing my natural edges down.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long, so you wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing it in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Once dry you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the contents should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It lays my edges down all of 10 min, with a tie down prior to or without, same results.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only been growing my hair for less than three years.</li>
            <li> 1 week later I saw some slight breakage in areas in which I massage into my scalp and stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I use it along with coconut oil and my hair is already about a half inch down my back</li>
            <li> I am frustrated with the fact that I had to pay $9.38 for delivery for 2 African Formula Super Grow</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair sticky like other products.</li>
            <li> I still us it in conjunction with other products because of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I know I have about other hair products</li>
            <li> Works well with your hair a little damp and when its dry!  </li>
            <li> I use very little on my scalp in different spots, then massage it in with a round, rubber massager.</li>
            <li> It is not watered down or too oily...</li>
            <li> Not what I expected too small</li>
            <li> My hair is a coarse 3c4a very thick.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> How does someone pay $9.38 for delivery of these 2 small jars and get it delivered by USPS instead of UPS or FEDEX.  </li>
            <li> terrible product--super greasy and does not hold hair down--doesnt even seem to be a hair gel--seem more like a jar of grease</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s like a thick pomade.</li>
            <li> and i would know because I have the infamous cowlick edges</li>
            <li> Smells disgusting &amp; makes even curly hair flat.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a TERRIBLE hair cut!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet if this substance will really grow hair, but it is very good for my very dry, frizzy hair. It has made it more smooth and a little more manageable. The ingredients are so natural that you could eat them! There are no chemicals at all. I use very little on my scalp in different spots, then massage it in with a round, rubber massager. This way, the product goes onto my whole head. It does not make my hair sticky like other products. A little goes a long way, so the contents should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since january...its March 3rd and my hair has grown 4 inches...that&#x27;s a lot! Buy this product!</li>
            <li> I had gotten a TERRIBLE hair cut! And using this, grew my hair back nice and quick! Its also great for laying down your edges. I love it! Still use it!</li>
            <li> Smells disgusting &amp; makes even curly hair flat. Might be good for people&#x27;s edges. Especially with coarse hair. But it&#x27;s like a thick pomade. If you want extra hold. You need hair spray or gel over this. I&#x27;m having to throw mine out. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Love it!! My hair have grown and got so full using this product!!</li>
            <li> The product is great and does what it is suppose to do.  I am frustrated with the fact that I had to pay $9.38 for delivery for 2 African Formula Super Grow Hair Gel Extra Hold 4 oz jars.  How does someone pay $9.38 for delivery of these 2 small jars and get it delivered by USPS instead of UPS or FEDEX.  If you ask me I think I paid more for the product.  They have it advertised as $9.99 then charge you over priced delivery and use USPS.  $9.38 Delivery cost should be expedited next day delivery.</li>
            <li> terrible product--super greasy and does not hold hair down--doesnt even seem to be a hair gel--seem more like a jar of grease</li>
            <li> It makes my hair a bit shiny and thicker and the hold is natural and not greasy. Goodby frizz!  I&#x27;m not sure if it actually grows my hair but certainly no bad side effects</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the ingredients and for the purpose of smoothing my natural edges down.  My hair is a coarse 3c4a very thick.  It lays my edges down all of 10 min, with a tie down prior to or without, same results.  I still us it in conjunction with other products because of the ingredients.  I have not seen any new growth in the area that i use it in and i would know because I have the infamous cowlick edges and they are still cowlicked.</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent hold</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because it simply did not do anything at all for my hair.  Being that my hair is soft, it seemed to cause a lot of breakage. Just because it did not work for me does not mean it will not work for someone else.  I will not recommend nor purchase this product ever again.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product.  It is the only product that has my locs on point and I don&#x27;t need to add anything else.  I use it along with coconut oil and my hair is already about a half inch down my back and I&#x27;ve only been growing my hair for less than three years. It&#x27;s the best product you can buy for natural hair and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  It lasts long, so you wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing it in a hurry.  I wish they sold it all over so I can get it whenever I wanted, instead of having to purchase it online and wait. I&#x27;ve only seen it in New York other than getting it online.  It&#x27;s also great for laying your edges prostrate.  There&#x27;s no residue left in your hair and it&#x27;s not too greasy.  As long as it is sold I will definitely be a customer.</li>
            <li> The consistency is more like pomade instead of gel...and that is a huge plus for me!  It is not watered down or too oily...its just right!  I&#x27;m in love with the product!  Works well with your hair a little damp and when its dry!  No flakes!  PERFECT!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It washes out quickly and when I re-twist with it, it makes my hair very shiny and it holds my locs into place after I come up from the dryer without feeling greasy. I would buy again, but it will last you a while which is too great about it.</li>
            <li> This gel has been the best one I have ever used. The hold is not a crunchy hold. This product beats ECO  Styler by MILES!!,  My twists outs last for days without having to add more gel. My hair stays shiny unlike Eco.  This is a must have in my book.</li>
            <li> I love this for my Locs! It has a great hold as well as it keeps my Locs shiny! So far this is the best product I have used for my Locs and I have been locing my hair since 2006!</li>
            <li> Had to stop using it, the directions states to massage into scalp, 1 week later I saw some slight breakage in areas in which I massage into my scalp and stopped using it. My hair is in much better condition since I used other products to treat the breakage and I eliminated the product completely from my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> Since I started growing my locs 5 years ago, this is the only product I use for my hair. It has all the required nutrients I need without the use of other natural products on the market. I have recommended this product to a number of people and they have noticed the drastic change in their hair growth. My locs are currently down my back in length, thanks to this product. It is a gel, but it does not leave a residue like &amp;#34;traditional gels&amp;#34; leave on your hair. It also strenghthens, and moistens your hair in the process. I loveand swear by this product and for anyone willing to try it, you will never look back.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected too small</li>
            <li> Simply Some Good Stuff! There are many hair products out there that promise great ingredients for your hair but when you read the side of the bottle most of the ingredients are names I&#x27;ve never heard before. This product is a bit pricy but most defiantly worth every penny. I don&#x27;t know what made me buy this probably the same reason I&#x27;ve purchased countless other hair products before, hoping it does what it says or live up to the commercial hype only to be let down. Well this time I hit the jackpot! When I bought it I opened it up and noticed it looked like the consistency of a jar of thick grease and thought to myself this is just going to be mostly petroleum jelly and fragrance and a waste of money. Well what a wonderful surprise to find that this product is not greasy at all. It does NOT leave a film of grease coating the hair. Its not oily and it leaves no build up or flacks! I know you have heard this before cause I know I have about other hair products but this time take it from me it is true about this African Formula Super Grow Hair Gel. You just got to know how to use it. This gel is not like the over watery or over greasy gels we are all use to. This is SIMPLY SOME GOOD STUFF! lightly dampen your hair (lightly) and then take some of the product and rub it between your hands and then distribute on hair style your  hair as desired. This stuff defines the texture of your hair, conditions, and adds real healthy shine with real good ingredients.  Once dry you&#x27;ll be hooked. Say goodbye to pomade, gel, mouse etc.....  This is all you&#x27;ll need.  INGREDIENTS: Purified water, Wild Bee Huney, Coconut Oil, West African Shea Butter, Virgin Olive Oil, Basil, Safflower, and Peach Oils, Extracts of Peach Leaves, Birch, Coltsfoots, Horsetail, Calendula Blossoms, Rosemary, Onion Juice, Vegetable Proteins, Biotin, Allantoin, Panthenol, Natural Glycerin, Na-PCA, Vitamins A, B, C, &amp; E, Natural Preservatives and vegetable aroma  P.S. Thus far I have only experienced the African Formula Super Grow hair gel REGULAR HOLD and it holds perfectly not to hard and combs out easy. I have recommended this to a number of people with different textures of hair and they like it as well (curly, ethic curls, wavy). Men often look for no fuss products that work so don&#x27;t worry about any perfume smells there is none.  I recommend  product.</li>
