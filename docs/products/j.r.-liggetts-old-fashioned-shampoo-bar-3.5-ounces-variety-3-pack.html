    <ol>
            <li>i bought these as an alternative to the baking soda/vinegar lol!</li>
            <li>It is especially good for travel.  </li>
            <li>Bought my 4 best friends the 3 bar pack for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>the lather is great.  </li>
            <li>honestly, the best thing that&#x27;s happened to my hair.</li>
            <li>No frills, but my hair feels great</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still astonished with these great results and so happy.  </li>
            <li>Smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.  </li>
            <li>I love this variety in coconut oil based shampoos!  </li>
            <li>and I have beautiful, clean, shiny, and nourished hair.  </li>
            <li>the products are still amazing</li>
            <li>also each smells really nice.</li>
            <li>THESE SHAMPOO BARS ARE THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE FOUND THAT REALLY WORKS ON MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been this strong before!</li>
            <li>It smells good, but it makes my hair super oily, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with oily hair before.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the lather, love what it does to my hair</li>
            <li>I just wish that these bars lasted more than about 20 washes each.</li>
            <li>I also love the convenience and portability of the bar.  </li>
            <li>I have since purchased more and have promoted it&#x27;s use to family and friends.  </li>
            <li>Love these bars.</li>
            <li>I HAD TO KISS MANY FROGS</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE J.R. Liggett&#x27;s Shampoo Bar.  </li>
            <li>I love these  bars.</li>
            <li>but I love the tea tree one and the jojoba one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for more than 6 months</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>so I was astonished that my hair after shampooing and air dry, my hair looks and feels like healthy hair !!!  </li>
            <li>Nice lather, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>EASILY.  </li>
            <li>Packaging in fine condition.</li>
            <li>Fine quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>...don&#x27;t love how quickly they get used up.</li>
            <li>They all make a huge difference in texture, ridding the brillo pad feel and creating a must softer texture.</li>
            <li>but the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and thicker.</li>
            <li>his hair is still clean and not oily even weirder</li>
            <li>Just shampooed today and again, my hair is no longer dry and feels great.  </li>
            <li>the very first time i used it</li>
            <li>Got the hang of washing hair with bar pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so great, they&#x27;ve completely corrected the issues I was having with my unmanageable, frizzy curls that were both too dry and too greasy.</li>
            <li>Love this variety pack, especially the mint and jojoba one!</li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE TRYING THESE FOR THE FIRST TIME, DON&#x27;T GIVE UP AFTER THE FIRST TRY.  </li>
            <li>I got the variety set and tried the jojoba and peppermint first</li>
            <li>It is definitely different make sure you give it a real chance because it takes a while for your scalp to adapt.</li>
            <li>Now it dries quicker and is smooth and silky right away, no flat iron needed.</li>
            <li>Was able to use it to wash clothing, hair, and didn&#x27;t need conditioner even though my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>i really want to like these.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit of a sceptic but found this product to work wonders; really noticed a difference in my hair and beard.</li>
            <li>Has really helped my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li>and i love the minimal biodegradable ingredients</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient for air travel because of this bar formula instead of liquid.  </li>
            <li>I had about given up and had resorted to using either argon or coconut oil to make it look like real hair.  </li>
            <li>I should also mention that using a bar is so much easier than liquid shampoo...</li>
            <li>Be patient, this is just the transition from shampoos that are full of unpronounceable ingredients to a pure, organic, deep detoxifying  shampoo.  </li>
            <li>maybe, i&#x27;ve also used your bar with conditioner (trying to work my way down my hair is naturally very dry), and so far so good my hair is clean, and when i rinsed the shampoo out my hair squeeked.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does require me to use a conditioner because it makes my hair so clean, but I condition my hair anyway so no big deal.  </li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>and it looks like it will last a couple of more months before I&#x27;ll open one of the remaining two.</li>
            <li>Long story short thanks for a GREAT product i think you&#x27;ve found a new lifelong customer as we are about to order a bar for my mother too</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Now I just wash about 3 times per week with one of these shampoo bars, use a light conditioner once a week, and use argan oil as a detangler before I comb out my wet hair.</li>
            <li>No worries; it does lather like normal shampoo but doesn&#x27;t strip off the natural oil with detergent.</li>
            <li>I was really scared until i saw others reviews apparently</li>
            <li>all natural oils saponified....</li>
            <li>I AM 61 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>YOUR HAIR IS NOT USED TO &amp;#34;GOOD&amp;#34; NATURAL INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li>IT MAY FEEL A BIT LIKE &amp;#34;STRAW&amp;#34; BUT BELIEVE ME WHEN YOUR HAIR DRIES, IT WILL BE SOFT, SHINY AND MANAGEABLE.  </li>
            <li>i will say rubbing a bar on your hair is a bit weird at first, but i&#x27;m sure i will get used to that.</li>
            <li>The first shampoo I did not see a change -still very dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the last five years but nothing worked and my hair was like a dry old broom (my hair is quite long, and is very thick of fine texture).</li>
            <li>These shampoos don&#x27;t strip the natural oils necessary to maintain a well groomed, yet epic beard.</li>
            <li>i wish i had known that because now i feel like i have a residue in my hair and apparently to get it out</li>
            <li>i have only tried the argan and virgin coconut so far, after using this my hair became too waxy and cannot get rid of the buildup with blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>The first 2-3 shampoos your hair may feel heavy, not quite rinsed out.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have blonde, hair down to my neck, and I am a Caucasian man...</li>
            <li> I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF $ LOOKING FOR THE &amp;#34;HOLY GRAIL&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i let the wax on my hair and only towel dried my hair</li>
            <li> but apparently they dont work well if you have hard water.  </li>
            <li> could it be he was allergic to the other soaps he was using that was causing this well</li>
            <li> , my hair didn&#x27;t dry as fast and it became very thin and rubbery that i can pull my hair</li>
            <li> In the past, when I would dry my hair it would be frizzy and static-filled.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is a very small bar for the price, and will melt quickly if not kept in a soap dish that drains.  </li>
            <li> I was previously washing my hair 7-10 times per week and using shampoo, conditioner, argan oil, once a week hair masques, etc.</li>
            <li> A little awkward at first washing hair with a bar soap rather then a liquid.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend has always had extremely (think oil slick) oily hair</li>
            <li> I will give the hemp oil a try next and hope it suits my poor hair.</li>
            <li> I only use once every 3 days as a transition to no poo, but ill still use this once every week after, perhaps, a year transition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive shampoo forever, and now I probably won&#x27;t ever go back.  </li>
            <li> While the shipping was quite a tedious process because of the italian shipper....</li>
            <li> the argan soap is not suitable.</li>
            <li> we have hard water</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand negative reviews.</li>
            <li> From what I have found, just wet hair, rub on scalp until you can scrub in and it will lather like crazy...</li>
            <li> but lasts very few washes and burns eyes really bad if you accidentally get it into your eyes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product arrived in time frame as promised. Packaging in fine condition. Fine quality ingredients. Smells pleasant. A little awkward at first washing hair with a bar soap rather then a liquid. Got the hang of washing hair with bar pretty quickly though. I like the results. My hair and my hubby&#x27;s hair quality has improved. I&#x27;m planning to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The peppermint kinda dries my hair out</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the lather, love what it does to my hair...don&#x27;t love how quickly they get used up. I can actually wash my hair less often when I use these instead of traditional shampoo. They&#x27;re so great, they&#x27;ve completely corrected the issues I was having with my unmanageable, frizzy curls that were both too dry and too greasy. I was previously washing my hair 7-10 times per week and using shampoo, conditioner, argan oil, once a week hair masques, etc. Now I just wash about 3 times per week with one of these shampoo bars, use a light conditioner once a week, and use argan oil as a detangler before I comb out my wet hair. I&#x27;ll occasionally use a keratin-based heat protectant if I&#x27;m planning on straightening my hair for an event. My hair has never been this strong before! I just wish that these bars lasted more than about 20 washes each.</li>
            <li> i really want to like these.  the lather is great.  but apparently they dont work well if you have hard water.  i wish i had known that because now i feel like i have a residue in my hair and apparently to get it out you should do a baking soda/vinegar rinse.  i bought these as an alternative to the baking soda/vinegar lol!</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this soap and thought I would try it. Nice lather, fresh smell. My hair feels clean and thicker. I plan to take it on my trip to spain on the Camino de Santiago. I will use it for body soap as well.</li>
            <li> I was a bit of a sceptic but found this product to work wonders; really noticed a difference in my hair and beard. I also love the convenience and portability of the bar.  I have since purchased more and have promoted it&#x27;s use to family and friends.  No worries; it does lather like normal shampoo but doesn&#x27;t strip off the natural oil with detergent.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive shampoo forever, and now I probably won&#x27;t ever go back.  This is all you need. No frills, but my hair feels great and i love the minimal biodegradable ingredients</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It is especially good for travel.  No liquid concerns for TSA or the inside of my bag.  Just throw it in a ziploc and throw it in the bag.  No worries.  Smells good too.  I&#x27;ll probably use this forever.</li>
            <li> Love these bars. Sent this to my boyfriend in italy. While the shipping was quite a tedious process because of the italian shipper....the products are still amazing</li>
            <li> Great product but lasts very few washes and burns eyes really bad if you accidentally get it into your eyes.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but it makes my hair super oily, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with oily hair before.</li>
            <li> holy wonder bar! my boyfriend has always had extremely (think oil slick) oily hair if he didn&#x27;t wash his hair every day he was instantly oily the next...well he used your bar, and no conditioner (not that he used it before anyways) two days ago! his hair is still clean and not oily even weirder he dosen&#x27;t find his face and skin to be as oily sense using your bar just on his hair! could it be he was allergic to the other soaps he was using that was causing this well maybe, i&#x27;ve also used your bar with conditioner (trying to work my way down my hair is naturally very dry), and so far so good my hair is clean, and when i rinsed the shampoo out my hair squeeked. we have hard water and i have not noticed any waxy buildup others have talked about. i will say rubbing a bar on your hair is a bit weird at first, but i&#x27;m sure i will get used to that. Long story short thanks for a GREAT product i think you&#x27;ve found a new lifelong customer as we are about to order a bar for my mother too</li>
            <li> Cleans very well. Takes time for your hair to get used to it but the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love this variety pack, especially the mint and jojoba one!</li>
            <li> Bought this variety pack after trying the peppermint oil version. Of you have a beard, this is a must have. While it is recommended that you don&#x27;t wash your beard daily, I work in medicine and feel the need to shampoo after a day in a germy hospital. These shampoos don&#x27;t strip the natural oils necessary to maintain a well groomed, yet epic beard. They all make a huge difference in texture, ridding the brillo pad feel and creating a must softer texture. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> THESE SHAMPOO BARS ARE THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE FOUND THAT REALLY WORKS ON MY HAIR.  I AM 61 YEARS OLD AND MY HAIR IS BABY-FINE AND DRYS EASILY.  I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF $ LOOKING FOR THE &amp;#34;HOLY GRAIL&amp;#34; HAIR PRODUCT - I WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THESE SHAMPOO BARS ARE IT.  IF YOU ARE TRYING THESE FOR THE FIRST TIME, DON&#x27;T GIVE UP AFTER THE FIRST TRY.  YOUR HAIR IS NOT USED TO &amp;#34;GOOD&amp;#34; NATURAL INGREDIENTS SO IT MAY FEEL A BIT LIKE &amp;#34;STRAW&amp;#34; BUT BELIEVE ME WHEN YOUR HAIR DRIES, IT WILL BE SOFT, SHINY AND MANAGEABLE.  I HAD TO KISS MANY FROGS BEFORE I FOUND MY PRINCE.</li>
            <li> i have only tried the argan and virgin coconut so far, after using this my hair became too waxy and cannot get rid of the buildup with blow drying my hair. i had to shower again with a shampoo to remove the wax. the very first time i used it i let the wax on my hair and only towel dried my hair, my hair didn&#x27;t dry as fast and it became very thin and rubbery that i can pull my hair and it just breaks in my hand . I was really scared until i saw others reviews apparently the argan soap is not suitable. I will give the hemp oil a try next and hope it suits my poor hair.</li>
            <li> Took on a backpacking trip to Spain. Was able to use it to wash clothing, hair, and didn&#x27;t need conditioner even though my hair is dry. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE J.R. Liggett&#x27;s Shampoo Bar.  Yes, it does require me to use a conditioner because it makes my hair so clean, but I condition my hair anyway so no big deal.  AND it saves a plastic bottle from being thrown away.  YAY!</li>
            <li> I love this variety in coconut oil based shampoos!  I have been using these for two years now and I have beautiful, clean, shiny, and nourished hair.  Only drawback is a very small bar for the price, and will melt quickly if not kept in a soap dish that drains.  The first 2-3 shampoos your hair may feel heavy, not quite rinsed out.  Be patient, this is just the transition from shampoos that are full of unpronounceable ingredients to a pure, organic, deep detoxifying  shampoo.  It is very convenient for air travel because of this bar formula instead of liquid.  Bought my 4 best friends the 3 bar pack for Christmas.  Now they are also coverts!</li>
            <li> The older I get the driver my hair has become.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the last five years but nothing worked and my hair was like a dry old broom (my hair is quite long, and is very thick of fine texture). I had about given up and had resorted to using either argon or coconut oil to make it look like real hair.  Then I decided to try these shampoo bars.  The first shampoo I did not see a change -still very dry hair.  I decided to keep using the shampoo bar anyway and add oil.  On the third or fourth shampoo, I noticed that I no longer needed to oil my hair.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner so I was astonished that my hair after shampooing and air dry, my hair looks and feels like healthy hair !!!  Just shampooed today and again, my hair is no longer dry and feels great.  I&#x27;m still astonished with these great results and so happy.  I should also mention that using a bar is so much easier than liquid shampoo...I love these  bars. I got the variety set and tried the jojoba and peppermint first and it looks like it will last a couple of more months before I&#x27;ll open one of the remaining two.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this in place of shampoo. I am not fond of the one with Coconut but I love the tea tree one and the jojoba one. It is definitely different make sure you give it a real chance because it takes a while for your scalp to adapt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for more than 6 months and I absolutely love it. Obviously it takes some time to get used to this versus liquid shampoo, but my hair is cleaner and healthier than ever. In the past, when I would dry my hair it would be frizzy and static-filled. Now it dries quicker and is smooth and silky right away, no flat iron needed.</li>
