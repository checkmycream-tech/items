            <li>This was my favorite!!!</li>
            <li>I thought that a plumping lip-conditioner sounded like a great combo product.</li>
            <li>Great lip conditioner.  </li>

            <li>I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>was so happy to find these on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used, I buy these 3 packs three at a time because my grand daughters steel it.</li>
            <li>is as good as $27 lip conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>These plumping conditioners make your lips feel so good, even if you don&#x27;t put on lip color.</li>
            <li>For something cheaper, I&#x27;ve heard good things about Sally Hansen&#x27;s lip plumper, but I haven&#x27;t tried it myself.</li>
            <li>I bought the three pack because of the raving reviews, thinking if it&#x27;s that good, I don&#x27;t want to run out of it.</li>
            <li>I go to Amazon, find a good seller and there its - at a very&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>I ordered one package and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Price was good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product with an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>Works as good as shea butter in hydration.  </li>
            <li>and it arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>What a relief to know that I have something to help me quickly:  overnight results!!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I then ordered 4 more packages!  </li>
            <li>Love this product and will recommended it to all my friends!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find this product again as I&#x27;ve used it for many years and had just run out of it.  </li>
            <li>Nice nude color.</li>
            <li>These are nice for conditioning the lips.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this lipsticks.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be able to find Avon products that have been discontinued on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The Avon specials though are more cost effective than buying on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more them 20 years.</li>
            <li>I love this lip conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to get three tubes</li>
            <li>It is smooth and creamy - which is nice -</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll take smooth, plumped lips over whistling any day!    </li>
            <li>It was interesting to discover that after a week or so without my Avon lip plumping balm, I was able to whistle again.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Wish Avon hadn&#x27;t discontinued my favorite color of it</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to see three lip conditioners delivered in threes.</li>
            <li>them in threes was much more convenient.</li>
            <li>and this is one of the better products out there.  </li>
            <li>But I do love the nude color it has when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lip conditioner for many years can not replace it with anything else.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a great plumper but also a fantastic moisturizer that healed my chapped lips in two days!!</li>
            <li>It the best for dry lips.</li>
            <li>Makes lips soft and works great alone and under lipstick or gloss.</li>
            <li>I was not too surprised because it does have retinol, but I was happy</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any plumping of the lips, but it does make my lips soft.</li>
            <li>z volume effect is just a lie but its a verg good moisturizn agent with a very nic color .</li>
            <li>Seems like an odd way to realize how effective your lip plumper is, but I&#x27;m now even more convinced that I never want to be without this amazing product!</li>
            <li>so I do not run-out so quickly because I use more than just my lips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many lip plumpers in the range of $30-$60, from Soap and Glory to Too Faced to Dior, but none work like this--and it&#x27;s so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;m REALLY going to use all 3 at once... wouldve been nice to keep them in box to store until i need... or give one away...</li>
            <li>it leaves it fabulously moisturized</li>
            <li>keeps lips smooth for hours.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a fantastic lip moisturizer, nothing in the plumping department though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have that cheap glossy look to it--</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips hydrated and smooth, very useful for a winter weather.</li>
            <li>It looks great, and helps keep your lips extra soft and appear slightly more full (:</li>
            <li>If you want a real plumper try either Soap &amp; Glory&#x27;s Sexy Mother Plucker or Clinician&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Feels good and the tube is actually a sleek matte silver like a lipstick</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a good conditioner, but there is a white film when you wear it by itself.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderfully soothing on chapped lips and provides a good base for putting on lipstick.  </li>
            <li>This is a great alternative if you just want that natural gloss and moisturizer at the same time.  </li>
            <li>They have a tiny bit of a nude color which I personally kind of like.  </li>
            <li>If you apply to lips before putting on lipstick you will find it creates a smooth layer, hiding any minor cracks, and lipstick looks much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or glossy, it smooth and makes your lips so soft.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent lip conditioner with a faint neutral tone and a non-slippery finish that makes lips feel great (and not the least bit greasy), while also helping to keep lipstick in place.</li>
            <li>This  Avon Plumping Lip Conditioner is much more:  after using 3 of these on my lips, I just recently tried it on my \\&quot;crowsfeet\\&quot; at the outermost edge and between my eyebrows where I wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>First off, if you don&#x27;t like flowery scented things, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li>mine came on a hot day and they were melted.. didnt use .</li>
            <li>I use this first, then apply color.  </li>
            <li>The plumping isn&#x27;t exaggerated, but it starts to work fairly quickly, and becomes even more effective over time.</li>
            <li>Not like surgery or fillers, but a simple easy to apply substitute.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; going on with this product.</li>
            <li>#34;long lasting&amp;#34; and that doesn&#x27;t work very well with this product, either.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Could not tell much &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; difference, but it does make the areas feel smoother.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s three in a package because I can keep one in my bathroom for when I&#x27;m getting ready, one in my purse and one in my desk at work.  </li>
            <li>this is a 3 pack because it goes fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light change, so don&#x27;t expect Angelina Jolie lips or anything, and I also feel like it slightly dries out my lips...</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty classy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more or less chapstick.</li>
            <li>I wear it mainly as a moisturizer for my lips</li>
            <li>Got back home and resumed using it again, and I&#x27;m back to not being able to whistle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very clever idea.</li>
            <li>actually love putting a little coconut oil on my lips, and apply this after.</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s one unexpected side effect: after trying to get my dog&#x27;s attention one day, I discovered that I can no longer whistle effectively unless I do the fingers-in-the-mouth kind of very loud whistle, because after using this lip conditioner, my lips get just plump enough to make whistling difficult.</li>
            <li>It was a good thing at the time, as I was desperately trying to hail a cab, but it underscored the fact that without the Avon lip plumping conditioner, my lips had lost enough plumpness that I was able to whistle again.</li>
            <li>It definitely has a distinct smell to it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a decent product, but be aware of the scent...</li>
            <li>live in them.</li>
            <li>Some other lip conditioners cost more and you get only one, but this one is tripled the value.</li>
            <li>It conditioned a little bit, but nothing more than a regular chapstick would do.</li>
            <li>They are soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again because it&#x27;s inexpensive and the perfect base.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff as lip tint, such a pretty pale pink!</li>
            <li>It does moisturize well and the smell and taste are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the pale color wouldn&#x27;t suit me, but when applied it turns a &#x27;natural&#x27; color.</li>
            <li>The only down side is the actual product inside the tube is shorter than many other lip products.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; my lips, but helps them appear slightly fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> They are soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again because it&#x27;s inexpensive and the perfect base.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff as lip tint, such a pretty pale pink!</li>
            <li> It does moisturize well and the smell and taste are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the pale color wouldn&#x27;t suit me, but when applied it turns a &#x27;natural&#x27; color.</li>

            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as long as chapstick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to disappoint,  but this really doesn&#x27;t have a plumping effect on the lips.</li>
            <li> It does both extremely well, and I apply it several times a day, year-round.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t use it alone - it makes my lips blend right in with my face (not a good look!)</li>
            <li> The color was an odd nude color that actually made it look like I had no lips!</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Not much of a plumper.</li>

            <li> This isn&#x27;t one of those lip plumpers that does its job by irritating lips until they swell (like those that use cinnamon and other topical irritants to create a temporary plumping effect, but can also dry your lips and make them red around the edges</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing lipstick or lip gloss because of the heavy feel when i&#x27;m at work (pharmacist).  </li>

            <li> I use this everyday!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend recommend this. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I have chapped lips and would leave white areas on my chapped area. Didn&#x27;t plump whatsoever. Gave them to my friend.</li>
            <li> I use to always buy this from AVON but sometimes they dont have it.  A product I swear by as it actually works!  It&#x27;s not sticky or glossy, it smooth and makes your lips so soft.  I fully recommend this product and will continue to buy it.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years now.</li>
            <li> I must be allergic to lipstick because any brand makes my lips peel - I&#x27;m constantly chewing the skin off.  Ghastly.  I began using this product, wearing it under my lipstick, and I no longer have this problem.  It does moisturize and it wear well.  I like purchasing 3 at a time so I have one for the vanity, one for my purse, and an extra when I begin to run out.</li>
            <li> this product is not scented but it moisturized your lip . I don&#x27;t know about the lip pump but it work well for me . I have used this product for more them 20 years.</li>
            <li> The best lip moisturizer I have ever used! I don&#x27;t ever want to run out!</li>
            <li> I love this lip conditioner.  It goes on quite thick so the tube doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, but the lip conditioner itself feels fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;This is as good as $27 lip conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> it does not work as limp plumper. No tingle, no nothing. Its like a lip gloss. waste of money. I have bought stuff at Wal-mart and Walgreens that does work.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff as lip tint, such a pretty pale pink! I wear it everyday, without fail. I wear it mainly as a moisturizer for my lips though.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; my lips, but helps them appear slightly fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I actually love putting a little coconut oil on my lips, and apply this after. It looks great, and helps keep your lips extra soft and appear slightly more full (:</li>
            <li> This product is wonderfully soothing on chapped lips and provides a good base for putting on lipstick.  If you apply to lips before putting on lipstick you will find it creates a smooth layer, hiding any minor cracks, and lipstick looks much better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any additional  plumpness, however I did like the color over some other lipsticks or it would have received less stars.</li>
            <li> Makes lips soft and works great alone and under lipstick or gloss. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> It works. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used, I buy these 3 packs three at a time because my grand daughters steel it. ;)</li>
            <li> Nothing is perfect but this product is just what it advertises.  It plumps.  Not like surgery or fillers, but a simple easy to apply substitute.</li>
            <li> These plumping conditioners make your lips feel so good, even if you don&#x27;t put on lip color. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Didnt appreciate the actual boxes of these being taped up like Fort Knox! Like I&#x27;m REALLY going to use all 3 at once... wouldve been nice to keep them in box to store until i need... or give one away... pathetic. The tape served no purpose. Stupidity at its finest.</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money for me. It conditioned a little bit, but nothing more than a regular chapstick would do. The color was an odd nude color that actually made it look like I had no lips! There was no plumping effect at all, no tingling, no flushing, nothing. If you want a real plumper try either Soap &amp; Glory&#x27;s Sexy Mother Plucker or Clinician&#x27;s Complex Lip Enhancer- both are pricy, but they actually provide results. For something cheaper, I&#x27;ve heard good things about Sally Hansen&#x27;s lip plumper, but I haven&#x27;t tried it myself.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome awesome love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this a lot since Avon brought it out. I like 24 hour stay on lip colors &amp; I live in them. I use this at night before I go to bed to keep my lips supple...then once in the morning when I get up. It has decreased my feathering quite a bit &amp; keeps my lips from looking wrinkled &amp; dried out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing lipstick or lip gloss because of the heavy feel when i&#x27;m at work (pharmacist).  This is a great alternative if you just want that natural gloss and moisturizer at the same time.  It also plumps the lips. I use this everyday! Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find this product again as I&#x27;ve used it for many years and had just run out of it.  I was glad to get three tubes and it arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; going on with this product. It is smooth and creamy - which is nice - but I can&#x27;t use it alone - it makes my lips blend right in with my face (not a good look!). I try to use lipsticks that are &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; and that doesn&#x27;t work very well with this product, either. My &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; lipstick does not last very long if I have this conditioner on underneath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this plumping lip conditioner for about three years now, after discovering a couple of winters ago that my usual lip balm wasn&#x27;t keeping cold/dry-weather chapping at bay. I thought that a plumping lip-conditioner sounded like a great combo product. It does both extremely well, and I apply it several times a day, year-round. Avon offers lipstick in the same plumping formula, and I&#x27;ve tried those as well, but I also use other brands over the plumping conditioner, and it works just as well.    This isn&#x27;t one of those lip plumpers that does its job by irritating lips until they swell (like those that use cinnamon and other topical irritants to create a temporary plumping effect, but can also dry your lips and make them red around the edges so you end up with what I call \\&quot;clown mouth\\&quot;). It&#x27;s an excellent lip conditioner with a faint neutral tone and a non-slippery finish that makes lips feel great (and not the least bit greasy), while also helping to keep lipstick in place. The plumping isn&#x27;t exaggerated, but it starts to work fairly quickly, and becomes even more effective over time. And there&#x27;s one unexpected side effect: after trying to get my dog&#x27;s attention one day, I discovered that I can no longer whistle effectively unless I do the fingers-in-the-mouth kind of very loud whistle, because after using this lip conditioner, my lips get just plump enough to make whistling difficult. But I&#x27;ll take smooth, plumped lips over whistling any day!    12/29/14 Update: I recently went on a 3-week trip abroad, and forgot to take a tube of this lip conditioner with me, so I bought a different lip balm during my travels. It was interesting to discover that after a week or so without my Avon lip plumping balm, I was able to whistle again. It was a good thing at the time, as I was desperately trying to hail a cab, but it underscored the fact that without the Avon lip plumping conditioner, my lips had lost enough plumpness that I was able to whistle again. Got back home and resumed using it again, and I&#x27;m back to not being able to whistle. Seems like an odd way to realize how effective your lip plumper is, but I&#x27;m now even more convinced that I never want to be without this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lipstick for at least 8 or 9 years.  It is the perfect shade of nude.  I apply it during the day, and also before I go to sleep.  It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great lip conditioner.  This lip conditioner is really a great deal. Some other lip conditioners cost more and you get only one, but this one is tripled the value.</li>
            <li> I bought the three pack because of the raving reviews, thinking if it&#x27;s that good, I don&#x27;t want to run out of it. It&#x27;s more or less chapstick. And it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as long as chapstick. So, I probably wont be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I won&#x27;t be without it! Wish Avon hadn&#x27;t discontinued my favorite color of it tho!!</li>
            <li> This was my favorite!!! It doesn&#x27;t change color of your lips yet it leaves it fabulously moisturized</li>
            <li> I use this over the years. It beat what on the market. Any avon lady that sell avon should sell this to construction worker that work out in the sun all day. It the best for dry lips.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff. I hope they make it forever. keeps lips smooth for hours.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see three lip conditioners delivered in threes. Usually, I have to order one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Putting them in threes was much more convenient. Reasonably priced too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to be able to find Avon products that have been discontinued on Amazon. Sometimes&lt;br /&gt;something will be discontinued that I&#x27;ve used for years. I go to Amazon, find a good seller and there its - at a very&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very clever idea. Selling them in threes.</li>
            <li> Feels good and the tube is actually a sleek matte silver like a lipstick so it&#x27;s pretty classy</li>
            <li> thought it was the plumper but can use it for conditioner when I find some plumper</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well but does not plump at all. Nice nude color.</li>
            <li> Could not tell much &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; difference, but it does make the areas feel smoother.</li>
            <li> These are nice for conditioning the lips.  They are soft and silky.  I don&#x27;t get any plumping from them though, at all, and have been using them daily for a couple weeks now.  They have a tiny bit of a nude color which I personally kind of like.  I like that there&#x27;s three in a package because I can keep one in my bathroom for when I&#x27;m getting ready, one in my purse and one in my desk at work.  Just wish they actually did plump!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to disappoint,  but this really doesn&#x27;t have a plumping effect on the lips. It does moisturize well and the smell and taste are barely noticeable. It&#x27;s a good thing this is a 3 pack because it goes fast. The nude shade is flattering and it plumps to the degree that it is moisturizing, meaning the plumping effect is just that... moisturized lips.  I&#x27;d buy it again because it&#x27;s inexpensive and the perfect base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few over the years and this is one of the better products out there.  Works well as a base under your lipstick.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a couple of weeks now and it&#x27;s a fantastic lip moisturizer, nothing in the plumping department though.</li>
            <li> z volume effect is just a lie but its a verg good moisturizn agent with a very nic color .</li>
            <li> I ordered one package and loved it.  I then ordered 4 more packages!  I have a tube stashed everywhere so I always have one at hand.  I have very thin lips that tend to be very dry.  The result for me is a bit of plumping and and lots of moisture and smoothing.  The only down side is the actual product inside the tube is shorter than many other lip products.</li>
            <li> Had no problems. Was happy to find these. Price was good.</li>
            <li> This  Avon Plumping Lip Conditioner is much more:  after using 3 of these on my lips, I just recently tried it on my \\&quot;crowsfeet\\&quot; at the outermost edge and between my eyebrows where I wrinkle.  It has worked to plump those areas!  I was not too surprised because it does have retinol, but I was happy I tried it between my eyebrows!!!  This is a good product with an affordable price.  I am happy with it.  My current order is a \\&quot;3-Pack\\&quot; so I do not run-out so quickly because I use more than just my lips.  My best is to use at night before bed. UPDATE: the extreme winter just put my skin into super-dryness.  So, I put Avon&#x27;s Plumper on my nipples &amp; IT WORKED!  The bad dryness (that no expensive lotion nor Vaseline could undo) was removed by this product!  What a relief to know that I have something to help me quickly:  overnight results!!! Thank Goodness for this product!!!</li>
            <li> First off, if you don&#x27;t like flowery scented things, don&#x27;t get this. It definitely has a distinct smell to it. I had to cover it up with scented lip gloss afterwards in order to stand it. But I do love the nude color it has when I put it on. Also, it does help with my lips. It&#x27;s a very light change, so don&#x27;t expect Angelina Jolie lips or anything, and I also feel like it slightly dries out my lips...but that might just be me. Overall, it&#x27;s a decent product, but be aware of the scent...</li>
            <li> Not much of a plumper. And it&#x27;s a good conditioner, but there is a white film when you wear it by itself.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this for years. My Avon lady passed away and I didn&#x27;t know where to get these.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find these on Amazon at a great price. Now I am set with the other 2 for backup.</li>
            <li> Best lip plumper I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have that cheap glossy look to it--it&#x27;s just like Chapstick but it plumps your lips perfectly. I&#x27;ve tried so many lip plumpers in the range of $30-$60, from Soap and Glory to Too Faced to Dior, but none work like this--and it&#x27;s so much cheaper!! Not only is it a great plumper but also a fantastic moisturizer that healed my chapped lips in two days!! Love this product and will recommended it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip conditioner for many years can not replace it with anything else. It keeps my lips hydrated and smooth, very useful for a winter weather. The Avon specials though are more cost effective than buying on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lipsticks. At first I thought the pale color wouldn&#x27;t suit me, but when applied it turns a &#x27;natural&#x27; color. I haven&#x27;t experienced any plumping of the lips, but it does make my lips soft.</li>
            <li> mine came on a hot day and they were melted.. didnt use . threw away</li>
            <li> Hydrates and plumps my thin lips.  I use this first, then apply color.  Works as good as shea butter in hydration.  A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> One of the best products by Avon</li>
