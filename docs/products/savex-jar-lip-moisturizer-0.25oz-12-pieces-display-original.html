            <li>Thanks for a good product</li>
            <li>It really keeps my lips in a good moistened condition.</li>

            <li>When I&#x27;m out, I&#x27;ll be back to buy more!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>I use this product on my lips all the time, have it in my car, purse, home and desk,,always handy for me,, It keeps your lips protected and soft  much longer than other brands,, and this company offers it at a very good price.</li>
            <li>Savex is just right.  </li>
            <li>Update: the latest batch I received feels and smells different - less pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li>This product came exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried many different types and nothing compares.  </li>
            <li>It is worth buying it 12 at a time and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I gave 3 away to my mom and opened the 4th one and used today for the first time from this batch so I don&#x27;t think I can return them....  </li>
            <li>Savex always does the trick in a short time and to me tastes much better than Carmex.  </li>
            <li>I tried Carmex and other lip balms before which were either too strong or too light.  </li>
            <li>By the way, the Lysine is a natural amino acid, which comes in many foods, so this is a totally natural way to go, between it and the Savex.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>I was very please to find it on-line and</li>
            <li>My whole family uses this product.</li>
            <li>I hope they didn&#x27;t change the formulation because I really like the \\&quot;old\\&quot; savex.</li>
            <li>Been using it for years, we live in a place that has four seasons and my lips really used to get really chapped.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that keeps my lips hydrated all night, the only gloss that prevents AND cures lip viruses/blisters, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Savex.  </li>
            <li>This \\&quot;medicated\\&quot; version is new to me</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and the heat  </li>
            <li>Now I live in Norther Arizona &#x27;</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of lip balms that come off real easy.</li>
            <li>is extreme in the summer and my lips get very dry very easily.</li>
            <li>It is great for cold sores also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a one-two punch that works nearly every time.   </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate, stays well applicated and keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li>The be as t for sensitive lips or skin</li>
            <li>Savex is a medicated lip balm that can be used even if the skin on my lips has become too sensitive for lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Also, I no longer am under such stress in life, and I&#x27;m older now.</li>
            <li>really works well for dry lips</li>
            <li>It arrived early, and now we will only buy it through Amazon!</li>

            <li> This lip balm is essential and the only product that helps my family with dry lips and also decreasing sores.</li>
            <li> (I posted this same review on the single jar version, but wanted everyone to see this advice here on the 12 jar version too, which I have decided to go for instead, because shipping is only $3 for the 12, versus $14.97 to buy 3!!!)  </li>
            <li> I have used Savex for years, mostly just during the cold months</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Savex (like 20 some years).  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s down to one that gets as far as being visible to others due to this response protocol I was taught.</li>
            <li> We have used this product in the past, it is a very effective treatment for cold sores etc, it lasts forever and we were having trouble obtaining some until we decided to try on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got this order on time as promised and sealed as expected.  </li>
            <li> Because unfortunately, this protocol won&#x27;t work unless you heed and address that forewarning of the tingling sensation RIGHT AWAY.</li>
            <li> I would take SAVEX lipgloss over any other lipcare in the universe.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user of savex in the little pot.</li>
            <li> I chew them up and take them with water to wash them down since they&#x27;re so hard), and put Savex on the lips, every hour, IMMEDIATELY upon the tingling sensation of something going on in the lips or below or above them.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t go on the same as the thick but silky little pot version.</li>
            <li> unfortunately they have added an extra element that makes it softer than the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t stay on my lips as long as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; formula.</li>
            <li> no more other chap sticks don&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> It was not original Savex.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and wouldn&#x27;t be without</li>
            <li> It is not flavored but there is a small taste to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find though.</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm fanatic, but I literally buy this lip balm in bulk, because nothing else will do.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago they stopped carrying it, then they brought it back, &amp; my mom &amp; I were always buying a ton when we were in there, afraid it would go away.....</li>
            <li> They have a a ton  of different smells and flavors for whatever fits your choice, try it out you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> sad sad sad ....</li>
            <li> I was I was told by a co-worker all those years ago that to avoid cold sores on and around the lips you take Lysine amino acid orally</li>
            <li> but anytime I have a cold sore or abrasion on my lips.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible, unsightly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this lipgloss for almost twenty years. It is perfect. It is the only thing that keeps my lips hydrated all night, the only gloss that prevents AND cures lip viruses/blisters, and I love the smell. I am the type of girl to only use Tom&#x27;s Toothpaste, Origins skincare, and Nioxin hair care, so I am picky!!!! I would take SAVEX lipgloss over any other lipcare in the universe. It is the best!!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST lip balm EVER. I am a lip balm fanatic, but I literally buy this lip balm in bulk, because nothing else will do. I have them everywhere! At work, in my purse, in my makeup bag, in the kitchen, EVERYWHERE. Once you try it, you&#x27;ll be a Savex convert.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip covering! I have used Savex for over 25 years. Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years n they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores no more other chap sticks don&#x27;t work for me I will b ordering again thank you</li>
            <li> The savex is at a really good price.  I think it&#x27;s the best price anywhere.  I highly recommend Savex.  My wife and I love it.  We will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> (I posted this same review on the single jar version, but wanted everyone to see this advice here on the 12 jar version too, which I have decided to go for instead, because shipping is only $3 for the 12, versus $14.97 to buy 3!!!)  I have been using this brand in this form (the jar, not the stick) for 25 years. This \\&quot;medicated\\&quot; version is new to me but I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy it on the assumption that it will work as well as the unmedicated has for me all these years.  I was I was told by a co-worker all those years ago that to avoid cold sores on and around the lips you take Lysine amino acid orally (it&#x27;s cheap - you can buy it an any drugstore or Trader Joe&#x27;s - take several 500 mg tablets every 3 hours - I chew them up and take them with water to wash them down since they&#x27;re so hard), and put Savex on the lips, every hour, IMMEDIATELY upon the tingling sensation of something going on in the lips or below or above them. I used to have breakouts maybe 6 times a year. Horrible, unsightly. Now it&#x27;s down to one that gets as far as being visible to others due to this response protocol I was taught. Also, I no longer am under such stress in life, and I&#x27;m older now. A trigger is being in the sun (block it with hats), also chocolate combined with nuts. And stress. The trick of the Lysine is that it blocks the virus from multiplying, and the Savex smothers it from above the surface. It&#x27;s a one-two punch that works nearly every time.   I haven&#x27;t had luck with the lipstick version of the Savex - it doesn&#x27;t go on the same as the thick but silky little pot version. Very soothing. If this is what you&#x27;re considering buying it for, you better keep it on your person along with access to Lysine tabs. Because unfortunately, this protocol won&#x27;t work unless you heed and address that forewarning of the tingling sensation RIGHT AWAY. When I have fiddled around, asking myself \\&quot;Am I feeling something? Could it be?\\&quot; and then I don&#x27;t do anything about it for a few hours, the breakoutis really underway, and then there&#x27;s no stopping it, in my experience. By the way, the Lysine is a natural amino acid, which comes in many foods, so this is a totally natural way to go, between it and the Savex. Maybe much better than a prescribed medicine - I&#x27;ve never tried pharmacy company anti-herpes medications, but why would I if this has proven effective and is so cheap. Good luck to you all and I hope this works for you as it did for me!   (P.S. My son has used it for 15 years for chapped lips and when skiing, especially.)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get it, wrote to them, still didn&#x27;t get it............sad sad sad .... more words are required here so I am writing it</li>
            <li> It was not original Savex. It was medicated Savex and after two shipments of the same thing I just decided to keep it. It works.</li>
            <li> We have used this product in the past, it is a very effective treatment for cold sores etc, it lasts forever and we were having trouble obtaining some until we decided to try on Amazon. We fully intend to let our friends and relatives know about it, and how we obtained it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my lips all the time, have it in my car, purse, home and desk,,always handy for me,, It keeps your lips protected and soft  much longer than other brands,, and this company offers it at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty finding this item in any stores. It works great and doesn&#x27;t have the addictive properties of ChapStick or balmex. Use it twice when your lips are chapped, and they are healed!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.&lt;br /&gt;It really works well for dry lips - I keep one in every room.</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy Savex again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product all the time.</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of Savex (like 20 some years).  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate, stays well applicated and keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm.  I can no longer find it in stores.  I tried many different types and nothing compares.  It keeps my lips moisturizer without leaving them chapped when it wears off.  It is worth buying it 12 at a time and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Discovered this product in the early 80s when I was a ski bum, I am so happy I can get it online. I hope they stay in business forever. I never see it on the shelf.  Keeps your lips from getting burned when you are out skiing, or any outdoor activity.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm I have ever used. I would highly recommend this product over any other on the market</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to find in stores.  I was very please to find it on-line and even more please to find it sold in bulk.  I won&#x27;t run out of it for awhile.    Product Savex Medicated lip balm.</li>
            <li> This is one great product. My daughter and I split the box and last all year. Thanks for a good product</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lip balm. It is very smooth and does not have any waxy feeling to it at all. It is not flavored but there is a small taste to it and it smells great. It moisturizes your lips for hours. I live in the desert and the heat  is extreme in the summer and my lips get very dry very easily. I also work outside all day so this is a must to have in my work van. They have a a ton  of different smells and flavors for whatever fits your choice, try it out you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Always love this stuff. The be as t for sensitive lips or skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Savex since 1999.  I tried Carmex and other lip balms before which were either too strong or too light.  The ones that were too strong would make my lips dependent on them and crust up if I didn&#x27;t have any. Unfortunately, I am no longer able to find Savex in stores, so I buy them in bulk online.  I got this order on time as promised and sealed as expected.  When I&#x27;m out, I&#x27;ll be back to buy more!</li>
            <li> Savex is a medicated lip balm that can be used even if the skin on my lips has become too sensitive for lipsticks. I would recommend this to anyone whose lips are too sore for lipstick or Chapstick. It is soothing and healing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of lip balms that come off real easy. It always clears my chapped lips with one or two applications. It is great for cold sores also.</li>
            <li> Great Great Great!  Have been using this product for years.  Can only buy on line.  My whole family uses this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over 5 years and love it.  Vaseline does not work on my chapped lips but Savex does wonders!    Update: the latest batch I received feels and smells different - less pleasant.  It almost made me gag.  So I dropped the rating to 3 stars.  I don&#x27;t know if I received defective ones.  I gave 3 away to my mom and opened the 4th one and used today for the first time from this batch so I don&#x27;t think I can return them....  I hope they didn&#x27;t change the formulation because I really like the \\&quot;old\\&quot; savex.</li>
            <li> &#x27;nuf said.  However, 18 words are required.  This product performs it&#x27;s task as advertised...lip protection...love the tingle of menthol...&#x3D; )</li>
            <li> I feel this is the best lip balm ever! It&#x27;s really hard to find though. When I lived in CA. I used to find it sometimes. Now I live in Norther Arizona &#x27; I could only find it at one gas station. A couple of years ago they stopped carrying it, then they brought it back, &amp; my mom &amp; I were always buying a ton when we were in there, afraid it would go away..... And what do u know, they stopped carrying it avian this month! But thanks to Amazon, we were able to find it and buy a 12 pack for a great deal! It arrived early, and now we will only buy it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  like Carmex.  Too mentholated.  Savex is just right.  Could not find it locally so was glad to be able to buy it on line.</li>
            <li> I have used this lip balm for several years.  I put it on over my lipstick to give it the perfect shine.  I also wear it EVERY night before I go to bed because it literally stays on all night.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I&#x27;ve used for over 20 yrs. So happy you still have it available.</li>
            <li> Savex is great!! Been using it for years, we live in a place that has four seasons and my lips really used to get really chapped. Savex keeps them from chapping--terrific!!!</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user of savex in the little pot. I would have given it 5 stars if it was actually &amp;#34;&amp;#34;the original&amp;#34; formula. unfortunately they have added an extra element that makes it softer than the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t stay on my lips as long as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; formula. It is the &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; version. Smells different, tastes different and stays on different than the actual &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Savex.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is essential and the only product that helps my family with dry lips and also decreasing sores.</li>
            <li> I have used Savex for years, mostly just during the cold months but anytime I have a cold sore or abrasion on my lips.  Savex always does the trick in a short time and to me tastes much better than Carmex.  Will definitely buy again, and I also like the Cherry flavor Savex now that I have tried one.</li>
            <li> Best Treatment for dried lips!</li>
            <li> The best chapped lip balm there is. Our family has been buying this for years.</li>
            <li> Savex is the best stuff out there. After every store in CA stopped selling it, we turned to Amazon. LOVE THIS STUFF! Better price, quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The shipper sent this in a very short period of time.  It was well packaged and is precisely what I wanted.  It really keeps my lips in a good moistened condition.</li>
