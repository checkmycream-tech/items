            <li>Keeps my hair soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>However, I do like the smell, and it lathers quite nicely so that I only have to do one lather.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser said that using any NON sulfate shampoo was OK to use with keratin treatments, so the treatment may have lasted simply because this shampoo has no sulfates.</li>
            <li>Lathers up better than the other shampoos for straightened hair.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed as I transition from relaxer to natural (kinky) hair.</li>
            <li>I had a Lisse Keratin treatment because my hair is dry and very frizzy in humidity, so I purchased this hoping it would prolong the effects of the treatment, and indeed the treatment lasted for a full 5 months.</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old, and my hair looks and feels softer than it did when I was in my 30&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> This shampoo help my keratin treatment last longer. I like it !!</li>
            <li> I had an Alfaparf Lisse Smoothing Treatment and this shampoo is made specifically to be used with the product so your treatment will last longer. Just cleans, doesn&#x27;t strip hair of oils.</li>
            <li> Great product for Keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo, if the original product, is great for keratin treated hair. Yet, if you purchase it from seller called &amp;#34;Just Ultimate Discounts &amp;#34;, you will get a diluted water like product, which is nowhere close to what the manufacturer produced. I am very disappointed in my last purchase and quite worried that the product I received may be not only diluted but fake altogether.</li>
            <li> I meet all my espectations about this product, not only the shampoo but also the conditioner.  Because it is heavy chemicals free my hair don&#x27;t suffer from caustic or sulfur.  Don&#x27;t damage hair color or keratin treatments.  Keeps my hair soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Perfect in maintaining my keratin therapy treatment. Cleanses hair and smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed as I transition from relaxer to natural (kinky) hair. Excellent in combination with the mask from the same line and silicon mix liso sedoso intensive leave in.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, let my hair feeling soft and I loved the smell. Bought it more than once.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and I have keratin. This shampoo smells so good and let my hair really smooth!</li>

            <li> Lathers up better than the other shampoos for straightened hair. Use this after getting the Lisse smoothing system for my hair.</li>
