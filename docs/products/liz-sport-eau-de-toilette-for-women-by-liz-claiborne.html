            <li> I ordered the 3.8 bottle by its self as shown in the picture and received the 3 piece set with the bath gel and lotion. I didn&#x27;t want the bath gel and lotion because I&#x27;m allergic to most of these type of things. I was wondering why the cologne cost so much, I didn&#x27;t remember paying 45.00 for it before. Don&#x27;t want to have to pay to ship it back. Not sure if I will ever do this again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  In my area it is very difficult to find at a department store.  My only problem was that I was sent 2 bottles when I ordered only one.  This seems to be a problem.  In the past I have been sent the wrong items.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon. I have worn this perfume for years and was having trouble finding it. Not only do you carry it you have it at half the price.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent to work every day for at least twenty years!  It&#x27;s a clean fresh scent that stays all day.  My co-workers, male and female compliment me quite often.  In recent years, it has been hard to find, even in the Liz Claiborne outlet.  I am praying that it&#x27;s never discontinued!  I haven&#x27;t found anything that&#x27;s comparable!</li>
            <li> I threw away the boxes so I cannot send it back. I assumed it would be Liz Sport which I have been using for 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;It must be a knockoff. It smells nothing like Liz Sport. And rather than getting what I ordered I received 3 boxes with additional items (cream and bath soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very unhappy and wish I could return these. I will not use them and have to purchase somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Just the right touch of freshness. Not sweet or heavy.</li>
            <li> I should have realized that this was not the real Liz Sport when the 5 bottles were delivered to me, none of them in the Liz Sport boxes.  All individually wrapped in paper or cardboard.  Though the bottles looked like Liz Sport, they smelled horrible.  A musty sweet sour smell.  I threw all 5 bottles away. Do NOT purchase.</li>
            <li> Smell very good.  Sweet odor.  I use this one for a long time ago. And it&#x27;s the best on for me.  Everybody tell me: you smell so good!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Not overwhelming or floral, it has a very clean, crisp smell.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this for daytime.  You can layer with a nightime perfume easily but it is great for a work day or spruce up. Not in stores, great to have it online!!</li>
            <li> I gave it a four but I could have given it a five but it was not here before Christmas</li>
            <li> Been using this since I was 16, over 10 years...Get lots of compliments..hope its never discontinued...don&#x27;t know what I would do...Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for many many years , there isn&#x27;t a day goes by that I don&#x27;t hear &amp;#34;You smell so good, what are you wearing&amp;#34;? I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s a clean smell . I don&#x27;t know why they stopped selling it in the department stores ? It is hard to find sometimes ... Thank you for such a great product !!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is my favorite . It is very hard to find anymore. Glad that you have it .</li>
            <li> This is a great classic scent that has endured the overblown turned coagulated perfume market. The perfume towers over other perfumes flooding the current market. In this beautiful scent you will find floral fun tempered by elegant class. Your lady will love it fella&#x27;s...trust me.</li>
            <li> I love it, have been wearing it for years. It is a crisp clean smell, and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites! I&#x27;m allergic to quite a few fragrances but this has never once bothered me. I&#x27;ve worn it for many years and the scent has never gotten old. It&#x27;s light and easy on the nose. My teenage daughter even started using it when she smelled it on me. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I love my wife!  For whatever reason, this has become increasing more difficult to find in the department stores.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  Great product for a good price.  I was not able to find this in any store.  I was so thankful I finally found it here on line.  It arrived when they said it would and made a wonderful Christmas Gift.  She was very surprised because she had been looking all over for this product.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li> We thought it wasn&#x27;t made anymore, same great scent and great delivery</li>

            <li> My favorite perfume bar none.  I get many compliments on this every time I wear it.  It is not sold in stores, so I have to hunt for it now.</li>
            <li> I Love using this perfume and hope she don&#x27;t stop making it, this one will always be in my collection.</li>
            <li> I have had this product in the past and have had trouble locating it until now.  This has a clean, light fragrance and I consistently get compliments when wearing it.  I would recommend it to anyone wishing for that type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t have the same fragrance as my last bottle.  (I kept the other bottle and compared)</li>
