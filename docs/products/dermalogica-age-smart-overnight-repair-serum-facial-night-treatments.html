            <li>Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li>It does have a rose smell</li>
            <li>(Rosewood) Wood Oil, Eugenia Caryophylus (Clove) Flower Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Oil, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Rose Flower Oil, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia, Ocimum Basilicum (</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like tea tree oil</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>I looked up the ingredients online after slathering it on my face and thought I  smelled rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li>Also, it felt kind of burn-y.</li>
            <li>Roses are lovely, but this is not even an enchanting rose smell.  </li>
            <li>My face looks beautiful and my skin tone and texture are  exactly what I was hoping to accomplish at 50.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice scent, and I will plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, nice and dewy, you look refreshed in the morning!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Will follow up with more information.  </li>
            <li>I love the product and have bought it before from a retail store.  </li>
            <li>It is the best serum ever,it makes my face look younger and brighter.</li>
            <li>I love Dermalogica.  </li>
            <li>The texture is like an oil, with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love all Dermalogica products, however this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this Overnight Repair Serum.  </li>
            <li>as a better option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are better products on the market.</li>
            <li>I  got a facial done at the Dermalogica Skin Bar in NYC, and it was a wonderful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Prices are better here at Amazon though.</li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the way it makes me feel when I put it on and love the way it makes my skin feel in the morning.</li>
            <li>but okay.</li>
            <li>I love this oily overnight potion.  </li>
            <li>but I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Love Dermalogica.  </li>
            <li>A dropper would have been better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of itâ€¦very spa-like and relaxing.</li>
            <li>The serum works so much better than a cream.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s better living through chemistry, for me concerning skin care.)</li>
            <li>wait until it soaks in pretty good and head to bed.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great product, but I just received an old bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love Dermalogica products, so I was excited to see this one.  </li>
            <li>Have tried other serums and this is still the best</li>
            <li>this in addition to the super rich has effectively removed the dehydration lines in my lower cheeks.  </li>
            <li>It also comes in a three sample kit with the Eye Reversal Complex and the Super Rich Repair which makes for a perfect travel size and could also make a great little gift for a friend who loves great products!</li>
            <li>Noticed improvement in pore size and skin smoothness softness.and fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The product is first rate and this is the best price I have seen, in addition, having it in 2 days, delivered to your door, makes things so simple.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li>I liked this because it absorbed quickly, moisture well, and didn&#x27;t end up on the pillow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all like the rest of their fabulous product line.</li>
            <li>Excellent stuff, especially for the more mature skin type</li>
            <li>Skin was smooth, plump, glowing.</li>
            <li>I suggest that if you are within reach of a  Dermalogica Skin Bar , you should call for an appointment to go in and  have the experts do a face mapping  and a great facial.</li>
            <li>Skin feels so great the next day..</li>
            <li>and this makes my dry skin feel hydrated and beautiful.</li>
            <li>a rich overnight serum seemed like just the ticket.  </li>
            <li>I wear it at night with super rich repair cream and it makes a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product,  was very surprised to experience a significant change.  </li>
            <li>I clean my face and neck at night and put on serum,</li>
            <li>Soaks into skin so nice and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>Love this Age Smart line.  </li>
            <li>The only one I have found that notice my skin looking smooth, healthy and fine wrinkles vanishing.</li>
            <li>It is pretty powerful on the fine lines as well as the deeper wrinkles.</li>
            <li>the ingredients (listed below) only the first two have been shown to be good, non-irritating plant products for your skin.  </li>
            <li>This products gives your skin the natural youthful glow, love it and won&#x27;t go without.</li>
            <li>so I know it&#x27;s a fresh bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $110.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is absorbed into the skin without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I happen to not be able to use so-called all natural products and oils because the irritate my skin and cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>You can notice it right away when I apply it at night.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy - soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Got samples of this when I had my last facial, and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I like the product it does a good job, but the smell is a little off putting.  </li>
            <li>I have used other Dermalogica products that I have liked.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a big difference when I use this at night under my Super Rich Repair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the Age Smart overnight repair serum.  </li>
            <li>Extremely frustrating because I am sure it&#x27;s good, but turning it upside down, shaking and banging it against your hand does not make it appealing.</li>
            <li>I  use the Pure Night and C-12 Concentrate at night.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if it works well or not, because the smell is so strong that I have only worn it when my husband was not at home.  </li>
            <li>I swear my fine lines have faded and today is only day number 3!!!!!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but I found it quite soothing at night and it really hydrated my skin without it being oily.</li>
            <li>Who knows whether it is making a real difference?  </li>
            <li>This product works well, but I have not seen much of a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]]</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely rancid.</li>
            <li>The way it is dispensed it very time consuming</li>
            <li>I use this serum every night on my face &amp; neck and I have noticed a real difference.</li>
            <li>Works real well.  </li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference in your skin when you use Overnight repair.</li>
            <li>Dr. Oz was the rage thanks to oprah, now AMA will respond to complaints</li>
            <li>Fast delivery-great product.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day and really like it.</li>
            <li>I find that I use more than the 2-3 drops recommended, but I also live in AZ and the climate is extremely dry here, so that might account for it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need to be used in conjuntion with other products (example: another moisturizer over top).  </li>
            <li>Although it says to use a couple drops all over the face I definitely use more, probably more like 10 drops so it can get expensive but so worth it!</li>
            <li>very effective in the harsh Ohio winters and  in increasingly dry home and work environments.  </li>
            <li>Really makes a difference in harsh winter climates to keep your skin moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>no hydration and much older than I am.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a flight attendant and have super dry skin</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>But the seller sent  me  a used serum instead of a new one, I would never recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>I have several other Dermologica products and love them.  </li>
            <li>I have recently begun to switch to some of the Age smart products as I have been aging and this is now one of my all time favorites.  </li>
            <li>My skin loves this product and feels dewey and soft after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>For now I will stick to old faithful, Yonka.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and/or cannot tolerate fragrant plant oils, do not use this.</li>
            <li>This is just the perfect base under your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This serum sinks right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I mix a few drops with Dermalogica Rich Repair Cream.</li>
            <li>It looked to be the same as what the salon used, however this is probably something made for young 20 something girls, not for a 40yr old.</li>
            <li>I have seen dramatic improvements in my skin with Dermalogica products such as Multi Vitamin Therafoliant, Dynamic Skin Recovery and Super Rich Repair, but while this product does no harm I have not seen the marked improvement I am used to with Dermalogica.</li>
            <li>If I add half cream and half serum - effect is  much better.</li>
            <li>Have used this for several years and it is a vital part of my nightly routine.  </li>
            <li>how many times I used the stuff to moisturize, I always looked like I was so tired,</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t have money to throw down, try a sample first.</li>
            <li>It takes very little (4 drops), is quickly absorbed and never feels greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin that can sometimes get red and blotchy.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> You can notice it right away when I apply it at night.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy - soaks right in.</li>
            <li> Got samples of this when I had my last facial, and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I like the product it does a good job, but the smell is a little off putting.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Dermalogica products that I have liked.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference when I use this at night under my Super Rich Repair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the Age Smart overnight repair serum.  </li>
            <li> Extremely frustrating because I am sure it&#x27;s good, but turning it upside down, shaking and banging it against your hand does not make it appealing.</li>
            <li> I  use the Pure Night and C-12 Concentrate at night.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it works well or not, because the smell is so strong that I have only worn it when my husband was not at home.  </li>
            <li> I swear my fine lines have faded and today is only day number 3!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but I found it quite soothing at night and it really hydrated my skin without it being oily.</li>
            <li> Who knows whether it is making a real difference?  </li>
            <li> This product works well, but I have not seen much of a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]]</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely rancid.</li>
            <li> The way it is dispensed it very time consuming</li>
            <li> I use this serum every night on my face &amp; neck and I have noticed a real difference.</li>
            <li> Works real well.  </li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference in your skin when you use Overnight repair.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz was the rage thanks to oprah, now AMA will respond to complaints</li>
            <li> Fast delivery-great product.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and really like it.</li>
            <li> I find that I use more than the 2-3 drops recommended, but I also live in AZ and the climate is extremely dry here, so that might account for it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need to be used in conjuntion with other products (example: another moisturizer over top).  </li>
            <li> Although it says to use a couple drops all over the face I definitely use more, probably more like 10 drops so it can get expensive but so worth it!</li>
            <li> very effective in the harsh Ohio winters and  in increasingly dry home and work environments.  </li>
            <li> Really makes a difference in harsh winter climates to keep your skin moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> no hydration and much older than I am.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a flight attendant and have super dry skin</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> But the seller sent  me  a used serum instead of a new one, I would never recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have several other Dermologica products and love them.  </li>
            <li> I have recently begun to switch to some of the Age smart products as I have been aging and this is now one of my all time favorites.  </li>
            <li> My skin loves this product and feels dewey and soft after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> For now I will stick to old faithful, Yonka.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and/or cannot tolerate fragrant plant oils, do not use this.</li>
            <li> This is just the perfect base under your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This serum sinks right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I mix a few drops with Dermalogica Rich Repair Cream.</li>
            <li> It looked to be the same as what the salon used, however this is probably something made for young 20 something girls, not for a 40yr old.</li>
            <li> I have seen dramatic improvements in my skin with Dermalogica products such as Multi Vitamin Therafoliant, Dynamic Skin Recovery and Super Rich Repair, but while this product does no harm I have not seen the marked improvement I am used to with Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> If I add half cream and half serum - effect is  much better.</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years and it is a vital part of my nightly routine.  </li>
            <li> how many times I used the stuff to moisturize, I always looked like I was so tired,</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t have money to throw down, try a sample first.</li>
            <li> It takes very little (4 drops), is quickly absorbed and never feels greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin that can sometimes get red and blotchy.  </li>
            <li> Have had difficulty with resurfacing products due to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not better, not worse.</li>
            <li> I havnt used it long enough.  </li>
            <li> doubt this is too outrageous to publish, but all my ratings on amazon are honest &amp; usually right on.  </li>
            <li> I usually have tight and dry skin and this product plus the other takes the dryness away, calms the redness, and gets rid of the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I expected use only  this serum , but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product very long</li>
            <li> Softens lines and wrinkles,  takes away the dry look.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer unless you&#x27;re really dry.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle for my dry 30-year-old skin.</li>
            <li> This product make my skin dry if use it without cream.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin - always have, so</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well for my extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Have only been using a few weeks and have seen a difference.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Expensive compared to other products but worth the price.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I returned the product and would not recommend it due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and this is a terrific product.</li>
            <li> Good grief!  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and have dry skin, for reference.</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy off Amazon since it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is hard to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I add a few (3-4) drops to my nighly moisturizer, then apply to my face.  </li>
            <li> It is a serum, soaks in in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but you only need a little just like the rest of the dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> i use it every night and coupled with the other Dermalogical products, people are always shocked to hear I&#x27;m 51 years old!</li>
            <li> Not many drops are needed.  </li>
            <li> and I have very few visible lines or dryness.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was not a success.</li>
            <li> When squeezing the bottle very small drops dispense.</li>
            <li> and I believe it had been opened before and the seal had been broken by another purchaser.  </li>
            <li> I did not like this product because of the unusual horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I returned, I am not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, and my skin went from bad to worse after I started using it.  </li>
            <li> As some of the reviews revealed, it is REALLY difficult to to get the serum out of this container.</li>
            <li> had been using the products all along, but just randomly buying.  </li>
            <li> Weird smell</li>
            <li> Fake product no money refunded</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you order this.</li>
            <li> When I attempted to use the product, the smell was so bad, I was unable to go to sleep until I got up and washed it off.  </li>
            <li> It broke my face out BAD, through out the day no matter</li>
            <li> Use every night and you WILL not be disappointed</li>
            <li> but I hated the container.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This overnight repair is amazing. The only one I have found that notice my skin looking smooth, healthy and fine wrinkles vanishing. I will be &#x27;re ordering when I need again.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products, so I was excited to see this one.  I have very dry skin - always have, so a rich overnight serum seemed like just the ticket.  I really don&#x27;t know if it works well or not, because the smell is so strong that I have only worn it when my husband was not at home.  Even then, it kept me awake.  Roses are lovely, but this is not even an enchanting rose smell.  It&#x27;s rosey-chemical... ugh.  I&#x27;ll try this product again when they fix it.  It&#x27;s not at all like the rest of their fabulous product line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if actually does anything.  I won&#x27;t be ordering it again - it&#x27;s pricey for a product that may or may not benefit me.  Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li> Got samples of this when I had my last facial, and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> If you like oily skin stuff, this is a good option.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve actually been using it on my cuticles as well as my face and neck at night.  Smells good too, like roses.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does have a rose smell but I found it quite soothing at night and it really hydrated my skin without it being oily.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks. Really makes a difference in harsh winter climates to keep your skin moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> This was suggested by my facialist.  I have sensitive dry skin that can sometimes get red and blotchy.  I noticed a big difference when I use this at night under my Super Rich Repair.  I forgot to take it with me when I went out of town and my skin started to have problems again.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all - it&#x27;s like roses (actually my husband loves the smell).</li>
            <li> Softens lines and wrinkles,  takes away the dry look.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> As some of the reviews revealed, it is REALLY difficult to to get the serum out of this container. Extremely frustrating because I am sure it&#x27;s good, but turning it upside down, shaking and banging it against your hand does not make it appealing. Will probably never use and never re-order</li>
            <li> I found this product a couple of weeks ago and I love it.  I wear it at night with super rich repair cream and it makes a huge difference in my skin.  I usually have tight and dry skin and this product plus the other takes the dryness away, calms the redness, and gets rid of the fine lines.  Although it says to use a couple drops all over the face I definitely use more, probably more like 10 drops so it can get expensive but so worth it!</li>
            <li> I got a facial about 2 years ago when the woman used this product on y skin.  The smell is heavenly and your skin feels amazing after applying.  I use it regularly now.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is an oily product but I simply mix it with my moisturizer and the oiliness isn&#x27;t noticeable.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin so nice and makes my skin feel very soft. Would recommend this product to all women and men.</li>
            <li> I havnt used it long enough.  Will follow up with more information.  It smells like lavender and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have bought it before from a retail store.  However, the bottle leaked all over the packaging and I believe it had been opened before and the seal had been broken by another purchaser.  This was supposed to be a \\&quot;new\\&quot; item.</li>
            <li> Great product! Timely shipping.</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years and it is a vital part of my nightly routine.  It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product because of the unusual horrible smell.  When I attempted to use the product, the smell was so bad, I was unable to go to sleep until I got up and washed it off.  I have used other Dermalogica products that I have liked.  I returned the product and would not recommend it due to the smell.</li>
            <li> I have used many Dermalogica products over many years, and am told I have beautiful skin.  I clean my face and neck at night and put on serum, wait until it soaks in pretty good and head to bed.  I&#x27;ve also used their SPF30  moisturizer under makeup for about 10 years.  I&#x27;m giving these products credit for helping me look younger than my 60+ years.</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff, especially for the more mature skin type</li>
            <li> It is the best serum ever,it makes my face look younger and brighter. But the seller sent  me  a used serum instead of a new one, I would never recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Who knows whether it is making a real difference?  But it feels great, and my skin is looking good for 63!</li>
            <li> This products gives your skin the natural youthful glow, love it and won&#x27;t go without. Have tried other serums and this is still the best</li>
            <li> Use every night after cleansing. Very good for moisturising. Expensive compared to other products but worth the price. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica.  This product works well, but I have not seen much of a difference in my skin.  I have seen dramatic improvements in my skin with Dermalogica products such as Multi Vitamin Therafoliant, Dynamic Skin Recovery and Super Rich Repair, but while this product does no harm I have not seen the marked improvement I am used to with Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I adore Dermalogica and have been using their products for years. I have recently begun to switch to some of the Age smart products as I have been aging and this is now one of my all time favorites.  The texture is like an oil, with a lovely scent. I find that I use more than the 2-3 drops recommended, but I also live in AZ and the climate is extremely dry here, so that might account for it. My skin loves this product and feels dewey and soft after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY BEST DERMALOGICA PRODUCT.  I KEEP ONE IN MY CABINET AT ALL TIMES AND SWEAR BY IT.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I tried a sample given to me at the store. Applied it overnight and woke up looking like I had filling done! In a good way of course. Skin was smooth, plump, glowing. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Use every night and you WILL not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I love all Dermalogica products, however this is my favorite.  I mix this with Dermalogica Map and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I love this Overnight Repair Serum.  I add a few (3-4) drops to my nighly moisturizer, then apply to my face.  I can see the difference in my skin, and love it!</li>
            <li> My overnight Repair Serum is AWESOME!  You can notice it right away when I apply it at night.  Thank you Amazon for offering another great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I think the bottle I received is rancid.  I think this is a great product, but I just received an old bottle.  It burns my skin.  I have several other Dermologica products and love them.  I think this is just a one-time experience.  I will purchase this product at a local store so I know it&#x27;s a fresh bottle.</li>
            <li> This serum has the strongest perfume odor of any product I&#x27;ve put on my face.  I made the mistake of getting it too close to my eyes and they were irritated and teared for a couple of hours afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the ingredients (listed below) only the first two have been shown to be good, non-irritating plant products for your skin.  Some of the oils are known irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]] as a better option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Rosa Moschata Seed Oil, Portulaca Pilosa Extract, Sucrose Cocoate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-38, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Alaria Esculenta Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Eugenia Caryophylus (Clove) Flower Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Oil, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Rose Flower Oil, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Murraya Koenigii Leaf Oil, Cinnamomum Zeylanicum (Cinnamon) Leaf Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary), Leaf Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Citronellol, Eugenol, Limonene, Geraniol, Linalool, Benzyl Benzoate Benzyl Salicylate, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Sorbitan Isostearate</li>
            <li> This serum is great! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 months and I have very few visible lines or dryness.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was not a success. The smell is absolutely rancid. The consistency is thick, and my skin went from bad to worse after I started using it.  There are better products on the market.</li>
            <li> I  got a facial done at the Dermalogica Skin Bar in NYC, and it was a wonderful.  After this awesome experience, I was given samples, which included the serum, I could not resist and immediately ordered the products here on Amazon before my samples were done. My face looks beautiful and my skin tone and texture are  exactly what I was hoping to accomplish at 50. I  use the Pure Night and C-12 Concentrate at night. I suggest that if you are within reach of a  Dermalogica Skin Bar , you should call for an appointment to go in and  have the experts do a face mapping  and a great facial. They will also advise on what combination  of products is best suited for your skin. It&#x27;s worth the $110.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the products all along, but just randomly buying.  Now I have a great selection which is BEST suited for me.&lt;br /&gt;Prices are better here at Amazon though.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I swear my fine lines have faded and today is only day number 3!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have had difficulty with resurfacing products due to sensitive skin. This has been so wonderful,  I actually look forward to washing my face at night  just to put this on. It is a serum, soaks in in a few minutes.  Don&#x27;t even need to use a moisturizer unless you&#x27;re really dry. Noticed improvement in pore size and skin smoothness softness.and fine wrinkles. Have only been using a few weeks and have seen a difference.  Felt wonderful the night after my microderm. I am 54 and take really good care of my skin. Great for sensitive skin, nice and dewy, you look refreshed in the morning!</li>
            <li> This product is okay but I hated the container. The way it is dispensed it very time consuming and I find myself reluctant to take the time to use it.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well for my extremely dry skin.  I do not like the fragrance of this product at all.  I would have reordered it if it were not for the smell of the product.  So I will not be reordering unless that changes.</li>
            <li> I tried this as an addition to the Dermalogica therapy repair cream I purchased. It is pretty powerful on the fine lines as well as the deeper wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Just love it. Plain and simple. Love the smell, love the way it makes me feel when I put it on and love the way it makes my skin feel in the morning. I&#x27;m only 27 but I&#x27;m a flight attendant and have super dry skin and this makes my dry skin feel hydrated and beautiful. It&#x27;s the perfect compliment to my dermalogica skin routine.</li>
            <li> This serum sinks right into my skin.  Not many drops are needed.  I do add to my nightly moisturizer, when feeling extra dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent, and I will plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I like the product it does a good job, but the smell is a little off putting.  It kind of smells like tea tree oil</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the improvement as it said but okay. It does feels sticky and have a smell when applied on face.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference in my skin whatsoever. Not better, not worse. So for this price, Id say move on and keep looking.</li>
            <li> I love this oily overnight potion.  i use it every night and coupled with the other Dermalogical products, people are always shocked to hear I&#x27;m 51 years old!</li>
            <li> I use this serum every night on my face &amp; neck and I have noticed a real difference. My face &amp; neck are smoother and softer. I&#x27;m about to turn 44 and people tell me my skin looks like a 30 year olds skin.  It&#x27;s expensive but you only need a little just like the rest of the dermalogica products. I love it!</li>
            <li> Weird smell but I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Fake product no money refunded</li>
            <li> Received this in a sample and I went without it for a while but that won&#x27;t happen again. This is just the perfect base under your moisturizer. I am in my late 50&#x27;s and this is a terrific product. I use it both day and night. You won&#x27;t be sorry if you order this. It also comes in a three sample kit with the Eye Reversal Complex and the Super Rich Repair which makes for a perfect travel size and could also make a great little gift for a friend who loves great products!</li>
            <li> The product is first rate and this is the best price I have seen, in addition, having it in 2 days, delivered to your door, makes things so simple.</li>
            <li> Love Dermalogica.  Love this Age Smart line.  Works real well.  My only complaint is that it is hard to get out of the bottle.  A dropper would have been better.</li>
            <li> Amazing product,  was very surprised to experience a significant change.  A serum that does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, meet my needs and a good price</li>
            <li> I went to a spa and had a facial done using this product line. I liked it so I decided to buy off Amazon since it was a little cheaper. It looked to be the same as what the salon used, however this is probably something made for young 20 something girls, not for a 40yr old. It broke my face out BAD, through out the day no matter how many times I used the stuff to moisturize, I always looked like I was so tired, no hydration and much older than I am. I used it for about 3 weeks. Needless to say I returned, I am not happy with this product at all. For now I will stick to old faithful, Yonka.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the Age Smart overnight repair serum.  It takes very little (4 drops), is quickly absorbed and never feels greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be used in conjuntion with other products (example: another moisturizer over top).  It will be my choice from now on.</li>
            <li> I liked this because it absorbed quickly, moisture well, and didn&#x27;t end up on the pillow. I could see a difference in my skin within a short amount of time</li>
            <li> I am hooked on Dermalogical. You can really feel the difference in your skin when you use Overnight repair. I use alot of their product but Overnight repair has to be my fav.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle for my dry 30-year-old skin. Not greasy - soaks right in. And I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this! I mix a few drops with Dermalogica Rich Repair Cream. I love the smell of itâ€¦very spa-like and relaxing. I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product very long but I can already see an ilmprovement in my skin. I am looking forward to results over time.</li>
            <li> I have used it several years</li>
            <li> Upon opening the label said it should be used in conjunction with a night cream. I&#x27;d have just bought the cream instead. When squeezing the bottle very small drops dispense.</li>
            <li> I daresay extra virgin olive oil may do what this stuff possibly can.  Two weeks  &amp; I see no difference except the feel of oil on my face.  and for those bucks it should knock 15 years off this face!  this was a mothers day gift certificate or no justification for the cost.  relieved someone&#x27;s Jet Lag??  - oh please, I didn&#x27;t get off the shrimp boat last night....&lt;br /&gt; there&#x27;s a lot hype going on with these reviews I think.  Dr. Oz was the rage thanks to oprah, now AMA will respond to complaints he&#x27;s a quack.&lt;br /&gt;At my age, I think if something costs big bucks, American women just gravitate &amp; stand in line for it.  Example:  Aveda hair coloring - &amp;#34;oh it&#x27;s only made with organic blah blah&amp;#34;  Good grief!  My last highlighting  was my second and last with Aveda,  Hair was SO DAMAGED!  Only then did I remember how years ago it fried my hair!! (yes, with a different stylist)  And I know we need CHEMICALS to lighten hair &amp; I&#x27;m fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;no doubt this is too outrageous to publish, but all my ratings on amazon are honest &amp; usually right on.  So if you don&#x27;t have money to throw down, try a sample first.</li>
            <li> This product make my skin dry if use it without cream. I expected use only  this serum , but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. If I add half cream and half serum - effect is  much better.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery-great product.  Everything was great.  Would recommend this product to everyone.  I use it every day and really like it.</li>
            <li> The serum works so much better than a cream.  It is absorbed into the skin without a greasy feel.  Skin feels so great the next day..</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and/or cannot tolerate fragrant plant oils, do not use this. I received a sample from my aesthetician. I did not read the ingredients (which are extra tiny on a sample). The product is all oils. I happen to not be able to use so-called all natural products and oils because the irritate my skin and cause me to break out. (It&#x27;s better living through chemistry, for me concerning skin care.) I looked up the ingredients online after slathering it on my face and thought I  smelled rose hip seed oil. Also, it felt kind of burn-y. And oily. I am in my late 40&#x27;s and have dry skin, for reference. So, if you can&#x27;t tolerate fragrant plant oils, do not use this.</li>
            <li> Killer product!!! this in addition to the super rich has effectively removed the dehydration lines in my lower cheeks.  very effective in the harsh Ohio winters and  in increasingly dry home and work environments.  scent is rather romantic  but doesn&#x27;t cling around.</li>
