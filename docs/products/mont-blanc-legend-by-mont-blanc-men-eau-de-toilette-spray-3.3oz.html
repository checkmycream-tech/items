            <li> She won&#x27;t let me wear any other scent now.</li>
            <li> At the price, half of what you would spend at Macy&#x27;s or other department stores!  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> If you like something that isn&#x27;t harsh you will like this.</li>
            <li> half the price!  </li>

            <li> delivered fast and came as described</li>
            <li> The package  arrived very quickly and was exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites to wear....Great product, authentic as well.</li>
            <li> I like the scent. Also  cool looking bottle. My girlfriend loves it on me. She won&#x27;t let me wear any other scent now.</li>
            <li> Smell good and have good resistance and I like. I recommend for does man that like to smell good. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and love the smell of this! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product. Got it as a gift for my brother and he loved it. Got it on Amazon because it was 25 bucks cheaper than at the store</li>
            <li> This is a masculine scent that possibly due to the atomizer is stronger than I am used to. I have used moonshine and polo sport. I use moonshine as a daily cologne and polo sport for a \\&quot;day off\\&quot; cologne. I will be using this cologne more as a going out cologne. Like I said before this is a great scent, but for me the atomizer (no matter how I adjust how the spray hitting me) seems to douse me with scent. This makes the cologne edge on making me smellable from the door (a quality I mock in most men who purposefully do it). All in all it is a great scent that my girlfriend loves, just watch out for coming on too strong (1 spray walked into will do it).</li>
            <li> Ordered 2. Only received one! Is it on back order or do I need to reorder???</li>
            <li> It has a very distinct, refreshing aroma, however it does not last as long as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> My huband wears this because (I) love it !!!!! very manly scent.....he gets alot of compliments that he smells good,its the best smelling cologne for men in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> The fragrance last for a long period of time</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this cologne. I buy it for all the men I need to get gifts for. The people I&#x27;ve given it to as gifts have told me about getting multiple compliments as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas. He likes it and I love it! It&#x27;s a great, sexy scent w/o being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast delivery and I love the smell. My husband is gonna love it!</li>
            <li> I always get many remarks on how great I smell, fron both men and women! It&#x27;s got a masculine scent, but there&#x27;s also a light womanly side to it that women love! It makes so that you&#x27;re not over powerings like you just came out of the locker room smelling like old spice, dial, and other guy smells that are none to pleasing. Trust me, if you&#x27;re a confident person, you&#x27;ll want this product, and buy it from this seller! Excellebt price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle that I have ordered from Amazon.  This is a great cologne!!  I get compliments from both men and women.  It smells amazing.  At the price, half of what you would spend at Macy&#x27;s or other department stores!  It does resemble Abercrombie and Fitch&#x27;s Fierce, also half the price!  I ordered it on a Friday and received it the following Monday!  Great price, Great value.. Fast shipping!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> bought it because it&#x27;s my fiance&#x27;s favorite scent. i love the scent, not too strong but strong enough to be noticed. one or two sprays and i&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> Smell is not too long lasting about four hours</li>
            <li> Very Good Item and Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Loved it and came in fast</li>
            <li> This cologne has a nice clean smell. Purchased as a gift after smelling a card sample. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> its worth at macy&#x27;s is $70 - $90 and here it is half price and the same quality. proud of this purchase :) !!!</li>
            <li> It was on time. I was notified every step of the way. Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to fill the void of abercrombie fierce.  Not exactly a match, but does smell fantastic to me, and I can quote multiple women saying &amp;#34;that is how a man is supposed to smell like&amp;#34;  Good volume/cost ratio, will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> My husband got this the first time as a gift. He liked it and  since then he  keeps using this perfume.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD AND SO QUICKLY</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and good packaging. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it is very manly when it comes to smell It&#x27;s not to strong either.</li>
            <li> bottle half empty and not the original spray</li>
            <li> Great value.  Quick ship</li>
            <li> From the moment you lift the cap off of the bottle you realize you have a great purchase. A very classy, adult, Night out on the down in a 3peice suit, sensual scent. I opened the box at my job at the clerical desk and let the female clerk smell it first. Her eyes bucked and then rolled to the top of her head. Lol &amp;#34;it literally happened just that way.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase. Enough said!</li>
            <li> This cologne is a great present if you&#x27;re considering it for a gentleman or if you&#x27;re a guy on the fence thinking about buying it. Personally I get tons of compliments from ladies and other guys too. It is not a strong smelling cologne like a Versace, but it lasts and makes a good impression from those who you&#x27;re in contact with!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I ordered and all my expectations was met. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Getting a lot of compliments. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. Shipping was fast and packed well. Price is fantastic! Recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just became my fav perfume, when I put it on me, it&#x27;s like magic.......</li>
