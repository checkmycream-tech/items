            <li>Great, am totally happy with it.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>I started using this product one month ago and is great, without it I feel like my nails are nacked.</li>
            <li>love it!!  </li>
            <li>my manicure very nicely 2 weeks ..</li>
            <li>but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  </li>
            <li>This Gelish structure gel is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I loved the colors and my nails always looked great</li>
            <li>Its good stuff but</li>
            <li>Works well and good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure.</li>
            <li>It provides the strength and support needed to deliver superior results.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good quality in</li>
            <li>ex.2 years now, unfortunatly this time it arrives not in good conditions.. it was leaking all over the envelope.</li>
            <li>It arrived in good condition with no leaks and was sealed.</li>
            <li>The reason I did give it three stars and not a one star though, was because save for the packaging nightmare, the product itself is really good.</li>
            <li>waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>Imagine my delight with this product (which is EXTREMELY easy to use), when after a week my gel manicure looks as good as the day I applied it!  </li>
            <li>Works great, love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to all that awesome, structure is also a pretty good way to apply gems.</li>
            <li>altho I saw some reviews that said it peeled off even after using the Gelish foundation, most of the reviews seemed to say that with the foundation it worked great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to even out, hold, and protect glitter or 3D bits and bobs on your nail as the consistency is thicker than top coat.</li>
            <li>I have many Gelish polishes that I have ordered here through Amazon and all have been great.</li>
            <li>My first purchase was a Sally Hansen gel nail kit, which was a great starter kit and gave a beautiful set of nails.  </li>
            <li>WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!  </li>

            <li>Amazing adds strength to your nails</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it came in a bottle with a brush for easier application.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li>so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li>You need your own brush or use the foundation brush.</li>
            <li>have always been into doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>I followed her instructions and am loving my nails ever since!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do my own gels at home using gelish products.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a pro at removing either to be honest.  </li>
            <li>Loving the Gelish system.</li>
            <li>Also I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the kind of thing you can build tips with -</li>
            <li>I am happy with my results, I gel my nail every three week and this product really works great.</li>
            <li>You also need to buy your own brush to apply this product.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel polish for about 6 months now</li>
            <li>You use a brush and kind of spackle it on there.</li>
            <li>So I started doing my own Gelish Nails at home</li>
            <li>So friendly, so fast, best deals, and great selection.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to soak off.</li>
            <li>It makes your nails very strong though.</li>
            <li>This gel came off very easily.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li>but I love  doing my own nails</li>
            <li>And Direct Nail Supply here on Amazon is THE BEST EVER!!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy using it ,very nice and easy to use ,love working with it and as with all gelish products as well</li>
            <li>Received quickly and used for the first time and it works great!  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, went on great.</li>
            <li>texture of this gel enhancement is very smooth, yet dense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds up so well, goes on easy, and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as easy to use as the polish as you need your own brush, but it&#x27;s thicker and adds strength.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so awesome good by to tapping loose glitter onto the nail!!!</li>
            <li>Yes iam just one more added to Rate this product</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Just love to do my nails at home.  </li>
            <li>I use gelish products all the time and this is my all time lease favorite.</li>
            <li>Better yet, they no longer hurt and for that I am eternally grateful.  </li>
            <li>leaks out of container - works ok</li>
            <li>You can also cure this product using the Senstionail Led Lamp :-)</li>
            <li>It does help strengthen your nails and be creative by yourself or be pampered and have then done,</li>
            <li>Elegant\\&quot;, applying 2 coats (each cured for 2 minutes under UV lamp), and a top coat of Top It Off.</li>
            <li>the Gelish Top It Off</li>
            <li>Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li>I cover this with the Top</li>
            <li>so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li>Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li>Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>

            <li>They have the best colors and this product is no different.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the application instructions to a T.</li>
            <li>Used it twice and love it</li>
            <li>Will buy more when out.</li>
            <li>Mostly because my nails are always breaking and therefore hurt.</li>
            <li>my favorite thing about it is that it is soak-off.  </li>
            <li>Most builder gels are designed to be a permanent addition to your nail...</li>
            <li>Also, if you want to put tips on your nails, you will not be able to do it with a gel polish kit.  </li>
            <li>my favorite thing about it is that it is soak-off.  </li>
            <li>Most builder gels are designed to be a permanent addition to your nail...</li>
            <li>Works and cures as promised and the price was fantastic!</li>
            <li>Great price I will absolutely by from this seller again.</li>
            <li>This gel was the last piece for a perfect recipe in regards to nail strength!</li>
            <li>I use the structure gel to give them more strength.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and use one coat per manicure.  </li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>Works ok but can not replace a trip to the nail salon.</li>
            <li>I love this gel, it gave my nails the added strength I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I did the foundation, structure gel, and then the top coat.</li>
            <li>My clients LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Love it love it</li>
            <li>, I thought it would be better for the nails.</li>
            <li>as many of the reviewers have suggested and swear by how well it works for them that way.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They have been growing and getting healthy for over a year after having acrylic nails for years.</li>
            <li>So I bought the gelish starter kit and was pleased but still needed something stronger.</li>
            <li>I recommend any harmony product. :)</li>
            <li>i love glitter nails, i just take my brush and dip it in the pot and then the glitter and brush it on, then cure</li>
            <li>I use this over my foundation coat of Gelish polishes, and under my color of choice, but it can be applied over the top of the color as well.  </li>
            <li>I waited to review this product before reviewing it because I wanted to be able to share the ease of removal.  </li>
            <li>Because I want to be able to change my polish sooner than two weeks</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>it was ok</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the Gelish look</li>
            <li>You can also use this with acrylic powder for even more strength.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I cure a coat of the Foundation gel, then apply and cure a coat of the Structure gel, and then continue with the color application and Top It</li>
            <li>Off top coat.</li>
            <li>Love the gelish foundation will buy more Thank you</li>
            <li>added 2 coats of color and finally top it off ,led setting between each coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a favorite hobby of mine.  </li>
            <li>Then, I researched a bit more.  </li>
            <li>The structure gel kept the nail from bending and splitting more while it grew out.</li>
            <li>So, yes; I ordered the structure gel, the Gelish Foundation and the Top it</li>
            <li>, it does what I wanted it to do, and more.</li>
            <li>(and more??  </li>
            <li>and then I use the Top</li>
            <li>+, more than the price of the product.</li>
            <li>Love this product allows my nails to be longer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You then apply the polish layers and top</li>
            <li>Felt like it made my nails chip and oral way more with it than without it.</li>
            <li>I have used 2 times now and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it on top of glitter that I scrubbed in and it helps get rid of the bumpiness with out using 2 or 3 coats of top coat.</li>
            <li>If gelish could come up with a better packaging situation with this product I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine using the Gelish polish without this, but I wish it did do more to help my nails once the polish is removed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too pleased with this structure gel from Gelish.</li>
            <li>I normally get 2-3 weeks of beautiful nails before chipping.</li>
            <li>Apply Gelish Top It Off and cure two minutes. 9.</li>
            <li>I love structure</li>
            <li>Love - luv</li>
            <li>OOOO &amp; one more tip instead of using a UV Gel nail polish.</li>
            <li>this is a great product, will continue to use, and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Again, my polish looked great after 2 weeks, and I highly recommend adding this to your gel routine</li>
            <li>I now have long beautiful fingernails!  </li>
            <li>I read all the great reviews for this product, and I had huge hopes that this was the miracle product to make my nails strong and pretty, and it does work, but</li>
            <li>It makes my nails strong and more resilent.  </li>
            <li>The key to a good structure application is a good foundation layer.</li>
            <li>But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now,it may be prolongs one more day chip free nails, but without it, it is ok also.</li>
            <li>Adds a great strength and sturdiness to natural nails.</li>
            <li>Great so far.</li>
            <li>After you are done with the 1 or 2 layers, then you finish it with Gelish nail polish color, do your nail designs, uv/led light it, then the top coat...</li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use it every time and its easy to appy and self levels.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt seem to interfere with the removal process either-soaks off easily,</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, not bulky.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use this yourself if you have an led lamp.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and soaks off easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I can apply this easily.</li>
            <li>I found the structure to be extremely easy to use, when applied with a nail art brush.  </li>
            <li>It all cures very quickly under an LED lamp</li>
            <li>Will make your nails stronger, easy to apply and remove it.</li>
            <li>An extremely strong shield for my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit runny compared to the Structure Gel (black jar) but great for mixing your own pigments, glitters &amp; setting in jewels/studs/cabochons.</li>
            <li>Once again Andrea on Chickettes and her blog were not only very convincing but spot on correct!</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my nails feel and makes them feel so much thicker too!!</li>
            <li>That was a huge, time consuming pain in the backside.  </li>
            <li>The great thing with regular polish is you can remove the RPN with non- acetone remover and</li>
            <li>This product, as well as all of the Harmony Gelish products have to be cured with a UV light</li>
            <li>The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>finished off with the soak off gel nail polish on the color \\&quot;Light</li>
            <li>I have found it is much easier and more economical to purchase acrylic (water-base) paints and mix my own colors of choice for my nail polish.  </li>

            <li>[...]&lt;br /&gt;Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li>They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have this nails and this provided a smooth build up to protect my nails.</li>
            <li>have tried everything to remedy this; NutriNail, Julep MIghty Nail, Derma Nail, OPI Envy</li>
            <li>EZ &amp; smooth application.</li>
            <li>However, since I do this at home and own the whole set up,  </li>
            <li>Works great when using with acrylic tips &amp; gelish to add that extra strength.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li>I love gels/nail art and prefer to do it myself because it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>08-14-16: I STILL love this product and am ordering all fresh stuff today.</li>
            <li>I just paint on the foundation gel by gelish, or this could work too, and dip my nails in acrylic powder, then put my nails under the led light.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky, but works amazing.</li>
            <li>Remove sticky induction layer with lint free wipe and alcohol.</li>
            <li>Tend to cuticles, buff lightly with fine grit, clean off with alcohol, apply dehydrator to nail.</li>
            <li>I use a #6 flat brush and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Also, it was super easy to apply just like if you were painting your nail with polish.</li>
            <li>I added this to my nail routine now and my nails are super strong.</li>
            <li>super easy to apply</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s buildable and it really helps to keep your nails strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>Use PH first, than foundation, structure gel, gel polish &amp; lastly top it off.</li>
            <li>I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I ordered two!</li>
            <li>I love it because it really works!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy, no ecstatic, to say that my nails are not chipping or breaking - even though I type all day long.  </li>
            <li>Original review:</li>
            <li>Try mixing glitters it is fun!</li>
            <li>My nails are very long and look great.</li>
            <li>Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li>Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li>Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li>this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li>I actually had better luck just poking this structure gel into the crack (by kind of jabbing at it, backwards with the brush) than I did using a silk wrap and putting structure gel over it.</li>
            <li>I saw many positive reviews on Youtube and wanted to try it</li>
            <li>Refer to original feedback for full details.</li>
            <li>This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.  </li>
            <li>This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li>I put one coat of Top It off over my whole nail.  </li>
            <li>Bought this along with the full size Basix kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>But this always gets EVERYWHERE and is super sticky to clean up.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for full sets twice</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>hoopfully next time it will arrives in good conditions</li>
            <li>Overall Good Product, Will Probably Purchase Another One</li>
            <li>and it still isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>Now I have the same good results everyone&#x27;s raving about.</li>
            <li>and I gotta say that I love their whole product line.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>Buff your natural nail using a super fine grit (pay extra attention to the cuticle area where it is most oily and dont miss your sides) use the cleanse to remove the dust, use a good amount of ph and dont forget to dab a bit under your free edge, apply foundation in a super thin layer using swirl and swipe motions (one brush load wiped clean will coat all nails perfectly, start with your thumb and cap your free edges)</li>
            <li>but this is a good product, it works great under gel nail products, or with acrylics, and also alone, I have ben wearing it alone the most, but have used it in every way, and I will continue to use this, and buy more, I do recommend this, since it can be used in many ways if you do gel nails or acrylics, and also just as a base for your nails to look pretty if you don&#x27;t even wear polish, and to help give them some more strength, or to put under gel or regular polish to add more strength and coverage ect...</li>
            <li>It brings strength to my nail, but behaves like a gel polish in that it&#x27;s not as thick, is easy to apply/work with, and is incredibly self-leveling.  </li>
            <li>It brings strength to my nail, but behaves like a gel polish in that it&#x27;s not as thick, is easy to apply/work with, and is incredibly self-leveling.  </li>
            <li>But they did work fine as a double layer to make my brittle nails more strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing the great strength that other reviewers seem to be talking about with this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is good if you want a little more strength of gel.</li>
            <li>It is great for soft nails that bend easily, it adds just enough support that they are strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li>I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li>Looks great as a clear coat if you want to wear your natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time the foundation that comes in the Fabulous Four Gelish system is strong enough when I use two coats under my polish color.  </li>
            <li>and I love the added strength it gives your nails; so I purchased this as I was using several coats of top coat to get the desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Much better than laying on multiple layers of top coat.</li>
            <li>[highly recommend over a UV] and my nails have never looked and felt better.  </li>
            <li>First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I also regularly mix it with Martha Stewart fine glitters to create my own glitter nails with my own custom mixed colors.  </li>
            <li>However, I just found a great use for it when you tear a nail and don&#x27;t want to cut it down.  </li>
            <li>Does thicken and reinforce natural nails that have been damaged by impatient gel polish removal, and it&#x27;s excellent as a smoothing coat after very glittery gel polish, and before Top It Off,</li>
            <li>the structure gel remains untouched, allowing you to easily change colors without going thru the whole gel removal process.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and really works helping strengthen the nail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a product that I could you along with my gel polish that would strengthen my nails &amp; I&#x27;ve found exactly it!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful replacement for my weak nails and chips without the smell and chemicals of acrylic liquid.</li>
            <li>Excellent if you have nail ridges, little imperfections or just want a bit of strength for sensitive nails as you grow them out.  </li>
            <li>First application was super easy, the product does not run and holds shape which is a big difference than the top coat I was using.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money</li>
            <li>This will not give you the strength of acrylics or gel nails but will give you more than your natural nails alone.</li>
            <li>picture of my nails is after a week&#x27;s worth of growth.</li>
            <li>: Make sure you do not leave your brush (with product on it), or the structure gel, near the curing lamp, as this might harden the gel/brush.</li>
            <li>Also in regard to using after acrylics, it covers the ridge left by the dremel nicely even when used without color.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel nail manicure for quite some time after having acrylic nails for several years.  </li>
            <li>Makes doing my nails a lot of fun</li>
            <li>Next time, I will remember to use the warm towel when I soak and see if that helps.</li>
            <li>and I assumed it all had to be done fresh each time.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought my own 2mm</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I was able to apply without difficulty.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love all Gelish products so far.</li>
            <li>If the surface isn&#x27;t glassy smooth and even you can apply a bit more structure gel before curing, or cure all and do a second coat of structure.</li>
            <li>Shipped pretty quick and does was it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Thanks Gelish for such an exceptional product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure it made much of a difference in my nails, plus it doesn&#x27;t make a good top coat</li>
            <li>takes long time to make it but it is very good compare to regular polish.</li>
            <li>right after I put on the foundation gel.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>that a day the gel just peeled right off my nails.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with considering am new to using structure gels.</li>
            <li>It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li>I use a flat square nail art brush wiped almost clean, be sure to cape</li>
            <li>My nails are nice and long now</li>
            <li>and I found my nails growing nice and long</li>
            <li>Note that you want this structure gel if you want a soak off, not a hard gel that needs to be sanded off or kept on and filled.  </li>
            <li>It seems a little more challenging to remove it vs. polish alone</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would be strong and allow my natural nails to grow below.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, I believe that I have found my new gel!!!  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The polish was still very much adhered to my nail, but with some work it peeled off.</li>
            <li>I just use the brush from my old nail polish that I&#x27;ve cleaned and that seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take that long to cure.</li>
            <li>It did, however, give me a nice full two week manicure with no lifting and little wear.</li>
            <li>Such fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li>the only difference is that the structure gel is a lot thicker making the nails just more stronger.</li>
            <li>I noticed when i used it that it is the exact consistency of the foundation gel.</li>
            <li>But after getting my first shellac manicure, I was sold.  </li>
            <li>it will last better.  </li>
            <li>Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li>then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li>Did the job,  will continue to use this when I do my regular gel manis without tips just to get a bit more strength.</li>
            <li>I have researched and tried many different methods of care.</li>
            <li>Nails from a reputable salon would last 5 days max until they lifted and cracked.</li>
            <li>Not too thick, which is also great.</li>
            <li>Which also works pretty well</li>
            <li>I really love it actually -</li>
            <li>Structure seems to make my manicure slightly more solid feeling, but not like the acrylics.  </li>
            <li>apply the nail dehydrator first, then Gel Foundation and cure for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>This shipped so fast!</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, it looks light lavender in the bottle</li>
            <li>That is consistently happening</li>
            <li>which is what I have been doing, however it seems to only stay on for about a week, then starts to peel off, and I hope that is not damaging my nails more</li>
            <li>I love the gelish line and this product is no different.</li>
            <li>Because of the packaging and extra step involved with using Structure gel, I am looking for a better nail strengthener that I can use with my at-home gel manicures.</li>
            <li>first i dehydrated, then foundation and led set it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I did not use the foundation, because I didn&#x27;t know I was supposed to</li>
            <li>I also made sure to do an extra coat of structure gel.  </li>
            <li>I use Foundation, about 2 coats of the Gelish Structure Gel, my white tip polish, and Top it off.  </li>
            <li>If youfeel like another coat of structure gel is in order prior to the top it off,  by all means, go for it.</li>
            <li>I questioned weather or not you would be able to see a color difference in the nail when you did a &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; rather than soaking it all off in acetone and starting over.  </li>
            <li>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li>Would love it if came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li>the extra strength that they need to be able to grow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different systems in my nails (some of them applied by professionals and some by myself) and the result after removal alwas was an even more fragil and damage nail than it was before.</li>
            <li>When I first opened this package, there was sticky residue all over.  </li>
            <li>I have gone back to just using the basics and get much better results.</li>
            <li>WILL MOST DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li>f you like the look of glitter embedded in gel over the entire nail but with a totally smooth, glassy finish, this is what you need!</li>
            <li>First you prep your nails</li>
            <li>This product adds significant strenght and rigidity to your nail specially if you apply multiple coats.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s super durable yet easy to soak off, while proving to be an excellent strengthening base for brittle/bendy nails.</li>
            <li>I am not as thrilled with this product as I have been with every other Gelish product that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last very long, pops off easily, but good for overlays on natural nails.</li>
            <li>The nail that was split has grown out enough to where I actually filed the split part off and stll have good length on that nail.  </li>
            <li>PERFECT AND THICK ENOUGH NOT TO BREAK!</li>
            <li>A little thicker than gel polish but super easy to apply!</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li>Also, I have had consistent and super speedy shipping turn around by always choosing to order my polishes and nail needs from Direct Nail Supply.  </li>
            <li>Even with my high wattage professional light, this stuff just won&#x27;t harden.</li>
            <li>I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li>(But I prefer tapping loose glitter into the sticky layer. :)</li>
            <li>Most builder gels are thick and gloopy, and unlike the gel polishes, does not self-level as quickly or as easily</li>
            <li>But no matter what, it is VERY important to rough up your nail surface with a file.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li>I understand that it is most definitely a different method of care, but it allows my nails to grow out naturally under a protective shield!</li>
            <li>I just used a craft brush to apply the structure gel and my nails are hard, glossy, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Only have used it a few times but seems to work great.</li>
            <li>Came so fast so excite.</li>
            <li>really give this a five stars</li>
            <li>This really lives by it&#x27;s name, STRUCTURE.  </li>
            <li>The Structure allows them to be much stronger</li>
            <li>but i dont use it much</li>
            <li>I tried this product and didn&#x27;t like it all that much.</li>
            <li>Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li>Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li>My nails are so much stronger &amp; my gel polish lasts a lot longer as well....</li>
            <li>This product is also very pliable once it does cure and all is said and done.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Structure DOES work with nail tips, but keep in mind that if you DO decide to use nail tips, the very method that you would use to remove the color or the Structure gel--which is putting acetone-soaked pads on your nails--will also remove the nail tips themselves.  </li>

            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and it really help my nails not to chip or break because even though you have gel polish on them you nail can still chip and break.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would act like a ridge filler, but really it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>My nails are not splitting and are very durable thanks to this</li>
            <li>It did make this baby nail a tad thicker but not really noticably to others, just me .It made all my nails stronger for sure.</li>
            <li>I think this is really going to help when I am without acrylics.</li>
            <li>It really helps to grow out your nails.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think this is a necessity in the gelish line</li>
            <li>Thanks Gelish.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful that I would not see chipping and splitting during the anticipated 2 weeks wear time.</li>
            <li>I could have gone much longer.</li>
            <li>Not so much for creating nail extensions.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really paint over it either.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to dump another $17 into this &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; but I really wanted it to work, so I did.  </li>
            <li>Recommend HIGHLY!</li>
            <li>I had acrylic nails on which really damaged my nails.</li>
            <li>Off to really give it that shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the structure gel, don&#x27;t swirl or mix it around too much because it causes air bubbles.</li>
            <li>nails seem to be much stronger , and the gel adheres well to the nail.  </li>
            <li>It gave so much strength and durability to my nails</li>
            <li>I had it on for 2 weeks and could have gone on much longer</li>
            <li>remove I just used a curved metal nail tool to gently lift off my nail bed.</li>
            <li>but it seems much thicker to me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t seen much of a difference from using this product.</li>
            <li>much thicker than the nail polish UV gel.</li>
            <li>I really needed this stuff.</li>
            <li>So I had to figure out how do I use this with their system; just in case if anyone wants to know here&#x27;s how you do it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to apply extremely thin layers and cure between each on and don&#x27;t forget to paint the top of your nail to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it otherwise it&#x27;ll lift faster than it should.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I could just use an extra layer of gelish color and get the same result as this.</li>
            <li>You can also add glitter directly to the structure gel and have extra sparkly nails :)  </li>
            <li>Adds great strength ans a nice base for polish.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li>I found that most brands make a more pliable version of their builder gels (IBD makes a plain clear gel, for example, not labelled as \\&quot;Builder\\&quot; gel, but just as clear gel).  </li>
            <li>I originally wanted to use these to extend my short nails, but the tips were very jelly and ripped off.</li>
            <li>so I damaged my nails pretty bad, this stuff totally filled in the pitted spots in my nails and leveled them out and was very easy to apply the consistency was easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I love this product &amp; all other Gelish products.</li>
            <li>Not what I was expecting since I was pleased with the other gelish product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to reconsider if you are looking for a product that will make your nails a bit stronger and not peel within days.</li>
            <li>Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use with loose glitter.</li>
            <li>I recently tried IBD strong builder gel and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of those cracks appear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked great and the thin coat applied after the foundation/base, and before the color, cured under the UV lamp to a very shiny clear coat.</li>
            <li>First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li>Builder gel strengthens your nails, gel polish is simply nail color that cures under a light so that it dries completely by the time you are done, and can go straight to doing your business.</li>
            <li>Then I found Structure Gel &amp; knew I&#x27;d found the secret to a successful home manicure.  </li>
            <li>It Was Only 3/4&#x27;s Full.</li>
            <li>I tried and tried to open it but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Having been a professional nail tech for many years, I&#x27;m well acquainted with the fact that things can dry up when they have been opened, used and then not cleaned and sealed properly.</li>
            <li>This works very well and gives a little more strength to my manicure.  </li>
            <li>My damaged-via-acrylic nails are stronger than ever and have a whole new life.</li>
            <li>I followed the steps very carefully, 4 times, and finally decided my time was worth more.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for those who have thin nails and need just a bit more strength than they would get with a gel manicure.</li>
            <li>Even if my manicure doesn&#x27;t end up lasting 2 weeks, I&#x27;m excited that the results looks so professional and all I had to do was add an extra step in my polish process to get such fantastic results!</li>
            <li>Its kind of hard to work with sometimes, but less really is more.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so bummed because I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone using Gelish.</li>
            <li>I have mostly used OPI Axxium (in the little pots) until I started using LED products and switched to OPI GelColor.</li>
            <li>If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li>so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good  for strength and growing natural nails, not good for tips.</li>
            <li>So it does a MUCH better job of molding with my uneven, wily nails.  </li>
            <li>So it does a MUCH better job of molding with my uneven, wily nails.  </li>
            <li>Ok...I have been a fanatic about doing my own gel manicures for over 3 years now.</li>
            <li>When using normal polish remember to cap the nail and use a non-acetone polish remover.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super thick and is kind of hard to spread in a smooth layer on the nail; however, once it is on, it really strengthens the nail and just looks like clear polish.</li>
            <li>And yes it&#x27;s true, your polish is 100% dry when finished.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re using tips, you will have to re-apply a new set each time.rs sufficiently imo, and are yet another expense.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re using tips, you will have to re-apply a new set each time.</li>
            <li>Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li>Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>problem with builder gels that cure to that level of rigidity is that if you have thin, pliable nails, or an uneven or damaged nail surface (dents, ridges, dings) like I do, there&#x27;s a good chance that the gel will lift...and very quickly, at that.  </li>
            <li>I currently am using it on a broken toe nail as a foundation and have found it to be very effective.</li>
            <li>for 30 seconds which is amazing:-0 WOW!</li>
            <li>Well that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s EXACTLY THE SAME INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li>Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li>I could not love this product any more than I already do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The removal is exactly the same as when you don&#x27;t use structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: As promised, it is self-leveling, especially if you hold your hand palm-up for the first bit of cure time.</li>
            <li>After looking at the ingredients this product is the exact same as the foundation.</li>
            <li>I think a key to this is doing a proper manicure and making sure you get all the cuticle off your nail prior to applying it, which I did.</li>
            <li>I thought that it was a soak off for the purpose of not leaving damage to the natural nail bed?!?</li>
            <li>Edit: this is NOT the same exact thing as the Foundation, it is a thicker formulation.   </li>
            <li>My nails are stable enough to grow twice as long and my normal 14day wear will last days longer and in better condition.</li>
            <li>Quick cure time 30 sec with LED lamp.</li>
            <li>I do my own at home gel polish, even with that my nails are weak and often rip at the edges.  </li>
            <li>Applying was simple, removal was super simple too.  </li>
            <li>I have just completed my 1st attempt of DIY Gelish nails and they turned out great, and the Structure Gel provides the extra protection and strength that my weak nails need!</li>
            <li>Works great over my natural nails, and causes far less damage than the hard gel.  </li>
            <li>The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li>I also scrubbed the brush downward into the existing gel polish to be certain to  fill in any tiny gaps if there were any.</li>
            <li>We do several gel polish applications per day at the salon and 80% of the people we add Structure to their nails to give them a little bit more strength.</li>
            <li>First off it lifted in one day and second it does major damage to your nail bed during removal.</li>
            <li>Then apply two coasts of Gel polish followed by top coat (curing between each coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect hard as nails, Nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have weak nails - ones that break off easily or flake - then STRUCTURE is exactly what you need.  </li>
            <li>Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li>but with just one coat it is clear.</li>
            <li>this protects your natural nails</li>
            <li>I even just had two co-workers make comments about my \\&quot;professionally manicured nails\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This worked well and allowed me to protect her soft, damaged nails while adding some strength without a lot of thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.  </li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li>flick off old polish from</li>
            <li>Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li>Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li>Voila, nail fixed.  </li>
            <li>Now the splits in his nails are nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>You can use these pliable builder gels as the foundation step of your gel polish application, as long as you don&#x27;t wipe with alcohol between the pliable builder gel and your first coat of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also kept an old brush from a finished bottle of foundation, and I use that to brush it on my nails.</li>
            <li>I find that it adds strength to my natural nails that were weakened by over a decade of continual acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li>but I went much lighter the subsequent two times, so that was not it.  </li>
            <li>I just applied it yesterday and so far no issues with it.</li>
            <li>This product self levels, it builds the nail , yet it still looks natural.</li>
            <li>this a try if you find your nails brittle, soft or flaky.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find it in the mail just after a couple days of ordering.</li>
            <li>It has been 3 days so far and no lifting, chipping or anything.</li>
            <li>I go from natural nails to acrylics a lot</li>
            <li>It has not cracked my natural nail</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li>I did research &amp; decided to invest in the complete kit &amp; professional tools.  </li>
            <li>It really helps strengthen my nails and prevent breakage; however, my nails still occasionally chip and peel even when using Structure gel.</li>
            <li>I also added the PH bonder to the natural nail after filing.</li>
            <li>My nails are naturally peel-y</li>
            <li>Once you figure out how to use it, it is simple and really helps the polish to stay on the nails longer.</li>
            <li>I have a damaged thumb nail that splits continually and the structure helps keep it from spliting further and lasts the whole manicure.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCTS LEAVES MY NATURAL NAILS</li>
            <li>Not too helpful for soft nails.</li>
            <li>; File the edges, push back the cuticles and gently buff your nail bed to take away the shine with a 180 nail grit file.</li>
            <li>Next you Cleanse wipe your nail to take away the dust or 90%+ Alcohol, then use the PH Bond, 1 thin layer of the Foundation, uv/led light this, then use this product (Harmony Gelish Structure Gel), uv/led light it,</li>
            <li>When \\&quot;tipping the ends\\&quot; .. if I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li>I will never go back to the hard gels [like IBD and the other Gelish] because of the lifting which is such a pain, and the incredible difficulty and time consumption of removal.  </li>
            <li>You can also use regular nail polish, but I recommend a fast dry regular nail polish as you have to wait for the product to completely dry before you use the Top Coat on it.</li>
            <li>Found that applying an extra coat of polish made my nails strong enough &amp; my nails are baby thin and peel easily.</li>
            <li>Must use small brush with it, could use Gelish foundation brush for easy application.  </li>
            <li>(over-lays on my natural nail, medium long length) and have gotten cracks across my nails just above the smile line.  </li>
            <li>Second time I got the same results, I even let my nails dry for 4 minutes to get better results the same thing.</li>
            <li>easy to use and really strengthens my weak nails.</li>
            <li>Since I still have a ton of older product from OPI, I used the OPI Alpine Snow for my French tips.</li>
            <li>If i do get a split in a nail - I use a piece of a empty tea bag laid down on top of the foundation to mend the nail.  </li>
            <li>A last coment, because the gel is self leveling, I&#x27;ve found better results turning my hand upside down before putting the nails in the lamp, and the nails doesn&#x27;t look flat as result.</li>
            <li>If you take off an old color and put on a new color in the same sitting, you will quite literally spend a couple of HOURS at this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reason for my dissatisfaction stems from the fact that my nails are thin, peel easily and often chip or break without much effort.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am doing my own, I use two coats of Structure after the base coat but before the color and my nails are strong.  </li>
            <li>It is also incredibly easy to remove by comparison to the hard stuff.  </li>
            <li>(I used the same brush from the foundation bottle, after swishing off as much foundation from brush as possible).</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be more of a solid, thick layer once cured.</li>
            <li>I love the thickness it adds to my weak nails and that I can wear it under polish as well.</li>
            <li>not as well as I had hoped it would, I use a lot of the gelish and other at home gel kit products, and do my own gel nails at home, and here lately they seem to be very damaged, broken down to barley nothing, and chip soo easy, and they wont grow out, so I thought I could use this and just leave them clear, so I wouldn&#x27;t have so much product on my nails,</li>
            <li>I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure.  </li>
            <li>I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li>Structure Gel is sold in a small jar so you have to use a separate brush, which means that you have another item to clean with acetone after your manicure.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to apply too much, or it gets too thick and peels off easily.</li>
            <li>I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 2 minutes to a high shine.  </li>
            <li>I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li>generally because I use this product</li>
            <li>*Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li>This gel is brushed on your nail directly, and is designed to strengthen it.</li>
            <li>I also used the foundation brush directly, and they are the same ingredients, just a bit thicker (structure gel).</li>
            <li>Definitely makes my natural nails stronger and</li>
            <li>A couple coats of this (plus my French tip gel polish) give me a professional look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use this product (with the base and top it of) as a clear base over which I apply regular polish and my nails are more beautiful, stronger and longer than ever.</li>
            <li>By sure to apply extremely thin to prevent bulking on nails.</li>
            <li>These tend to work much better with thin or damaged nails.  </li>
            <li>Use a thin coat for better results.</li>
            <li>, I applied four thin coats after the Gelish Foundation but under my color and top coat.</li>
            <li>It mends and holds my cracked and broken nails so that they are able to grow out.  </li>
            <li>The cool thing about this is if you have glitter/color dust then you mix it with this on the 2nd round and viola</li>
            <li>You can use sunscreen before using your UV lamp, but this is obviously greasy at a time when you want to be as clean and dry as possible, and it&#x27;s yet another step in an already very long process.  </li>
            <li>My nail was damaged, super thin and brittle, I applied 3 coats and now is very rigid almost as acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>and some polishes wrinkle badly on top of this and yet are fine just over a base coat.  </li>
            <li>thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And keep in mind that gel polish, while it cures fast and lasts long, takes just as long to take off as it does to put on.  </li>
            <li>it definitely add some strength to your nails, but have to make sure you put on thin coats</li>
            <li>It could be used without color if one desired a clear nail color, as every other product (except colored polishes of course) in Gelish process is cures to clear color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took my acrylics off for the first time in  forever a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>My nails held up well with the original Foundation product, but are even better with Structure as my base coat.</li>
            <li>Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li>and they always did acrylics and filed down sooo much of it.</li>
            <li>but they became very brittle and started peeling, which is typical from my nails, not a result of the gel polish.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s in a jar because it is very tacky and can get messy real easily if not careful.</li>
            <li>with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED</li>
            <li>well two weeks was not long enough!</li>
            <li>I do my own gel manicures but my nails have always been a little weak and sometimes still bend after a week or so.  </li>
            <li>After 3 coats of this my nails are super thick, just like regular acrylics.</li>
            <li>The amount of lifting was very minimal to my normal gel application without the structure gel</li>
            <li>My nails have been feeling weak, so I use this structure gel for a little extra strength, and it has work out nicely.  </li>
            <li>(Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li>and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>

            <li> Great, am totally happy with it.</li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product one month ago and is great, without it I feel like my nails are nacked.</li>
            <li> love it!!  </li>
            <li> my manicure very nicely 2 weeks ..</li>
            <li> but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  </li>
            <li> This Gelish structure gel is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I loved the colors and my nails always looked great</li>
            <li> Its good stuff but</li>
            <li> Works well and good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure.</li>
            <li> It provides the strength and support needed to deliver superior results.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good quality in</li>
            <li> ex.2 years now, unfortunatly this time it arrives not in good conditions.. it was leaking all over the envelope.</li>
            <li> It arrived in good condition with no leaks and was sealed.</li>
            <li> The reason I did give it three stars and not a one star though, was because save for the packaging nightmare, the product itself is really good.</li>
            <li> waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li> Imagine my delight with this product (which is EXTREMELY easy to use), when after a week my gel manicure looks as good as the day I applied it!  </li>
            <li> Works great, love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to all that awesome, structure is also a pretty good way to apply gems.</li>
            <li> altho I saw some reviews that said it peeled off even after using the Gelish foundation, most of the reviews seemed to say that with the foundation it worked great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to even out, hold, and protect glitter or 3D bits and bobs on your nail as the consistency is thicker than top coat.</li>
            <li> I have many Gelish polishes that I have ordered here through Amazon and all have been great.</li>
            <li> My first purchase was a Sally Hansen gel nail kit, which was a great starter kit and gave a beautiful set of nails.  </li>
            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!  </li>

            <li> Would be nice if it came in a bottle with a brush for easier application.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li> so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li> You need your own brush or use the foundation brush.</li>
            <li> have always been into doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> I followed her instructions and am loving my nails ever since!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do my own gels at home using gelish products.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a pro at removing either to be honest.  </li>
            <li> Loving the Gelish system.</li>
            <li> Also I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the kind of thing you can build tips with -</li>
            <li> I am happy with my results, I gel my nail every three week and this product really works great.</li>
            <li> You also need to buy your own brush to apply this product.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel polish for about 6 months now</li>
            <li> You use a brush and kind of spackle it on there.</li>
            <li> So I started doing my own Gelish Nails at home</li>
            <li> So friendly, so fast, best deals, and great selection.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to soak off.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails very strong though.</li>
            <li> This gel came off very easily.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> but I love  doing my own nails</li>

            <li> The first time I used it, went on great.</li>
            <li> texture of this gel enhancement is very smooth, yet dense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds up so well, goes on easy, and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not as easy to use as the polish as you need your own brush, but it&#x27;s thicker and adds strength.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so awesome good by to tapping loose glitter onto the nail!!!</li>
            <li> Yes iam just one more added to Rate this product</li>

            <li> leaks out of container - works ok</li>
            <li> You can also cure this product using the Senstionail Led Lamp :-)</li>
            <li> It does help strengthen your nails and be creative by yourself or be pampered and have then done,</li>
            <li> Elegant\\&quot;, applying 2 coats (each cured for 2 minutes under UV lamp), and a top coat of Top It Off.</li>

            <li> They have the best colors and this product is no different.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the application instructions to a T.</li>
            <li> Used it twice and love it</li>
            <li> Will buy more when out.</li>
            <li> Mostly because my nails are always breaking and therefore hurt.</li>
            <li> my favorite thing about it is that it is soak-off.  </li>
            <li> Most builder gels are designed to be a permanent addition to your nail...</li>
            <li> Also, if you want to put tips on your nails, you will not be able to do it with a gel polish kit.  </li>
            <li> my favorite thing about it is that it is soak-off.  </li>
            <li> Most builder gels are designed to be a permanent addition to your nail...</li>

            <li> Great price I will absolutely by from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This gel was the last piece for a perfect recipe in regards to nail strength!</li>
            <li> I use the structure gel to give them more strength.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and use one coat per manicure.  </li>
            <li> I love it  </li>
            <li> Works ok but can not replace a trip to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, it gave my nails the added strength I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I did the foundation, structure gel, and then the top coat.</li>
            <li> My clients LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Love it love it</li>
            <li> , I thought it would be better for the nails.</li>
            <li> as many of the reviewers have suggested and swear by how well it works for them that way.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They have been growing and getting healthy for over a year after having acrylic nails for years.</li>
            <li> So I bought the gelish starter kit and was pleased but still needed something stronger.</li>
            <li> I recommend any harmony product. :)</li>
            <li> i love glitter nails, i just take my brush and dip it in the pot and then the glitter and brush it on, then cure</li>
            <li> I use this over my foundation coat of Gelish polishes, and under my color of choice, but it can be applied over the top of the color as well.  </li>
            <li> I waited to review this product before reviewing it because I wanted to be able to share the ease of removal.  </li>
            <li> Because I want to be able to change my polish sooner than two weeks</li>
            <li> love this</li>
            <li> it was ok</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish look</li>
            <li> You can also use this with acrylic powder for even more strength.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I cure a coat of the Foundation gel, then apply and cure a coat of the Structure gel, and then continue with the color application and Top It</li>
            <li> Off top coat.</li>
            <li> Love the gelish foundation will buy more Thank you</li>
            <li> added 2 coats of color and finally top it off ,led setting between each coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a favorite hobby of mine.  </li>
            <li> Then, I researched a bit more.  </li>
            <li> The structure gel kept the nail from bending and splitting more while it grew out.</li>
            <li> So, yes; I ordered the structure gel, the Gelish Foundation and the Top it</li>
            <li> , it does what I wanted it to do, and more.</li>
            <li> (and more??  </li>
            <li> and then I use the Top</li>
            <li> +, more than the price of the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product allows my nails to be longer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> You then apply the polish layers and top</li>
            <li> Felt like it made my nails chip and oral way more with it than without it.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 times now and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it on top of glitter that I scrubbed in and it helps get rid of the bumpiness with out using 2 or 3 coats of top coat.</li>
            <li> If gelish could come up with a better packaging situation with this product I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine using the Gelish polish without this, but I wish it did do more to help my nails once the polish is removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too pleased with this structure gel from Gelish.</li>
            <li> I normally get 2-3 weeks of beautiful nails before chipping.</li>
            <li> Apply Gelish Top It Off and cure two minutes. 9.</li>
            <li> I love structure</li>
            <li> Love - luv</li>
            <li> OOOO &amp; one more tip instead of using a UV Gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, will continue to use, and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Again, my polish looked great after 2 weeks, and I highly recommend adding this to your gel routine</li>
            <li> I now have long beautiful fingernails!  </li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews for this product, and I had huge hopes that this was the miracle product to make my nails strong and pretty, and it does work, but</li>
            <li> It makes my nails strong and more resilent.  </li>
            <li> The key to a good structure application is a good foundation layer.</li>
            <li> But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now,it may be prolongs one more day chip free nails, but without it, it is ok also.</li>
            <li> Adds a great strength and sturdiness to natural nails.</li>
            <li> Great so far.</li>
            <li> After you are done with the 1 or 2 layers, then you finish it with Gelish nail polish color, do your nail designs, uv/led light it, then the top coat...</li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use it every time and its easy to appy and self levels.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt seem to interfere with the removal process either-soaks off easily,</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, not bulky.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use this yourself if you have an led lamp.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and soaks off easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I can apply this easily.</li>
            <li> I found the structure to be extremely easy to use, when applied with a nail art brush.  </li>
            <li> It all cures very quickly under an LED lamp</li>
            <li> Will make your nails stronger, easy to apply and remove it.</li>
            <li> An extremely strong shield for my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit runny compared to the Structure Gel (black jar) but great for mixing your own pigments, glitters &amp; setting in jewels/studs/cabochons.</li>
            <li> Once again Andrea on Chickettes and her blog were not only very convincing but spot on correct!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my nails feel and makes them feel so much thicker too!!</li>
            <li> That was a huge, time consuming pain in the backside.  </li>
            <li> The great thing with regular polish is you can remove the RPN with non- acetone remover and</li>
            <li> This product, as well as all of the Harmony Gelish products have to be cured with a UV light</li>
            <li> The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> finished off with the soak off gel nail polish on the color \\&quot;Light</li>
            <li> I have found it is much easier and more economical to purchase acrylic (water-base) paints and mix my own colors of choice for my nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>

            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  </li>
            <li> Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curing Nail Dryer Light Timer</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li> They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I have this nails and this provided a smooth build up to protect my nails.</li>
            <li> have tried everything to remedy this; NutriNail, Julep MIghty Nail, Derma Nail, OPI Envy</li>
            <li> EZ &amp; smooth application.</li>
            <li> However, since I do this at home and own the whole set up,  </li>
            <li> Works great when using with acrylic tips &amp; gelish to add that extra strength.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li> I love gels/nail art and prefer to do it myself because it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> 08-14-16: I STILL love this product and am ordering all fresh stuff today.</li>
            <li> I just paint on the foundation gel by gelish, or this could work too, and dip my nails in acrylic powder, then put my nails under the led light.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky, but works amazing.</li>
            <li> Remove sticky induction layer with lint free wipe and alcohol.</li>
            <li> Tend to cuticles, buff lightly with fine grit, clean off with alcohol, apply dehydrator to nail.</li>
            <li> I use a #6 flat brush and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Also, it was super easy to apply just like if you were painting your nail with polish.</li>
            <li> I added this to my nail routine now and my nails are super strong.</li>
            <li> super easy to apply</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s buildable and it really helps to keep your nails strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> Use PH first, than foundation, structure gel, gel polish &amp; lastly top it off.</li>
            <li> I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I ordered two!</li>
            <li> I love it because it really works!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy, no ecstatic, to say that my nails are not chipping or breaking - even though I type all day long.  </li>
            <li> Original review:</li>
            <li> Try mixing glitters it is fun!</li>
            <li> My nails are very long and look great.</li>
            <li> Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li> Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li> Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li> this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li> I actually had better luck just poking this structure gel into the crack (by kind of jabbing at it, backwards with the brush) than I did using a silk wrap and putting structure gel over it.</li>
            <li> I saw many positive reviews on Youtube and wanted to try it</li>
            <li> Refer to original feedback for full details.</li>
            <li> This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.  </li>

            <li> I put one coat of Top It off over my whole nail.  </li>
            <li> Bought this along with the full size Basix kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> But this always gets EVERYWHERE and is super sticky to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for full sets twice</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> hoopfully next time it will arrives in good conditions</li>
            <li> Overall Good Product, Will Probably Purchase Another One</li>
            <li> and it still isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> Now I have the same good results everyone&#x27;s raving about.</li>
            <li> and I gotta say that I love their whole product line.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> Buff your natural nail using a super fine grit (pay extra attention to the cuticle area where it is most oily and dont miss your sides) use the cleanse to remove the dust, use a good amount of ph and dont forget to dab a bit under your free edge, apply foundation in a super thin layer using swirl and swipe motions (one brush load wiped clean will coat all nails perfectly, start with your thumb and cap your free edges)</li>
            <li> but this is a good product, it works great under gel nail products, or with acrylics, and also alone, I have ben wearing it alone the most, but have used it in every way, and I will continue to use this, and buy more, I do recommend this, since it can be used in many ways if you do gel nails or acrylics, and also just as a base for your nails to look pretty if you don&#x27;t even wear polish, and to help give them some more strength, or to put under gel or regular polish to add more strength and coverage ect...</li>
            <li> It brings strength to my nail, but behaves like a gel polish in that it&#x27;s not as thick, is easy to apply/work with, and is incredibly self-leveling.  </li>

            <li> But they did work fine as a double layer to make my brittle nails more strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing the great strength that other reviewers seem to be talking about with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is good if you want a little more strength of gel.</li>
            <li> It is great for soft nails that bend easily, it adds just enough support that they are strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li> I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li> Looks great as a clear coat if you want to wear your natural nails.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time the foundation that comes in the Fabulous Four Gelish system is strong enough when I use two coats under my polish color.  </li>
            <li> and I love the added strength it gives your nails; so I purchased this as I was using several coats of top coat to get the desired thickness.</li>
            <li> Much better than laying on multiple layers of top coat.</li>
            <li> [highly recommend over a UV] and my nails have never looked and felt better.  </li>
            <li> First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li> First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I also regularly mix it with Martha Stewart fine glitters to create my own glitter nails with my own custom mixed colors.  </li>
            <li> However, I just found a great use for it when you tear a nail and don&#x27;t want to cut it down.  </li>
            <li> Does thicken and reinforce natural nails that have been damaged by impatient gel polish removal, and it&#x27;s excellent as a smoothing coat after very glittery gel polish, and before Top It Off,</li>
            <li> the structure gel remains untouched, allowing you to easily change colors without going thru the whole gel removal process.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and really works helping strengthen the nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a product that I could you along with my gel polish that would strengthen my nails &amp; I&#x27;ve found exactly it!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful replacement for my weak nails and chips without the smell and chemicals of acrylic liquid.</li>
            <li> Excellent if you have nail ridges, little imperfections or just want a bit of strength for sensitive nails as you grow them out.  </li>
            <li> First application was super easy, the product does not run and holds shape which is a big difference than the top coat I was using.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money</li>
            <li> This will not give you the strength of acrylics or gel nails but will give you more than your natural nails alone.</li>
            <li> picture of my nails is after a week&#x27;s worth of growth.</li>
            <li> : Make sure you do not leave your brush (with product on it), or the structure gel, near the curing lamp, as this might harden the gel/brush.</li>
            <li> Also in regard to using after acrylics, it covers the ridge left by the dremel nicely even when used without color.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel nail manicure for quite some time after having acrylic nails for several years.  </li>
            <li> Makes doing my nails a lot of fun</li>
            <li> Next time, I will remember to use the warm towel when I soak and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> and I assumed it all had to be done fresh each time.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought my own 2mm</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I was able to apply without difficulty.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love all Gelish products so far.</li>
            <li> If the surface isn&#x27;t glassy smooth and even you can apply a bit more structure gel before curing, or cure all and do a second coat of structure.</li>
            <li> Shipped pretty quick and does was it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gelish for such an exceptional product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it made much of a difference in my nails, plus it doesn&#x27;t make a good top coat</li>
            <li> takes long time to make it but it is very good compare to regular polish.</li>
            <li> right after I put on the foundation gel.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> that a day the gel just peeled right off my nails.  </li>
            <li> Easy to work with considering am new to using structure gels.</li>
            <li> It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li> I use a flat square nail art brush wiped almost clean, be sure to cape</li>
            <li> My nails are nice and long now</li>
            <li> and I found my nails growing nice and long</li>
            <li> Note that you want this structure gel if you want a soak off, not a hard gel that needs to be sanded off or kept on and filled.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little more challenging to remove it vs. polish alone</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be strong and allow my natural nails to grow below.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, I believe that I have found my new gel!!!  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The polish was still very much adhered to my nail, but with some work it peeled off.</li>
            <li> I just use the brush from my old nail polish that I&#x27;ve cleaned and that seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take that long to cure.</li>
            <li> It did, however, give me a nice full two week manicure with no lifting and little wear.</li>
            <li> Such fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> the only difference is that the structure gel is a lot thicker making the nails just more stronger.</li>
            <li> I noticed when i used it that it is the exact consistency of the foundation gel.</li>
            <li> But after getting my first shellac manicure, I was sold.  </li>
            <li> it will last better.  </li>
            <li> Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li> then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li> Did the job,  will continue to use this when I do my regular gel manis without tips just to get a bit more strength.</li>
            <li> I have researched and tried many different methods of care.</li>
            <li> Nails from a reputable salon would last 5 days max until they lifted and cracked.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, which is also great.</li>
            <li> Which also works pretty well</li>
            <li> I really love it actually -</li>
            <li> Structure seems to make my manicure slightly more solid feeling, but not like the acrylics.  </li>
            <li> apply the nail dehydrator first, then Gel Foundation and cure for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> This shipped so fast!</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, it looks light lavender in the bottle</li>
            <li> That is consistently happening</li>
            <li> which is what I have been doing, however it seems to only stay on for about a week, then starts to peel off, and I hope that is not damaging my nails more</li>
            <li> I love the gelish line and this product is no different.</li>
            <li> Because of the packaging and extra step involved with using Structure gel, I am looking for a better nail strengthener that I can use with my at-home gel manicures.</li>
            <li> first i dehydrated, then foundation and led set it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I did not use the foundation, because I didn&#x27;t know I was supposed to</li>
            <li> I also made sure to do an extra coat of structure gel.  </li>
            <li> I use Foundation, about 2 coats of the Gelish Structure Gel, my white tip polish, and Top it off.  </li>
            <li> If youfeel like another coat of structure gel is in order prior to the top it off,  by all means, go for it.</li>
            <li> I questioned weather or not you would be able to see a color difference in the nail when you did a &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; rather than soaking it all off in acetone and starting over.  </li>
            <li> Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li> Would love it if came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> the extra strength that they need to be able to grow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different systems in my nails (some of them applied by professionals and some by myself) and the result after removal alwas was an even more fragil and damage nail than it was before.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this package, there was sticky residue all over.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back to just using the basics and get much better results.</li>
            <li> WILL MOST DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> f you like the look of glitter embedded in gel over the entire nail but with a totally smooth, glassy finish, this is what you need!</li>
            <li> First you prep your nails</li>
            <li> This product adds significant strenght and rigidity to your nail specially if you apply multiple coats.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super durable yet easy to soak off, while proving to be an excellent strengthening base for brittle/bendy nails.</li>
            <li> I am not as thrilled with this product as I have been with every other Gelish product that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, pops off easily, but good for overlays on natural nails.</li>
            <li> The nail that was split has grown out enough to where I actually filed the split part off and stll have good length on that nail.  </li>
            <li> PERFECT AND THICK ENOUGH NOT TO BREAK!</li>
            <li> A little thicker than gel polish but super easy to apply!</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li> Also, I have had consistent and super speedy shipping turn around by always choosing to order my polishes and nail needs from Direct Nail Supply.  </li>
            <li> Even with my high wattage professional light, this stuff just won&#x27;t harden.</li>
            <li> I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li> (But I prefer tapping loose glitter into the sticky layer. :)</li>
            <li> Most builder gels are thick and gloopy, and unlike the gel polishes, does not self-level as quickly or as easily</li>
            <li> But no matter what, it is VERY important to rough up your nail surface with a file.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li> I understand that it is most definitely a different method of care, but it allows my nails to grow out naturally under a protective shield!</li>
            <li> I just used a craft brush to apply the structure gel and my nails are hard, glossy, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Only have used it a few times but seems to work great.</li>
            <li> Came so fast so excite.</li>
            <li> really give this a five stars</li>
            <li> This really lives by it&#x27;s name, STRUCTURE.  </li>
            <li> The Structure allows them to be much stronger</li>
            <li> but i dont use it much</li>
            <li> I tried this product and didn&#x27;t like it all that much.</li>
            <li> Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li> Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li> My nails are so much stronger &amp; my gel polish lasts a lot longer as well....</li>
            <li> This product is also very pliable once it does cure and all is said and done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Structure DOES work with nail tips, but keep in mind that if you DO decide to use nail tips, the very method that you would use to remove the color or the Structure gel--which is putting acetone-soaked pads on your nails--will also remove the nail tips themselves.  </li>

            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and it really help my nails not to chip or break because even though you have gel polish on them you nail can still chip and break.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would act like a ridge filler, but really it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My nails are not splitting and are very durable thanks to this</li>
            <li> It did make this baby nail a tad thicker but not really noticably to others, just me .It made all my nails stronger for sure.</li>
            <li> I think this is really going to help when I am without acrylics.</li>
            <li> It really helps to grow out your nails.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think this is a necessity in the gelish line</li>
            <li> Thanks Gelish.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that I would not see chipping and splitting during the anticipated 2 weeks wear time.</li>
            <li> I could have gone much longer.</li>
            <li> Not so much for creating nail extensions.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really paint over it either.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to dump another $17 into this &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; but I really wanted it to work, so I did.  </li>
            <li> Recommend HIGHLY!</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails on which really damaged my nails.</li>
            <li> Off to really give it that shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the structure gel, don&#x27;t swirl or mix it around too much because it causes air bubbles.</li>
            <li> nails seem to be much stronger , and the gel adheres well to the nail.  </li>
            <li> It gave so much strength and durability to my nails</li>
            <li> I had it on for 2 weeks and could have gone on much longer</li>
            <li> remove I just used a curved metal nail tool to gently lift off my nail bed.</li>
            <li> but it seems much thicker to me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t seen much of a difference from using this product.</li>
            <li> much thicker than the nail polish UV gel.</li>
            <li> I really needed this stuff.</li>
            <li> So I had to figure out how do I use this with their system; just in case if anyone wants to know here&#x27;s how you do it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to apply extremely thin layers and cure between each on and don&#x27;t forget to paint the top of your nail to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it otherwise it&#x27;ll lift faster than it should.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I could just use an extra layer of gelish color and get the same result as this.</li>
            <li> You can also add glitter directly to the structure gel and have extra sparkly nails :)  </li>
            <li> Adds great strength ans a nice base for polish.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.</li>

            <li> I found that most brands make a more pliable version of their builder gels (IBD makes a plain clear gel, for example, not labelled as \\&quot;Builder\\&quot; gel, but just as clear gel).  </li>
            <li> I originally wanted to use these to extend my short nails, but the tips were very jelly and ripped off.</li>
            <li> so I damaged my nails pretty bad, this stuff totally filled in the pitted spots in my nails and leveled them out and was very easy to apply the consistency was easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; all other Gelish products.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting since I was pleased with the other gelish product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to reconsider if you are looking for a product that will make your nails a bit stronger and not peel within days.</li>
            <li> Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li> Easy to use with loose glitter.</li>
            <li> I recently tried IBD strong builder gel and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of those cracks appear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked great and the thin coat applied after the foundation/base, and before the color, cured under the UV lamp to a very shiny clear coat.</li>
            <li> First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li> Builder gel strengthens your nails, gel polish is simply nail color that cures under a light so that it dries completely by the time you are done, and can go straight to doing your business.</li>
            <li> Then I found Structure Gel &amp; knew I&#x27;d found the secret to a successful home manicure.  </li>
            <li> It Was Only 3/4&#x27;s Full.</li>
            <li> I tried and tried to open it but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Having been a professional nail tech for many years, I&#x27;m well acquainted with the fact that things can dry up when they have been opened, used and then not cleaned and sealed properly.</li>
            <li> This works very well and gives a little more strength to my manicure.  </li>
            <li> My damaged-via-acrylic nails are stronger than ever and have a whole new life.</li>
            <li> I followed the steps very carefully, 4 times, and finally decided my time was worth more.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for those who have thin nails and need just a bit more strength than they would get with a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> Even if my manicure doesn&#x27;t end up lasting 2 weeks, I&#x27;m excited that the results looks so professional and all I had to do was add an extra step in my polish process to get such fantastic results!</li>
            <li> Its kind of hard to work with sometimes, but less really is more.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so bummed because I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone using Gelish.</li>
            <li> I have mostly used OPI Axxium (in the little pots) until I started using LED products and switched to OPI GelColor.</li>
            <li> If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li> so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good  for strength and growing natural nails, not good for tips.</li>
            <li> So it does a MUCH better job of molding with my uneven, wily nails.  </li>
            <li> So it does a MUCH better job of molding with my uneven, wily nails.  </li>
            <li> Ok...I have been a fanatic about doing my own gel manicures for over 3 years now.</li>
            <li> When using normal polish remember to cap the nail and use a non-acetone polish remover.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super thick and is kind of hard to spread in a smooth layer on the nail; however, once it is on, it really strengthens the nail and just looks like clear polish.</li>
            <li> And yes it&#x27;s true, your polish is 100% dry when finished.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re using tips, you will have to re-apply a new set each time.rs sufficiently imo, and are yet another expense.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re using tips, you will have to re-apply a new set each time.</li>
            <li> Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> problem with builder gels that cure to that level of rigidity is that if you have thin, pliable nails, or an uneven or damaged nail surface (dents, ridges, dings) like I do, there&#x27;s a good chance that the gel will lift...and very quickly, at that.  </li>
            <li> I currently am using it on a broken toe nail as a foundation and have found it to be very effective.</li>
            <li> for 30 seconds which is amazing:-0 WOW!</li>
            <li> Well that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s EXACTLY THE SAME INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li> I could not love this product any more than I already do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The removal is exactly the same as when you don&#x27;t use structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : As promised, it is self-leveling, especially if you hold your hand palm-up for the first bit of cure time.</li>
            <li> After looking at the ingredients this product is the exact same as the foundation.</li>
            <li> I think a key to this is doing a proper manicure and making sure you get all the cuticle off your nail prior to applying it, which I did.</li>
            <li> I thought that it was a soak off for the purpose of not leaving damage to the natural nail bed?!?</li>
            <li> Edit: this is NOT the same exact thing as the Foundation, it is a thicker formulation.   </li>
            <li> My nails are stable enough to grow twice as long and my normal 14day wear will last days longer and in better condition.</li>
            <li> Quick cure time 30 sec with LED lamp.</li>
            <li> I do my own at home gel polish, even with that my nails are weak and often rip at the edges.  </li>
            <li> Applying was simple, removal was super simple too.  </li>
            <li> I have just completed my 1st attempt of DIY Gelish nails and they turned out great, and the Structure Gel provides the extra protection and strength that my weak nails need!</li>
            <li> Works great over my natural nails, and causes far less damage than the hard gel.  </li>
            <li> The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li> I also scrubbed the brush downward into the existing gel polish to be certain to  fill in any tiny gaps if there were any.</li>
            <li> We do several gel polish applications per day at the salon and 80% of the people we add Structure to their nails to give them a little bit more strength.</li>
            <li> First off it lifted in one day and second it does major damage to your nail bed during removal.</li>
            <li> Then apply two coasts of Gel polish followed by top coat (curing between each coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect hard as nails, Nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have weak nails - ones that break off easily or flake - then STRUCTURE is exactly what you need.  </li>
            <li> Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li> but with just one coat it is clear.</li>
            <li> this protects your natural nails</li>
            <li> I even just had two co-workers make comments about my \\&quot;professionally manicured nails\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This worked well and allowed me to protect her soft, damaged nails while adding some strength without a lot of thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.  </li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li> flick off old polish from</li>
            <li> Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li> Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Voila, nail fixed.  </li>
            <li> Now the splits in his nails are nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> You can use these pliable builder gels as the foundation step of your gel polish application, as long as you don&#x27;t wipe with alcohol between the pliable builder gel and your first coat of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also kept an old brush from a finished bottle of foundation, and I use that to brush it on my nails.</li>
            <li> I find that it adds strength to my natural nails that were weakened by over a decade of continual acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li> but I went much lighter the subsequent two times, so that was not it.  </li>
            <li> I just applied it yesterday and so far no issues with it.</li>
            <li> This product self levels, it builds the nail , yet it still looks natural.</li>
            <li> this a try if you find your nails brittle, soft or flaky.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find it in the mail just after a couple days of ordering.</li>
            <li> It has been 3 days so far and no lifting, chipping or anything.</li>
            <li> I go from natural nails to acrylics a lot</li>
            <li> It has not cracked my natural nail</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li> I did research &amp; decided to invest in the complete kit &amp; professional tools.  </li>
            <li> It really helps strengthen my nails and prevent breakage; however, my nails still occasionally chip and peel even when using Structure gel.</li>
            <li> I also added the PH bonder to the natural nail after filing.</li>
            <li> My nails are naturally peel-y</li>
            <li> Once you figure out how to use it, it is simple and really helps the polish to stay on the nails longer.</li>
            <li> I have a damaged thumb nail that splits continually and the structure helps keep it from spliting further and lasts the whole manicure.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCTS LEAVES MY NATURAL NAILS</li>
            <li> Not too helpful for soft nails.</li>
            <li> ; File the edges, push back the cuticles and gently buff your nail bed to take away the shine with a 180 nail grit file.</li>
            <li> Next you Cleanse wipe your nail to take away the dust or 90%+ Alcohol, then use the PH Bond, 1 thin layer of the Foundation, uv/led light this, then use this product (Harmony Gelish Structure Gel), uv/led light it,</li>
            <li> When \\&quot;tipping the ends\\&quot; .. if I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the hard gels [like IBD and the other Gelish] because of the lifting which is such a pain, and the incredible difficulty and time consumption of removal.  </li>
            <li> You can also use regular nail polish, but I recommend a fast dry regular nail polish as you have to wait for the product to completely dry before you use the Top Coat on it.</li>
            <li> Found that applying an extra coat of polish made my nails strong enough &amp; my nails are baby thin and peel easily.</li>
            <li> Must use small brush with it, could use Gelish foundation brush for easy application.  </li>
            <li> (over-lays on my natural nail, medium long length) and have gotten cracks across my nails just above the smile line.  </li>
            <li> Second time I got the same results, I even let my nails dry for 4 minutes to get better results the same thing.</li>
            <li> easy to use and really strengthens my weak nails.</li>
            <li> Since I still have a ton of older product from OPI, I used the OPI Alpine Snow for my French tips.</li>
            <li> If i do get a split in a nail - I use a piece of a empty tea bag laid down on top of the foundation to mend the nail.  </li>
            <li> A last coment, because the gel is self leveling, I&#x27;ve found better results turning my hand upside down before putting the nails in the lamp, and the nails doesn&#x27;t look flat as result.</li>
            <li> If you take off an old color and put on a new color in the same sitting, you will quite literally spend a couple of HOURS at this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason for my dissatisfaction stems from the fact that my nails are thin, peel easily and often chip or break without much effort.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am doing my own, I use two coats of Structure after the base coat but before the color and my nails are strong.  </li>
            <li> It is also incredibly easy to remove by comparison to the hard stuff.  </li>
            <li> (I used the same brush from the foundation bottle, after swishing off as much foundation from brush as possible).</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be more of a solid, thick layer once cured.</li>
            <li> I love the thickness it adds to my weak nails and that I can wear it under polish as well.</li>
            <li> not as well as I had hoped it would, I use a lot of the gelish and other at home gel kit products, and do my own gel nails at home, and here lately they seem to be very damaged, broken down to barley nothing, and chip soo easy, and they wont grow out, so I thought I could use this and just leave them clear, so I wouldn&#x27;t have so much product on my nails,</li>
            <li> I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure.  </li>
            <li> I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li> Structure Gel is sold in a small jar so you have to use a separate brush, which means that you have another item to clean with acetone after your manicure.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to apply too much, or it gets too thick and peels off easily.</li>
            <li> I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 2 minutes to a high shine.  </li>
            <li> I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li> generally because I use this product</li>
            <li> *Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li> This gel is brushed on your nail directly, and is designed to strengthen it.</li>
            <li> I also used the foundation brush directly, and they are the same ingredients, just a bit thicker (structure gel).</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my natural nails stronger and</li>
            <li> A couple coats of this (plus my French tip gel polish) give me a professional look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product (with the base and top it of) as a clear base over which I apply regular polish and my nails are more beautiful, stronger and longer than ever.</li>
            <li> By sure to apply extremely thin to prevent bulking on nails.</li>
            <li> These tend to work much better with thin or damaged nails.  </li>
            <li> Use a thin coat for better results.</li>
            <li> , I applied four thin coats after the Gelish Foundation but under my color and top coat.</li>
            <li> It mends and holds my cracked and broken nails so that they are able to grow out.  </li>
            <li> The cool thing about this is if you have glitter/color dust then you mix it with this on the 2nd round and viola</li>
            <li> You can use sunscreen before using your UV lamp, but this is obviously greasy at a time when you want to be as clean and dry as possible, and it&#x27;s yet another step in an already very long process.  </li>
            <li> My nail was damaged, super thin and brittle, I applied 3 coats and now is very rigid almost as acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> and some polishes wrinkle badly on top of this and yet are fine just over a base coat.  </li>
            <li> thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And keep in mind that gel polish, while it cures fast and lasts long, takes just as long to take off as it does to put on.  </li>
            <li> it definitely add some strength to your nails, but have to make sure you put on thin coats</li>
            <li> It could be used without color if one desired a clear nail color, as every other product (except colored polishes of course) in Gelish process is cures to clear color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took my acrylics off for the first time in  forever a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> My nails held up well with the original Foundation product, but are even better with Structure as my base coat.</li>
            <li> Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li> and they always did acrylics and filed down sooo much of it.</li>
            <li> but they became very brittle and started peeling, which is typical from my nails, not a result of the gel polish.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s in a jar because it is very tacky and can get messy real easily if not careful.</li>
            <li> with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED</li>
            <li> well two weeks was not long enough!</li>
            <li> I do my own gel manicures but my nails have always been a little weak and sometimes still bend after a week or so.  </li>
            <li> After 3 coats of this my nails are super thick, just like regular acrylics.</li>
            <li> The amount of lifting was very minimal to my normal gel application without the structure gel</li>
            <li> My nails have been feeling weak, so I use this structure gel for a little extra strength, and it has work out nicely.  </li>
            <li> (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li> and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>
            <li> , in conclusion, I loved the product because it is thick, it fixes broken nails, it works well for a fill and doesn&#x27;t seem to discolor (although I have not tried the tanning bed or swimming yet).</li>
            <li> It looked like any other normal nail polish job except it was dry as soon as the last cure in lamp was done with no waiting time after the manicure.</li>
            <li> too thick to dry quickly</li>
            <li> I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application.  </li>
            <li> I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application.</li>
            <li> My fill looks like a new set, and it&#x27;s been about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s applied, you&#x27;re pretty much done, and if you do get lifting, when you try to get it off, you will wind up with very thin, damaged nails.  </li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s applied, you&#x27;re pretty much done, and if you do get lifting, when you try to get it off, you will wind up with very thin, damaged nails.  </li>
            <li> I thought I put on too thick of a coat at first</li>
            <li> It made my natural nail a little stronger, but if you put on an extra coat of color</li>
            <li> With Gelish base, usually 2 coats of polish and top coat, nails seem just a strong.</li>
            <li> but since I like to apply tips to my natural nails, I think I&#x27;m going to have to purchase some Hard Gel again in clear.</li>
            <li> I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed.</li>
            <li> I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed.</li>
            <li> Then I take a dry acrylic brush and remove the tacky layer of the nails and then paint on the structure gel onto my nails like regular polish and then cure (LED) for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> A thin coat of Structure gel helps the gel polish release much faster when soaking off old polish.</li>
            <li> Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula</li>
            <li> She loved it and it was very thin and delicate looking.</li>
            <li> They were very thin and split easily.  </li>
            <li> I have weak nails right now because I was a long term nail salon person that was getting my nails done</li>
            <li> I love that it looks like I have artificial nails</li>
            <li> This will last the same amount of time as does the Gelish Soak Off Gel Nail Polish which is an average cost of $10 per .5oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got an old bottle or if it is slightly different composition.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder and would do even further damage!  </li>
            <li> I had no professional gel brushes</li>
            <li> when I heard how long gel nails lasted ..</li>
            <li> I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed ..</li>
            <li> They grow long and never break or chip with the addition of Structure to my Gelish routine.</li>
            <li> Adds strength to my naturally long nails.</li>
            <li> I notice I have to create a thicker layer to prevent my long nails from bending when accidentally jabbing into things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional.</li>
            <li> I did notice some lifting after a week, but as long as I didn&#x27;t pick at it the polish stayed in place.</li>
            <li> My nails are pretty thin and brittle, but the regular foundation, color, and topcoat combo seems to be plenty to add strength and structure.</li>
            <li> Gelish is an expensive up front cost, as was the structure gel, but ITS WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> When I first took off the acrylics, my nails were so weak and they bent if you looked at them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s imposible for me not to wash my hands several times per day due to my profession and the idea of wearing a manicure after the weekend was a dream.</li>
            <li> Gives my nails that really hard thick feel to them and soooo shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> this is a DRY cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I have dry nails</li>
            <li> dry brush it</li>
            <li> I really would only recommend this if you feel like your nails are still bumpy or thin with the rest of the products.</li>
            <li> This will help create a more natural rounded nail base and won&#x27;t slide into the cuticles.</li>
            <li> This brush made even this amateur try look professional.</li>
            <li> No matter how long I let it cure under a UV lamp, it stayed wet.</li>
            <li> and so my nails are pretty thin.</li>
            <li> though pretty hard, it does remain a little gummy,  </li>
            <li> No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.</li>
            <li> I bought structure to use as a medium for my loose glitters.</li>
            <li> I also mix it with loose glitter and make a glitter paste</li>
            <li> Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  </li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> (I keep mine next to my bed and put iton at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dip the brush and use long deliberate strokes; lifting the brush as few times as possible.</li>
            <li> if you press the nail over and over again with a slight bit of pressure the glitter looks mirrored and totally uniform instead of scattered.</li>
            <li> it does a great job at making your nails hard but once removed, leaves nails very weak and damaged !!</li>

            <li> I have followed the directions and found that I can only keep the product from lifting for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; after a week an a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a person that likes my nails to look on the artificial side (by being too perfect) but not so thick to look fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gelish polish seems to severly weaken my nails, so I got this in the hopes that the damage would be minimal.  </li>
            <li> Just another added layer which helps make your nails harder.</li>
            <li> Apply another thin layer foundation without dragging too much which will remove glitter.</li>
            <li> So this product is actually used as my base coat :-)</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to people with weak nails.  </li>
            <li> Structure gel has a hint of a very pale lilac color(cures to clear), is VERY thick, to the point that a soft brush is not a tool you want to use to apply it.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t get it again, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit of product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Polish Structure twice in the past 2 months and it leaves my short nails without any protection whatsoever!</li>
            <li> It makes my nails extremely durable.  </li>
            <li> When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail.  </li>
            <li> With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  </li>
            <li> I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:&lt;br /&gt;*****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  </li>
            <li> When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten a bum jar of it, I&#x27;m not sure, but I have just stuck with the basic gelish application since then and skipped the structure gel.</li>
            <li> Will try some tips from other reviewers but for now, it&#x27;s sitting on a shelf.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it helps make nails stronger, but I like it for an extra layer of polish.</li>
            <li> Obviously way past its shelf-life.</li>
            <li> so I cut down the brush from an empty bottle of polish (cleaned of course) to about 1/4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so I was very careful in applying the product.</li>
            <li> I am very rough on my nails, as I have a job that requires it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing gel manicures in salons, and now on myself for a little while now, and while my nails started to grow, they wouldn&#x27;t grow too long before breaking or \\&quot;flaking\\&quot; down.  </li>
            <li> with the pad slightly off center.  </li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails</li>
            <li> On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip.  </li>
            <li> On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip.</li>
            <li> but they are thin enough and thick enough at the same time.  </li>
            <li> and I never hit a finger hard enough to notice it (you know how when you bash into something</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to get this product to work for me with no success.</li>
            <li> at least package the Structure gel in a bottle with a brush, similar to how the Foundation gel is sold.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product does cause pealing if applied to thick.</li>
            <li> I use two coats to fortify my post-acrylic-removal nails, which are thin and prone to breaking until they grow out completely.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this but hate the execution.</li>
            <li> i put base coat, then coat of gelish structure, then 2 coats of color and finish with top coat.</li>
            <li> Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  </li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> I filed my gel polish down and did a fill</li>
            <li> Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail.</li>
            <li> NOW, after a small layer of  this structure gel my manicure AND my nail strength last two weeks, minimum (I really just get sick of LONG nails and my nail color!!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am guaranteed my soak off removal time will be 10 minutes or less</li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  </li>
            <li> Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:  a.  </li>
            <li> (less harmful to cuticles and surrounding skin than UV lamps)  </li>
            <li> had a definately half  torn baby  fingernail .</li>
            <li> Before you cure each coat, turn your hand over so the Structure has a chance to shape itself into a slight mound (about a minute).  </li>
            <li> It took over an hour and a half to soak off all layers.</li>
            <li> within less</li>
            <li> I tried curing less, curing longer, all to no avail.</li>
            <li> It made a mess of the brushes I used</li>
            <li> : If I&#x27;m not careful to cap the tip (spread a thin layer of gel along the edge of the nail)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this actually helps strengthen my nails, but just makes them look bulky and thick.</li>
            <li> but  they just weren&#x27;t thick enough to prevent breaking when the length got past the tip of my finger.</li>
            <li> but it also goes along way.my little nails are stronger when weak.after</li>
            <li> If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  </li>
            <li> it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping.</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of practice to get used to working with it though.</li>
            <li> Even if it appears to be too little, wait it out, it evens itself.</li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application&lt;</li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I did not have to redo my nails or cut them down to match the torn one!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that fix only lasted for three days because I am so rough on my nails.  </li>
            <li> It really gives your nails strength after taking off artificial nails.</li>
            <li> It adds a littel extra strength to my thin nails.  </li>
            <li> i even &#x27;scuffed&#x27; my nail to give it an uneven surface to make it easier to adhere and that did not work either.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has trouble with their nails breaking...</li>
            <li> I recommend applying it with THIN layers, curing, and then if you want further strength, apply additional layers, curing in between each.  </li>
            <li> I recommend applying it with THIN layers, curing, and then if you want further strength, apply additional layers, curing in between each.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced peeling, in fact just the opposite.</li>
            <li> I find that my my nail polish peels off after a few days when using the structure gel.  </li>
            <li> This product does what it promises; however, it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> I just think it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> - the application is messy.  </li>
            <li> Apply a few coats then add your color coats.</li>
            <li> this go round</li>
            <li> so you couldn&#x27;t see the ridge the acrylics left behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The key to layering your gel polishes is to use THIN coats.</li>
            <li> One of the clients polish that was applied thinly chipped off the next day.</li>
            <li> I have paper thin nails that get so flimsy they bend back.</li>
            <li> Hold your hand palm up for a few seconds so it evens out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t provide a brush with it but not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> But its very thick so a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> The polish did not chip, but it is a very thin formula and did nothing to protect or strengthen my natural nails.</li>
            <li> With structure gel my nails have grown long, and they never chip or break or feel weak.  </li>
            <li> It leaks in my nail polish kit where I keep all my polishes and nail items, so now I&#x27;m forced to store it separate from my other nail items.</li>
            <li> As a former lifelong nail biter, my nails are weak, brittle, and exceedingly thin.</li>
            <li> However, there are times when I have weak spots in my nails and need that extra hard filler -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purpose:  Used to strengthen weak nails and to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.  </li>
            <li> Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done that for the past few months, and now I find I don&#x27;t need the tips anymore.  </li>
            <li> not at all the acrylic-hard you want for long false tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer to use regular polish over gel polish, because I can change the color as frequently as I want without compromising the gel base with the structure gel.</li>
            <li> The nail feels a little thick</li>
            <li> consistency is a little on the thick side.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a thick gel, in a little pot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this product because it is advertised as LED curable, however it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size container fool you, there&#x27;s lots of product in there, very little is needed for each nail.</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of peeling my gels off after a week or so and by doing so have really damaged my nail beds and made them week.</li>
            <li> small toenails</li>
            <li> I used to waste my money on acrylic and gel nails, but just got the gelish system and added the structure gel in there, and I&#x27;ll never get my nails done again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve forgotten this step in the past, and have gotten lifting within a day.  </li>
            <li> That means its SMALL.</li>
            <li> It mixes and cures well with glitter added (no more than 30% additives tho).</li>
            <li> My gel usually stays put for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it by itself without that coat, so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> and it had leaked all over itself and the small plastic bag it was shipped in.</li>
            <li> This was the missing piece of the puzzle for my manicure and now I will NOT go without it!  </li>
            <li> However when I received this I was unable to open it.....</li>
            <li> I read about the Gelish Nail System and discovered that not only does that system have a Foundation base coat, but also has the Structure Gel coat made especially for weaken nails.</li>
            <li> the jar is very small ill need to order bigger size</li>
            <li> On 3 clients, I polished with a thin coat and on another I polished with a slight thicker coat.</li>
            <li> Hard gel must be filed off.</li>
            <li> made it really hard  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I like the idea of not have to chisel away at the hard gel to get it off.  </li>
            <li> though this doesn&#x27;t make my nails rock hard, it does strengthen them quite a bit.</li>
            <li> A little nail buff over the glued patch, then cover with one thin layer of the harmony gelish vitagel strengthener and seal with the structure gel and voila you are done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically I won&#x27;t be doing gel nails without this stuff at least until mine grow out stronger.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint with this product is packaging.</li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.</li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> My nails were thick as if I had laid an acrylic overlay.</li>
            <li> Thick coats will lift.</li>
            <li> I have been growing them out for the last 8 months trying to get rid of the damage done by wearing artificial nails for the last 5 yrs, and now they are reuined again grrr...</li>
            <li> If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  </li>
            <li> Foundation and Structure have a similar application, thin thin thin!</li>
            <li> it is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Used this one time and it was hard to get off , But will try again nails were weak and damage</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once but had bad results as my gel polish peeled within two days.  </li>
            <li> My nails plates were brittle and thin and in sad sad shape overall.  </li>
            <li> If you do have a thick layer though, I suggest trying to thin it out w/ a dremol or file, otherwise it will curve your nail bed pinching into your finger(s).</li>
            <li> Not a pleasant feeling and can scare the shiznat out of someone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> all the way.for me it does improve ur weak nails when u need a breather towards ur nails from gels and acrylics.</li>
            <li> Structure gel (along with the gelish line) is a must have product for people with weak and brittle nails or who bite their nails.</li>
            <li> the product was real small for the price</li>
            <li> I have weak bendy nails, no matter what vitamins I take, its just the way my nails are.</li>
            <li> I have extremely weak nails...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also given my weak nails</li>
            <li> But when you&#x27;re done, you have a very hard set of nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helpful Aid in the event of a broken nail or weak nail.  </li>
            <li> Although i know that it says to use this product after using the Gelish foundation I use this product without using the foundation as a base coat because I feel that the Gelish Structure and Gelish foundation is made out of the same ingredients  </li>
            <li> poor product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions:  Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application.  </li>
            <li> I tried to apply it as thinly as I could.</li>
            <li> If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  </li>
            <li> Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application.</li>
            <li> I used 3 thin layers with my tips and 2 layers without them.</li>
            <li> I put two thin coats of structure gel over the tear and finished my manicure.  </li>
            <li> I had no problems with it peeling at all and kept layers thin to prevent this.</li>
            <li> as I see they may be getting worn thin.</li>
            <li> i have no great manicure skills</li>
            <li> Regardless, it works wonders in my thin nails.  </li>
            <li> I put on two thin coats of STRUCTURE (curing between applications)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using structure gel and they are growing and not one has torn or broken.  </li>
            <li> and you look at your hand expecting to see a broken nail).  </li>
            <li> I have been applying it in thin coats</li>
            <li> trick is to put it on in thin coats.  </li>
            <li> do 3 thin coats, with 2-3 drying cycles in between coats.  </li>
            <li> I have paper thin nails, literally.</li>
            <li> My thin nails seem to crack even with the no chip polish on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I bought this I tried to apply multiple coats of the base coat, but id did not work well.</li>
            <li> This a different product than the base coat.</li>
            <li> and so often the &amp;#34;bases&amp;#34; they recommend are unnecessary anyway.  </li>
            <li> Thin, thin coats seemed to be the answer.</li>
            <li> You need to apply thin coats or else it will not cure correctly.</li>
            <li> This has the same ingredients as the base coat</li>
            <li> Thin layer of Gelish Foundation, cure 30 secs.</li>
            <li> Gelish wasn&#x27;t staying on my nails because they&#x27;re too thin and would bend.</li>
            <li> Adding the extra coat of Structure gel adds strength, but it is tedious to have to do two base coats.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and weak nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed to come across a gelish product that I&#x27;m not fond of.</li>
            <li> I have VERY weak finger nails</li>
            <li> My nails are very weak after wearing acrylic nails for years.</li>
            <li> and I save a fortune by not having to buy expensive nail polishes.</li>
            <li> (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS</li>
            <li> This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  </li>
            <li> In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails ..</li>
            <li> (although granted, I may have used the wrong gel for that procedure.)</li>
            <li> I found my gel manicure with the structure to be almost as difficult to remove as the acrylics</li>
            <li> I have tried three times, thinking that I had done something wrong, but it has happened every time.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all Structure did was lift off my nails within a day.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I didnt think to took a picture of it so...</li>
            <li> and I was bored with my color.</li>
            <li> I bought the structure gel because my nails are very thin</li>
            <li> applied it VERY THIN</li>
            <li> - I repeat very very thin and stroked it along the length of the nail until it was smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails, so even with the Gelish foundation gel, my nails would still tear and break off.  </li>
            <li> Apply this very thin after your Foundation application.</li>
            <li> But I decided this wasn&#x27;t for me, because I felt I needed a bit of strengthening to my very thin nails.  </li>
            <li> dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush.</li>
            <li> Im not happy :(</li>
            <li> It also works well with artificial tips.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so disappointing.  </li>
            <li> have paid for a totally useless product!</li>
            <li> also I found it very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  </li>
            <li> IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I think I see another gel that is a bit thicker in vicosity than this.  </li>
            <li> I did my Mom&#x27;s nails this weekend and used Structure on them as she had layers of nails splitting and bad cracking at the end of her finger</li>
            <li> SO BADLY TO AMAZON</li>
            <li> I have really bad, think, cracking nails.  </li>
            <li> It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with gelish and this product keeps that shining reputation.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was always disappointed when mine started looking ragged after 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> I use it to thicken the gel layer where my nails are especially weak.</li>
            <li> Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions:</li>
            <li> You can use this under Shellac also, after the base coat.</li>
            <li> I use this gel over the base coat, and before the colour coat.  </li>
            <li> Put it on after base but before color.</li>
            <li> Is a strengther you use after your base coat.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a lot disappointed with the Hamony Gel!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine filing off gel because it looks so horrible and ruined!</li>
            <li> My nails were horrible all my life.  </li>
            <li> This soak off gel is the worst ever!!!</li>
            <li> but I gave it three stars because the packaging for this product is horrible.</li>

            <li> Not what I thought it was. This is a GEL, NOT A GEL BUILDING POWDER.</li>
            <li> Yes iam just one more added to Rate this product and i am finding that it does its job.it is somewhat costly but it also goes along way.my little nails are stronger when weak.after 2weeks iam back with tips again. Came so fast so excite. And i will buy again.i really give this a five stars all the way.for me it does improve ur weak nails when u need a breather towards ur nails from gels and acrylics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to get this product to work for me with no success. It caused the paint to chip off and did not stay on the nail no matter what steps I tried. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference with using this product. Found that applying an extra coat of polish made my nails strong enough &amp; my nails are baby thin and peel easily.</li>
            <li> A thin coat of Structure gel helps the gel polish release much faster when soaking off old polish. Apply before foundation on prepared nails.</li>
            <li> Its good stuff but the jar is very small ill need to order bigger size</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I put one layer of foundation, 2 layers of gel, one layer of top coat, curing between each layer. Adds great strength ans a nice base for polish. I&#x27;ve used both gel and regular polish over it. The great thing with regular polish is you can remove the RPN with non- acetone remover and the structure gel remains untouched, allowing you to easily change colors without going thru the whole gel removal process.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It adds a littel extra strength to my thin nails.  I use it every time and its easy to appy and self levels.  I use a #6 flat brush and it works great.  It doesnt seem to interfere with the removal process either-soaks off easily,</li>
            <li> This really lives by it&#x27;s name, STRUCTURE.  It is to be applied after the foundation but before any color.  I have a bad habit of peeling my gels off after a week or so and by doing so have really damaged my nail beds and made them week. The Structure allows them to be much stronger and I have noticed that I do not have the temptation to peel it off as I know it&#x27;s harder and would do even further damage!  I am a do-it-yourselfer so I am no pro.  Just love to do my nails at home.  This product, as well as all of the Harmony Gelish products have to be cured with a UV light just so you know.  Also, I have had consistent and super speedy shipping turn around by always choosing to order my polishes and nail needs from Direct Nail Supply.  Literally about three days from computer order to door!  I will continue to chose them no matter what!</li>
            <li> I use gelish products all the time and this is my all time lease favorite. it does a great job at making your nails hard but once removed, leaves nails very weak and damaged !! my nails were peeling weeks after I removed this! also I found it very difficult to apply. isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! My damaged-via-acrylic nails are stronger than ever and have a whole new life. Better yet, they no longer hurt and for that I am eternally grateful.  Such fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> leaks out of container - works ok but i dont use it much</li>
            <li> Although i know that it says to use this product after using the Gelish foundation I use this product without using the foundation as a base coat because I feel that the Gelish Structure and Gelish foundation is made out of the same ingredients  the only difference is that the structure gel is a lot thicker making the nails just more stronger. So this product is actually used as my base coat :-) You can also cure this product using the Senstionail Led Lamp :-) for 30 seconds which is amazing:-0 WOW!</li>
            <li> Works perfect and helps to get my nails in shape. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does help strengthen your nails and be creative by yourself or be pampered and have then done, either way it&#x27;s a must have</li>
            <li> This product peels even when you use the foundation coat. i even &#x27;scuffed&#x27; my nail to give it an uneven surface to make it easier to adhere and that did not work either. poor product.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I think I see another gel that is a bit thicker in vicosity than this.  I&#x27;m gonna try that.</li>
            <li> No complaints, item as described.  Would be nice if it came in a bottle with a brush for easier application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Polish Structure twice in the past 2 months and it leaves my short nails without any protection whatsoever! It also lifts and I haven&#x27;t had that problem with the OPI or Tammy Taylor gels when I use their structure gel only. All the Harmony Gelish nail polishes have been awsome but I&#x27;m a lot disappointed with the Hamony Gel!</li>
            <li> I bought the structure gel because my nails are very thin and i wanted to add a LOT of strength. I noticed when i used it that it is the exact consistency of the foundation gel. Well that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s EXACTLY THE SAME INGREDIENTS. They&#x27;re all in the same order so they could be different amounts i guess. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product knowing it&#x27;s probably the same thing and the company is just selling it to make money off of people. Save your money and just use the foundation gel and apply it thicker.</li>
            <li> takes long time to make it but it is very good compare to regular polish. this protects your natural nails</li>
            <li> I have very thin and weak nails.  The only way I could get my nails to grow was to have acrylics.  But after getting my first shellac manicure, I was sold.  I purchased the Gelish system and loved it!  But I was still breaking nails.  That is when I found Structure.  I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure.  I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed. The end result is fantastic.  Great strength without the thickness of acrylics. It has been a week now, and my nails still look like they were done today. I even just had two co-workers make comments about my \\&quot;professionally manicured nails\\&quot;.  You can imagine the look on their faces when I told them I did them myself!</li>
            <li> I always use structure gel underneath my Gelish colors.  It makes my nails extremely durable.  With structure gel my nails have grown long, and they never chip or break or feel weak.  Structure gel (along with the gelish line) is a must have product for people with weak and brittle nails or who bite their nails.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product does cause pealing if applied to thick. However a trick to prevent this from occuring is to ensure the ends of the nail is properly covered.</li>
            <li> I did my Mom&#x27;s nails this weekend and used Structure on them as she had layers of nails splitting and bad cracking at the end of her finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Structure gel has a hint of a very pale lilac color(cures to clear), is VERY thick, to the point that a soft brush is not a tool you want to use to apply it. I had no professional gel brushes so I cut down the brush from an empty bottle of polish (cleaned of course) to about 1/4\\&quot;. This worked well and allowed me to protect her soft, damaged nails while adding some strength without a lot of thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it VERY THIN - I repeat very very thin and stroked it along the length of the nail until it was smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this gel enhancement is very smooth, yet dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked great and the thin coat applied after the foundation/base, and before the color, cured under the UV lamp to a very shiny clear coat. It could be used without color if one desired a clear nail color, as every other product (except colored polishes of course) in Gelish process is cures to clear color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished off with the soak off gel nail polish on the color \\&quot;Light Elegant\\&quot;, applying 2 coats (each cured for 2 minutes under UV lamp), and a top coat of Top It Off. It looked like any other normal nail polish job except it was dry as soon as the last cure in lamp was done with no waiting time after the manicure. She loved it and it was very thin and delicate looking.</li>
            <li> Works well and good price.</li>
            <li> Very good product, would recommend</li>
            <li> Works great with acrylic powder to strengthen nails. By sure to apply extremely thin to prevent bulking on nails.</li>
            <li> Ingredients:  Di-Hema Trimethylhexyl Dicarbamate, HEMA, Hydroxypropyl Methacrylate, Hydroxycyclohexyl Phenyl Ketone, Violet 2 (CL 60725).  Has the same chemical ingredients as the Gelish Top It Off but is thicker in viscosity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose:  Used to strengthen weak nails and to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.  Use this product after the Gelish Foundation step has been completed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application.  When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail.  Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.  You want to minimize the times you lift the brush from the product so as not to incorporate air bubbles.  Once the nail is covered with the sculpting gel, turn your hand over keeping it level for 1 minute.  This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.  Cure as directed between each application.  See requirements for the cure time needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:  Gelish structure must be cured with an LED lamp or UV lamp system.  LED cure time 30 seconds.  36W UV Lamp - 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  For me this is a must have product.  I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application.  This helps to equal out the level differences between the two.  On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip.  Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top If Off as the final step&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money Saving Tip:  I have found it is much easier and more economical to purchase acrylic (water-base) paints and mix my own colors of choice for my nail polish.  I cover this with the Top It Off gel ensuring I swipe my nail tip to protect the acrylic water-based paint.  This will last the same amount of time as does the Gelish Soak Off Gel Nail Polish which is an average cost of $10 per .5oz bottle.  I am guaranteed my soak off removal time will be 10 minutes or less and I save a fortune by not having to buy expensive nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails, so even with the Gelish foundation gel, my nails would still tear and break off.  Gelish Structure, makes my nails thicker so they grow longer and do not tear between polishes.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I just tried this as part of my Gelish routine. I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 2 minutes to a high shine.  I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.</li>
            <li> This is a product that is needed for everyone....Thanks Gelish for such an exceptional product. This product is worth the money</li>
            <li> this stuff has changed my fingernail world..so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This product gives my nails the strength they need.  I apply it with an artist brush and it&#x27;s very fast and easy.  Would highly recommend this to people with weak nails.  This little pot will last a long,long time.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and didn&#x27;t like it all that much. I tried to apply it as thinly as I could. I even got three nails out of one application. No matter how long I let it cure under a UV lamp, it stayed wet. I gave up.</li>
            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!  STRUCTURE GEL HAS WORKED JUST GREAT FOR ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  I have been doing my own nails for years .. when I heard how long gel nails lasted .. I was hooked!  I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks .. my manicure very nicely 2 weeks .. then I must start to \\&quot;tip\\&quot; the ends with a matching regular nail polish.  When \\&quot;tipping the ends\\&quot; .. if I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color .. it will last better.  My nails grow quickly so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  Hope the below is helpful .. thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AUGUST 2013  (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS SO BADLY TO AMAZON VIA THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AUGUST 2013  The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. First remove old gel polish. Rough up nails well so acetone can get through. Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  with the pad slightly off center.  Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. . This helps keep the pads moist longer.  Do the second hand.  Put a glove on the second hand and set the timer for 20 minutes after completing 2nd hand. With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand, flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go. If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  Pads can reused a couple of times before throwing away .. flick off old polish from pad/flatten/let dry/store separated in paper sheets they came in.  (Using: Graham Hands Down Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps-works GREAT! -for small toenails the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)&lt;br /&gt; 2.  Apply cuticle remover .. push back the cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3.  Remove cuticle from nail plate.  Clean up as needed.  4.  Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  5.  Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  6.  Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  (IF POSSIBLE:  apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  Leave on overnight if possible. Then:  wash with soap and water and polish using the proper steps.&lt;br /&gt; 7.  Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol. You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  8. Apply  PH Bond to the nail plate. (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  9. SKIP TO #12 IF nails are not peeling/brittle/weak/damaged.  If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  **Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail. If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  10.  Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.) Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  10b NEXT  .. \\&quot;STRUCTURE GEL.  NOTE:  dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush. Then, wipe the rest of the gel off of the brush. Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail. I even wipe the brush off between each nail. This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds. (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  11. If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  DO NOT USE CLEANSER... this is a DRY cleaning.  12.  Apply Gelish Color Coat of Choice. First, seal the free edge of the nail. Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer. APPLICATION SHOULD BE ALMOST SEE-THROUGH ON 1st COAT!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  13.  Repeat Step 11, 12 &amp; 13 for 2nd color coat.&lt;br /&gt;  14.  Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER). First seal the free edge. Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION. If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  15.  Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  16.  Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:  a.  I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light .. with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  b.  I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet .. IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c.  Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second  Gelish kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d.  By searching and finally finding a regular nail polish (Sally Hansen \\&quot;#350 Heart to Heart\\&quot; Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Color) close to my gel polish (gelish \\&quot;Tiger Blossum-Item #01334) I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  Not looking great toward the end but tolerable!  In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails .. ie using the #350 to color the tip of the nails after they wear off.  I find I must do this nearly every day .. just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed .. then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  I get another week out of it .. YEAH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;e.

I was always using my Iphone as a timer backup for the UV lamp so this was really nice.

[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; **clients who like to peel the product off, I believe this may be why subsequent applications are not working. They are taking the top layer of keratin off. I always caution my clients not do to this and if they do, they cannot expect the product to perform the way it&#x27;s designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; **Do buy a bottle of cuticle oil and use it over your Shellac every day (I keep mine next to my bed and put iton at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; **there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now. Gelish, Geleration, Axxium, Gelicure... lots of them. They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  **Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first, some, all of the above.&lt;br /&gt;**  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:&lt;br /&gt;*****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  **I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine. I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  .. Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.

            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed to come across a gelish product that I&#x27;m not fond of. Even with my high wattage professional light, this stuff just won&#x27;t harden. I originally wanted to use these to extend my short nails, but the tips were very jelly and ripped off. (although granted, I may have used the wrong gel for that procedure.) But they did work fine as a double layer to make my brittle nails more strong. I just wish I could&#x27;ve made an acrylic-like manicure that would actually soak off.</li>
            <li> Helped keep my nails from breaking. I work in the food industry and this helped to strengthen them. Looked like I was wearing acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent structure gel. Must use small brush with it, could use Gelish foundation brush for easy application.  Adds a great strength and sturdiness to natural nails.</li>
            <li> Got this because I wanted something to add some strength too some tips I was applying to my nails. Did the job,  will continue to use this when I do my regular gel manis without tips just to get a bit more strength. :) Also, it was super easy to apply just like if you were painting your nail with polish. I used 3 thin layers with my tips and 2 layers without them.</li>
            <li> I have recently started doing gel manicures for several of my clients. This product is fantastic for those who have thin nails and need just a bit more strength than they would get with a gel manicure. I have never been disappointed with gelish and this product keeps that shining reputation.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> Works Great for strengthening nails I am trying to grow my nails out and using this with an SENATIONAIL  LED LAMP works great together</li>
            <li> I have been using this structure gel as part of my manicure for almost two months now. However, I just found a great use for it when you tear a nail and don&#x27;t want to cut it down.  I just did a french manicure 4 days ago with my index finger nail torn a little.  I put two thin coats of structure gel over the tear and finished my manicure.  Unfortunately, that fix only lasted for three days because I am so rough on my nails.  So, last night, I roughed up my gelish polish with a nail file over the tear.  I put three coats of structure gel over the tear (putting it in the UV lamp after every coat) and one coat under it.  I put one coat of Top It off over my whole nail.  Voila, nail fixed.  The nail feels a little thick but I did not have to redo my nails or cut them down to match the torn one!</li>
            <li> I used to waste my money on acrylic and gel nails, but just got the gelish system and added the structure gel in there, and I&#x27;ll never get my nails done again! Gelish is so easy to use!!! I just used a craft brush to apply the structure gel and my nails are hard, glossy, and gorgeous. I bought tips from Sallys and the structure gel is perfect for using with tips for french manis to reinforce it. Gelish is an expensive up front cost, as was the structure gel, but ITS WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products! It&#x27;s a soak-off gel line that I offer gel services to my clients. They have the best colors and this product is no different. It provides the strength and support needed to deliver superior results. I currently am using it on a broken toe nail as a foundation and have found it to be very effective. Although this is a temporary fix, I have had no problems out of it. Make sure you follow the application instructions to a T. If you can&#x27;t find them online, contact the company and obtain them from their customer service department. This is definitely a necessary of you are using this soak-off gel system.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Wish I would&#x27;ve known about it sooner! I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a product that I could you along with my gel polish that would strengthen my nails &amp; I&#x27;ve found exactly it! My nails are so much stronger &amp; my gel polish lasts a lot longer as well.... Even used this for gel extensions &amp; it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> My husbands nails started to split so ordered this  product for him... It worked!  Now the splits in his nails are nearly gone.  I would recommend this to anyone who has trouble with their nails breaking...</li>
            <li> We do several gel polish applications per day at the salon and 80% of the people we add Structure to their nails to give them a little bit more strength. This will not give you the strength of acrylics or gel nails but will give you more than your natural nails alone. Apply this very thin after your Foundation application. You can use this under Shellac also, after the base coat. We use LED lights and cure for 30 seconds but if you&#x27;re using UV then cure for 2 minutes. Do not wipe nails in between any of the layers, only at the end. And yes it&#x27;s true, your polish is 100% dry when finished. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is good if you want a little more strength of gel. My nails are very long and look great. You need your own brush or use the foundation brush. Either way you can layer or strength.</li>
            <li> I wear two to three coats of Structure between my Gelish foundation and Gelish Colors. I have VERY weak finger nails and this adds the perfect amount of strength to them. They grow long and never break or chip with the addition of Structure to my Gelish routine. Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, pops off easily, but good for overlays on natural nails. Good  for strength and growing natural nails, not good for tips.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for gel lovers.  My nails have been feeling weak, so I use this structure gel for a little extra strength, and it has work out nicely.  I also use this on my granddaughter to build her nails (she bites her nails) and it work great, they last her two weeks, (when they started to lift ) this is a great product, will continue to use, and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> the product was real small for the price</li>
            <li> This is a a great product!!  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> makes my nails stronger.  Used it twice and love it</li>
            <li> I love the thickness it adds to my weak nails and that I can wear it under polish as well.</li>
            <li> jar is always sticky, I can&#x27;t seem to get it cleaned. it arrived that way in shipping.</li>
            <li> Adds great strength to my nails. Easy to apply, not bulky. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> This works very well and gives a little more strength to my manicure.  I would recommend adding this to your gel manicure.  I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I put two coats of it over the &#x27;foundation&#x27; gelish.  It makes my nails strong and more resilent.  If i do get a split in a nail - I use a piece of a empty tea bag laid down on top of the foundation to mend the nail.  Again... awesome product.</li>
            <li> I use this when my nails are week. Its easy to use this yourself if you have an led lamp. It really gives your nails strength after taking off artificial nails.</li>
            <li> Definitely adds strength to the nails.  I used it on someone that had just ripped off their acrylics and it helped their nails grow without breaking while the damaged area grew out.  It also helps fill ridges and makes the nail look smoother.  I had no problems with it peeling at all and kept layers thin to prevent this.</li>
            <li> I used the structure after removing the acrylic nails I got for my wedding. I found my gel manicure with the structure to be almost as difficult to remove as the acrylics</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have this nails and this provided a smooth build up to protect my nails. Cures in LED in 30 seconds. Very easy to apply. A little thicker than gel polish but super easy to apply! Use PH first, than foundation, structure gel, gel polish &amp; lastly top it off. Great product. Will buy more when out.</li>
            <li> I could not love this product any more than I already do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been into doing my own nails. Mostly because my nails are always breaking and therefore hurt. They would snag on everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything to remedy this; NutriNail, Julep MIghty Nail, Derma Nail, OPI Envy etc. etc.. I have researched and tried many different methods of care. None of it worked for me like this product does. I understand that it is most definitely a different method of care, but it allows my nails to grow out naturally under a protective shield! That is what I think of this product! An extremely strong shield for my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gel Nails from a reputable salon would last 5 days max until they lifted and cracked. NOW, after a small layer of  this structure gel my manicure AND my nail strength last two weeks, minimum (I really just get sick of LONG nails and my nail color!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out about this product from the wonderful woman of Chickettes. com. I followed her instructions and am loving my nails ever since!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture of my nails is after a week&#x27;s worth of growth.</li>
            <li> Structure is everything I&#x27;ve been looking for...finally.  It brings strength to my nail, but behaves like a gel polish in that it&#x27;s not as thick, is easy to apply/work with, and is incredibly self-leveling.  I recommend applying it with THIN layers, curing, and then if you want further strength, apply additional layers, curing in between each.  This product is also very pliable once it does cure and all is said and done.  So it does a MUCH better job of molding with my uneven, wily nails.  This product reacts with both UV *AND* LED lights, which is wonderful, but my favorite thing about it is that it is soak-off.  Most builder gels are designed to be a permanent addition to your nail...once it&#x27;s applied, you&#x27;re pretty much done, and if you do get lifting, when you try to get it off, you will wind up with very thin, damaged nails.  Structure comes off just like gel nail polish--you soak a pad with acetone, wrap the nail, and wait about 10 minutes or so, at which time, it peels off without damaging the nail underneath.  This made this product perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Structure DOES work with nail tips, but keep in mind that if you DO decide to use nail tips, the very method that you would use to remove the color or the Structure gel--which is putting acetone-soaked pads on your nails--will also remove the nail tips themselves.  So if you&#x27;re using tips, you will have to re-apply a new set each time.rs sufficiently imo, and are yet another expense.  You can use sunscreen before using your UV lamp, but this is obviously greasy at a time when you want to be as clean and dry as possible, and it&#x27;s yet another step in an already very long process.  For these reasons, I decided on going the LED route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I&#x27;ve learned in my journeys is that there is a difference between the builder gel that they put on your nails in nail salons, and gel polish. Builder gel strengthens your nails, gel polish is simply nail color that cures under a light so that it dries completely by the time you are done, and can go straight to doing your business. My first purchase was a Sally Hansen gel nail kit, which was a great starter kit and gave a beautiful set of nails.  But I decided this wasn&#x27;t for me, because I felt I needed a bit of strengthening to my very thin nails.  Also, if you want to put tips on your nails, you will not be able to do it with a gel polish kit.  And keep in mind that gel polish, while it cures fast and lasts long, takes just as long to take off as it does to put on.  If you take off an old color and put on a new color in the same sitting, you will quite literally spend a couple of HOURS at this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to strengthen your nails like I was, or if you are looking to put tips on your nails, you will need some sort of builder gel.  This gel is brushed on your nail directly, and is designed to strengthen it. Most builder gels are thick and gloopy, and unlike the gel polishes, does not self-level as quickly or as easily--it&#x27;s harder to work with.  But when you&#x27;re done, you have a very hard set of nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with builder gels that cure to that level of rigidity is that if you have thin, pliable nails, or an uneven or damaged nail surface (dents, ridges, dings) like I do, there&#x27;s a good chance that the gel will lift...and very quickly, at that.  I found that most brands make a more pliable version of their builder gels (IBD makes a plain clear gel, for example, not labelled as \\&quot;Builder\\&quot; gel, but just as clear gel).  These tend to work much better with thin or damaged nails.  But no matter what, it is VERY important to rough up your nail surface with a file.  I&#x27;ve forgotten this step in the past, and have gotten lifting within a day.  You can use these pliable builder gels as the foundation step of your gel polish application, as long as you don&#x27;t wipe with alcohol between the pliable builder gel and your first coat of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leads me to this product, Structure.  It&#x27;s everything I&#x27;ve been looking for...finally.  It brings strength to my nail, but behaves like a gel polish in that it&#x27;s not as thick, is easy to apply/work with, and is incredibly self-leveling.  I recommend applying it with THIN layers, curing, and then if you want further strength, apply additional layers, curing in between each.  This product is also very pliable once it does cure and all is said and done.  So it does a MUCH better job of molding with my uneven, wily nails.  This product reacts with both UV *AND* LED lights, which is wonderful, but my favorite thing about it is that it is soak-off.  Most builder gels are designed to be a permanent addition to your nail...once it&#x27;s applied, you&#x27;re pretty much done, and if you do get lifting, when you try to get it off, you will wind up with very thin, damaged nails.  Structure comes off just like gel nail polish--you soak a pad with acetone, wrap the nail, and wait about 10 minutes or so, at which time, it peels off without damaging the nail underneath.  This, to me, made this product perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Structure DOES work with nail tips, but keep in mind that if you DO decide to use nail tips, the very method that you would use to remove the color or the Structure gel--which is putting acetone-soaked pads on your nails--will also remove the nail tips themselves.  So if you&#x27;re using tips, you will have to re-apply a new set each time.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw it in a tutorial somewhere, and the person said this helps keeps your nails stronger when used underneath your color of choice (after the foundation application). Works and cures as promised and the price was fantastic! I added this to my nail routine now and my nails are super strong. Not too thick, which is also great. I also kept an old brush from a finished bottle of foundation, and I use that to brush it on my nails. I also used the foundation brush directly, and they are the same ingredients, just a bit thicker (structure gel). Either one works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure you do not leave your brush (with product on it), or the structure gel, near the curing lamp, as this might harden the gel/brush.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. Works very well. Quick cure time 30 sec with LED lamp. Adds strength to my naturally long nails. Great price I will absolutely by from this seller again. Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I do my own at home gel polish, even with that my nails are weak and often rip at the edges.  This gel was the last piece for a perfect recipe in regards to nail strength! I now have long beautiful fingernails!  Just make sure to apply extremely thin layers and cure between each on and don&#x27;t forget to paint the top of your nail to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it otherwise it&#x27;ll lift faster than it should.</li>
            <li> Does thicken and reinforce natural nails that have been damaged by impatient gel polish removal, and it&#x27;s excellent as a smoothing coat after very glittery gel polish, and before Top It Off, but since I like to apply tips to my natural nails, I think I&#x27;m going to have to purchase some Hard Gel again in clear. Structure gel doesn&#x27;t have the strength to wear tips on your nails, but you can soak it off like Gelish polish. Hard gel must be filed off.</li>
            <li> My nails are damaged from years of acrylics so now as I grow them out I use the structure gel to give them more strength.  Seems to be working great!  Going to use gel from now on!</li>
            <li> Helpful Aid in the event of a broken nail or weak nail.  You have to be careful not to apply too much, or it gets too thick and peels off easily.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased on how great this product works! Bought the application brush from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store and it goes on great and you don&#x27;t have to use alot it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> We are yet to use this but my wife loves anything nail related. She can&#x27;t wait to use this next time she does her nails.</li>
            <li> Works great, love it and it really help my nails not to chip or break because even though you have gel polish on them you nail can still chip and break.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and soaks off easy.  I have noticed that my nails are stronger when I applied the structure gel.</li>
            <li> too thick to dry quickly</li>
            <li> The packaging (jar) was damaged somehow, so when I received it the mail package was covered inside with gel. I&#x27;ll repurchase in the future to actually try out the product.</li>
            <li> Great product!. EZ &amp; smooth application. Same/Similar ingredients as the Foundation/Base but a bit thicker in consistency; super easy to apply (I used the same brush from the foundation bottle, after swishing off as much foundation from brush as possible). Great for repairs, xtra strength on my nails. Don&#x27;t let the small size container fool you, there&#x27;s lots of product in there, very little is needed for each nail. The container opening to get to the product is same diameter as lid so be careful when opening.</li>
            <li> Ordered product on the 7th &amp; it arrived on the 10th. Be warned. Pay attention to the 0.5 oz. That means its SMALL. But its very thick so a little will go a long way. I love this product &amp; all other Gelish products. Very satisfied with the results!</li>
            <li> Only have used it a few times but seems to work great. I will continue to use this product as needed.</li>
            <li> The one thing my nails lack is STRUCTURE! It is one of the biggest reason why I switched form regular nail polish to gels. I have weak bendy nails, no matter what vitamins I take, its just the way my nails are. I do my own gels at home using gelish products. I bought structure to use as a medium for my loose glitters. Which also works pretty well (But I prefer tapping loose glitter into the sticky layer. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews by people who dislike this product, in my opinion, it is because of the user not the product. The key to a good structure application is a good foundation layer. Buff your natural nail using a super fine grit (pay extra attention to the cuticle area where it is most oily and dont miss your sides) use the cleanse to remove the dust, use a good amount of ph and dont forget to dab a bit under your free edge, apply foundation in a super thin layer using swirl and swipe motions (one brush load wiped clean will coat all nails perfectly, start with your thumb and cap your free edges) Foundation and Structure have a similar application, thin thin thin! I use a flat square nail art brush wiped almost clean, be sure to cape you edges. I use 2-3 layers, before applying my gel color. I have never experienced peeling, in fact just the opposite. My nails are stable enough to grow twice as long and my normal 14day wear will last days longer and in better condition. The removal is exactly the same as when you don&#x27;t use structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all that awesome, structure is also a pretty good way to apply gems. dab a dot, place, and cure!</li>
            <li> Excellent if you have nail ridges, little imperfections or just want a bit of strength for sensitive nails as you grow them out.  I love this stuff and use one coat per manicure.  It seems a little more challenging to remove it vs. polish alone but I&#x27;m not a pro at removing either to be honest.  I find myself soaking all of it no matter which it is for about 20 minutes and foil/cotton ball techniques are a joke at best.  I would order this for reinforcement and continued health and great appearance of your Gelish manicured nails.  Once again Andrea on Chickettes and her blog were not only very convincing but spot on correct!</li>
            <li> I have this stuff for about a year  I love it  I use it with some acrylic powder made it really hard  cause I&#x27;m a nurse  aid &amp; housekeeper  so I need  that hardness  lol but I love  doing my own nails I wish I could  leave a pic bit don&#x27;t know how</li>
            <li> Works ok but can not replace a trip to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> I use this gel over the base coat, and before the colour coat.  I find that it adds strength to my natural nails that were weakened by over a decade of continual acrylic nails.  When I first took off the acrylics, my nails were so weak and they bent if you looked at them.  I used to put tips over them, then this gel, then the colour.  I&#x27;ve done that for the past few months, and now I find I don&#x27;t need the tips anymore.  I can just use this gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as easy to use as the polish as you need your own brush, but it&#x27;s thicker and adds strength.</li>
            <li> I am not as thrilled with this product as I have been with every other Gelish product that I have used.  I find that my my nail polish peels off after a few days when using the structure gel.  I have tried three times, thinking that I had done something wrong, but it has happened every time.  I thought I put on too thick of a coat at first but I went much lighter the subsequent two times, so that was not it.  I may have gotten a bum jar of it, I&#x27;m not sure, but I have just stuck with the basic gelish application since then and skipped the structure gel.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy. It made my nails stronger and they feel amazing. Its kind of hard to work with sometimes, but less really is more. it does what it says it will do and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, it gave my nails the added strength I wanted. My nails are nice and long now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this actually helps strengthen my nails, but just makes them look bulky and thick. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly, but I&#x27;ve found that when I don&#x27;t use it the gel polish lasts longer. I was hoping it would act like a ridge filler, but really it doesn&#x27;t and some polishes wrinkle badly on top of this and yet are fine just over a base coat.  Will try some tips from other reviewers but for now, it&#x27;s sitting on a shelf.</li>
            <li> Great nail builder that&#x27;s super durable yet easy to soak off, while proving to be an excellent strengthening base for brittle/bendy nails. HORRAY! Even secures nail art gems and jewelry! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I just applied it yesterday and so far no issues with it.</li>
            <li> Gelish is a great product.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. Now I don&#x27;t have to pay $20 a pop at the salon!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with loose glitter.</li>
            <li> This product self levels, it builds the nail , yet it still looks natural. Easy to work with considering am new to using structure gels. It&#x27;s great to use when you repair nail cracks with the tea bag method cause it doesn&#x27;t show the patch work at all. A little nail buff over the glued patch, then cover with one thin layer of the harmony gelish vitagel strengthener and seal with the structure gel and voila you are done.</li>
            <li> Loving the Gelish system. Bought this along with the full size Basix kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: As promised, it is self-leveling, especially if you hold your hand palm-up for the first bit of cure time. I use two coats to fortify my post-acrylic-removal nails, which are thin and prone to breaking until they grow out completely. Also in regard to using after acrylics, it covers the ridge left by the dremel nicely even when used without color. It mixes and cures well with glitter added (no more than 30% additives tho). Definitely makes my natural nails stronger and harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If I&#x27;m not careful to cap the tip (spread a thin layer of gel along the edge of the nail) it will begin to lift before a week. However, since I do this at home and own the whole set up,  I tend to touch up the tips now and then as I see they may be getting worn thin. Also I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the kind of thing you can build tips with - though pretty hard, it does remain a little gummy,  not at all the acrylic-hard you want for long false tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I won&#x27;t be doing gel nails without this stuff at least until mine grow out stronger. Until then, my Structure gel is a nail saver! I really love it actually - I consider it an essential part of my Gelish kit!!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel nail manicure for quite some time after having acrylic nails for several years.  Even though I wouldn&#x27;t say my nails are soft, but the acrylics definitely made them harder.  I missed that durability and decided to try some options.  Structure seems to make my manicure slightly more solid feeling, but not like the acrylics.  It did, however, give me a nice full two week manicure with no lifting and little wear.</li>
            <li> I use this after the foundation layer and before I use color. Its great!!! Gives my nails that really hard thick feel to them and soooo shiny and smooth. Definitely reccommend this!</li>
            <li> This product does what it promises; however, it&#x27;s messy. No matter what I do the outside of the jar is sticky because the contents are extra gooey.</li>
            <li> I started using the gel polish about a month ago and I found my nails growing nice and long but they became very brittle and started peeling, which is typical from my nails, not a result of the gel polish.  I found some blogs that talked about this structure and ordered myself a container.  This works wonders.  Before I was only getting 4 days on my gel nails before they started peeling, but now I can get about 11 days out of a manicure.  My nails are not splitting and are very durable thanks to this structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a little on the thick side.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the nail dehydrator first, then Gel Foundation and cure for 30 seconds.  Then I take a dry acrylic brush and remove the tacky layer of the nails and then paint on the structure gel onto my nails like regular polish and then cure (LED) for 30 seconds.  Then apply two coasts of Gel polish followed by top coat (curing between each coat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect hard as nails, Nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try if you find your nails brittle, soft or flaky.</li>
            <li> i have no great manicure skills and I can apply this easily. I put it on after  foundation gel .. before color.&lt;br /&gt;I had a definately half  torn baby  fingernail . I used this gel with a tiny piece of tea bag and it held for almost 3 weeks. I did 2 layers of structure gel. It did make this baby nail a tad thicker but not really noticably to others, just me .It made all my nails stronger for sure.</li>
            <li> Amazing adds strength to your nails</li>
            <li> Maybe its just me. But this always gets EVERYWHERE and is super sticky to clean up.  Regardless, it works wonders in my thin nails.  I also regularly mix it with Martha Stewart fine glitters to create my own glitter nails with my own custom mixed colors.  Makes doing my nails a lot of fun</li>
            <li> My nails are very weak after wearing acrylic nails for years. I tried the Shellac Gel manicure (no chips for 10 -14 days). The polish did not chip, but it is a very thin formula and did nothing to protect or strengthen my natural nails. I read about the Gelish Nail System and discovered that not only does that system have a Foundation base coat, but also has the Structure Gel coat made especially for weaken nails. I have just completed my 1st attempt of DIY Gelish nails and they turned out great, and the Structure Gel provides the extra protection and strength that my weak nails need! And I saved $40 by doing it myself!!!</li>
            <li> This shipped so fast! I was pleasantly surprised to find it in the mail just after a couple days of ordering. It goes on clear, it looks light lavender in the bottle but with just one coat it is clear. I did the foundation, structure gel, and then the top coat. It has been 3 days so far and no lifting, chipping or anything. I am so happy I found this product! I go from natural nails to acrylics a lot and so my nails are pretty thin. I think this is really going to help when I am without acrylics. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once but had bad results as my gel polish peeled within two days.  My gel usually stays put for two weeks.  I will try again and update.</li>
            <li> If you have weak nails - ones that break off easily or flake - then STRUCTURE is exactly what you need.  I do the \\&quot;shellac\\&quot; thing but without STRUCTURE I was still have problems growing nails.  I put on two thin coats of STRUCTURE (curing between applications) right after I put on the foundation gel.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the additional strength it gives my nails.</li>
            <li> My clients LOVE it.  It really helps to grow out your nails.  I took my acrylics off for the first time in  forever a few weeks ago.  My nails plates were brittle and thin and in sad sad shape overall.  I&#x27;ve been using structure gel and they are growing and not one has torn or broken.  Love it love it love it!!  And Direct Nail Supply here on Amazon is THE BEST EVER!!  So friendly, so fast, best deals, and great selection.  I&#x27;ll be back again and again.</li>
            <li> After looking at the ingredients this product is the exact same as the foundation. Just packaged differently. It didn&#x27;t make a difference once applied.</li>
            <li> I add this after the gelish foundation. I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and I&#x27;m not sure if it helps make nails stronger, but I like it for an extra layer of polish. It makes the gelish color go on smoother. I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s in a jar because it is very tacky and can get messy real easily if not careful. I just use the brush from my old nail polish that I&#x27;ve cleaned and that seems to work fine. I don&#x27;t really think this is a necessity in the gelish line, I thought it would be better for the nails. Honestly, I could just use an extra layer of gelish color and get the same result as this. It didn&#x27;t seem to help the gelish last longer either, which is another reason I wanted to try it. I probably won&#x27;t get it again, but a little goes a long way and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> works well if you have a crack or split nail until it grows out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing the great strength that other reviewers seem to be talking about with this product.  I have used it for full sets twice (over-lays on my natural nail, medium long length) and have gotten cracks across my nails just above the smile line.  That is consistently happening and I&#x27;m not sure why.  It has not cracked my natural nail and I never hit a finger hard enough to notice it (you know how when you bash into something and you look at your hand expecting to see a broken nail).  I have been applying it in thin coats as many of the reviewers have suggested and swear by how well it works for them that way. I recently tried IBD strong builder gel and so far I haven&#x27;t had any of those cracks appear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take that long to cure. I cure it for about 1 minute using my Red Carpet led lamp. It&#x27;s buildable and it really helps to keep your nails strong and healthy. A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is so awesome. It&#x27;s almost like builder gel and it&#x27;s solid like it too. Easy to apply and really works helping strengthen the nail. Love it.</li>
            <li> Even when I got my nails done at a salon with gel and an &#x27;on lay&#x27; they would still crack and peel.  Now that I am doing my own, I use two coats of Structure after the base coat but before the color and my nails are strong.  They don&#x27;t crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to put it on in thin coats.  Before you cure each coat, turn your hand over so the Structure has a chance to shape itself into a slight mound (about a minute).  This will help create a more natural rounded nail base and won&#x27;t slide into the cuticles.</li>
            <li> This gel makes your manicure last way longer.</li>
            <li> I ❤ this gel!! I saw many positive reviews on Youtube and wanted to try it and it is AWESOME! Very fast shipping too! Thank you!!😍</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase. Refer to original feedback for full details.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem helpful at all. I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t provide a brush with it but not a huge deal. I just think it was a waste of money. With Gelish base, usually 2 coats of polish and top coat, nails seem just a strong.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!  I will purchase this again.  Great medium to mix glitter with for your nails. A little bit of product goes a long way.  Use a thin coat for better results.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought the structure was to strengthen my nails. They have been growing and getting healthy for over a year after having acrylic nails for years. So I bought the gelish starter kit and was pleased but still needed something stronger. So I got this..the minute finish the set it started to peel. Not what I was expecting since I was pleased with the other gelish product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to reconsider if you are looking for a product that will make your nails a bit stronger and not peel within days. Nevertheless, I will continue to use the gelish kit products..just back to the drawing board for something that will make my nails stronger.</li>
            <li> Works great when using with acrylic tips &amp; gelish to add that extra strength. I recommend any harmony product. :)</li>
            <li> i use this for my glitter nails. i love glitter nails, i just take my brush and dip it in the pot and then the glitter and brush it on, then cure</li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews for this product, and I had huge hopes that this was the miracle product to make my nails strong and pretty, and it does work, but not as well as I had hoped it would, I use a lot of the gelish and other at home gel kit products, and do my own gel nails at home, and here lately they seem to be very damaged, broken down to barley nothing, and chip soo easy, and they wont grow out, so I thought I could use this and just leave them clear, so I wouldn&#x27;t have so much product on my nails, which is what I have been doing, however it seems to only stay on for about a week, then starts to peel off, and I hope that is not damaging my nails more, I don&#x27;t think it is though, I also use the correct removers. but this is a good product, it works great under gel nail products, or with acrylics, and also alone, I have ben wearing it alone the most, but have used it in every way, and I will continue to use this, and buy more, I do recommend this, since it can be used in many ways if you do gel nails or acrylics, and also just as a base for your nails to look pretty if you don&#x27;t even wear polish, and to help give them some more strength, or to put under gel or regular polish to add more strength and coverage ect... I do like this product a lot! and I do recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have really bad, think, cracking nails.  I bought this hoping it would be strong and allow my natural nails to grow below.&lt;br /&gt;1st - the application is messy.  It needs some sort of brush, one that I don&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;2nd - doesn&#x27;t make my nails any stronger.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I was very careful in applying the product. I followed the directions precisely and I still developed an allergy to the product. It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  I tried giving my nails 2months off but the blisters came back faster that before. But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it. I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> I do soak off gels myself but you need this to make your nails stronger. Apply a few coats then add your color coats.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my results, I gel my nail every three week and this product really works great. Thanks Gelish. I will definitely recommend this item to my friends.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you watch a you tube video on this product before you purchase it. It takes a bit of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish line and this product is no different. I love it so much that I ordered two!</li>
            <li> I found this product is very good.  I did 2 coats under polish and over foundation. You might need to research how to apply online. It doesn&#x27;t come with brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing gel manicures in salons, and now on myself for a little while now, and while my nails started to grow, they wouldn&#x27;t grow too long before breaking or \\&quot;flaking\\&quot; down.  I found the structure to be extremely easy to use, when applied with a nail art brush.  It gives just an extra bit of thickness, without being too bulky or looking too unnatural.  You can also add glitter directly to the structure gel and have extra sparkly nails :)  I love this product!</li>
            <li> This Gelish structure gel is absolutely amazing! I love the way it makes my nails feel and makes them feel so much thicker too!! I also mix it with loose glitter and make a glitter paste and it&#x27;s so awesome good by to tapping loose glitter onto the nail!!!</li>
            <li> I use this over my foundation coat of Gelish polishes, and under my color of choice, but it can be applied over the top of the color as well.  Looks great as a clear coat if you want to wear your natural nails.  I still do the &amp;#34;Top it Off&amp;#34; Gelish coat as well.  Haven&#x27;t tried it by itself without that coat, so I&#x27;m not sure if you need the TIO coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do 3 thin coats, with 2-3 drying cycles in between coats.  Builds my nails up just enough to be a bit thicker/stronger, but not too hard, to where they hurt when I (inevitably) hit them on something.  I waited to review this product before reviewing it because I wanted to be able to share the ease of removal.  Applying was simple, removal was super simple too.  Just remove as you would any Gelish polish.</li>
            <li> I have paper thin nails, literally. As a former lifelong nail biter, my nails are weak, brittle, and exceedingly thin. Even using the gel polishes, I needed something to add strength that was not going to require me to file the protection off when I had enough growth. This stuff did the trick and then some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my haste and knowing my nails, I applied four thin coats after the Gelish Foundation but under my color and top coat. My nails were thick as if I had laid an acrylic overlay. I was very hopeful that I would not see chipping and splitting during the anticipated 2 weeks wear time. well two weeks was not long enough! I could have gone much longer. I had over 14 days of wear, not a chip, crack, or dent that needed repair (accept the slice I took out of the tip of my thumb preparing Thanksgiving dinner, which I simply applied two coats to the tip to reseal the edge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside.... I forgot that heat is helpful in the soak off process. It took over an hour and a half to soak off all layers. Next time, I will remember to use the warm towel when I soak and see if that helps. Because I want to be able to change my polish sooner than two weeks this go round, I have opted for two coats of structure under my color. My nails are plyable again so I am hoping I don&#x27;t see any of them break.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It is thicker than polish but smooths itself out on your nail. Adds strength without thickness. Put it on after base but before color. Soaks off with polish..no problem!</li>
            <li> I did research &amp; decided to invest in the complete kit &amp; professional tools.  Then I found Structure Gel &amp; knew I&#x27;d found the secret to a successful home manicure.  I followed the steps very carefully, 4 times, and finally decided my time was worth more. I had even used the LED light too &amp; applied thin coats but it just would not adhere.  Selling it all &amp; returned to the salon.</li>
            <li> My thin nails seem to crack even with the no chip polish on.  However, this product is a miracle!  It mends and holds my cracked and broken nails so that they are able to grow out.  I love it because it really works!</li>
            <li> This arrived as a lump of goo in a jar. Unusable. Obviously way past its shelf-life. Also, no brush is included.</li>
            <li> This product adds significant strenght and rigidity to your nail specially if you apply multiple coats. My nail was damaged, super thin and brittle, I applied 3 coats and now is very rigid almost as acrylic nails. I think this will protect my nails to grow stronger again.  love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought this I tried to apply multiple coats of the base coat, but id did not work well. This a different product than the base coat.</li>
            <li> i was trying to teach myself how to use this...it was ok</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is great for soft nails that bend easily, it adds just enough support that they are strong.&lt;br /&gt;However, I received it in the mail and it had leaked all over itself and the small plastic bag it was shipped in. That aside, great product!</li>
            <li> I do my own gel manicures but my nails have always been a little weak and sometimes still bend after a week or so.  This stuff isn&#x27;t as goopy/thick as acrylic but it does add some strength to your nails.  Takes a little bit of practice to get used to working with it though.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish look but I don&#x27;t always want a color. This is perfect. A brush is needed to apply the product, once on it gives a beautiful shine to my nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super thick and is kind of hard to spread in a smooth layer on the nail; however, once it is on, it really strengthens the nail and just looks like clear polish. I like the Gelish line.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful replacement for my weak nails and chips without the smell and chemicals of acrylic liquid. You can also use this with acrylic powder for even more strength. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using it ,very nice and easy to use ,love working with it and as with all gelish products as well</li>
            <li> I have followed the directions and found that I can only keep the product from lifting for a few days.  I was looking for the 2+ weeks that everyone is talking about... So with the lifting and pealing off, my nails have become ruined.  I have stopped using all the products.</li>
            <li> Used this one time and it was hard to get off , But will try again nails were weak and damage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit runny compared to the Structure Gel (black jar) but great for mixing your own pigments, glitters &amp; setting in jewels/studs/cabochons. Not so much for creating nail extensions. I notice I have to create a thicker layer to prevent my long nails from bending when accidentally jabbing into things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for soak off. If you do have a thick layer though, I suggest trying to thin it out w/ a dremol or file, otherwise it will curve your nail bed pinching into your finger(s). Not a pleasant feeling and can scare the shiznat out of someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional. I&#x27;m a DIY type of person. I love gels/nail art and prefer to do it myself because it&#x27;s fun. #jennyfulnail</li>
            <li> I use Structure gel with every gel manicure that I do at home. I cure a coat of the Foundation gel, then apply and cure a coat of the Structure gel, and then continue with the color application and Top It Off top coat. It really helps strengthen my nails and prevent breakage; however, my nails still occasionally chip and peel even when using Structure gel. I do at-home Gelish/Shellac manicures 3-4 times per month and I have used Structure gel weekly since purchasing it over a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint with this product is packaging. I wish that Gelish would incorporate the strength of their structure gel with their Foundation gel, or at least package the Structure gel in a bottle with a brush, similar to how the Foundation gel is sold. Structure Gel is sold in a small jar so you have to use a separate brush, which means that you have another item to clean with acetone after your manicure. Adding the extra coat of Structure gel adds strength, but it is tedious to have to do two base coats. It also adds a couple extra minutes of soak-off time to remove your Gelish manicure when you use Structure gel. Because of the packaging and extra step involved with using Structure gel, I am looking for a better nail strengthener that I can use with my at-home gel manicures.</li>
            <li> Love the gelish foundation will buy more Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gelish polish line for over a year and love it!  I thought I would try Structure to add a bit of strength.  Unfortunately, all Structure did was lift off my nails within a day.  My beautiful Gelish manicure was gone.  I did try keeping my nails under the lamp longer and still it lifted.</li>
            <li> i repaired my split nail with this product. first i dehydrated, then foundation and led set it. next i put a sm piece of nail silk and and layered 2-3 coats of structure ,led seting in between each layer. added 2 coats of color and finally top it off ,led setting between each coat. looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this but hate the execution. It made a mess of the brushes I used and I&#x27;m not sure it made much of a difference in my nails, plus it doesn&#x27;t make a good top coat so I can&#x27;t really paint over it either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my nails for years.  It&#x27;s a favorite hobby of mine.  I was using the &#x27;hard&amp;#34; gel for years and recently came across this.  I bought it because I like the idea of not have to chisel away at the hard gel to get it off.  That was a huge, time consuming pain in the backside.  So I bought the PH bonder and this gel.  The first time I used it I did not use the foundation, because I didn&#x27;t know I was supposed to and so often the &amp;#34;bases&amp;#34; they recommend are unnecessary anyway.  I was so disappointed.  within less that a day the gel just peeled right off my nails.  I was so bummed because I had high hopes for this product.  Then, I researched a bit more.  It seemed that others had reviewed it and altho I saw some reviews that said it peeled off even after using the Gelish foundation, most of the reviews seemed to say that with the foundation it worked great.  I was hesitant to dump another $17 into this &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; but I really wanted it to work, so I did.  I am very happy to report that with the foundation it works like a dream!  It all cures very quickly under an LED lamp [highly recommend over a UV] and my nails have never looked and felt better.  Works great over my natural nails, and causes far less damage than the hard gel.  It is also incredibly easy to remove by comparison to the hard stuff.  It also works well with artificial tips.  All in all, I believe that I have found my new gel!!!  I will never go back to the hard gels [like IBD and the other Gelish] because of the lifting which is such a pain, and the incredible difficulty and time consumption of removal.  Recommend HIGHLY!</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails on which really damaged my nails. They were very thin and split easily.  This evened out the surface of my nails so you couldn&#x27;t see the ridge the acrylics left behind. I have extremely weak nails...though this doesn&#x27;t make my nails rock hard, it does strengthen them quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I used this product to support a nail that was split.  The structure gel kept the nail from bending and splitting more while it grew out. I will use this as a foundation for each Gelish polish application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for almost two month nows and I&#x27;m happy, no ecstatic, to say that my nails are not chipping or breaking - even though I type all day long.  The nail that was split has grown out enough to where I actually filed the split part off and stll have good length on that nail.  I posted a pic on Dec 3 with just the Structure Gel and the Simple Sheer polish.  I can say now that my nails have doubled in length. I posted a \\&quot;month later\\&quot; pic with a French Manicure to show the difference in the nail length.</li>
            <li> I use the Gelish polish system at home.  Most of the time the foundation that comes in the Fabulous Four Gelish system is strong enough when I use two coats under my polish color.  However, there are times when I have weak spots in my nails and need that extra hard filler - that&#x27;s when I use the Structure Gel.  One coat of Structure Gel replaces two coats of foundation.</li>
            <li> Ok...I have been a fanatic about doing my own gel manicures for over 3 years now. I have mostly used OPI Axxium (in the little pots) until I started using LED products and switched to OPI GelColor. I loved the colors and my nails always looked great but  they just weren&#x27;t thick enough to prevent breaking when the length got past the tip of my finger. I am very rough on my nails, as I have a job that requires it.  I have dry nails and they always crack (especially the thumb) so low on the nail bed it is ridiculous. I scoured YouTube for reviews and was relentless in finding a product that was perfect for my needs. Gelish Structure Gel??  NAILED IT!!!!!  So, yes; I ordered the structure gel, the Gelish Foundation and the Top it Off. Since I still have a ton of older product from OPI, I used the OPI Alpine Snow for my French tips. Amazon prices can&#x27;t be beat.  Don&#x27;t go to Sally&#x27;s.  Serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a 5 star rating for the simple reason, it does what I wanted it to do, and more. (and more??  ...I&#x27;ll get there in a minute).  Let&#x27;s talk about fixing a cracked nail that you know darn well will take a month to grow out if you cut it off.  When you crack a nail on the side it&#x27;s so disappointing.  I actually had better luck just poking this structure gel into the crack (by kind of jabbing at it, backwards with the brush) than I did using a silk wrap and putting structure gel over it. I also made sure to do an extra coat of structure gel.  It&#x27;s still &amp;#34;fixed&amp;#34; after a week an a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a person that likes my nails to look on the artificial side (by being too perfect) but not so thick to look fake. A couple coats of this (plus my French tip gel polish) give me a professional look and then I use the Top it Off to really give it that shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to layering your gel polishes is to use THIN coats. Thick coats will lift. I use Foundation, about 2 coats of the Gelish Structure Gel, my white tip polish, and Top it off.  If youfeel like another coat of structure gel is in order prior to the top it off,  by all means, go for it. Just keep it thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok....the &amp;#34;and more&amp;#34; part.  I questioned weather or not you would be able to see a color difference in the nail when you did a &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; rather than soaking it all off in acetone and starting over.  I tried a &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; because I wanted to see if it would even work. I couldn&#x27;t imagine filing off gel because it looks so horrible and ruined! I had never done it and I assumed it all had to be done fresh each time.  Anyways...I filed my gel polish down and did a fill and I CAN&#x27;T SEE A COLOR DIFFERENCE. You know how when you have acrylic nails you can see where you had your fill and you always look forward to that &amp;#34;new set?&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t get that here. My fill looks like a new set, and it&#x27;s been about a week and a half.  Oh, by the way, no lifting. I think a key to this is doing a proper manicure and making sure you get all the cuticle off your nail prior to applying it, which I did. I also added the PH bonder to the natural nail after filing. I also scrubbed the brush downward into the existing gel polish to be certain to  fill in any tiny gaps if there were any. Then  smoothed it all out and cured it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in conclusion, I loved the product because it is thick, it fixes broken nails, it works well for a fill and doesn&#x27;t seem to discolor (although I have not tried the tanning bed or swimming yet). I love that it looks like I have artificial nails but they are thin enough and thick enough at the same time.  Every time I do my nails I feel like I&#x27;ve saved $30.00+, more than the price of the product. I actually bought my own 2mm Swarovski crystals off Amazon and this gel holds them in place and they haven&#x27;t popped off yet.  I do an extra coat of the structure gel on the nail I have my crystal on just for extra support. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy moreof this and I look forward to doing my nails again, knowing I don&#x27;t have to soak them off each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 08-14-16: I STILL love this product and am ordering all fresh stuff today. If you are experiencing air bubbles in your gel polish, it is likely from shaking the product and not letting it rest a bit before using. With the structure gel, don&#x27;t swirl or mix it around too much because it causes air bubbles. Dip the brush and use long deliberate strokes; lifting the brush as few times as possible.</li>
            <li> Love this product allows my nails to be longer. Is a strengther you use after your base coat. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a problem with chipping and pealing. I did a test on several people with polish. On 3 clients, I polished with a thin coat and on another I polished with a slight thicker coat. One of the clients polish that was applied thinly chipped off the next day. The client with the thicker coat chipped off the next day and the two remaining clients with the thinner coats are lasting 6 days now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s causing this. I&#x27;m using the Bondaid on the nails before applying and prepping the nails also. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li> Good quality in generally because I use this product ex.2 years now, unfortunatly this time it arrives not in good conditions.. it was leaking all over the envelope. I looked all over the pot but find no damage spot. Sorry I didnt think to took a picture of it so...hoopfully next time it will arrives in good conditions</li>
            <li> Product Is A Great Size And Price, But Upon Opening The Structure Gel It Was Only 3/4&#x27;s Full. Overall Good Product, Will Probably Purchase Another One Once This Is Finished.</li>
            <li> My nails were horrible all my life.  Splits and peeling.  I began using a nail gel system several months ago, which helped a lot, but by 7 days they were begining to lift and split.  I decided to use the Gelish Structure.  I purchased a #6 square brush, since this is not like the polish gels.  It is a thick gel, in a little pot.  I was surprised that I was able to apply without difficulty.  Thin, thin coats seemed to be the answer. You then apply the polish layers and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;My nails seem to be much stronger , and the gel adheres well to the nail.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Great so far. It arrived in good condition with no leaks and was sealed. I also use it to make glitter tip designs aside from strengthening. Would love it if came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Gel polish manicures are always touted for lasting up to 2 weeks.  I was always disappointed when mine started looking ragged after 3-4 days.  With regular polish, I would have to reapply daily or every 2 days.  The reason for my dissatisfaction stems from the fact that my nails are thin, peel easily and often chip or break without much effort.  Imagine my delight with this product (which is EXTREMELY easy to use), when after a week my gel manicure looks as good as the day I applied it!  This was the missing piece of the puzzle for my manicure and now I will NOT go without it!  It&#x27;s also given my weak nails the extra strength that they need to be able to grow.  I&#x27;m sold!  Even if my manicure doesn&#x27;t end up lasting 2 weeks, I&#x27;m excited that the results looks so professional and all I had to do was add an extra step in my polish process to get such fantastic results!</li>
            <li> Shipped pretty quick and does was it&#x27;s suppose to do. You need to apply thin coats or else it will not cure correctly. You also need to buy your own brush to apply this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this product because it is advertised as LED curable, however it really isn&#x27;t. I tried curing less, curing longer, all to no avail. Wiping off the sticky layer just removes the gel as well. Now if I want to use this stuff, I have to purchase a UV lamp...</li>
            <li> This soak off gel is the worst ever!!! First off it lifted in one day and second it does major damage to your nail bed during removal. I thought that it was a soak off for the purpose of not leaving damage to the natural nail bed?!? If I wanted to reuin my nails I could have saved 12$ and put my regular none soak off gel back on them! I have been growing them out for the last 8 months trying to get rid of the damage done by wearing artificial nails for the last 5 yrs, and now they are reuined again grrr...Im not happy :(</li>
            <li> Did not like this product at all. Felt like it made my nails chip and oral way more with it than without it.</li>
            <li> This product is as described. It is very easy to soak off. It made my natural nail a little stronger, but if you put on an extra coat of color I think I get the same result.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love all Gelish products so far. The structure has given the nail sets the extra they needed. Order came timely and without any problems.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own gel polish for about 6 months now and I love the added strength it gives your nails; so I purchased this as I was using several coats of top coat to get the desired thickness. I have used 2 times now and love it. First application was super easy, the product does not run and holds shape which is a big difference than the top coat I was using. It gave so much strength and durability to my nails I had it on for 2 weeks and could have gone on much longer but the growth was getting noticeable and I was bored with my color. I did notice some lifting after a week, but as long as I didn&#x27;t pick at it the polish stayed in place. The amount of lifting was very minimal to my normal gel application without the structure gel underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove I just used a curved metal nail tool to gently lift off my nail bed. The polish was still very much adhered to my nail, but with some work it peeled off. I hate soaking in acetone, so this was a great alternative. Again, my polish looked great after 2 weeks, and I highly recommend adding this to your gel routine, it makes it that much better!</li>
            <li> This leaves my nails too flexible. I have paper thin nails that get so flimsy they bend back. I got this to make my Nails thicker so I could get some length and it still isn&#x27;t good enough. They are still too flexible. I have started doing my nails in an acrygel way that I found on YouTube. I just paint on the foundation gel by gelish, or this could work too, and dip my nails in acrylic powder, then put my nails under the led light. After 3 coats of this my nails are super thick, just like regular acrylics.</li>
            <li> My nails are naturally peel-y and sometimes they would even try to peel after I had just done a gel manicure. The structure gel does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It gives nails some strength in addition to the gel polish. I&#x27;ve found my manicures lasting longer when I use this after my foundation. I&#x27;ve tried using it on top of glitter that I scrubbed in and it helps get rid of the bumpiness with out using 2 or 3 coats of top coat. It also works well under IBD just gel polish.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use this for glitter nails and I&#x27;m so happy with it!</li>
            <li> I always had brittle nails... But not anymore. I&#x27;ve tried different systems in my nails (some of them applied by professionals and some by myself) and the result after removal alwas was an even more fragil and damage nail than it was before. It&#x27;s imposible for me not to wash my hands several times per day due to my profession and the idea of wearing a manicure after the weekend was a dream. I&#x27;ve use this product (with the base and top it of) as a clear base over which I apply regular polish and my nails are more beautiful, stronger and longer than ever. I prefer to use regular polish over gel polish, because I can change the color as frequently as I want without compromising the gel base with the structure gel. When using normal polish remember to cap the nail and use a non-acetone polish remover. A last coment, because the gel is self leveling, I&#x27;ve found better results turning my hand upside down before putting the nails in the lamp, and the nails doesn&#x27;t look flat as result.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I gave it three stars because the packaging for this product is horrible. It leaks EVERYWHERE!!! When I received it in the mail it was leaking in the box, so part of the product was lost in shipment. It leaks in my nail polish kit where I keep all my polishes and nail items, so now I&#x27;m forced to store it separate from my other nail items. The reason I did give it three stars and not a one star though, was because save for the packaging nightmare, the product itself is really good. I like to use it for affixing stones in nail art projects and also for very short, temporary extensions. If gelish could come up with a better packaging situation with this product I would give it five stars. No problem.</li>
            <li> I use this product to coat one of my nails that has an injury causing it to split as it grows off the end of my finger.  Works great!</li>
            <li> This has the same ingredients as the base coat but it seems much thicker to me. I am not sure if I got an old bottle or if it is slightly different composition. You use a brush and kind of spackle it on there. It makes your nails very strong though.</li>
            <li> When I first opened this package, there was sticky residue all over.  Then I noticed that the jar was leaking.  Gross and a hassle.  I decided just to wipe it off and keep it.&lt;br /&gt;Gelish polish seems to severly weaken my nails, so I got this in the hopes that the damage would be minimal.  I can say that the damage isn&#x27;t as severe, but it&#x27;s still there.  After 2 weeks my nails are like...I don&#x27;t have a word for it.  You can peel my nails like a banana or a skin of a cooked bean.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine using the Gelish polish without this, but I wish it did do more to help my nails once the polish is removed.</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky, but works amazing. Once you figure out how to use it, it is simple and really helps the polish to stay on the nails longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too pleased with this structure gel from Gelish. My nails are pretty thin and brittle, but the regular foundation, color, and topcoat combo seems to be plenty to add strength and structure. I really would only recommend this if you feel like your nails are still bumpy or thin with the rest of the products.</li>
            <li> Great, am totally happy with it. I use it to thicken the gel layer where my nails are especially weak. It&#x27;s also great to even out, hold, and protect glitter or 3D bits and bobs on your nail as the consistency is thicker than top coat. Much better than laying on multiple layers of top coat.</li>
            <li> Gelish is the only brand of uv colored gel I use on my nails. It holds up so well, goes on easy, and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my nails with just the starter kit, then I decided to purchase the Structure Gel because it is suppose to make your nails stronger. The 1st time I applied the Structure my nails chipped within one day. Second time I got the same results, I even let my nails dry for 4 minutes to get better results the same thing. I have gone back to just using the basics and get much better results. I normally get 2-3 weeks of beautiful nails before chipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t seen much of a difference from using this product.</li>
            <li> Product work perfect. The first time I used it, went on great. I use tips and they kept splitting and braking. But with the structure gel,it lasted for weeks.  Arrived faster than I planned. Thank you</li>
            <li> I used two layers of this under my gel polish. I was expecting this to be more of a solid, thick layer once cured. Essentially it just acts like an additional layer of gel polish foundation, though my nails do feel stronger. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I wear gel polish a lot and one day I improperly removed my polish because I wanted it off and I didn&#x27;t have the proper tools to remove it so I damaged my nails pretty bad, this stuff totally filled in the pitted spots in my nails and leveled them out and was very easy to apply the consistency was easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I have many Gelish polishes that I have ordered here through Amazon and all have been great. However when I received this I was unable to open it.....and I&#x27;m NO weakling. I tried and tried to open it but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;Having been a professional nail tech for many years, I&#x27;m well acquainted with the fact that things can dry up when they have been opened, used and then not cleaned and sealed properly. Of course no product should be used and then re-sold. I don&#x27;t know if this scenario happened here but it feels as if it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have paid for a totally useless product!</li>
            <li> Received quickly and used for the first time and it works great!  I have a damaged thumb nail that splits continually and the structure helps keep it from spliting further and lasts the whole manicure.</li>
            <li> Just another added layer which helps make your nails harder. i put base coat, then coat of gelish structure, then 2 coats of color and finish with top coat.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCTS LEAVES MY NATURAL NAILS PERFECT AND THICK ENOUGH NOT TO BREAK! LOVE THIS BRAND AND PRODUCT! WILL MOST DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I adore this! much thicker than the nail polish UV gel. Everyone deserve a soak-off Gel in their life!</li>
            <li> Not too helpful for soft nails. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now,it may be prolongs one more day chip free nails, but without it, it is ok also.</li>
            <li> Edit: this is NOT the same exact thing as the Foundation, it is a thicker formulation.   Original review: f you like the look of glitter embedded in gel over the entire nail but with a totally smooth, glassy finish, this is what you need! Note that you want this structure gel if you want a soak off, not a hard gel that needs to be sanded off or kept on and filled.  What I do with a UV lamp (led is faster): 1. Tend to cuticles, buff lightly with fine grit, clean off with alcohol, apply dehydrator to nail. 2. Thin layer of Gelish Foundation, cure 30 secs. 3. Take glitter and press it onto tacky surface using glitter or finger. Slap hands together to remove excess or blow, shake, etc. if you press the nail over and over again with a slight bit of pressure the glitter looks mirrored and totally uniform instead of scattered. 4. Apply another thin layer foundation without dragging too much which will remove glitter. Cure 30 secs. 5. Apply a layer of structure gel. I just paint on a regular polish amount. Even if it appears to be too little, wait it out, it evens itself. Hold your hand palm up for a few seconds so it evens out. 6. Every one or two nails, stick in the UV to flash cure for 5-10 seconds. It will keep gel from moving or pooling. 7. Do all but thumbs, cure nails 2-3 mins and then do thumbs and cure. 8. Apply Gelish Top It Off and cure two minutes. 9. Remove sticky induction layer with lint free wipe and alcohol. Apply cuticle oil.  If the surface isn&#x27;t glassy smooth and even you can apply a bit more structure gel before curing, or cure all and do a second coat of structure. Try mixing glitters it is fun!</li>
            <li> great product. easy to use and really strengthens my weak nails. will definitely be purchasing this item again in the future.</li>
            <li> I really needed this stuff. Gelish wasn&#x27;t staying on my nails because they&#x27;re too thin and would bend. Structure was the perfect remedy! Now I have the same good results everyone&#x27;s raving about.</li>
            <li> I love structure it definitely add some strength to your nails, but have to make sure you put on thin coats don&#x27;t glob it on!</li>
            <li> This gel came off very easily.</li>
            <li> I started using this product one month ago and is great, without it I feel like my nails are nacked. Will make your nails stronger, easy to apply and remove it.</li>
            <li> Love - luv this product. I have weak nails right now because I was a long term nail salon person that was getting my nails done and they always did acrylics and filed down sooo much of it. So I started doing my own Gelish Nails at home and I gotta say that I love their whole product line. So I had to figure out how do I use this with their system; just in case if anyone wants to know here&#x27;s how you do it. First you prep your nails; File the edges, push back the cuticles and gently buff your nail bed to take away the shine with a 180 nail grit file. Next you Cleanse wipe your nail to take away the dust or 90%+ Alcohol, then use the PH Bond, 1 thin layer of the Foundation, uv/led light this, then use this product (Harmony Gelish Structure Gel), uv/led light it, dry brush it and then do another layer or apply your color. The cool thing about this is if you have glitter/color dust then you mix it with this on the 2nd round and viola you got it. After you are done with the 1 or 2 layers, then you finish it with Gelish nail polish color, do your nail designs, uv/led light it, then the top coat... Wheeewww!! I hoped that helped everyone. OOOO &amp; one more tip instead of using a UV Gel nail polish. You can also use regular nail polish, but I recommend a fast dry regular nail polish as you have to wait for the product to completely dry before you use the Top Coat on it.</li>
            <li> My nails held up well with the original Foundation product, but are even better with Structure as my base coat. I highly recommend this product to anyone using Gelish.</li>
