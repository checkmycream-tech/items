            <li>I love Ouidad products.  </li>
            <li>Love these products for years I struggled with semi curly to frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using dual purpose products at they are more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a setting lotion, it doesn&#x27;t flake and is easy to separate curls without being crunchy like some setting lotions leave your hair.  </li>
            <li>So glad a friend put me on to Ouidad-expensive but worth every cent</li>
            <li>It allows you to scrunch or define your curls and gives a light hold.  </li>
            <li>My daughters have very curly hair and they love all of the Ouidad products.</li>
            <li>This dual purpose product offers a nice medium hold to my 2c/3a hair.  </li>
            <li>I find it very overwhelming, but because the product works so well on me, I&#x27;m willing to live with it.  </li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and this line of products</li>
            <li>The smell of this spray alone is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It has great hold without being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>Great hold without feeling stiff.</li>
            <li>has been the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that works best for my tight curls.  </li>
            <li>I use only Ouidad products and love them all.</li>
            <li>Which is exactly what this product did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and I generally have to use tons of hairspray, but with Quidad, I just sprayed the hair I was about to curl, curled it, then ran my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>I have used other products from OUIDAD and found them to be really great for my big hair, so here I am adding to the collection.</li>
            <li>Good holding spray, not too stiff!</li>
            <li>It held up well, considering I live in a hot and humid area and it rained the first day I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like how silky my hair looks after I spray it on my hair.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as</li>
            <li>Many reviewers are spraying this on dry hair!!</li>
            <li>definitely more hold than some other Ouidad curl products.  </li>
            <li>It has a unique scent which isn&#x27;t enough to make me not use or like it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Smells good, holds without leaving hair crunchy, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>When used on wet hair it sets the curls into place and is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It keeps long-lasting curls in my normally curl-resistant hair.</li>
            <li>As a holding or finishing spray, it offers a healthy shine and sheen to the hair without being too heavy or leaving that tacky feel.  </li>
            <li>If you are very sensitive to the scent of witch hazel</li>
            <li>I would recommend for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>but it was unexpected.</li>
            <li>Keeps curls non-frizzy and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it as a setting lotion for natural curls using rake and shake or two-strand twists</li>
            <li>Then when it&#x27;s dry I just run my hands through my hair and all the stiffness disappears and I have soft bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Allows my hair to dry naturally and finger style.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thin, fine and prone to frizz, AND I live in Florida.</li>

            <li> One of the few hairsprays I&#x27;ve used that not only holds a style in place without excessive stickiness/stiffness, but washes out clean.  </li>
            <li> This is to be used on WET hair only and NEVER dry.</li>
            <li> I would use it only as a hairspray and keep using my other curly hair products (different brand) for everything else.  </li>
            <li> Strangely my hair is never sticky afterward.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this Styling Mist and Holding Spray as both a pre-dryer spray and then, after my hair is dry and styled, as the holding mist.  </li>
            <li> Spray on the ends of your curly hair after you have applied gel and before you blow dry.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise, it actually works extremely well!</li>
            <li> Reminds me of a dentist office and actually makes me a little nauseous.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> the other reviewers said it did.</li>
            <li> Used a little prep bowl to pour some product into for use on dry hair whilst rolling.</li>
            <li> I usually spray it on dry hair, but you can spray it on wet hair as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t overly stiff, and it didn&#x27;t flake or dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> It also left me hair hard and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Other hairsprays leave my hair incredibly dry and dull after long-term use.  </li>
            <li> I tend to spray a little bit then scrunch my curls</li>
            <li> Could even dilute with a little water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not huge on hairspray, but sometimes we all need a little something to keep our styles in place.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t felt a need try that as the hold I get from one round of spray is sufficient for my needs.</li>
            <li> Shipping was delayed due to cold weather-</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, just be aware that the scent of this product is terrible.  </li>
            <li> and I was tired of my hair not holding curls.</li>
            <li> NO more bad hair days for me!  </li>
            <li> you will probably hate the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> What can I say...over all one of the worst products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> The smell on this product is terrible!  </li>

            <li> My daughters have very curly hair and they love all of the Ouidad products.</li>
            <li> Good holding spray, not too stiff! Really like how silky my hair looks after I spray it on my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not create \\&quot;crunchy curls\\&quot; like most hairsprays.  I would recommend for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> What can I say...over all one of the worst products I&#x27;ve tried.  Sticky and crisp...not a good look, they should remove this from their product line</li>
            <li> Smells good, holds without leaving hair crunchy, and a little goes a long way. It keeps long-lasting curls in my normally curl-resistant hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this is one of the Ouidad products I use. My curly hair product routine is: PlayCurl spray, PlayCurl foam, then this styling mist. It is not crunchy but definitely keeps my curls in place. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product for what it does...definitely more hold than some other Ouidad curl products.  It has a unique scent which isn&#x27;t enough to make me not use or like it but it was unexpected.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray the best!  Will not use anything else.  It has great hold without being sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> This dual purpose product offers a nice medium hold to my 2c/3a hair.  I&#x27;ve used it as it was designed: both as a setting lotion and as a finishing/holding spray.  As a setting lotion, it doesn&#x27;t flake and is easy to separate curls without being crunchy like some setting lotions leave your hair.  I&#x27;ve only used it as a setting lotion for natural curls using rake and shake or two-strand twists and I haven&#x27;t used it yet when doing a traditional roller set.  As a holding or finishing spray, it offers a healthy shine and sheen to the hair without being too heavy or leaving that tacky feel.  I tend to spray a little bit then scrunch my curls and I&#x27;m done. The bottle says for stronger hold to spray twice but I haven&#x27;t felt a need try that as the hold I get from one round of spray is sufficient for my needs. I really enjoy using dual purpose products at they are more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Alcohol Denat., Water, Ethyl Ester of PVM/MA Copolymer, Alcohol, Aminomethyl Propanol, AMP-Isostearoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Benzophenone-3, Glycerin, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), PEG-12 Dimethicone, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Fragrance, Eugenol, Limonene</li>
            <li> Awesome setting spray, smells soo good and sets curly hair great!  This is a must buy for those who have curly hair and need good hold.</li>
            <li> Best Curly hair products out there!  I tried many products and Quidad is the best.  I also have a Quidad haircut. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Once I started using Ouidad products I would never go back to another brand.  I use this Styling Mist and Holding Spray as both a pre-dryer spray and then, after my hair is dry and styled, as the holding mist.  I do find if I overspray and it gets on the floor then the floor is sticky.  Strangely my hair is never sticky afterward.  Just a beautiful hold.</li>
            <li> I have to say I purchased this styling mist because of all the rave reviews and I was tired of my hair not holding curls. I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as the other reviewers said it did. But to my surprise, it actually works extremely well! My hair is fine and I generally have to use tons of hairspray, but with Quidad, I just sprayed the hair I was about to curl, curled it, then ran my fingers through it. I sprayed Ouidad, again, as hairspray. It held up well, considering I live in a hot and humid area and it rained the first day I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair.  I have fine, frizzy curly hair and this product takes care of the frizz and gives it great shine and hold.  HOWEVER, just be aware that the scent of this product is terrible.  One of the ingredients of the product is witch hazel.  If you are very sensitive to the scent of witch hazel you will probably hate the smell of this product.  I find it very overwhelming, but because the product works so well on me, I&#x27;m willing to live with it.  Also, the smell does dissipate after a while so you won&#x27;t smell it all day.</li>
            <li> I like how this product holds the curl while my hair dries. Then when it&#x27;s dry I just run my hands through my hair and all the stiffness disappears and I have soft bouncy curls. My hair is very thin, fine and prone to frizz, AND I live in Florida. This product works for me.</li>
            <li> Spray on the ends of your curly hair after you have applied gel and before you blow dry. Makes a big difference</li>
            <li> The smell on this product is terrible!  Reminds me of a dentist office and actually makes me a little nauseous.  It also left me hair hard and sticky.  I would use it only as a hairspray and keep using my other curly hair products (different brand) for everything else.  It has nice hold.  The smell alone is enough for me to never buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Styling Mist Setting Spray is awesome for my curly hair!!  This is my second order!  :)  Curly hair rules!!!</li>
            <li> One of the few hairsprays I&#x27;ve used that not only holds a style in place without excessive stickiness/stiffness, but washes out clean.  Other hairsprays leave my hair incredibly dry and dull after long-term use.  I do not experience this with Quidad.</li>
            <li> Keeps curls non-frizzy and soft.  Allows my hair to dry naturally and finger style.  The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use only Ouidad products and love them all. I have never found anything that was as good for my wavy hair. So glad a friend put me on to Ouidad-expensive but worth every cent</li>
            <li> Great hold without feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good. I&#x27;m not huge on hairspray, but sometimes we all need a little something to keep our styles in place. Which is exactly what this product did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t overly stiff, and it didn&#x27;t flake or dry out my hair. Oh, and I actually liked the scent, which was a pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li> Shipping was delayed due to cold weather- but that was understandable.  The product is the best I have ever used!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great styling product.  It allows you to scrunch or define your curls and gives a light hold.  I usually spray it on dry hair, but you can spray it on wet hair as well.  The smell of this spray alone is worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers are spraying this on dry hair!! NO! Have they visited the salon in NYC?This is NOT a hairspray. This is to be used on WET hair only and NEVER dry. When used on wet hair it sets the curls into place and is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love Ouidad products.  I have super curly hair and this line of products has been the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that works best for my tight curls.  NO more bad hair days for me!  I recommend any of the Quidad products.</li>
            <li> Good product set well with velcro rollers. Used a little prep bowl to pour some product into for use on dry hair whilst rolling. Could even dilute with a little water.</li>
            <li> The best styling spray and it is water soluble.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used other products from OUIDAD and found them to be really great for my big hair, so here I am adding to the collection.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t live without it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love these products for years I struggled with semi curly to frizzy hair.  Now with these products from Ouidad, my hair is curly every day.</li>
