    <ol>
            <li>But, The results are beautiful!</li>
            <li>Awesome hair removal-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wildly impressed with the simplicity.</li>
            <li>I loved this tool to remove chin hair!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work all that great.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as wax, but since my skin breaks out from all kinds of waxing, this is a great replacement.</li>
            <li>Works great on the &amp;#34;blonde fuzzies&amp;#34; and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with the results I get from this tool.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase..</li>
            <li>I love this!!</li>
            <li>just relax while watching a favorite program and whisk the hairs away!</li>
            <li>but it kind of works.</li>
            <li>NIce packaging.</li>
            <li>so I have a nice peach fuzz like I did before I started messing with the hair on my face.</li>
            <li>but honestly what do you expect from something designed to pull tons of hair out of your face like a million tweezers?</li>
            <li>I like another one I had better</li>
            <li>But I like being able to do it at home and over a period of time.</li>
            <li>I had a one dollar spring and worked better</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be more convenient and time saving than just plucking and it</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I thought this looked easy to use.</li>
            <li>I cleaned with rubbing alchohol on a cotton swab and make sure u clean ur skin too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll keep working well, since it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li>The price is cheap but the quality is not.</li>
            <li>deep breaths can&#x27;t handle lol.</li>
            <li>but this is so easy and quick saved money...and it pulls the hair from the roots. .....</li>
            <li>It definitely pulls the softer hairs out, but is not too good at the thicker ones.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the cost on those things, so if u think of buying one try this one first because it is affordable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a healthy alternative.</li>
            <li>and although this is a fairly new purchase I can already tell you that I love it.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li>and when I first received it it was a lot more effective at hair removal from my upper lip and the fine hairs on my jawline near my ears.  </li>
            <li>and it turned to be a great little helper.</li>
            <li>Handle came off with first use.</li>
            <li>but through trial and error I found that rolling the spring at an angle on my skin actually worked better for me than the &#x27;bend-into-a-U-shape&#x27; method I&#x27;ve seen used.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the way it says it will.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast delivery as well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been raving about it since I got it pretty much.</li>
            <li>Hurts too much to use</li>
            <li>Really, this thing hurts.</li>
            <li>This thing is really primitive.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very durable, no plastic.</li>
            <li>I use it on my upper lip and it leaves my skin feeling really smooth.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s a much healthier alternative to those as waxes can remove skin and hair removing creams can leave burns and breakouts</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really work very well.</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>I had no trouble using it, i watched a video on youtube and it is shows exactly how to do it.</li>
            <li>For the first time i have no red pimples after epilating ( over the lips) and it gets even the tiny fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of practice to get used to, you do have to go over a few times to get more hairs...</li>
            <li>This thing definitely works once you figure out the right way to do it.</li>
            <li>; above my lips and the first time.. it hurt quite a bit.</li>
            <li>This one is not painful but the other one rips the hair out from the root.</li>
            <li>My pain threshold is more tolerable for use on chin vs. upper lip, but nothing a few pauses/</li>
            <li>Ordered because it was cheap, but use the other one that I ordered at the same time because is actually works.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ever removing my little mustache.  </li>

            <li> This was my first time ever removing my little mustache.  </li>
            <li> still works on the small fine hairs on my upper lip if I go over it a few times but not really anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t get every little hair, but it definitely cuts down on tweezing time.</li>
            <li> A lot of times it just cut off the hairs so they come back harder and darker.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with very clear instructions (at least not that were in English)</li>
            <li> Although this one is cheaper than other similar hair removers, I didn&#x27;t feel like it was of a lower quality.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting rid of hair near the skin, instead it broke the hair close to the skin and left stubble.</li>
            <li> Pain is moderate because it doesnt pluc out entire section but just few at a time.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for this to pull every single hair out like waxing or creams do, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> they can&#x27;t allow a single hair between them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes I&#x27;ll need to alternate using the U shape and going at an angle with a slight L shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting a bit stretched out but still works a few months later.</li>
            <li> No this is more painful than both.</li>
            <li> It can take a few minutes and you&#x27;ll have to go over the hairs over and over, but it definitely works!</li>
            <li> It took some playing around to finally get the hang of it, just look up youtube videos if you&#x27;re having any trouble.</li>
            <li> the pain would bring me to my knees based on other woman&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> every single little blond hair as well</li>
            <li> It does get the hair out but not just your black unsightly hair....</li>
            <li> In less than 3 minutes, I had all the hair removed, and I was on my way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this little thing as a try out</li>
            <li> Maybe a few days after use I started to break out.</li>
            <li> than this.i recommend u buy the ones with the round plastic handles</li>
            <li> It is a bit painful the first time you use it</li>
            <li> When I got it was a little hard to catch all the hair</li>
            <li> I usually thread</li>
            <li> i like the mettalic handles but its hard to remove hairs</li>
            <li> It does hurt a bit, but at least that way</li>
            <li> This spring hair removal has at least removed the long awkward hairs from my face</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t get how anyone could think this hurts, as its gentler than tweezers in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Worse than wax.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the pain is any worse than a waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been too afraid to wax or get the hair removed by threading.  </li>
            <li> Works if you know how to use it , I suggest cleaning it before use because I started breaking out badly</li>
            <li> and SO SO SO painful.</li>
            <li> , it was all metal design and got bad reviews because it WAS painful.</li>
            <li> beauty is painful, sugar.</li>
            <li> Now I have acne scars :(</li>
            <li> and I bet you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hurts too much to use</li>
            <li> Handle came off with first use. Not flexible enough.  I have one that I purchased some 10 years ago that works as these should.</li>
            <li> works well,arrived on time</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work all that great.  Ordered because it was cheap, but use the other one that I ordered at the same time because is actually works.</li>
            <li> Ouch. Really, this thing hurts. Worse than wax. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as wax, but since my skin breaks out from all kinds of waxing, this is a great replacement. It can take a few minutes and you&#x27;ll have to go over the hairs over and over, but it definitely works!</li>
            <li> Although this one is cheaper than other similar hair removers, I didn&#x27;t feel like it was of a lower quality. It didn&#x27;t come with very clear instructions (at least not that were in English) but through trial and error I found that rolling the spring at an angle on my skin actually worked better for me than the &#x27;bend-into-a-U-shape&#x27; method I&#x27;ve seen used.</li>
            <li> I loved this tool to remove chin hair! Maybe a few days after use I started to break out. Now I have acne scars :( I&#x27;ve tried exfoliante face cleansers and I&#x27;m gonna try cleaning the tool with rubbing alcohol. For now i&#x27;ve held off on using this.</li>
            <li> This thing is really primitive. It looks like the end of a door stopper with two rubber ends. It does get the hair out but not just your black unsightly hair....every single little blond hair as well and SO SO SO painful. I would rather wax or pluck.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking the pain would bring me to my knees based on other woman&#x27;s reviews. Granted, everyone&#x27;s tolerance for pain is different, and granted, it DID hurt... but the pain was tolerable.  All the hairs on my upper lip are gone. This was my first time ever removing my little mustache.  I&#x27;ve always been too afraid to wax or get the hair removed by threading.  In less than 3 minutes, I had all the hair removed, and I was on my way.</li>
            <li> I like another one I had better, it was all metal design and got bad reviews because it WAS painful. This one is not painful but the other one rips the hair out from the root. This one seems to snap them off and hair grows back quicker and sharper. I had a hard time getting rid of hair near the skin, instead it broke the hair close to the skin and left stubble.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the way it says it will. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with a low tolerance for pain.. But, The results are beautiful! Definitely removed all the hairs!</li>
            <li> YES IT IS GOING TO HURT A BIT. It is essentially like the EpiLady back in the day or getting waxed. But I like being able to do it at home and over a period of time. Works great on the &amp;#34;blonde fuzzies&amp;#34; and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works!! Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li> If anyone says this is like plucking or waxing they are lying. No this is more painful than both. That being said, it&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t get over. I personally use it for that &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; above my lips and the first time.. it hurt quite a bit. I didn&#x27;t stop using it though... and although this is a fairly new purchase I can already tell you that I love it. I&#x27;ve been raving about it since I got it pretty much. The lasting time could vary I suppose, but for me it&#x27;s been two weeks and that hair has not popped up yet. The price is cheap but the quality is not. Buy it and I bet you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair removal- just relax while watching a favorite program and whisk the hairs away!</li>
            <li> I thought this looked easy to use. When I got it was a little hard to catch all the hair but it kind of works. Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this instead of the cheaper ones because i like how it looks i like the mettalic handles but its hard to remove hairs i tried it a bunch of different  ways and doesnt pull any hairs. I had a one dollar spring and worked better than this.i recommend u buy the ones with the round plastic handles and they&#x27;re  a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 months and when I first received it it was a lot more effective at hair removal from my upper lip and the fine hairs on my jawline near my ears.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair and I thought it would be more convenient and time saving than just plucking and it was.&lt;br /&gt;It still works on the small fine hairs on my upper lip if I go over it a few times but not really anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. NIce packaging. Does it work? OH yes. Does it hurt? Oh yes. But it is a lot easier and faster than tweezing. Very durable, no plastic. I highly recomend.</li>
            <li> This thing definitely works once you figure out the right way to do it. It does hurt a bit, but at least that way you know it&#x27;s getting the hair!</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with the results I get from this tool.  It is a bit painful the first time you use it but you get use to it. I don&#x27;t think the pain is any worse than a waxing. I use it on my upper lip and it leaves my skin feeling really smooth. No, the hair does not grow back any thicker than it was prior. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for this to pull every single hair out like waxing or creams do, but it doesn&#x27;t. That being said, it&#x27;s a much healthier alternative to those as waxes can remove skin and hair removing creams can leave burns and breakouts like they have with me. This spring hair removal has at least removed the long awkward hairs from my face so I have a nice peach fuzz like I did before I started messing with the hair on my face. It does take a bit of practice to get used to, you do have to go over a few times to get more hairs... and yes it hurts but honestly what do you expect from something designed to pull tons of hair out of your face like a million tweezers? The people that complain that it hurts are being whinny... beauty is painful, sugar. Suck it up or get out. I highly recommend this as a healthy alternative.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.. It took some playing around to finally get the hang of it, just look up youtube videos if you&#x27;re having any trouble. I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes I&#x27;ll need to alternate using the U shape and going at an angle with a slight L shape. Just play around, it does work. I seriously don&#x27;t get how anyone could think this hurts, as its gentler than tweezers in my opinion. Perhaps if you have course hair, it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast delivery as well! Bought this on another account.</li>
            <li> I purchased this little thing as a try out and it turned to be a great little helper. I had no trouble using it, i watched a video on youtube and it is shows exactly how to do it. Itbgets the hairs out from the root. I have epilator, ekevtric one, and i always had pimples after epilating. A lot of times it just cut off the hairs so they come back harder and darker. Not to mention the cost on those things, so if u think of buying one try this one first because it is affordable and easy to use. I cleaned with rubbing alchohol on a cotton swab and make sure u clean ur skin too. For the first time i have no red pimples after epilating ( over the lips) and it gets even the tiny fine hairs. What else can you want!?!?!   Pain is moderate because it doesnt pluc out entire section but just few at a time.</li>
            <li> It works okay.  It definitely pulls the softer hairs out, but is not too good at the thicker ones.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really work very well. It removes some of the hair but misses a lot and you have to keep going back over the same patch. It takes forever and you never manage to get it all in the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the REM brand spring before, but wasn&#x27;t fond of the price, so I tried this one.  It&#x27;s terrible.  Even when you place it in the proper &amp;#34;u&amp;#34; position, the spring coils are so close together they can&#x27;t allow a single hair between them.  That means that there is no hair removal.  I&#x27;m returning this and going back to the REM brand.</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic! I&#x27;m wildly impressed with the simplicity.</li>
            <li> I love this!! It certainly doesn&#x27;t get every little hair, but it definitely cuts down on tweezing time. My pain threshold is more tolerable for use on chin vs. upper lip, but nothing a few pauses/deep breaths can&#x27;t handle lol.</li>
            <li> At last I finally got my in thr mail and it really works I usually thread but this is so easy and quick saved money...and it pulls the hair from the roots. .....</li>
            <li> Does the job. It&#x27;s getting a bit stretched out but still works a few months later. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll keep working well, since it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works if you know how to use it , I suggest cleaning it before use because I started breaking out badly and I&#x27;m not prone to acne at all</li>
