            <li>I just tried it and loved it..</li>
            <li>good stuff</li>
            <li>Lavender oil is good for so many things but spraying some on my pillow at night is a great way to fall</li>
            <li>Sun Organic has the best price I could find and the oil arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The oils are the second best part, quality, affordable and they have some of the best blends I have tried.</li>
            <li>PURE BS is what that is!!!!!  </li>

            <li>With that being said the opinion given is solely my own.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked to have gotten a glass dropper either attached or separate</li>
            <li>I received this oil and 3 others in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>, however, it has some kind of carrier oil in it, the sauna steam does not lie.</li>
            <li>This one is good quality and not too strong in scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong</li>

            <li>The size of this means that I won&#x27;t have to worry about restocking too soon, and the scent means that I am more relaxed {a known Lavender oil benefit}.</li>

            <li>Great customer service as well; I highly reccommend!</li>
            <li>Bottle top broke in my hands</li>
            <li>: I received this free product to perform product testing with the intent of providing an honest and educated review.</li>
            <li>I love the calming and relaxing properties of lavender.</li>
            <li>But, at this great price I can&#x27;t complain too much :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review.</li>

            <li>LOVE this oil</li>
            <li>i would for sure recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li>I love lavender oil.</li>
            <li>Most of those companies can&#x27;t even guarantee you an organic oil, I love that this is organic.</li>
            <li>Will be looking into more of the oils this company has to offer.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve ordered from several competitors and this is the BEST product</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the price for the amount.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to find more uses for this.</li>
            <li>I use it in my humidifier at night to sleep and it truly helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li>I received this product free to try and review, my opinion is completely my own.  </li>
            <li>I love the quality of this product and will purchase again soon.</li>
            <li>I love anything with the name sunorganics.  </li>
            <li>Super super happy with both the timing of this Lavender oil, its size, and its scent.</li>
            <li>This one in particular is great for mixing in lotions or to diffuse.</li>
            <li>a sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The pice was pretty good also.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils and sun Organic is a great brand to buy.</li>
            <li>The Lavender is strong, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>It is cut with some kind of oil, even though it says 100% pure EO.</li>
            <li>It comes in a huge amber bottle to protect the quality.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Great essential oil!</li>
            <li>I was happy to order this lavender oil from Sun Essential OIls to try out.  </li>
            <li>got this oil for free to review</li>
            <li>I will be using this oil primarily in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Great lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>Great article about essential oils:  http://essentialoilblogging.com/2014/01/14/can-essential-oils-be-ingested/</li>
            <li>Received this to try for free.</li>
            <li>There was a reason it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Excellent Product, reasonable price and on PRIME!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product as your &#x27;go-to&#x27; lavender essence to add to  your Epsom salts for your bath, for your coconut oil to slather on your body (especially after bath, before bedtime).</li>
            <li>No where near as good of quality as what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Smells great&amp; is cheaper than most other brands</li>
            <li>Hopefully they will take in consideration to try to make this one more time since they have lots of other ones that they smell great.</li>
            <li>I DO LOVE HOT LAVENDER OIL WORKS</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pay more, get the real deal!</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent, love a few drops in the bath!</li>
            <li>I really believe that it helps me to relax and sleep better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like lavender that much, but the French Lavender smells great!  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing aroma like it better than some others I have</li>
            <li>Just a few drops in the diffuser and the whole rooms smells great and it has a nice calming effect.</li>
            <li>can help stop a persistent headache)&lt;br /&gt;Burns and sunburn:  Lavender oil can be used to cool, relieve and help heal burns and sunburn.</li>
            <li>This Sun Essential product has a nice lavender scent, but is not as strong as others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very high quality essential oil, and a great value for a bottle of this size.</li>
            <li>Lavender is a classic and has so many uses.</li>
            <li>the clear top that lets you dispense the oil drop by drop doesn&#x27;t fit the bottle and didn&#x27;t have a hole punched in it anyway.  </li>
            <li>it dissipated fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Just as I had hoped...lovely and quickly shipped</li>
            <li>but it does take more than normal.</li>
            <li>Have been using it in my various combinations and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Great quality essential oils without the high prices of oils sold by the 1/4 or 1/2 ounce.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Nice, but don&#x27;t try to use it for the same applications as you would lavender.</li>
            <li>That said, this wasn&#x27;t even worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>This is a great value for such a large amount of high quality EO.</li>
            <li>It is a good oil for the price, but it seems to lose its smell faster than other oils I have used.</li>
            <li>Had Lavender on my shopping list when I rec&#x27;d an offer for THIS company&#x27;s product---fortuitous right?</li>
            <li>It comes in a very large glass 4 ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li>love lavender oil and confess I only opened the bottle and sniffed it quickly before I wrote the first review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lavender is my absolute favorite scent and I am so excited to finally have it!</li>
            <li>of now, its only fit to clean etching ink off my printing plates...</li>
            <li>There is no indication that it has been tested or verified for purity, such as by gas chromatography or mass spectroscopy, as is the case with better products.</li>
            <li>They just sit on the top like a gross, slimy film!!!  </li>
            <li>I personally love the smell of French lavender tho.</li>
            <li>Absolutely swoon-worthy!</li>
            <li>What you&#x27;re getting is most likely lavandin oil, judging by the smell.</li>
            <li>Lavandin has a higher level of camphor terpenes than lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satified!</li>
            <li>Lavender Essential Oils ranks as one of my favorite essential oils because of its many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Essentials is so confident with the quality of their essential oils that they offer a 100% guarantee.</li>
            <li>MORE THAN THE FRENCH LAVENDER</li>
            <li>Lavender essential oil is one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I only wish thw bottle had a drop top.</li>
            <li>First time trying this brand</li>
            <li>LOVE all my Essential Oils...</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a few drops onto your pillow to help a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>** use them to treat any physical or emotional ailment that my family members and I might have, but they are good quality EO&#x27;s for home cleaning use.  </li>
            <li>French lavender has a very sweet smell.</li>
            <li>The items shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li>I also received a dropper which helps you use exactly how much you need without wasting it.  </li>
            <li>but I would have preferred if they included a glass dropper built right into the lid of the bottle (like many other companies include).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obviously super diluted with some old mystery oil that they don&#x27;t even tell you about on the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a large 4 fl.</li>
            <li>It came to me in a large, brown, glass bottle along with a plastic dropper.</li>
            <li>In hindsight I got a chuckle out of the &amp;quot; 100% pure&amp;quot; words in the product description, it isn&#x27;t about the oil, it is a 100% pure unconditional manufacturer refund.</li>
            <li>I rated this oil as a 4 because it is not 100% pure oil and The brand</li>
            <li>The essential oil is fine..</li>
            <li>Nice little dropper to control use.</li>
            <li>This helped them get through July 4th a little more calmly.</li>
            <li>Essentials French Lavender Oil comes in a huge 4oz bottle with a plastic pipette.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Better than expected</li>
            <li>I transfer these over to bottles with droppers, so I can measure it more carefully.</li>
            <li>It has a very calming,relaxing effect on me.</li>
            <li>really like using lavender oil to help with relaxation, either during stressful times or when I’m trying to go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>but I think I may have used too much in the cleaner I scented with it.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t appreciate the scent as much as I do, but it seemed to have a calming effect on him.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really oil.</li>
            <li>oil is also anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and Headaches (gently massaged onto the temples</li>
            <li>/&gt;Relaxation: A few drops in a hot bath, or mixed with carrier oil for a massage, can ease away the day&#x27;s stress and aid a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many other uses that can be researched on internet.  </li>
            <li>But as far s this one goes it&#x27;s smells strong and like French lavender, to which is soothing.</li>
            <li>When I first stumbled upon Sun organic, I was a little taken back by how great the price was for the 4 ounce bottle of French lavender.</li>
            <li>If you are less than satisfied you can request a refund, anytime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will never buy lavender from any of the big-name companies I typically buy most of my oils from ever again.</li>
            <li>French Lavender is my favorite of all time from all the Essential Oils that they have out in the market.</li>
            <li>I recently went thru my orders to reorder some more and when I received this last bottle</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A few months back I purchased the same French lavender oil from the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; company, awesome no complaints.</li>
            <li>The smell to me is a little more fresh than regular lavender oils.  </li>
            <li>I live in an older house and have closets which tend to smell musty, so I always have cedarwood in stock.</li>
            <li>I have been using EO for 20 years,  thought I would try a new brand, it smelled good not great.</li>
            <li>Sun Essential Oil French Lavender is not as strong as others that I try before.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be a more dryer, blends right in, like other brands of oils I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>i find new uses for it every day.</li>
            <li>however I can live without it.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>love Sun Essentials French Lavender Essential Oil, and use it in my bedroom diffuser on a regular basis in the evening to promote relaxation and help me fall asleep.</li>
            <li>This particular lavender oil only requires me to use one drop as it is very fragrant.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I like this particular product.</li>
            <li>When it comes to using the oils, I&#x27;ve found that using the oil really helps calm me down.</li>
            <li>But soon after I heated it in my burner (tea candle heat source in glass bowl), I noticed that the lavender scent quickly dissipated, leaving an oil that (a) smelled reminiscent of cooking oil, and (b) didn&#x27;t burn off in the bowl, even after several hours of burning.</li>
            <li>Every single one of these &amp;#34;pure essential oils&amp;#34; is FILLED with a carrier oil -</li>
            <li>Essential oils are volatile, and evaporate quickly and nearly completely when heated or left out in the air.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for pure essential oils then look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It is not 100% pure Lavender Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li>I knew just based on the price that it wasnt pure essential oil as it claims to be.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this oil is tremendous.</li>
            <li>I have used the lavender on the back of my dog&#x27;s collar to help calm his anxiety and for diffusing in our home to calm down my hyper boys!</li>
            <li>My diffuser was old and quit working on me</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend Sun Essentials French Lavender Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is my least favorite although I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li>My only problem with it is it seems to have too much of a greasy consistency that does not rub in.</li>
            <li>, just make sure you follow some sort of guide when using this, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Powerful aroma, long lasting fragrance</li>
            <li>This French Lavender smells a little to strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>It worked wonders to calm him down and he slept like the old saying &amp;#34;a baby&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m wondering whether this is actually fully pure essential oil or diluted with a carrier.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even looking for a pure essential oil for internal use.</li>
            <li>I’ve become a big fan of essential oils over the last few months since I’ve started building up my own personal collection.  </li>
            <li>While this is a lovely product, I would say that it does not smell as strongly, or last as long, as other lavender essential oils I have used.</li>
            <li>; there are no other indications that this item is organic.  </li>
            <li>This product barely smells like anything!</li>
            <li>I received no other compensation, and all opinions are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to all these essential oils, so I haven&#x27;t tryed any other brands, other then the cheap ones you buy at WalMart etc.</li>
            <li>The large glass bottle will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li>I primarily use this for aromatherapy by itself or as a secondary oil in blends.</li>
            <li>and OMG it helped to open up and clear my sinuses..</li>
            <li>This barely has any lavender smell to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good aromatherapy idea for people with lung issues (flu, cold, congestion, etc), but DO NOT try to use this oil to soothe burns.</li>
            <li>I suppose this oil is not pure and much diluted.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t tryed any of my new essential oils in one yet, also I&#x27;m just now finding out that they have a million uses, so as soon as I try all the different ways, I will update this review and give an opinion on the ways I tryed them and how they worked.</li>
            <li>It seemed like lavender oil in a carrier oil and was not a high quality, pure essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I have some other lavender oil that seems so much stronger than this.</li>
            <li>If it was cheaper I would have suspected it but at this price no excuse.</li>
            <li>French lavender oil has a very distinctive smell, and this, my friends, is no pure French Lavender oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve burned NOW Foods lavender oil for a few years, and the strong lavender scent remains until the oil has completely burned off, usually within an hour, leaving an amber residue in the bowl.</li>
            <li>its lavender, but it smells a little off, and it gets really sticky.  </li>

            <li> For the price it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I just tried it and loved it..</li>
            <li> good stuff</li>
            <li> Lavender oil is good for so many things but spraying some on my pillow at night is a great way to fall</li>
            <li> Sun Organic has the best price I could find and the oil arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The oils are the second best part, quality, affordable and they have some of the best blends I have tried.</li>
            <li> PURE BS is what that is!!!!!  </li>

            <li> With that being said the opinion given is solely my own.  </li>

            <li> I received this oil and 3 others in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>

            <li> i would for sure recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> I love lavender oil.</li>
            <li> Most of those companies can&#x27;t even guarantee you an organic oil, I love that this is organic.</li>
            <li> Will be looking into more of the oils this company has to offer.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve ordered from several competitors and this is the BEST product</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>

            <li> I love the quality of this product and will purchase again soon.</li>
            <li> I love anything with the name sunorganics.  </li>
            <li> Super super happy with both the timing of this Lavender oil, its size, and its scent.</li>
            <li> This one in particular is great for mixing in lotions or to diffuse.</li>
            <li> a sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The pice was pretty good also.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and sun Organic is a great brand to buy.</li>
            <li> The Lavender is strong, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> It is cut with some kind of oil, even though it says 100% pure EO.</li>
            <li> It comes in a huge amber bottle to protect the quality.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Great essential oil!</li>
            <li> I was happy to order this lavender oil from Sun Essential OIls to try out.  </li>
            <li> got this oil for free to review</li>
            <li> I will be using this oil primarily in my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Great lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> Great article about essential oils:  http://essentialoilblogging.com/2014/01/14/can-essential-oils-be-ingested/</li>
            <li> Received this to try for free.</li>
            <li> There was a reason it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, reasonable price and on PRIME!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product as your &#x27;go-to&#x27; lavender essence to add to  your Epsom salts for your bath, for your coconut oil to slather on your body (especially after bath, before bedtime).</li>
            <li> No where near as good of quality as what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Smells great&amp; is cheaper than most other brands</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will take in consideration to try to make this one more time since they have lots of other ones that they smell great.</li>
            <li> I DO LOVE HOT LAVENDER OIL WORKS</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pay more, get the real deal!</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, love a few drops in the bath!</li>
            <li> I really believe that it helps me to relax and sleep better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like lavender that much, but the French Lavender smells great!  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing aroma like it better than some others I have</li>
            <li> Just a few drops in the diffuser and the whole rooms smells great and it has a nice calming effect.</li>
            <li> can help stop a persistent headache)&lt;br /&gt;Burns and sunburn:  Lavender oil can be used to cool, relieve and help heal burns and sunburn.</li>
            <li> This Sun Essential product has a nice lavender scent, but is not as strong as others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a very high quality essential oil, and a great value for a bottle of this size.</li>
            <li> Lavender is a classic and has so many uses.</li>
            <li> the clear top that lets you dispense the oil drop by drop doesn&#x27;t fit the bottle and didn&#x27;t have a hole punched in it anyway.  </li>
            <li> it dissipated fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Just as I had hoped...lovely and quickly shipped</li>
            <li> but it does take more than normal.</li>
            <li> Have been using it in my various combinations and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Great quality essential oils without the high prices of oils sold by the 1/4 or 1/2 ounce.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Nice, but don&#x27;t try to use it for the same applications as you would lavender.</li>
            <li> That said, this wasn&#x27;t even worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for such a large amount of high quality EO.</li>
            <li> It is a good oil for the price, but it seems to lose its smell faster than other oils I have used.</li>
            <li> Had Lavender on my shopping list when I rec&#x27;d an offer for THIS company&#x27;s product---fortuitous right?</li>
            <li> It comes in a very large glass 4 ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li> love lavender oil and confess I only opened the bottle and sniffed it quickly before I wrote the first review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lavender is my absolute favorite scent and I am so excited to finally have it!</li>
            <li> of now, its only fit to clean etching ink off my printing plates...</li>
            <li> There is no indication that it has been tested or verified for purity, such as by gas chromatography or mass spectroscopy, as is the case with better products.</li>
            <li> They just sit on the top like a gross, slimy film!!!  </li>
            <li> I personally love the smell of French lavender tho.</li>
            <li> Absolutely swoon-worthy!</li>
            <li> What you&#x27;re getting is most likely lavandin oil, judging by the smell.</li>
            <li> Lavandin has a higher level of camphor terpenes than lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satified!</li>
            <li> Lavender Essential Oils ranks as one of my favorite essential oils because of its many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Essentials is so confident with the quality of their essential oils that they offer a 100% guarantee.</li>
            <li> MORE THAN THE FRENCH LAVENDER</li>
            <li> Lavender essential oil is one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li> I only wish thw bottle had a drop top.</li>
            <li> First time trying this brand</li>
            <li> LOVE all my Essential Oils...</li>
            <li> Sprinkle a few drops onto your pillow to help a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ** use them to treat any physical or emotional ailment that my family members and I might have, but they are good quality EO&#x27;s for home cleaning use.  </li>
            <li> French lavender has a very sweet smell.</li>
            <li> The items shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li> I also received a dropper which helps you use exactly how much you need without wasting it.  </li>
            <li> but I would have preferred if they included a glass dropper built right into the lid of the bottle (like many other companies include).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously super diluted with some old mystery oil that they don&#x27;t even tell you about on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a large 4 fl.</li>
            <li> It came to me in a large, brown, glass bottle along with a plastic dropper.</li>
            <li> In hindsight I got a chuckle out of the &amp;quot; 100% pure&amp;quot; words in the product description, it isn&#x27;t about the oil, it is a 100% pure unconditional manufacturer refund.</li>
            <li> I rated this oil as a 4 because it is not 100% pure oil and The brand</li>
            <li> The essential oil is fine..</li>
            <li> Nice little dropper to control use.</li>
            <li> This helped them get through July 4th a little more calmly.</li>
            <li> Essentials French Lavender Oil comes in a huge 4oz bottle with a plastic pipette.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Better than expected</li>
            <li> I transfer these over to bottles with droppers, so I can measure it more carefully.</li>
            <li> It has a very calming,relaxing effect on me.</li>
            <li> really like using lavender oil to help with relaxation, either during stressful times or when I’m trying to go to sleep.  </li>
            <li> but I think I may have used too much in the cleaner I scented with it.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t appreciate the scent as much as I do, but it seemed to have a calming effect on him.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really oil.</li>
            <li> oil is also anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and Headaches (gently massaged onto the temples</li>
            <li> /&gt;Relaxation: A few drops in a hot bath, or mixed with carrier oil for a massage, can ease away the day&#x27;s stress and aid a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many other uses that can be researched on internet.  </li>
            <li> But as far s this one goes it&#x27;s smells strong and like French lavender, to which is soothing.</li>
            <li> When I first stumbled upon Sun organic, I was a little taken back by how great the price was for the 4 ounce bottle of French lavender.</li>
            <li> If you are less than satisfied you can request a refund, anytime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never buy lavender from any of the big-name companies I typically buy most of my oils from ever again.</li>
            <li> French Lavender is my favorite of all time from all the Essential Oils that they have out in the market.</li>
            <li> I recently went thru my orders to reorder some more and when I received this last bottle</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A few months back I purchased the same French lavender oil from the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; company, awesome no complaints.</li>
            <li> The smell to me is a little more fresh than regular lavender oils.  </li>
            <li> I live in an older house and have closets which tend to smell musty, so I always have cedarwood in stock.</li>
            <li> I have been using EO for 20 years,  thought I would try a new brand, it smelled good not great.</li>
            <li> Sun Essential Oil French Lavender is not as strong as others that I try before.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a more dryer, blends right in, like other brands of oils I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> i find new uses for it every day.</li>
            <li> however I can live without it.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> love Sun Essentials French Lavender Essential Oil, and use it in my bedroom diffuser on a regular basis in the evening to promote relaxation and help me fall asleep.</li>
            <li> This particular lavender oil only requires me to use one drop as it is very fragrant.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I like this particular product.</li>
            <li> When it comes to using the oils, I&#x27;ve found that using the oil really helps calm me down.</li>
            <li> But soon after I heated it in my burner (tea candle heat source in glass bowl), I noticed that the lavender scent quickly dissipated, leaving an oil that (a) smelled reminiscent of cooking oil, and (b) didn&#x27;t burn off in the bowl, even after several hours of burning.</li>
            <li> Every single one of these &amp;#34;pure essential oils&amp;#34; is FILLED with a carrier oil -</li>
            <li> Essential oils are volatile, and evaporate quickly and nearly completely when heated or left out in the air.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for pure essential oils then look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It is not 100% pure Lavender Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li> I knew just based on the price that it wasnt pure essential oil as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this oil is tremendous.</li>
            <li> I have used the lavender on the back of my dog&#x27;s collar to help calm his anxiety and for diffusing in our home to calm down my hyper boys!</li>
            <li> My diffuser was old and quit working on me</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend Sun Essentials French Lavender Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is my least favorite although I do like it a lot.</li>
            <li> My only problem with it is it seems to have too much of a greasy consistency that does not rub in.</li>
            <li> , just make sure you follow some sort of guide when using this, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Powerful aroma, long lasting fragrance</li>
            <li> This French Lavender smells a little to strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders to calm him down and he slept like the old saying &amp;#34;a baby&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wondering whether this is actually fully pure essential oil or diluted with a carrier.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even looking for a pure essential oil for internal use.</li>
            <li> I’ve become a big fan of essential oils over the last few months since I’ve started building up my own personal collection.  </li>
            <li> While this is a lovely product, I would say that it does not smell as strongly, or last as long, as other lavender essential oils I have used.</li>
            <li> ; there are no other indications that this item is organic.  </li>
            <li> This product barely smells like anything!</li>
            <li> I received no other compensation, and all opinions are my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to all these essential oils, so I haven&#x27;t tryed any other brands, other then the cheap ones you buy at WalMart etc.</li>
            <li> The large glass bottle will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use this for aromatherapy by itself or as a secondary oil in blends.</li>
            <li> and OMG it helped to open up and clear my sinuses..</li>
            <li> This barely has any lavender smell to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good aromatherapy idea for people with lung issues (flu, cold, congestion, etc), but DO NOT try to use this oil to soothe burns.</li>
            <li> I suppose this oil is not pure and much diluted.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t tryed any of my new essential oils in one yet, also I&#x27;m just now finding out that they have a million uses, so as soon as I try all the different ways, I will update this review and give an opinion on the ways I tryed them and how they worked.</li>
            <li> It seemed like lavender oil in a carrier oil and was not a high quality, pure essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I have some other lavender oil that seems so much stronger than this.</li>
            <li> If it was cheaper I would have suspected it but at this price no excuse.</li>
            <li> French lavender oil has a very distinctive smell, and this, my friends, is no pure French Lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burned NOW Foods lavender oil for a few years, and the strong lavender scent remains until the oil has completely burned off, usually within an hour, leaving an amber residue in the bowl.</li>
            <li> its lavender, but it smells a little off, and it gets really sticky.  </li>
            <li> It can be used for such things as: Cuts, grazes and scars; lavender oil can be used on minor cuts and grazes, simply by dabbing a few drops straight onto the affected area.&lt;br /&gt;Spots and skin irritations</li>
            <li> when I used it in the bath later that week, rather than scent filling my bathroom with fragrance, it gave off a weak scent that quickly dissipated.</li>
            <li> There is barely any scent to this item and I am comparing it to other well known inexpensive brands.  </li>
            <li> They include a plastic pipette, but I do really wish there was a glass dropper built into the bottle lid (like other brands I’ve had), since these plastic ones get gummed up over time and can get messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used essential lavender oil for over 20 years and with out a doubt this has been mixed with some other type of oil.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time in my oil diffuser alone and mixed with other essential oils.  </li>
            <li> The rather faint scent of sandalwood quickly dissipates, leaving the same cooking-oil-smelling oil that doesn&#x27;t burn off, even when it stays on the burner for an entire tea candle to burn out.</li>
            <li> I purchased more than a dozen oils from this company, and all of them were similarly disappointing.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money, and</li>
            <li> I have used it on my young son&#x27;s pillow at night before he goes to bed (a few drops on the outer corners).</li>
            <li> So far I have used it in the difuser a few times and on my wool dryer balls.</li>
            <li> Like vegetable oil you&#x27;ve had hanging around in a plastic bottle for too long.</li>
            <li> Not pure essential oil.  </li>
            <li> and it is NOT pure essential lavender .</li>
            <li> compared to the price of essential oils sold other places.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mixed with some type of other carrier oil.</li>
            <li> It had definitely been cut with some other type of oil.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of the french lavender essential oil into my lotion every morning after I shower.</li>
            <li> Lavandin is a hybrid of English and French lavenders, and is distinctive from lavender oil by the heavy camphor/menthol smell.</li>
            <li> It does smell  like French Lavender but the smells last just a few .</li>
            <li> This product smells like the average public restroom.</li>
            <li> As stated previously, I received this as a freebie which simply means that I appreciate both the offer AND the company for this opportunity.}</li>
            <li> ; yes, maybe Sun Organic does put 100% lavender oil in the bottle, but not much of it.</li>
            <li> lavender oil as expected.</li>
            <li> This oil smells just as expected.  </li>
            <li> Putting a few drops on my neck does the trick and the oil doesn&#x27;t make me feel gross afterwards.</li>
            <li> Left a thick gross film and ruined two of our diffusers.  </li>
            <li> I did a blot test on paper and this product is not a pure essential,oil.  </li>
            <li> Takes a large bottle to do what the now oils do in just a few drops and then still not good fragrance or therapeutic quality.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> Get this and refill your other bottle and those of your friends too.</li>
            <li> I should have known better :(</li>
            <li> It smelled very weak, I put a drop on a white plain paper, 5 hours later it left an oil stain.</li>
            <li> Weirdly, I have terriers who are very responsive to aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not very strong smell</li>
            <li> When my tub drained,  a thick residue was left behind, something I had not experienced in all my years of using lavender essential oil in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using this again for personal use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can add a few drops to your bath for a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> , this oil smells like lavender with a heavy note of camphor.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer notes, this just turns to a gluey carrier oil with no smell when warmed or left out.</li>
            <li> Instead of replacing the pricey pouches, we bought 100% lavender oil and put a few drops on the pouches about once a month.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few drops applied to the affected area can do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I have made a few batched of lavendar shea butter with this, I have used it for my face with a coconut oil as the carrier.</li>
            <li> I also like to add a few drops to my laundry during the rinse cycle, place a few drops in my clothing drawers, and drop a few drops on my pillow at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was disappointing as i do use lavender oil in my vacuum cleaner daily and like to dispense drop by drop.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down the WORST essential oils I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.  </li>
            <li> Very little scent.</li>
            <li> It is mixed with a thicker oil that smells like used cooking oil and with a faint scent of lavender.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how can they claim that this oil is \\&quot;PURE\\&quot; \\&quot;FRENCH\\&quot; Lavender and its fragrance lasts no more than 2 minutes...  </li>
            <li> No more Sun \\&quot;Organic\\</li>
            <li> and this seems to help when she applies a small amount with a swab.</li>
            <li> The oil beaded up on the surface of the water, rather than dispersing in small oil drops.</li>
            <li> It relaxes me when I&#x27;m really tense.</li>
            <li> so I wanted somethjng less expensive.</li>
            <li> Moreover, this oil has been diluted with undisclosed filler oils and it has a weak fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is weak.</li>
            <li> Weak solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson - for homemade cleaning and laundry items where you need bulk essential oils but DON&#x27;T WANT CRAP, buy the NOW Foods brand.  </li>
            <li> Lid came broken as well, so quite a bit leaked out.</li>
            <li> It is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> Item arrived with a broken cap and therefore leaking.</li>
            <li> Very weak.</li>
            <li> very weak smell one</li>
            <li> however the packaging is lousy..</li>
            <li> My wife likes this as much as expensive brands that are sold by MLM (pyramid) sales organizations.  </li>
            <li> I only purchased these oils to use in my DIY homemade laundry soap and on my wool dryer balls, but these are so awful</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry to say this is one I am returning.</li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to dispense the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> I am troubled that the website for Sun Organics has a section  &amp;quot;about us&amp;quot; - it just gives you a map of Scottsdale.</li>
            <li> very poor quality lavander.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> But it would be impossible for me to prove it...  </li>
            <li> All I can smell is that &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; that has gone bad or spoiled type smell.</li>
            <li> so maybe it was a bad batch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My conclusion is that the lavender is cut with a base, maybe rapeseed oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bet money that the bulk (80%?) of the oil in both products is a cheaper base oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this oil.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> horrible.</li>
            <li> These are AWFUL!!!</li>
            <li> Disgusting.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There is no disclosure of what parts of the plant have been used or the source of the plants from which the essential oil has been derived. There is no indication that it has been tested or verified for purity, such as by gas chromatography or mass spectroscopy, as is the case with better products. Moreover, this oil has been diluted with undisclosed filler oils and it has a weak fragrance. If you&#x27;re looking for pure essential oils then look elsewhere. I purchased more than a dozen oils from this company, and all of them were similarly disappointing.</li>
            <li> This item is listed as an &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; French Lavender Essential Oil.  Other then the company name &amp;#34;Sun Organic&amp;#34; there are no other indications that this item is organic.  There is barely any scent to this item and I am comparing it to other well known inexpensive brands.  I made a batch of hand balms that had to be remade because there was no indication of any lavender scent and I put in twice the recommended amount of lavender essential oil in it.</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect for adding a nice fragrance to our home made soaps.</li>
            <li> Very good, I am experimenting with aroma therapy, it seems to be working well</li>
            <li> Wonderful lavender quality and smell.</li>
            <li> Very good product; I will buy it again.  Thesoapmaker.net</li>
            <li> Amazing product, fast shipping.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This product looks fancy and hype but it&#x27;s not as concentrated as the Lavender essential oil I accustomed to. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I just opened the bottle today, and, yes, I did smell lavender. But soon after I heated it in my burner (tea candle heat source in glass bowl), I noticed that the lavender scent quickly dissipated, leaving an oil that (a) smelled reminiscent of cooking oil, and (b) didn&#x27;t burn off in the bowl, even after several hours of burning. My conclusion is that the lavender is cut with a base, maybe rapeseed oil. I&#x27;ve burned NOW Foods lavender oil for a few years, and the strong lavender scent remains until the oil has completely burned off, usually within an hour, leaving an amber residue in the bowl. But this product is distinctly different. I feel as if some deceptive or deliberately misleading wording is involved here; yes, maybe Sun Organic does put 100% lavender oil in the bottle, but not much of it. If I could return it, I would. I&#x27;m very dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this oil, I also bought from Sun Organic Australian Sandalwood, and guess what? The same thing happens! The rather faint scent of sandalwood quickly dissipates, leaving the same cooking-oil-smelling oil that doesn&#x27;t burn off, even when it stays on the burner for an entire tea candle to burn out. I won&#x27;t buy their products again. Fool me once . . . . btw, I would give the sandalwood the same 1-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve burned enough different oils over a period of years to know how they burn, how they smell as they burn, and the residue each leaves in the bowl.  I&#x27;d bet money that the bulk (80%?) of the oil in both products is a cheaper base oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received does not give the same information as the one shown. Sure the price is good but if the product isn&#x27;t what you want then...The information is so vague on the label I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s not been cut with a carrier oil. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Lavender oil is good for so many things but spraying some on my pillow at night is a great way to fall a sleep.&lt;br /&gt;The pice was pretty good also.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil! Big bottle. :)</li>
            <li> I put this in the diffuser in the kids room to help them relax at night!</li>
            <li> This product barely smells like anything! It must be mixed with a carrier oil. I&#x27;m so disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance. Better than expected</li>
            <li> compared to the price of essential oils sold other places.....this one rocks.....love it</li>
            <li> Great!  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The essential oil is fine.. however the packaging is lousy.. the bottle cap broke and fell apart while opening the bottle for the very first time!! Unacceptable!!</li>
            <li> vegetable oil.  horrible. avoid.</li>
            <li> It is not 100% pure Lavender Essential Oil.  It is a blended oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, reasonable price and on PRIME!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product as your &#x27;go-to&#x27; lavender essence to add to  your Epsom salts for your bath, for your coconut oil to slather on your body (especially after bath, before bedtime).</li>
            <li> Great quality essential oils without the high prices of oils sold by the 1/4 or 1/2 ounce.  My wife likes this as much as expensive brands that are sold by MLM (pyramid) sales organizations.  Get this and refill your other bottle and those of your friends too.</li>
            <li> Nice price, great for bulk products</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, love a few drops in the bath!</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of the french lavender essential oil into my lotion every morning after I shower. This particular lavender oil only requires me to use one drop as it is very fragrant. It is a great way to start my morning refreshed and energized. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> This product smells like the average public restroom.</li>
            <li> While this is a lovely product, I would say that it does not smell as strongly, or last as long, as other lavender essential oils I have used.</li>
            <li> lavender oil as expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down the WORST essential oils I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.  I only purchased these oils to use in my DIY homemade laundry soap and on my wool dryer balls, but these are so awful I can&#x27;t even use them for that!!!!!  Every single one of these &amp;#34;pure essential oils&amp;#34; is FILLED with a carrier oil - what kind of carrier oil, I don&#x27;t know!!  Maybe it&#x27;s vegetable oil??  ICK!  These oils won&#x27;t even absorb into my wool dryer balls!  They just sit on the top like a gross, slimy film!!!  I can&#x27;t even believe that this company markets them as &amp;#34;100% Pure&amp;#34;.  PURE BS is what that is!!!!!  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson - for homemade cleaning and laundry items where you need bulk essential oils but DON&#x27;T WANT CRAP, buy the NOW Foods brand.  Theirs might not be &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34; and I would **never** use them to treat any physical or emotional ailment that my family members and I might have, but they are good quality EO&#x27;s for home cleaning use.  SUN ORGANIC&#x27;S ARE NOT!!!  These are AWFUL!!!</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price</li>
            <li> Amazing smell but it does take more than normal.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. What you see is what you get. I transfer these over to bottles with droppers, so I can measure it more carefully. I wish it came with one built-in.</li>
            <li> Lavender oil was my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for numerous things, but the price for organic has restricted my use. I&#x27;ve been paying in the neighborhood of $8 per ounce for organic lavender so this purchase has me enjoying it liberally once again. Smells great.</li>
            <li> It seems diluted, possibly. I have some other lavender oil that seems so much stronger than this. It&#x27;s still a good deal</li>
            <li> Love this product..It is calming and it helps sooth the mind especially before i go to bed.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and sun Organic is a great brand to buy. I love the way their&#x27;s smell and works. Lavender is one of the oils that I use a lot of. It has a very calming,relaxing effect on me. I love using it in my diffuser in my bedroom. I really believe that it helps me to relax and sleep better. You can add a few drops to your bath for a relaxing bath. It is good in making candles,soaps and massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;Sun Organic has over one hundred scents for you to choose from. I am so happy that I was able to receive this for testing and my honest and unbiased opinion. This is my opinion and mine only.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil. I don&#x27;t really like lavender that much, but the French Lavender smells great!  I was given this product to test without any biased.</li>
            <li> Oil is just ok. Lid came broken as well, so quite a bit leaked out.</li>
            <li> its lavender, but it smells a little off, and it gets really sticky.  in my opinion there are much better brands out there, i even like &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of differnt lavander essential oils and I&#x27;m sorry to say this is one I am returning. It smelled very weak, I put a drop on a white plain paper, 5 hours later it left an oil stain. This makes me suspect that it is diluted with a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent , love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a great transaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to all these essential oils, so I haven&#x27;t tryed any other brands, other then the cheap ones you buy at WalMart etc. But as far s this one goes it&#x27;s smells strong and like French lavender, to which is soothing. I personally love the smell of French lavender tho. My diffuser was old and quit working on me so I haven&#x27;t tryed any of my new essential oils in one yet, also I&#x27;m just now finding out that they have a million uses, so as soon as I try all the different ways, I will update this review and give an opinion on the ways I tryed them and how they worked. These, all of the sun essential oils brand has came with a plastic dropper</li>
            <li> Not pure essential oil.  I did a blot test on paper and this product is not a pure essential,oil.  No wonder it is low cost. It is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I’ve become a big fan of essential oils over the last few months since I’ve started building up my own personal collection.  I was happy to order this lavender oil from Sun Essential OIls to try out.  The large glass bottle will last me a long time.  They include a plastic pipette, but I do really wish there was a glass dropper built into the bottle lid (like other brands I’ve had), since these plastic ones get gummed up over time and can get messy.  This makes it difficult to dispense the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like using lavender oil to help with relaxation, either during stressful times or when I’m trying to go to sleep.  It’s great added into bathwater for a relaxing soak in the tub as well.  I’m also trying to make some of my own soaps and lotions and this is great for those as well!  This Sun Essential product has a nice lavender scent, but is not as strong as others I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m wondering whether this is actually fully pure essential oil or diluted with a carrier.</li>
            <li> love this oil!!!! i would buy this over and over the only con i have is that its cold here and by time i get it its frozen, but i just set them on the counter and let them warm up to room temp. just scary touching a frozen glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells so good.</li>
            <li> Had Lavender on my shopping list when I rec&#x27;d an offer for THIS company&#x27;s product---fortuitous right? Super super happy with both the timing of this Lavender oil, its size, and its scent. Absolutely swoon-worthy! I Love Lavender &amp; ensure that I have a spare---always. The size of this means that I won&#x27;t have to worry about restocking too soon, and the scent means that I am more relaxed {a known Lavender oil benefit}. I live in an older house and have closets which tend to smell musty, so I always have cedarwood in stock. I apply Lavender oil to the wood to keep the moths at bay, and to freshen the scent of the closet.  I like sachets and refreshen the scent w/ Lavender drops every month or so. There are many ways to use Lavender oil so hope that this sparks off handy thought-processes.&lt;br /&gt; {BTW: As stated previously, I received this as a freebie which simply means that I appreciate both the offer AND the company for this opportunity.}</li>
            <li> Mid to low quality oil.  It seemed like lavender oil in a carrier oil and was not a high quality, pure essential oil.  I returned this and purchased a much better one (wellness scent).</li>
            <li> I just purchased this and it is NOT pure essential lavender . It&#x27;s mixed with some type of other carrier oil. It is mixed with a thicker oil that smells like used cooking oil and with a faint scent of lavender. I&#x27;ve used essential lavender oil for over 20 years and with out a doubt this has been mixed with some other type of oil.</li>
            <li> Keeps bugs away and also helps me sleep at night love lavender</li>
            <li> Lavender is afavorite oil and this is a good one. Very nicely fragrant. Use in aromatherapy and topically</li>
            <li> I had no idea when I won a collection of 12 of these oils that they were so huge!!!! These are good quality oils and have a beautiful aroma. I have used the lavender on the back of my dog&#x27;s collar to help calm his anxiety and for diffusing in our home to calm down my hyper boys! These do state on the bottle they are not for internal use, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them that way. However, they are perfect for soaps, lotions, candles, diffusers, and the like. They do come with a dropper. Great customer service as well; I highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> This is definitely lavender from France. My only issue is bottle does not say &amp;#34;French Lavender&amp;#34; on the label but on the ingredients list it does state French Lavender essential oil. So it will not have it in big letters on the label like the picture.</li>
            <li> Bottle top broke in my hands but it smells good</li>
            <li> French lavender oil has a very distinctive smell, and this, my friends, is no pure French Lavender oil. What you&#x27;re getting is most likely lavandin oil, judging by the smell. Lavandin is a hybrid of English and French lavenders, and is distinctive from lavender oil by the heavy camphor/menthol smell. Lavandin has a higher level of camphor terpenes than lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this oil smells like lavender with a heavy note of camphor. Nice, but don&#x27;t try to use it for the same applications as you would lavender. It&#x27;s a good aromatherapy idea for people with lung issues (flu, cold, congestion, etc), but DO NOT try to use this oil to soothe burns. The camphor level will make the burn worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLAIMER: I received this free product to perform product testing with the intent of providing an honest and educated review. I received no other compensation, and all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars because it&#x27;s a good oil, but it&#x27;s not the oil that&#x27;s being advertised</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly! I use it as room freshner!! I use in soap, hair, its too good!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this oil for free to review but the opinion is my own!!</li>
            <li> This Lavender Oil  is a great oil, and awesome value!  It comes in a very large glass 4 ounce bottle.  It also comes with a plastic dispenser that  makes dispensing the oil in my diffuser a breeze. This oil smells just as expected.  Lavender is a classic and has so many uses. I will be using this oil primarily in my diffuser.  It is a perfect way to unwind from a stressful day.  It smells great, and is great quality. I was provided a sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> Wow! Perfect, quality item!</li>
            <li> NOT essential oil!!! Essential oils are volatile, and evaporate quickly and nearly completely when heated or left out in the air. As another reviewer notes, this just turns to a gluey carrier oil with no smell when warmed or left out. If you are looking to use lavender oil therapeutically, this will do nothing for you at all. Complete waste of money, and definitely not what it says it is. Will never buy again from them. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Scorpions are a fact of life in southern Arizona.  Several people suggested we buy lavender pouches used to freshen closets and put them at entrances to the house.  We&#x27;ve used the pouches about 2 months and no scorpions.  Instead of replacing the pricey pouches, we bought 100% lavender oil and put a few drops on the pouches about once a month.  Sun Organic has the best price I could find and the oil arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this scent at all. But my family did. Didn&#x27;t smell like lavender to me. Received for reviewing purposes only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff and I like this brand. Weirdly, I have terriers who are very responsive to aromatherapy. This helped them get through July 4th a little more calmly.</li>
            <li> Great lavender essential oil. This smells wonderful in my diffuser. I love the calming and relaxing properties of lavender. It&#x27;s awesome. This is a large 4 fl. Oz. Bottle. This is a great value for such a large amount of high quality EO. Comes with plastic dropper. Very satified! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> Yet another amazing smelling oil! So awesome to receive these free and then try them out. The quality of the oil is that of it&#x27;s overpriced competitor! Will continue to use the Sun Essential Oils!!</li>
            <li> Lavender Essential Oils ranks as one of my favorite essential oils because of its many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender Essential Oil Provides Relief From:&lt;br /&gt;stress&lt;br /&gt;headaches&lt;br /&gt;sunburn&lt;br /&gt;insomnia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender Essential Oil Increases:&lt;br /&gt;relaxation&lt;br /&gt;calmness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Sun Essentials French Lavender Essential Oil, and use it in my bedroom diffuser on a regular basis in the evening to promote relaxation and help me fall asleep. I also like to add a few drops to my laundry during the rinse cycle, place a few drops in my clothing drawers, and drop a few drops on my pillow at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise against using ingesting this oil in any way as Sun Essential Oils puts a warning on the bottle that indicates &amp;#34;not for internal use.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sun Essentials French Lavender Oil comes in a huge 4oz bottle with a plastic pipette.  I appreciate that the company included a pipette but I would have preferred if they included a glass dropper built right into the lid of the bottle (like many other companies include).  But, at this great price I can&#x27;t complain too much :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very high quality essential oil, and a great value for a bottle of this size. I would absolutely recommend Sun Essentials French Lavender Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sun Essentials is so confident with the quality of their essential oils that they offer a 100% guarantee. If you are less than satisfied you can request a refund, anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Lavender is my absolute favorite scent and I am so excited to finally have it! The Lavender is strong, but not too strong. The bottle is bigger than I imagined it would be. The items shipped pretty fast and I had no problems with the shipping. When it comes to using the oils, I&#x27;ve found that using the oil really helps calm me down. Putting a few drops on my neck does the trick and the oil doesn&#x27;t make me feel gross afterwards. All in all, great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received a sample from the manufacturer for evaluation and review purposes.)</li>
            <li> Received for free for review smells incredible in my diffuser and i use in my soaps, scrubs i make, incredible oil love it.</li>
            <li> the lavender is great but the applicator doesn&#x27;t work at all.... the clear top that lets you dispense the oil drop by drop doesn&#x27;t fit the bottle and didn&#x27;t have a hole punched in it anyway.  i was able to punch a hole but it still did not attach to the bottle. it is simply too big.  it was disappointing as i do use lavender oil in my vacuum cleaner daily and like to dispense drop by drop.  now i have to figure out how to do that ... i have gotten sun essential oils before and never had this problem with the bottle/dispenser.</li>
            <li> Fantastic aroma!  LOVE this oil</li>
            <li> i received this to review and have to say i am very happy. i find new uses for it every day. i would for sure recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> I love lavender oil. It is great in the diffuser. It relaxes me when I&#x27;m really tense. This is a great oil to have.</li>
            <li> nice product!  great smell and usability. I would buy this again in a second.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price!</li>
            <li> So beautiful...love the smell and quality</li>
            <li> Fragrance is weak. Does not produce calming effects as it should.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how can they claim that this oil is \\&quot;PURE\\&quot; \\&quot;FRENCH\\&quot; Lavender and its fragrance lasts no more than 2 minutes...  This oil has been DILUTED!  But it would be impossible for me to prove it...  But you have been warned!    Also, on the label it says that the oil is \\&quot;NOT FOR INTERNAL USE\\&quot;.  However, they don&#x27;t say that on the advertisement above...  So, why not if it is \\&quot;PURE\\&quot; and \\&quot;HAS NO ADDED CHEMICALS\\&quot;???  so...  No more Sun \\&quot;Organic\\&quot; for me!!!!    I also bought the Rosemary oil and it was the same...    Great article about essential oils:  http://essentialoilblogging.com/2014/01/14/can-essential-oils-be-ingested/</li>
            <li> When I first stumbled upon Sun organic, I was a little taken back by how great the price was for the 4 ounce bottle of French lavender. We go through a lot of lavender in my house between the salt baths, diffusing it a bed time, and with how often I burned my hands while cooking LOL. I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with the quality of this oil. I will never buy lavender from any of the big-name companies I typically buy most of my oils from ever again. Most of those companies can&#x27;t even guarantee you an organic oil, I love that this is organic. Will be looking into more of the oils this company has to offer.</li>
            <li> Fresh and in perfect condition. Good timing with shipping too!! A +++</li>
            <li> I bought this and two others. This one is my least favorite although I do like it a lot. The smell is very strong but I think I may have used too much in the cleaner I scented with it. All in all it smells good, just make sure you follow some sort of guide when using this, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I DO LOVE HOT LAVENDER OIL WORKS IF YOU PLACE SOME DROPS ON YOUR PILLOW AND PJAYS CALMS THE MIND..&lt;br /&gt;BUT I PREFER THE LAVENDER MORE THAN THE FRENCH LAVENDER</li>
            <li> Some of sealed product leaked into package during transit.  Remaining product is lovely! It&#x27;s used in laundry and homemade soaps/scrubs.</li>
            <li> very poor quality lavander.  I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Not very strong smell, seems like  its a bit diluted,</li>
            <li> best lavender on site, I&#x27;ve ordered from several competitors and this is the BEST product it&#x27;s actually oil</li>
            <li> Great for homemade cleaning products.  I add it to everything.</li>
            <li> Powerful aroma, long lasting fragrance</li>
            <li> I put lavender oil on me and my two daughters every night, I mix it with a coconut  or almond carrier oil. I put a drop with my wax candle tarts also makes the house smell amazing!</li>
            <li> Smells great&amp; is cheaper than most other brands</li>
            <li> Disgusting.  Tried using it in our diffusers and it greased up all three of them.  I&#x27;ve never had this happen with DoTerra or NOW oils.  Left a thick gross film and ruined two of our diffusers.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lavender essential oil is one of my favorite scents.  I use it all the time in my oil diffuser alone and mixed with other essential oils.  This one is good quality and not too strong in scent.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided</li>
            <li> Not impressed! The smell of lavender is almost non-existent! I suppose this oil is not pure and much diluted. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I primarily use this for aromatherapy by itself or as a secondary oil in blends. Very relaxing aroma like it better than some others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is prone to yellowing toenails and this seems to help when she applies a small amount with a swab.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come back to edit my initial review now that I&#x27;ve used this product a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, mea culpa...&lt;br /&gt;I love lavender oil and confess I only opened the bottle and sniffed it quickly before I wrote the first review.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that it didn&#x27;t have the strength of fragrance or complexity of my last bottle from another vendor.&lt;br /&gt;I dismissed this observation as a notion.&lt;br /&gt;However when I used it in the bath later that week, rather than scent filling my bathroom with fragrance, it gave off a weak scent that quickly dissipated. The oil beaded up on the surface of the water, rather than dispersing in small oil drops. When my tub drained,  a thick residue was left behind, something I had not experienced in all my years of using lavender essential oil in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be using this again for personal use.&lt;br /&gt;As of now, its only fit to clean etching ink off my printing plates... because I will be wearing gloves when I do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay more, get the real deal!</li>
            <li> I will never buy again from sun organic the oils are deluded very.......disappointed</li>
            <li> This product was given to me without the expectation that I review it. With that being said the opinion given is solely my own.  I love this product. It came to me in a large, brown, glass bottle along with a plastic dropper. I would have liked to have gotten a glass dropper either attached or separate however I can live without it. The scent of this product is amazing. It&#x27;s not too overpowering. I have used it on my young son&#x27;s pillow at night before he goes to bed (a few drops on the outer corners). It worked wonders to calm him down and he slept like the old saying &amp;#34;a baby&amp;#34;. I have even used this product for myself and my husband as we both have sleep issues. My husband doesn&#x27;t appreciate the scent as much as I do, but it seemed to have a calming effect on him. I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I like this particular product. I would definitely recommend and will be buying it again as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Looking forward to using it in my homemade products.</li>
            <li> French Lavender is my favorite of all time from all the Essential Oils that they have out in the market. Sun Essential Oil French Lavender is not as strong as others that I try before. It does smell  like French Lavender but the smells last just a few . Hopefully they will take in consideration to try to make this one more time since they have lots of other ones that they smell great.</li>
            <li> Very weak. Takes a large bottle to do what the now oils do in just a few drops and then still not good fragrance or therapeutic quality. Will not buy again. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> very weak smell one our later no smell at all. Waiting for refund.</li>
            <li> Great product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> this product smelled like lavender and held up in my CP soap.  It is a good price for lavender EO.</li>
            <li> Good product. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I love the price for the amount. My only problem with it is it seems to have too much of a greasy consistency that does not rub in. I expected it to be a more dryer, blends right in, like other brands of oils I&#x27;ve purchased. But that&#x27;s ok I just need to use it differently then I planned on using it.</li>
            <li> Not as concentrated as it should be. I should have known better :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this oil. I received this oil and 3 others in exchange for an honest review. It had definitely been cut with some other type of oil. No where near as good of quality as what I&#x27;m used to. All the oils were like this. Won&#x27;t be purchasing from this company.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this companies products. Received this to try for free. bottle came all intact, no liquid lost! Nice little dropper to control use. The smell is very pleasant. Have been using it in my various combinations and am very pleased with the results. easy to blend and great smell</li>
            <li> Everything was great Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> Easiest one of the best customer service I have experienced. I love this company. My packages always arrive on time &amp; very secure. The oils are the second best part, quality, affordable and they have some of the best blends I have tried. This one in particular is great for mixing in lotions or to diffuse. It comes in a huge amber bottle to protect the quality. I also received a dropper which helps you use exactly how much you need without wasting it.  The smell to me is a little more fresh than regular lavender oils.  Just a few drops in the diffuser and the whole rooms smells great and it has a nice calming effect. I received this product for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> turns to glue when heated.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really oil.</li>
            <li> A few months back I purchased the same French lavender oil from the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; company, awesome no complaints. I recently went thru my orders to reorder some more and when I received this last bottle it was NOT the same at all. French lavender has a very sweet smell. This was just regular lavender. I also noticed that the company name has changed and the label looked blurry. I will be sending this back.</li>
            <li> This French Lavender smells a little to strong for my liking. So far I have used it in the difuser a few times and on my wool dryer balls. I am hoping to find more uses for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very  disappointed with this purchase. I wasn&#x27;t even looking for a pure essential oil for internal use. I was only looking for lavender oil for use in a diffuser so I wanted somethjng less expensive. I knew just based on the price that it wasnt pure essential oil as it claims to be. That said, this wasn&#x27;t even worth what I paid for it. When you open the bottle it doesn&#x27;t even smell like lavender. All I can smell is that &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; that has gone bad or spoiled type smell. Like vegetable oil you&#x27;ve had hanging around in a plastic bottle for too long. I would not recommend spending the money on this. Totally not worth it. It&#x27;s obviously super diluted with some old mystery oil that they don&#x27;t even tell you about on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have always loved lavender scents I received this for free and I&#x27;m leaving a review to say that this is a nice scent and great relaxing oil</li>
            <li> Funky aroma for lavender but it dissipated fairly quickly.  Not what I was at all expecting.</li>
            <li> This barely has any lavender smell to it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love it ,,,the price is very good for this quantity and the quality is great ,,im very happy</li>
            <li> I only wish thw bottle had a drop top. Other than that, this oil is tremendous. I use it in my humidifier at night to sleep and it truly helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Did not smell like lavender as I know it</li>
            <li> Excellent product and on time except there is a leak of oil</li>
            <li> I have been using EO for 20 years,  thought I would try a new brand, it smelled good not great. When I used it on my rocks in the sauna it smelled like  rancid oil. It is cut with some kind of oil, even though it says 100% pure EO. We had to leave the sauna until the smelled cleared. If it was cheaper I would have suspected it but at this price no excuse. First time trying this brand so maybe it was a bad batch, however, it has some kind of carrier oil in it, the sauna steam does not lie.</li>
            <li> Just as I had hoped...lovely and quickly shipped</li>
            <li> Item arrived with a broken cap and therefore leaking.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, it was &amp;quot;Sun Organic&amp;quot; Essential Oil. Where did the &amp;quot;Organic&amp;quot; go? It&#x27;s on my bottle, but not anywhere on Amazon anymore. It even disappeared off the picture in my historical orders information. I am troubled that the website for Sun Organics has a section  &amp;quot;about us&amp;quot; - it just gives you a map of Scottsdale. That&#x27;s it. Who put that website together? There are disclaimers there that appear to be written by Amazon. So it that web site made up by Amazon?  In hindsight I got a chuckle out of the &amp;quot; 100% pure&amp;quot; words in the product description, it isn&#x27;t about the oil, it is a 100% pure unconditional manufacturer refund. I don&#x27;t have enough experience with oils yet, but those I know and trust  that have a lot of experience say this oil that I bought doesn&#x27;t smell good. I will not buy any Sun Organic or Sun Essential Oils from now on because of the lack of details about the oil.</li>
            <li> LOVE all my Essential Oils...</li>
            <li> I received this product free to try and review, my opinion is completely my own.  I like the smell of the French Lavender and this essential oil has multiple uses.  I plan to use it in home made sugar scrubs.  It can be used for such things as: Cuts, grazes and scars; lavender oil can be used on minor cuts and grazes, simply by dabbing a few drops straight onto the affected area.&lt;br /&gt;Spots and skin irritations&lt;br /&gt;Lavender oil is also anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and Headaches (gently massaged onto the temples can help stop a persistent headache)&lt;br /&gt;Burns and sunburn:  Lavender oil can be used to cool, relieve and help heal burns and sunburn. A few drops applied to the affected area can do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Relaxation: A few drops in a hot bath, or mixed with carrier oil for a massage, can ease away the day&#x27;s stress and aid a good night&#x27;s sleep. Sprinkle a few drops onto your pillow to help a good nights sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many other uses that can be researched on internet.  I rated this oil as a 4 because it is not 100% pure oil and The brand sun organic leads you to believe it is organic but nowhere in description or on bottle it it certified organic.  For the price it is a good value.</li>
            <li> It is a good oil for the price, but it seems to lose its smell faster than other oils I have used.</li>
            <li> Weak solution. Very little scent. Disappointing. There was a reason it was cheap.</li>
            <li> So I have made a few batched of lavendar shea butter with this, I have used it for my face with a coconut oil as the carrier. I put some in my humidifier and OMG it helped to open up and clear my sinuses..I had no idea this would work I just tried it and loved it..I also added it to  my shampoo to prevent dandruff and reduce hair loss and it is doing a great job. I love the quality of this product and will purchase again soon.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with order.</li>
            <li> Received promptly and as promised thank you</li>
            <li> Love Sun Organics, great product, great price</li>
            <li> So Disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it A Chance.  It is Obviously diluted One Part in Ten.  In A Vegetable oil I cannot name.  I BUY Organic For QUALITY.  I would return it, and still Might!  I don&#x27;t Trust the Quality of their product anymore.  I will Go With NOW brand instead</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS ORDER,EXACTLY AS STATED.</li>
            <li> I love anything with the name sunorganics.  good stuff</li>
