            <li>They were the highlight of the party, everyone loved them.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine had a rave themed birthday party for a friend and there were tons of glow sticks and glow jewelry that you see fairly often.  </li>

            <li>Very cute.  </li>
            <li>So now you have this bright flashing object blinking on your head like you&#x27;re some kind of traffic</li>
            <li>But darn if they didn&#x27;t make her even better looking!  </li>
            <li>these were a great hit at our music in the park and they lasted and are still going strong.</li>

            <li>The price was the best and the product is really well made.</li>
            <li>this was an easy hair piece to use and the kids loved the colors changing.</li>
            <li>I need to use them tomorrow, but I wish they would read the color they sold so they can send out the right ones!!!</li>
            <li>The light is bright.</li>
            <li>Great sleepover fun for kids birthday party.  </li>
            <li>They light up well and look great at night, but the barrettes do not hold well and the fiber optic part falls out of the light/barrette easily.  </li>
            <li>Great deal and pretty lights.</li>
            <li>Just glad they are a color</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just lovely.</li>
            <li>love love.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for a variety of occasions!  </li>
            <li>I followed one of the suggested wears and clipped the top then braided the strands in</li>
            <li>I LOVE your hair!&amp;#34; comments threw me off guard.</li>
            <li>Why scour Amazon for the best deal on a specific item just to end up getting what you DIDN&#x27;T want?!</li>
            <li>Both of my daughters LOVE</li>
            <li>Cute accessory for nighttime events, like Disneyland.  </li>
            <li>Loved these, i had them in my hair all night &amp; it was fun &amp; festive.  </li>
            <li>The top with the battery compartment was chunky.  </li>
            <li>Super cute &amp; very unique!</li>
            <li>Real pretty at night!</li>
            <li>thing I like about these is that the clip comes undone easily without getting tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li>They clip into hair easily and stay well.  </li>
            <li>when the crowds it was easy to spot them.</li>
            <li>the strands fall out easily.  </li>
            <li>Wore it for about 4 hours and battery was still going fine.</li>
            <li>For an accurate picture of what you get, go to this link:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/</li>
            <li>Not to mention the plastic housing for the batteries (which is the barrette) is so cheap</li>
            <li>It comes out smoothly even when my hair is still braided.</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone who likes light up raving type of stuff.</li>
            <li>They light up.  </li>
            <li>It was a great hit with my teenage granddaughter as well as her mother and aunt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--VERY cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Glowbys brand light up when the clip is fastened and don&#x27;t have an off switch.</li>
            <li>Once they are in your hair, they are very fun.</li>
            <li>But, unlike some others I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s super easy to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li>Fun!</li>
            <li>These barrettes were so much fun at the music festival and made a statement too!</li>
            <li>Other than that I loved wearing them!</li>
            <li>This was fun and everyone liked at xmas but the clip was really large</li>
            <li>In addition, the barrette lights up very bright - much, much brighter than the fiber optic strands, further detracting from the point of this item, which is the fiber optic strands.</li>
            <li>They were just right!</li>
            <li>My carpet was full of plastic strands after the kids got done playing with it.</li>
            <li>Every female (kids and adults alike) LOVED them.</li>
            <li>These seemed like a good idea for party favors for the girls at a glow-in-the-dark dance party for 3rd graders.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old loved it so much she had to sleep with it.</li>
            <li>not a solid light like the others I own.</li>
            <li>They are super</li>
            <li>I was so happy that the girls had this barrette in their hair once it got dark...</li>
            <li>They were so much fun on new years! :)</li>
            <li>Decent price, &amp; they lasted thru the weekend for more fun.  </li>
            <li>Really fun with the girls and women wearing them in their hair at the dance party.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really fun for dances, parties, or raves.  </li>
            <li>Other than that we loved these - stayed clipped in the hair and were very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve liked if there was an on-off switch instead of having to keep the battery compartment open when not in use</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it...</li>
            <li>THESE ARE REALLY FUN.</li>
            <li>have not inquired as to the remainder of the ones I bought that I gave away to others&#x27; children, so I can&#x27;t honestly say that EVERY one had the same design/manufacturing flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it can be a fun while it lasts.</li>
            <li>These glowbys are so much fun.</li>
            <li>They worked well and were really pretty cool</li>
            <li>After going to one of those big arena kid events I decided I would find more cost effective and fun glow items for the next time rather than paying for the overpriced items at the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does look nice in the dark, so just be aware of it not staying too secure in your hair.</li>
            <li>Only regret is not getting more since very affordable and fun!</li>
            <li>Unlike in the photos, the only real light you see is at the very bottom of the strands, but they&#x27;re still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but once we experimented a little they worked out pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I did give one to a friend with short hair and she was able to keep it in OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of mine lasted multiple nights (~21 hours).</li>
            <li>If you want to turn it off again be sure to save the plastic tab - you can put it again later and turn it off for storage.  </li>
            <li>She got many compliments on them and several parents wanted to know where we got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one out of the package needed fiddling with in order to get it to function at all.  </li>
            <li>First of all, these are not \\&quot;Glowbys\\</li>
            <li>Got my product within 5 days! :) and all work properly!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend them to anyone who wants something unique for their light up outfit.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to know there were other colors too.</li>
            <li>They lasted the whole night and looked pretty neat</li>
            <li>You could barely tell they lit up with any light in the room.</li>
            <li>So if you aren&#x27;t the jumping up and down, running every which way kind of gal you may not have any problems.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>The design is such that the batteries are too loose in the barrette enclosure and thus they do not make good contact with the electrical contacts.  </li>
            <li>Up to 60 fibers is only accurate if you count all the strands from all four packages together.  </li>
            <li>Just cheap enough to not hassle with returning and asking for a refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t stay in the hair very well.</li>
            <li>It is really neat and lights up just like the item described.</li>
            <li>Seller ships fast &amp; very helpful as well.</li>
            <li>so they really just became a table novelty for everyone to look at once in a while.  </li>
            <li>You can still see through the hair and see the clip and it is kind of heavy.</li>
            <li>so tiny, any kind of pressure will obviously cause them to break, which they did do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look great in long hair and were just what I needed to keep track of my kid in the dark while she wandered around on Halloween.</li>
            <li>Loved the glow lights but the barrette part left the batteries showing (not pretty).  </li>
            <li>these are excited to wear them with their friends to middle school dances and sleep-overs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>n and fast sending me four new ones!</li>
            <li>Extra special for the princess to decorate her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Bought these for my granddaughters and they loved them when we went to the Renaissance Festival especially after it got dark!</li>
            <li>The barrette I think is a decent size.</li>
            <li>Also, they do not change color or flash, just steady blueish purple.</li>
            <li>Those with straight or fine hair will most certainly find the product disappointing.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a cheap little gift, and as long as you don&#x27;t have high expectations for it (or expect the description to be accurate), have the patience to fiddle with thing (and have some glue or tape on standby)</li>
            <li>These however are seen less frequently and so attract more attention.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to use on New Year&#x27;s Eve @</li>
            <li>AT OUR NEW YEARS PARTY.</li>
            <li>I guess we will use them on New Years and St. Patty&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>I got 2 blue and 2 pink in my latest order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These will look great after dark in the park and they don&#x27;t cost a small fortune like the ones the park sells.</li>
            <li>At first I received only one when I ordered the set of four and let it be known on the feedback.</li>
            <li>daughter had a chance to wear them for the first time when we went to the circus last month.  </li>
            <li>Of the 20 strands or so, only about 1/4 of them are full length at 14 inches, the rest are layered at different lengths.&lt;br</li>
            <li>important thing to note is that each individual barrette is a single color.</li>
            <li>This was a huge hit with the little girl I got it for.  </li>
            <li>Instead they have one of those little plastic tabs that you pull out to start the light.  </li>
            <li>bright color (at least the blue - which is the ONLY color I received).</li>
            <li>They have a clear housing containing the batteries and lights.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m going to assume that description is inaccurate</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to the green light, but I got 4 BLUE lights.</li>
            <li>We bought these for our 4-year old.  </li>
            <li>So far, they&#x27;ve held up and we haven&#x27;t had any issues to date.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised - did not use for hair, used on a Christmas tree</li>
            <li>It slides over so far that either the battery slips out</li>
            <li>A couple hours later, it once again stopped functioning, and I had to take the whole thing apart to adjust the contacts so that they would continuously transmit the batteries&#x27; electricity.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The batteries that came with them lasted throughout the show without any sign of dimming and will probably last for a few more shows.</li>
            <li>These are very verstile and long lasting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the barrette is small in shape, it has a significant thickness to it, and any attempt to hide it in medium thickness hair continually resulted in the barrette being clearly visible.  </li>
            <li>You can only fit a small amount of hair in it, and even then it wants to pop open.</li>
            <li>A little evening fun.</li>
            <li>The barrette is huge and is hard to hide under your hair.</li>
            <li>and just white light... not sure where the rainbow is supposed to some from.</li>
            <li>Yes, I was as careful and gentle as I could be, but the plastic tabs are</li>
            <li>It is a fun product, however the clip to attach to your hair is not a secure clip.  </li>
            <li>These are very fun, but delicate.</li>
            <li>I expected that everyone would have seen them before, but they were new to everyone!  </li>
            <li>AND even better - to use these hair lights for my party and then get the BONUS of having 2 extra round batteries after to use for other things - can never have enough of those batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As one other person said, unless you have an abundance of hair, you will not be able to hide the clip which is hard to fasten.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, there isn&#x27;t a good way to turn them off other than removing the batteries.</li>
            <li>The Glowbys are cute, but the build quality is pretty bad.</li>
            <li>All of the packages are marked as BLUE so clearly not rainbow, but they will serve their purpose.</li>
            <li>And as long as I get a few uses out of them they&#x27;ll be worth the price.</li>
            <li>The lighting does a slow fade across several colors and then a quick strobe flash through the colors.</li>

            <li> These seemed like a good idea for party favors for the girls at a glow-in-the-dark dance party for 3rd graders.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old loved it so much she had to sleep with it.</li>
            <li> not a solid light like the others I own.</li>
            <li> They are super</li>
            <li> I was so happy that the girls had this barrette in their hair once it got dark...</li>
            <li> They were so much fun on new years! :)</li>
            <li> Decent price, &amp; they lasted thru the weekend for more fun.  </li>
            <li> Really fun with the girls and women wearing them in their hair at the dance party.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really fun for dances, parties, or raves.  </li>
            <li> Other than that we loved these - stayed clipped in the hair and were very pretty.  </li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve liked if there was an on-off switch instead of having to keep the battery compartment open when not in use</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it...</li>
            <li> THESE ARE REALLY FUN.</li>
            <li> have not inquired as to the remainder of the ones I bought that I gave away to others&#x27; children, so I can&#x27;t honestly say that EVERY one had the same design/manufacturing flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it can be a fun while it lasts.</li>
            <li> These glowbys are so much fun.</li>
            <li> They worked well and were really pretty cool</li>
            <li> After going to one of those big arena kid events I decided I would find more cost effective and fun glow items for the next time rather than paying for the overpriced items at the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does look nice in the dark, so just be aware of it not staying too secure in your hair.</li>
            <li> Only regret is not getting more since very affordable and fun!</li>
            <li> Unlike in the photos, the only real light you see is at the very bottom of the strands, but they&#x27;re still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once we experimented a little they worked out pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I did give one to a friend with short hair and she was able to keep it in OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of mine lasted multiple nights (~21 hours).</li>
            <li> If you want to turn it off again be sure to save the plastic tab - you can put it again later and turn it off for storage.  </li>
            <li> She got many compliments on them and several parents wanted to know where we got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first one out of the package needed fiddling with in order to get it to function at all.  </li>
            <li> First of all, these are not \\&quot;Glowbys\\</li>
            <li> Got my product within 5 days! :) and all work properly!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend them to anyone who wants something unique for their light up outfit.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to know there were other colors too.</li>
            <li> They lasted the whole night and looked pretty neat</li>
            <li> You could barely tell they lit up with any light in the room.</li>
            <li> So if you aren&#x27;t the jumping up and down, running every which way kind of gal you may not have any problems.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The design is such that the batteries are too loose in the barrette enclosure and thus they do not make good contact with the electrical contacts.  </li>
            <li> Up to 60 fibers is only accurate if you count all the strands from all four packages together.  </li>
            <li> Just cheap enough to not hassle with returning and asking for a refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stay in the hair very well.</li>
            <li> It is really neat and lights up just like the item described.</li>
            <li> Seller ships fast &amp; very helpful as well.</li>
            <li> so they really just became a table novelty for everyone to look at once in a while.  </li>
            <li> You can still see through the hair and see the clip and it is kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> so tiny, any kind of pressure will obviously cause them to break, which they did do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They look great in long hair and were just what I needed to keep track of my kid in the dark while she wandered around on Halloween.</li>
            <li> Loved the glow lights but the barrette part left the batteries showing (not pretty).  </li>
            <li> these are excited to wear them with their friends to middle school dances and sleep-overs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> n and fast sending me four new ones!</li>
            <li> Extra special for the princess to decorate her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughters and they loved them when we went to the Renaissance Festival especially after it got dark!</li>
            <li> The barrette I think is a decent size.</li>
            <li> Also, they do not change color or flash, just steady blueish purple.</li>
            <li> Those with straight or fine hair will most certainly find the product disappointing.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a cheap little gift, and as long as you don&#x27;t have high expectations for it (or expect the description to be accurate), have the patience to fiddle with thing (and have some glue or tape on standby)</li>
            <li> These however are seen less frequently and so attract more attention.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use on New Year&#x27;s Eve @</li>
            <li> AT OUR NEW YEARS PARTY.</li>
            <li> I guess we will use them on New Years and St. Patty&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> I got 2 blue and 2 pink in my latest order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These will look great after dark in the park and they don&#x27;t cost a small fortune like the ones the park sells.</li>
            <li> At first I received only one when I ordered the set of four and let it be known on the feedback.</li>
            <li> daughter had a chance to wear them for the first time when we went to the circus last month.  </li>
            <li> Of the 20 strands or so, only about 1/4 of them are full length at 14 inches, the rest are layered at different lengths.&lt;br</li>
            <li> important thing to note is that each individual barrette is a single color.</li>
            <li> This was a huge hit with the little girl I got it for.  </li>
            <li> Instead they have one of those little plastic tabs that you pull out to start the light.  </li>
            <li> bright color (at least the blue - which is the ONLY color I received).</li>
            <li> They have a clear housing containing the batteries and lights.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m going to assume that description is inaccurate</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to the green light, but I got 4 BLUE lights.</li>
            <li> We bought these for our 4-year old.  </li>
            <li> So far, they&#x27;ve held up and we haven&#x27;t had any issues to date.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised - did not use for hair, used on a Christmas tree</li>
            <li> It slides over so far that either the battery slips out</li>
            <li> A couple hours later, it once again stopped functioning, and I had to take the whole thing apart to adjust the contacts so that they would continuously transmit the batteries&#x27; electricity.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The batteries that came with them lasted throughout the show without any sign of dimming and will probably last for a few more shows.</li>
            <li> These are very verstile and long lasting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the barrette is small in shape, it has a significant thickness to it, and any attempt to hide it in medium thickness hair continually resulted in the barrette being clearly visible.  </li>
            <li> You can only fit a small amount of hair in it, and even then it wants to pop open.</li>
            <li> A little evening fun.</li>
            <li> The barrette is huge and is hard to hide under your hair.</li>
            <li> and just white light... not sure where the rainbow is supposed to some from.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was as careful and gentle as I could be, but the plastic tabs are</li>
            <li> It is a fun product, however the clip to attach to your hair is not a secure clip.  </li>
            <li> These are very fun, but delicate.</li>
            <li> I expected that everyone would have seen them before, but they were new to everyone!  </li>
            <li> AND even better - to use these hair lights for my party and then get the BONUS of having 2 extra round batteries after to use for other things - can never have enough of those batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As one other person said, unless you have an abundance of hair, you will not be able to hide the clip which is hard to fasten.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there isn&#x27;t a good way to turn them off other than removing the batteries.</li>
            <li> The Glowbys are cute, but the build quality is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> All of the packages are marked as BLUE so clearly not rainbow, but they will serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> And as long as I get a few uses out of them they&#x27;ll be worth the price.</li>
            <li> The lighting does a slow fade across several colors and then a quick strobe flash through the colors.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s black, not white or clear which the picture assumes it to be.</li>
            <li> &quot; long, total packing is just under 15 inches.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t worn them yet to see how long the batteries last yet.  </li>
            <li> barrettes last a long time.</li>
            <li> They last long.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine some little kid trying to get this thing on and off let alone my 37 year old</li>
            <li> The color was wrong, the clip was cheap and not to mention I couldn&#x27;t even unclip it.</li>
            <li> My students love crazy hair day.</li>
            <li> All four packages came in Blue, which actually I expected them to be all one color after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> It all looked great...as long as the lights were OUT.</li>
            <li> I have very, very long hair (3 feet).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in the process of prying it open with pliers and then trying to widen the metal backing so it won&#x27;t be so hard to open and close.  </li>
            <li> I put my hair in 5 buns going down the middle of my head (like a mohawk) and had the glowbys sticking out the center.</li>
            <li> have been finding little fiber-optic strands around my apartment though, which leads me to believe some of the &#x27;hairs&#x27; fell out, but not enough to be noticeable on the barrette.</li>
            <li> They were a little tricky to get situated properly in her hair</li>
            <li> and/or lose the tiny little metal piece that makes it so the clip will close.  </li>
            <li> In doing so, the tiny little tabs that hold the cover in place broke off.</li>
            <li> (They stopped working for the battery, not because the actual product is dead...</li>
            <li> A few were made properly and worked well all night.  </li>
            <li> You have to be really careful not to break the barrette part</li>
            <li> Also, you have to be careful</li>
            <li> certainly not what was advertised.</li>
            <li> Got these just in time for EDC and unfortunately it&#x27;s the first time a product sold on Amazon has let me down.</li>
            <li> Barrette is EXTREMELY HARD to open.  </li>
            <li> The plastic clips are flimsy, it&#x27;s hard to open</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little fuzzy on which one goes which way, but at least I know they go different ways.</li>
            <li> Picture shows a white clip, they are black!!!</li>
            <li> The housing has a black clip to attach to your hair or wig.</li>
            <li> So you have to keep track of these little pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They should have had a little bow, flower or something to hide the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I glued on some little decals.</li>
            <li> helps to see the kids in the dark!</li>
            <li> Battery housing and switch take a little creativity to conceal</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any teeth to the clip, which might cause problems for someone with thin, short hair.</li>
            <li> The fiber optic strands fell out of the barrett and I ordered rainbow colored and all of them are green.</li>
            <li> The seller&#x27;s description that the barrette is \\&quot;thin\\&quot; and can be worn \\&quot;under the hair so that only the lights are visible\\&quot; is a farce.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it was a fail.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as lovely as the product photos would lead you to believe.  </li>
            <li> My nieces are young with thin blond hair so the clip just stood out and looked silly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also an Amazon Fulfillment product but at least it has the correct picture of what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> your afraid it&#x27;ll smash to pieces trying to get it open.  </li>
            <li> I would recomend at least 2 sets if you want them to look ballanced on your head.</li>
            <li> Blue!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too late to return them</li>
            <li> It just irks me when things are falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> I recieved a poorly made knock off product and the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed but still made a statement never-the-less.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not going to be paper thin, there are batteries in it!</li>
            <li> I thought they were a silly purchase.  </li>
            <li> I ordered with my Amazon prime two day shipping for my daughters crazy hair day and while I did receive them in two days, I got the completely wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (Hence the wrong picture!)</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed Amazon is fulfilling a product this like this and inaccurately!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate having to write theseI hate having to write</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really fun with the girls and women wearing them in their hair at the dance party.</li>
            <li> One was broken when I got it in the package, but what do you expect for so cheap. They stay in my hair and lite up/changed colors. My friend with straighter hair had problems getting it to stick in her hair.</li>
            <li> Got these just in time for EDC and unfortunately it&#x27;s the first time a product sold on Amazon has let me down. The color was wrong, the clip was cheap and not to mention I couldn&#x27;t even unclip it. It&#x27;s roulette when you buy stuff like this.</li>
            <li> CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. NOT 16\\&quot; long, total packing is just under 15 inches.  Of the 20 strands or so, only about 1/4 of them are full length at 14 inches, the rest are layered at different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;2. Definitely NOT rainbow.  All four packages came in Blue, which actually I expected them to be all one color after reading the reviews.  Just glad they are a color I like.&lt;br /&gt;3. Package shown in picture advertised is completely different.  For an accurate picture of what you get, go to this link:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Sparkle-Extensions-Accessories-Barrette-Dancing/dp/B007AM5PJC/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_t_5&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also an Amazon Fulfillment product but at least it has the correct picture of what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;4. Up to 60 fibers is only accurate if you count all the strands from all four packages together.  None of them flash or change speed, just one solid on or off.&lt;br /&gt;5. Haven&#x27;t worn them yet to see how long the batteries last yet.  So far, I&#x27;m going to assume that description is inaccurate also.&lt;br /&gt;6. Barrette is EXTREMELY HARD to open.  Not to mention the plastic housing for the batteries (which is the barrette) is so cheap your afraid it&#x27;ll smash to pieces trying to get it open.  And it&#x27;s black, not white or clear which the picture assumes it to be. (Hence the wrong picture!) I&#x27;m currently in the process of prying it open with pliers and then trying to widen the metal backing so it won&#x27;t be so hard to open and close.  Can&#x27;t imagine some little kid trying to get this thing on and off let alone my 37 year old self!&lt;br /&gt;6. Just cheap enough to not hassle with returning and asking for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;7. Sadly disappointed Amazon is fulfilling a product this like this and inaccurately!&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Very bright color (at least the blue - which is the ONLY color I received).</li>
            <li> They were the highlight of the party, everyone loved them. Someone at the party asked me where I got them , since they were going to order some for another occasion</li>
            <li> I always get tons of compliments when I wear these. They&#x27;re just lovely. Unlike in the photos, the only real light you see is at the very bottom of the strands, but they&#x27;re still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I like about these is that the clip comes undone easily without getting tangled in my hair. It comes out smoothly even when my hair is still braided. I have very, very long hair (3 feet). There aren&#x27;t any teeth to the clip, which might cause problems for someone with thin, short hair. I did give one to a friend with short hair and she was able to keep it in OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important thing to note is that each individual barrette is a single color. The &amp;#34;rainbow&amp;#34; refers to the fact that you have no choice in colors. I got 2 blue and 2 pink in my latest order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrettes last a long time. Most of mine lasted multiple nights (~21 hours). Unfortunately, there isn&#x27;t a good way to turn them off other than removing the batteries. But, unlike some others I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s super easy to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> I really liked these in my hair. They lasted the whole night and looked pretty neat - I think my boyfriend was jealous that they didn&#x27;t have any for short boys hair! I was at a loss for how to turn them off until I realized that the back panel slides off and you can take out the batteries. AND even better - to use these hair lights for my party and then get the BONUS of having 2 extra round batteries after to use for other things - can never have enough of those batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been finding little fiber-optic strands around my apartment though, which leads me to believe some of the &#x27;hairs&#x27; fell out, but not enough to be noticeable on the barrette.</li>
            <li> Wore these to a con, and to a party...I expected that everyone would have seen them before, but they were new to everyone!  They work as advertised, and I like the fact you can turn them &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and use the over and over again.  Fun!</li>
            <li> The Glowbys are cute, but the build quality is pretty bad. The plastic clips are flimsy, it&#x27;s hard to open/close the barrette without breaking it, and the cover tends to pop off and spill out the batteries. There&#x27;s also no on/off switch, so you have to take them apart and remove the batteries in order to turn them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip: if the cover pops off and spills out the batteries so you can&#x27;t tell which way you&#x27;re supposed to put them in, remember that one battery should be right-side up and one should be upside-down. I&#x27;m still a little fuzzy on which one goes which way, but at least I know they go different ways.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stay in the hair very well.</li>
            <li> Description says 4 multi color strands....NOT WHAT I GOT! I was really looking forward to the green light, but I got 4 BLUE lights. The light is bright. The barrette I think is a decent size. I mean,really people it&#x27;s not going to be paper thin, there are batteries in it! I did expect it to be as described such as a rainbow of color.</li>
            <li> At first I received only one when I ordered the set of four and let it be known on the feedback. The seller totally rectified the situatio...n and fast sending me four new ones! These barrettes were so much fun at the music festival and made a statement too! These are very verstile and long lasting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for a variety of occasions!  They&#x27;re really fun for dances, parties, or raves.  They clip into hair easily and stay well.  A friend of mine had a rave themed birthday party for a friend and there were tons of glow sticks and glow jewelry that you see fairly often.  These however are seen less frequently and so attract more attention.</li>
            <li> We took these to a camp that I rent every year by the water and EVERYONE ended up with one.  Real pretty at night!</li>
            <li> I received all 4 blue instead of rainbow which the seller needs to fix.  Other than that we loved these - stayed clipped in the hair and were very pretty.  The only thing is I wish they had an on and off switch.  Instead they have one of those little plastic tabs that you pull out to start the light.  If you want to turn it off again be sure to save the plastic tab - you can put it again later and turn it off for storage.  Wore it for about 4 hours and battery was still going fine.</li>
            <li> I got these to bedazzle my hair on &amp;#34;crazy hair day&amp;#34; at school. My students love crazy hair day. They can&#x27;t wait to see what I will do next. I put my hair in 5 buns going down the middle of my head (like a mohawk) and had the glowbys sticking out the center. It all looked great...as long as the lights were OUT. You could barely tell they lit up with any light in the room. I was a little disappointed but still made a statement never-the-less.</li>
            <li> We bought these for our 4-year old.  After going to one of those big arena kid events I decided I would find more cost effective and fun glow items for the next time rather than paying for the overpriced items at the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter had a chance to wear them for the first time when we went to the circus last month.  They were a little tricky to get situated properly in her hair but once we experimented a little they worked out pretty good.  She got many compliments on them and several parents wanted to know where we got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries that came with them lasted throughout the show without any sign of dimming and will probably last for a few more shows.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old loved it so much she had to sleep with it. So far, they&#x27;ve held up and we haven&#x27;t had any issues to date. They are awesome!</li>
            <li> These are very fun, but delicate. Definitely not for a child. I would&#x27;ve liked if there was an on-off switch instead of having to keep the battery compartment open when not in use but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I recommend to anyone who likes light up raving type of stuff.</li>
            <li> Great deal and pretty lights. They worked for three separate events, each one being 4-8 hours. (They stopped working for the battery, not because the actual product is dead... if I replace the battery it&#x27;ll keep going again.) Definitely worth it... I followed one of the suggested wears and clipped the top then braided the strands in and I got compliments all night. I forgot they were in my hair since they weren&#x27;t flopping all over my face, so the &amp;#34;OOOOOO! I LOVE your hair!&amp;#34; comments threw me off guard.</li>
            <li> not as advertised.  says set of 4 colors.  got 4 but in one color.</li>
            <li> This was a huge hit with the little girl I got it for.  She put it in her hair and it worked great.  Really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was NOT Glowbys, this was a knock off product. Why scour Amazon for the best deal on a specific item just to end up getting what you DIDN&#x27;T want?!</li>
            <li> They light up.  They held my nieces hair nicely.  While I have not used them myself, my nieces loved em and that made me happy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use on New Year&#x27;s Eve @ Sea World Orlando.  It was a great hit with my teenage granddaughter as well as her mother and aunt. I was so happy that the girls had this barrette in their hair once it got dark...when the crowds it was easy to spot them. It was easy to use and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very nice. My granddaughter loves them. Can&#x27;t beat the price either</li>
            <li> Great sleepover fun for kids birthday party.  Decent price, &amp; they lasted thru the weekend for more fun.  Very bright lighting.</li>
            <li> my granddaughters loved them</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised - did not use for hair, used on a Christmas tree</li>
            <li> They look neat bu the strands fall out easily.  My carpet was full of plastic strands after the kids got done playing with it.</li>
            <li> The clip is the brightest part. and just white light... not sure where the rainbow is supposed to some from. Do not recommed.</li>
            <li> These things are just o.k.  I guess you get what you pay for...  It would have been nice to know there were other colors too.</li>
            <li> Only 4 out of 8 worked, they either were not functional or the strands fell out immediately when taken out of the package.  A few were made properly and worked well all night.  The barrette is huge and is hard to hide under your hair.</li>
            <li> LAST OVER 6 HOURS AND STILL GOING. MY GF WAS GETTING STOPPED BY EVERYONE AT OUR NEW YEARS PARTY. THESE ARE REALLY FUN.</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters LOVE these are excited to wear them with their friends to middle school dances and sleep-overs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are two issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--VERY cheaply made.  You have to be really careful not to break the barrette part and/or lose the tiny little metal piece that makes it so the clip will close.  Also, you have to be careful when turning these off and on as the way to do that is to slide open the battery compartment.  It slides over so far that either the battery slips out and/or the batter cover comes off.  So you have to keep track of these little pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--I ordered these thinking I would get several different colors.  Nope.  All are blue.  The blue looks great….but certainly not what was advertised.</li>
            <li> Loved the glow lights but the barrette part left the batteries showing (not pretty).  They should have had a little bow, flower or something to hide the batteries.  I glued on some little decals.</li>
            <li> Cute accessory for nighttime events, like Disneyland.  These will look great after dark in the park and they don&#x27;t cost a small fortune like the ones the park sells.</li>
            <li> Loved these, i had them in my hair all night &amp; it was fun &amp; festive.  I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughters and they loved them when we went to the Renaissance Festival especially after it got dark!</li>
            <li> Will be good for Halloween and trick o&#x27; treating.  Extra special for the princess to decorate her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also helps to see the kids in the dark!</li>
            <li> They light up well and look great at night, but the barrettes do not hold well and the fiber optic part falls out of the light/barrette easily.  Had to try and glue them back together, then finally just gave up.</li>
            <li> It is really neat and lights up just like the item described. Only thing I would change is how big the clip is in your hair. You can still see through the hair and see the clip and it is kind of heavy. Other than that I loved wearing them! They were so much fun on new years! :)</li>
            <li> Picture shows a white clip, they are black!!! The colors shown in the picture is not what I received. I was sent 4 of the same color. Also, they do not change color or flash, just steady blueish purple. As one other person said, unless you have an abundance of hair, you will not be able to hide the clip which is hard to fasten. Once they are in your hair, they are very fun. Needless to say, will not order anything from this person again!!!!!</li>
            <li> these were a great hit at our music in the park and they lasted and are still going strong. I would recommend them to anyone for a party or 4th of july.</li>
            <li> Great seller customer service. Good price. Good product</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I found Glowbys were the best product. When I received my order it was not Glowbys, but Flash Braid. It came apart upon opening.</li>
            <li> I got this for my weddign party. Every female (kids and adults alike) LOVED them. They are bright and look great on the hair. Everyone used them differently up/down/sided but all looked AWESOME!!!! They last long. You can turn it on and off and make them last longer. My guests used them the following days during day and night!. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These were supposed to be multi-colored and all 4 packages were blue.  It specifically stated a package of 4 multi-colored, but every package was blue.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set of 4 glowbys rainbow colored fiber optic hair barrettes. I recieved a poorly made knock off product and the wrong color. The fiber optic strands fell out of the barrett and I ordered rainbow colored and all of them are green. I&#x27;m not going to send them back because they are gifts I need now. I guess we will use them on New Years and St. Patty&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> I hate having to write theseI hate having to write theseI hate having to write theseI hate having to write these</li>
            <li> Super cute &amp; very unique! Seller ships fast &amp; very helpful as well. Definitely recommend them to anyone who wants something unique for their light up outfit. Will definitely use again!</li>
            <li> this was an easy hair piece to use and the kids loved the colors changing. loved it. a great hit at the birthday party</li>
            <li> Very cute.  Battery housing and switch take a little creativity to conceal but once done it is a great effect.</li>
            <li> Used these while camping for the children.  A little evening fun.</li>
            <li> This was fun and everyone liked at xmas but the clip was really large so they really just became a table novelty for everyone to look at once in a while.  My nieces are young with thin blond hair so the clip just stood out and looked silly.</li>
            <li> The seller&#x27;s description that the barrette is \\&quot;thin\\&quot; and can be worn \\&quot;under the hair so that only the lights are visible\\&quot; is a farce.  While the barrette is small in shape, it has a significant thickness to it, and any attempt to hide it in medium thickness hair continually resulted in the barrette being clearly visible.  Those with straight or fine hair will most certainly find the product disappointing.  In addition, the barrette lights up very bright - much, much brighter than the fiber optic strands, further detracting from the point of this item, which is the fiber optic strands. So now you have this bright flashing object blinking on your head like you&#x27;re some kind of traffic light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought several of these items as stocking stuffers.  The first one out of the package needed fiddling with in order to get it to function at all.  The design is such that the batteries are too loose in the barrette enclosure and thus they do not make good contact with the electrical contacts.  A couple hours later, it once again stopped functioning, and I had to take the whole thing apart to adjust the contacts so that they would continuously transmit the batteries&#x27; electricity.  In doing so, the tiny little tabs that hold the cover in place broke off. Yes, I was as careful and gentle as I could be, but the plastic tabs are so tiny, any kind of pressure will obviously cause them to break, which they did do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not inquired as to the remainder of the ones I bought that I gave away to others&#x27; children, so I can&#x27;t honestly say that EVERY one had the same design/manufacturing flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, it&#x27;s a cheap little gift, and as long as you don&#x27;t have high expectations for it (or expect the description to be accurate), have the patience to fiddle with thing (and have some glue or tape on standby) it can be a fun while it lasts.</li>
            <li> These seem like great extensions. They have a clear housing containing the batteries and lights. The housing has a black clip to attach to your hair or wig. There is an on/off switch. The lighting does a slow fade across several colors and then a quick strobe flash through the colors.</li>
            <li> These seemed like a good idea for party favors for the girls at a glow-in-the-dark dance party for 3rd graders.  They were bent when they arrived and never would straighten out.  So, they did not flow well with hair.  The top with the battery compartment was chunky.  Overall, it was a fail.  Not nearly as lovely as the product photos would lead you to believe.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> These glowbys are so much fun. They look great in long hair and were just what I needed to keep track of my kid in the dark while she wandered around on Halloween. The price was the best and the product is really well made.</li>
            <li> First of all, these are not \\&quot;Glowbys\\&quot; brand, but they are about the same quality. It just irks me when things are falsely advertised. Secondly, they only have a flashing mode- not a solid light like the others I own. I do like that they have an on/off switch, so I can turn them off without taking them out of my hair. Glowbys brand light up when the clip is fastened and don&#x27;t have an off switch.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set of 4 hair clips with these lights. They were just right! I can style them into my hair and they look great. I would recomend at least 2 sets if you want them to look ballanced on your head.</li>
            <li> I ordered with my Amazon prime two day shipping for my daughters crazy hair day and while I did receive them in two days, I got the completely wrong color.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the rainbow color and instead got all Blue!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too late to return them bc I need to use them tomorrow, but I wish they would read the color they sold so they can send out the right ones!!!</li>
            <li> The pros- They are super bright.&lt;br /&gt;The cons- The second I pulled 1 out of the package 9 strands came out. All of the packages are marked as BLUE so clearly not rainbow, but they will serve their purpose. I am waiting to take the others out of the package so I don&#x27;t lose a bunch of strands. And as long as I get a few uses out of them they&#x27;ll be worth the price. But I&#x27;m a unicorn and would have preferred rainbow.</li>
            <li> It is a fun product, however the clip to attach to your hair is not a secure clip.  You can only fit a small amount of hair in it, and even then it wants to pop open. It is for my daughter, ( age 3 ) for trick or treat night.  So if you aren&#x27;t the jumping up and down, running every which way kind of gal you may not have any problems.  It does look nice in the dark, so just be aware of it not staying too secure in your hair.</li>
            <li> Got my product within 5 days! :) and all work properly! Very happy with it. Only regret is not getting more since very affordable and fun!</li>
            <li> I thought they were a silly purchase.  She bought them for a night 5k.  But darn if they didn&#x27;t make her even better looking!  They worked well and were really pretty cool</li>
