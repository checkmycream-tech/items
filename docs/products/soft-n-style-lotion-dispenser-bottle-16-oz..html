            <li>These are great for lotion, hand soap, shampoo, bath wash, etc.</li>
            <li>It works great and looks great.  </li>
            <li>I wish it worked because it is very nice looking.</li>
            <li>Good buy and easier than trudging through Walmart to find one.</li>
            <li>This plastic bottle is good for liquid hand washing soap.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a good dispenser.  </li>
            <li>Good size</li>
            <li>This bottle is a good size, and I use it for liquid soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a good experience with this bottle, but I haven&#x27;t been using is for lotion as the name suggests.</li>
            <li>It was in a good condition when I received it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love it!  </li>
            <li>, they look nice on the counter.  </li>
            <li>I realized I could get my own pumps and refill with whatever product I wanted</li>
            <li>This holds it well, doesn&#x27;t leak or let in water and is nice looking.</li>
            <li>Nice bottle, but I was dissapointed when the pump didnt work.</li>
            <li>We have been on a quest to find the perfect soap dispenser, and after many purchases this one is very close.  </li>
            <li>I was waiting to see how I liked it before I purchased more</li>
            <li>Looks great and works very well!</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, clear, easy to clean,and the pump has an excellent spring that does not stick.  </li>
            <li>Maybe better packaging should be utilized.  </li>
            <li>I need to buy a dozen more of these... too many uses to list.  </li>
            <li>The way the tube sits in the bottle (curved) works well too, because you get more of the soap</li>
            <li>Excellent price and solid construction.</li>
            <li>Pump dispenses appropriate amount and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Plan</li>
            <li>to order more.  </li>
            <li>(I thought it looked kind of cheap on the picture).</li>
            <li>it works great because i don&#x27;t have to work to squeeze the lotion out of a bottle while getting him ready for bed.</li>
            <li>I use them for creams, lotions, hair gels, hand sanitizers, anti bacterial soaps, baby soaps and shampooes,etc....whatever I need and they never leak or clog up like most bottles do.  </li>
            <li>We love it.  </li>
            <li>and gee do I wish I had bought more.  </li>
            <li>Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>So much more convenient than the original</li>
            <li>We love our original and are still using it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to see when you need to refill.</li>
            <li>It is easy to get out the amount you need without having to pick up the bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now 2014 and the bottle&#x27;s been going strong.  </li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re dispensing body wash, it&#x27;s more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>Somewhat cheap plastic</li>
            <li>great for kid&#x27;s shampoo, so they do not use up the entire bottle at once.</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>It does the job but the quality is extremely cheap and feels like the plastic could just crack.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>The pump is smooth, it doesn&#x27;t jam</li>
            <li>This was an add-on so the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>And once I poured in the dish soap, it actually looked kind of nice.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off going to bed bath and beyond - they have decently priced bottles of much better quality.</li>
            <li>We originally purchased this 8/30/2013.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t tip like original bottles for Jergens Liquid Soap.</li>
            <li>and if I ever see them closer to what I paid for the first one I&#x27;ll buy a dozen or more.  </li>
            <li>The reason why I got these wa so that I won&#x27;t have to constaly clean my bottles of hair and skin oils</li>
            <li>I have more control over how much lotion I pump at once than I did with the lotion&#x27;s original bottle.</li>
            <li>These bottles are good because the only thing I have to clean is the pump.</li>
            <li>Also, I didnt always get a full pump of product, and constanlty had to unscrew the lid, stir around the product and repump, to even get 1/2 a pump of product.  </li>
            <li>(nice, since I like to use natural and products).</li>
            <li>Great little pump for my 7 year old to dispense his own shampoo from.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cheap I have to say.</li>
            <li>Very durable and so easy to see when it needs to be refilled.</li>
            <li>I love using natural oils.</li>
            <li>Great once I got it filled and the flexible tube is long enough to reach the side at the bottom.</li>
            <li>just right so the stream of soap doesn&#x27;t soar into the air and leave a blob somewhere</li>
            <li>I wanted to create my own facial cleaner and this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The last two were attractive dispensers, one a very pretty color blue</li>
            <li>I poured they shampoo into this &amp; it makes it easy to pump the shampoo onto a soft cloth.</li>
            <li>They are not thick and durable like our original one.</li>
            <li>While shopping at Whole Foods, we noticed that they are being used by manufacturers to sell their shampoos/lotions etc too!  </li>
            <li>so it suctions pretty well without getting &#x27;leftovers&#x27; on the bottom.</li>
            <li>It makes dispensing and using the oil so much easier!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few soap dispensers, and have not had good luck with them  </li>
            <li>I also like that the dispenser is low profile, and still holds a lot so it will not tip over easily.  </li>
            <li>The plastic bottle and pump are strong enough that nothing has cracked after falling 3 feet onto a tile floor.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re large</li>
            <li>I buy Dial antibacterial hand soap in large eco-friendly refill bags ([[ASIN:B00289C338 Dial Eco-Smart Pomegranate &amp; Tangerine Antibacterial Moisturizer Hand Soap Refill]]) and pour it into this dispenser, using it as a soap dispenser in my home bathroom.</li>
            <li>This dispenser isn&#x27;t fancy nor is it opaque, but it certainly gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I buy bath gel in large quantities and needed a dispenser to put in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I purchased to get a certain width.</li>
            <li>Bottle gets hard to pump after a while, but it&#x27;s a good bottle.</li>
            <li>These bottles work very well.  </li>
            <li>Because it is sold by another seller and not Amazon, I cannot get a replacement, only return it for refund, however the cost to ship it back is more than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>We highly recommend this bottle!</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price</li>
            <li>I can get it on straight.  </li>
            <li>The girls at the party were supposed create their own smaller bottles of lotion (by layering different colors/scents).</li>
            <li>And now it&#x27;s so much more comfortable/convenient when I have a dish in one hand, the sponge in the other, and</li>
            <li>back side- right out of the box!  </li>
            <li>I just have to make sure I take my time and hold the threaded areas straight and tight as I screw the pump on.  </li>
            <li>My 2 previous dispensers rusted so hopefully this will hold up better.  </li>
            <li>I use the first one for shampoo in the shower because I can only use one hand and using a pump bottle makes shampooing my hair so much easier</li>
            <li>I love this bottle and have several other areas where I could use one to make my life a little easier but for now since I don&#x27;t have a pressing need I&#x27;ll wait for a better price.</li>
            <li>We use this to store our SPF since we live in sunny San Diego and you have to apply SPF every day before you go out.  </li>
            <li>in our new bathroom and powder room.</li>
            <li>The one before that was also attractive a plain amber glass with a dispenser made metal with a plastic plunger, it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Well the pump itself is complete junk!</li>
            <li>Bottle arrived slightly damaged, but it doesn&#x27;t show when filled with soap.</li>
            <li>He likes to take his showers on his own and this helps him control how much he uses and less mess.</li>
            <li>They were able to shower themselves with one exception: they had a hard time getting shampoo, conditioner and body wash out of containers.</li>
            <li>I do like that this bottle is clear and see-through.</li>
            <li>Because I tend to buy in bulk, I need clear containers to store products on counters, shelving, etc...</li>
            <li>Back to the drawing board for me because what I was really looking for was a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s worked well for us.  </li>
            <li>B000VDAE4I Soft &#x27;N Style Lotion Dispenser Bottle 16 oz.]]</li>
            <li>Works so far.  </li>
            <li>so you can control just how far it reaches.</li>
            <li>Soft &#x27;N Style makes they&#x27;re well made</li>
            <li>, it works, I guess my life is complete now.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>We use this 16 ounce Soft &#x27;N Style Dispenser Bottle with Dawn</li>
            <li>For the price I thought these wouldn&#x27;t last long, but actually they are working fine after months of every day use.</li>
            <li>If it was not for that, it looks decent enough.  </li>
            <li>I needed something this size so they fit in my small gym locker</li>
            <li>The other bottle is okay, very thin plastic with a cheap pump.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re clear and simple</li>
            <li>My eye doctor told me to wash my eye lashes &amp; eye lids with a soft cloth and baby shampoo daily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Revised 11/1/13 - I ordered 3 more of these bottles, but one arrived with a broken pump - it functions, but the pump nozzle is snapped off.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but disappointing policy.</li>
            <li>It was pretty much a nightmare trying to help 10 first graders simultaneously since they couldn&#x27;t merely pump the lotion out.</li>
            <li>It has a large dispensing tube for thicker soaps which is what I was looking for, hopefully it lasts longer than other dispensers I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>like the clear bottle, as you can see how much fluid is left.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s clear and you can see when it is getting empty.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> just right so the stream of soap doesn&#x27;t soar into the air and leave a blob somewhere</li>
            <li> I wanted to create my own facial cleaner and this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The last two were attractive dispensers, one a very pretty color blue</li>
            <li> I poured they shampoo into this &amp; it makes it easy to pump the shampoo onto a soft cloth.</li>
            <li> They are not thick and durable like our original one.</li>
            <li> While shopping at Whole Foods, we noticed that they are being used by manufacturers to sell their shampoos/lotions etc too!  </li>
            <li> so it suctions pretty well without getting &#x27;leftovers&#x27; on the bottom.</li>
            <li> It makes dispensing and using the oil so much easier!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few soap dispensers, and have not had good luck with them  </li>
            <li> I also like that the dispenser is low profile, and still holds a lot so it will not tip over easily.  </li>
            <li> The plastic bottle and pump are strong enough that nothing has cracked after falling 3 feet onto a tile floor.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re large</li>
            <li> I buy Dial antibacterial hand soap in large eco-friendly refill bags ([[ASIN:B00289C338 Dial Eco-Smart Pomegranate &amp; Tangerine Antibacterial Moisturizer Hand Soap Refill]]) and pour it into this dispenser, using it as a soap dispenser in my home bathroom.</li>
            <li> This dispenser isn&#x27;t fancy nor is it opaque, but it certainly gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I buy bath gel in large quantities and needed a dispenser to put in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I purchased to get a certain width.</li>
            <li> Bottle gets hard to pump after a while, but it&#x27;s a good bottle.</li>
            <li> These bottles work very well.  </li>
            <li> Because it is sold by another seller and not Amazon, I cannot get a replacement, only return it for refund, however the cost to ship it back is more than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> We highly recommend this bottle!</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price</li>
            <li> I can get it on straight.  </li>
            <li> The girls at the party were supposed create their own smaller bottles of lotion (by layering different colors/scents).</li>
            <li> And now it&#x27;s so much more comfortable/convenient when I have a dish in one hand, the sponge in the other, and</li>
            <li> back side- right out of the box!  </li>
            <li> I just have to make sure I take my time and hold the threaded areas straight and tight as I screw the pump on.  </li>
            <li> My 2 previous dispensers rusted so hopefully this will hold up better.  </li>
            <li> I use the first one for shampoo in the shower because I can only use one hand and using a pump bottle makes shampooing my hair so much easier</li>
            <li> I love this bottle and have several other areas where I could use one to make my life a little easier but for now since I don&#x27;t have a pressing need I&#x27;ll wait for a better price.</li>
            <li> We use this to store our SPF since we live in sunny San Diego and you have to apply SPF every day before you go out.  </li>
            <li> in our new bathroom and powder room.</li>
            <li> The one before that was also attractive a plain amber glass with a dispenser made metal with a plastic plunger, it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Well the pump itself is complete junk!</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived slightly damaged, but it doesn&#x27;t show when filled with soap.</li>
            <li> He likes to take his showers on his own and this helps him control how much he uses and less mess.</li>
            <li> They were able to shower themselves with one exception: they had a hard time getting shampoo, conditioner and body wash out of containers.</li>
            <li> I do like that this bottle is clear and see-through.</li>
            <li> Because I tend to buy in bulk, I need clear containers to store products on counters, shelving, etc...</li>
            <li> Back to the drawing board for me because what I was really looking for was a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s worked well for us.  </li>
            <li> B000VDAE4I Soft &#x27;N Style Lotion Dispenser Bottle 16 oz.]]</li>
            <li> Works so far.  </li>
            <li> so you can control just how far it reaches.</li>
            <li> Soft &#x27;N Style makes they&#x27;re well made</li>
            <li> , it works, I guess my life is complete now.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> We use this 16 ounce Soft &#x27;N Style Dispenser Bottle with Dawn</li>
            <li> For the price I thought these wouldn&#x27;t last long, but actually they are working fine after months of every day use.</li>
            <li> If it was not for that, it looks decent enough.  </li>
            <li> I needed something this size so they fit in my small gym locker</li>
            <li> The other bottle is okay, very thin plastic with a cheap pump.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re clear and simple</li>
            <li> My eye doctor told me to wash my eye lashes &amp; eye lids with a soft cloth and baby shampoo daily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Revised 11/1/13 - I ordered 3 more of these bottles, but one arrived with a broken pump - it functions, but the pump nozzle is snapped off.  </li>
            <li> Good product, but disappointing policy.</li>
            <li> It was pretty much a nightmare trying to help 10 first graders simultaneously since they couldn&#x27;t merely pump the lotion out.</li>
            <li> It has a large dispensing tube for thicker soaps which is what I was looking for, hopefully it lasts longer than other dispensers I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> like the clear bottle, as you can see how much fluid is left.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s clear and you can see when it is getting empty.  </li>
            <li> The long tube, that is also slanted near the bottom, does make it a little harder to screw the pump on straight but even with using just one hand</li>
            <li> Main drawback is that occasional drips of soap land on the bottle and look messy.</li>
            <li> the tube on the pump is actually bent and is long enough to reach the rim on the bottom</li>
            <li> very lightweight, not sure it will hold up</li>
            <li> Will have to see how long it will last for.</li>
            <li> We only bought the single bottle then.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve spent tons of money on fancy and basic soap dispensers for the kitchen.</li>
            <li> the soap came out of the dispenser the same color blue as the dispenser, instead of the white soap that poured in the dispenser, I decided not to use the other dispenser it was black.</li>
            <li> I remember reading other reviews that had the same issue.  </li>
            <li> I have an eye problem that causes my eyes to have dry flaky skin at my lash line.  </li>
            <li> We are a family of 4, all using a single bathroom.</li>
            <li> The next time you push the plunger, the soap squeezes its way out and may spray up down or sideways.</li>
            <li> Maybe the pump could have been a little bigger</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would look cheap</li>
            <li> With its wide bottom this puppy isn&#x27;t going to fall over or be unstable at all.</li>
            <li> These bottles were just what I expected, the quality is acceptable for my intended use (shampoo and conditioner) and the pump is efficient.  </li>
            <li> I expect it to last since the bottle is thick enough and</li>
            <li> It is also cheaper than any other model we have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I like the large, stable base but the pump shoots the soap straight out.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding alternate options on Amazon</li>
            <li> /&gt;I had a hard time to open up a screw-on lid but over all I like this bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot of pressure to push down.</li>
            <li> ....the pump mechanism stopped working in less than a week.</li>
            <li> This area of the pump lever has a thin cross section.  </li>
            <li> I like that the tube goes firmly into the bottom corner of the bottle to dispense</li>
            <li> Use it daily for my body wash, because the container it came in had a broken pump.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Green</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these bottles and one is defective and has a round bottom.</li>
            <li> so it does not fit the area in my car.</li>
            <li> No more waste or mess!</li>
            <li> Put some massage oil in them, and no more dropped bottles.</li>
            <li> These did the job, but now I&#x27;m looking at the stuff at the bottom, and it&#x27;s really hard to use it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I like the large base to hold soap as I wouldn&#x27;t have to fill it all the time.</li>
            <li> Handles the thick SPF</li>
            <li> Works well with thick liquids (shampoo, soaps) and</li>
            <li> i got tired of fighting with the bottles in the shower when i&#x27;m running late for work.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for 1 week now and the pump will hardly pump and keeps getting stuck all the time!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste any money on this!!!</li>
            <li> Not cheap crap like the dollar store pump bottles.</li>
            <li> This is what I was afraid of - broken pump lever on</li>
            <li> All in all, I was not impressed with how these worked.</li>
            <li> All failed: stop dispensing, rusted, fell apart, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dispenser bottle with a pump, it works, it hasn&#x27;t failed</li>
            <li> how can one go wrong!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it with hand soap refills. I like the large, stable base but the pump shoots the soap straight out.</li>
            <li> Great little pump for my 7 year old to dispense his own shampoo from.  He likes to take his showers on his own and this helps him control how much he uses and less mess.</li>
            <li> We use this to store our SPF since we live in sunny San Diego and you have to apply SPF every day before you go out.  Handles the thick SPF just fine and it&#x27;s easy to see when you need to refill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bottle and it works. Somewhat cheap plastic but seems to hold up. Good buy and easier than trudging through Walmart to find one.</li>
            <li> Works great. Not cheap crap like the dollar store pump bottles.</li>
            <li> great for kid&#x27;s shampoo, so they do not use up the entire bottle at once. and it keeps the water out of the shampoo too.</li>
            <li> It works as described and is sturdy.</li>
            <li> This plastic bottle is good for liquid hand washing soap. It is easy to get out the amount you need without having to pick up the bottle. There is no writing or label on the container, so it is attractive.</li>
            <li> It is very simple, and just works. I use it for shower jell. So much more convenient than the original bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the clear bottle, as you can see how much fluid is left.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a good dispenser.  It didn&#x27;t turn out to be what I thought I was ordering, but that was my fault, not yours.  I will have no problem finding a use for it.  Thank you for getting it to me in a timely fashion.  Your service is great.  Back to the drawing board for me because what I was really looking for was a spray bottle.  I do like that this bottle is clear and see-through.</li>
            <li> This is what I was afraid of - broken pump lever on back side- right out of the box!  I remember reading other reviews that had the same issue.  Maybe better packaging should be utilized.  This area of the pump lever has a thin cross section.  If it was not for that, it looks decent enough.  I would not recommend buying!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had it a couple days but it&#x27;s great.  While shopping at Whole Foods, we noticed that they are being used by manufacturers to sell their shampoos/lotions etc too!  We will update the review if it breaks of course.  Update 1/6/2014 We originally purchased this 8/30/2013.  It&#x27;s now 2014 and the bottle&#x27;s been going strong.  We love it!  Update 8/1/2015 We love our original and are still using it. We only bought the single bottle then. This time we purchased the three pack and these are NOT the same. They are not thick and durable like our original one. The pump is opaque rather than white. The pump spring feels like it&#x27;s going to break. We will use these and if they suck we are shipping them back and ordering the singles which are more expensive. Again, these are also from a different seller!</li>
            <li> I need to buy a dozen more of these... too many uses to list.  With its wide bottom this puppy isn&#x27;t going to fall over or be unstable at all.</li>
            <li> My 2 previous dispensers rusted so hopefully this will hold up better.  So far it&#x27;s worked well for us.  Good size</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I like the large base to hold soap as I wouldn&#x27;t have to fill it all the time. Well the pump itself is complete junk! I have had this product for 1 week now and the pump will hardly pump and keeps getting stuck all the time! I wouldn&#x27;t waste any money on this!!!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. The dispenser is a bit short so the soap sometimes gets on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Pump works great.  Put some massage oil in them, and no more dropped bottles.</li>
            <li> This bottle is a good size, and I use it for liquid soap. The problem is, after use, some of the soap clings to the spout and dries there. The next time you push the plunger, the soap squeezes its way out and may spray up down or sideways. You have to cup your hand over the spout just right so the stream of soap doesn&#x27;t soar into the air and leave a blob somewhere you&#x27;d rather not have it land.</li>
            <li> These bottles work very well.  They&#x27;re large so you don&#x27;t have to refill as often.  The nozzle doesn&#x27;t get clogged like the dispensers you get from the store made of metal/glass.  They&#x27;re clear and simple, they look nice on the counter.  The way the tube sits in the bottle (curved) works well too, because you get more of the soap out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use these bottles as a container to store additional shampoo and wanted to use it with a pump.  However (and this does show in the picutre) the tube connected to the pump is at an angle, and it doesn&#x27;t allow you to pump any product that is in the last 1/4 of the bottle.  Also, I didnt always get a full pump of product, and constanlty had to unscrew the lid, stir around the product and repump, to even get 1/2 a pump of product.  All in all, I was not impressed with how these worked.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and solid construction. As pictured; attractive. If you don&#x27;t already put your shampoo in a pump bottle, try it and prepare to have your morning rocked.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived slightly damaged, but it doesn&#x27;t show when filled with soap. The bottle is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t tip like original bottles for Jergens Liquid Soap. Main drawback is that occasional drips of soap land on the bottle and look messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a good experience with this bottle, but I haven&#x27;t been using is for lotion as the name suggests. I buy Dial antibacterial hand soap in large eco-friendly refill bags ([[ASIN:B00289C338 Dial Eco-Smart Pomegranate &amp; Tangerine Antibacterial Moisturizer Hand Soap Refill]]) and pour it into this dispenser, using it as a soap dispenser in my home bathroom. I&#x27;ve been doing this since July of last year (so 7 months now) and I&#x27;ve not had any problems with the bottle. We are a family of 4, all using a single bathroom. So the bottle sees a lot of use. But it&#x27;s never clogged or leaked or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how will it does or doesn&#x27;t work for lotion, but it works great with liquid Dial soap!</li>
            <li> These bottles were just what I expected, the quality is acceptable for my intended use (shampoo and conditioner) and the pump is efficient.  I like that the tube goes firmly into the bottom corner of the bottle to dispense the last bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised 11/1/13 - I ordered 3 more of these bottles, but one arrived with a broken pump - it functions, but the pump nozzle is snapped off.  Because it is sold by another seller and not Amazon, I cannot get a replacement, only return it for refund, however the cost to ship it back is more than it&#x27;s worth.  Good product, but disappointing policy.</li>
            <li> It has a large dispensing tube for thicker soaps which is what I was looking for, hopefully it lasts longer than other dispensers I have purchased.  I also like that the dispenser is low profile, and still holds a lot so it will not tip over easily.  I have tried a few soap dispensers, and have not had good luck with them  The last two were attractive dispensers, one a very pretty color blue I had decided to use in my master bathroom, when I tried to wash my hands the next morning the soap came out of the dispenser the same color blue as the dispenser, instead of the white soap that poured in the dispenser, I decided not to use the other dispenser it was black. The one before that was also attractive a plain amber glass with a dispenser made metal with a plastic plunger, it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Probably would be a 5 Star with a thinner soap. Great once I got it filled and the flexible tube is long enough to reach the side at the bottom. Tilt and Tap for close to the last drop.[[ASIN:B000VDAE4I Soft &#x27;N Style Lotion Dispenser Bottle 16 oz.]]</li>
            <li> My sister and I share a bathroom and, since we both use different types of hand cream, I purchased this for her use. Very durable and so easy to see when it needs to be refilled. We highly recommend this bottle!</li>
            <li> This is a great bottle I use it for my homemade shampoo and it works just as it should!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using two of these for shampoo and body soap at the gym and they work well.  I needed something this size so they fit in my small gym locker and I could refill them.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive pump bottle, works great. Have had no issues with it. Use it daily for my body wash, because the container it came in had a broken pump.</li>
            <li> Works so far.  Cheap.  Plastic.</li>
            <li> I use this to dispense food-grade coconut oil that we use as moisturizer.  The plastic bottle and pump are strong enough that nothing has cracked after falling 3 feet onto a tile floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to encourage independence in my 8-year olds. They were able to shower themselves with one exception: they had a hard time getting shampoo, conditioner and body wash out of containers. I had then found a shampoo that came with a pump that made life easier, but then the company stopped using a pump. I realized I could get my own pumps and refill with whatever product I wanted (nice, since I like to use natural and products). These are stout, so they are not so tippy, and hold enough product that you&#x27;re not constantly refilling, but not so much that it is too heavy or bulky. I labeled the containers with sharpie and that hasn&#x27;t run off in the shower. Needless to say, my kids love that they don&#x27;t need me to help them with showering anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought these when I broke my arm, and needed a dispenser for my shampoo and conditioner that I could use one handed in my shower.  These did the job, but now I&#x27;m looking at the stuff at the bottom, and it&#x27;s really hard to use it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would work well if you were going to refill over and over with the same stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this dispenser for hand lotion at my desk at work.  Works great with Vaseline Body Lotion.  Dispenser head locks with a simple quarter turn for spill-free transportation.</li>
            <li> I love using natural oils. The reason why I got these wa so that I won&#x27;t have to constaly clean my bottles of hair and skin oils everytime I jave to touch them. These bottles are good because the only thing I have to clean is the pump.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve spent tons of money on fancy and basic soap dispensers for the kitchen. All failed: stop dispensing, rusted, fell apart, etc. This dispenser isn&#x27;t fancy nor is it opaque, but it certainly gets the job done. I expect it to last since the bottle is thick enough and given the price how can one go wrong!  We were so impressed we immediately bought the six pack.</li>
            <li> Excellent pump- we use ours in the shower for baby shampoo (which is, you should know, the very best makeup remover around). This holds it well, doesn&#x27;t leak or let in water and is nice looking. Doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> I will be using this bottle to put my homemade flax seed gel in.  It will be perfect for dispensing the product</li>
            <li> It does the job but the quality is extremely cheap and feels like the plastic could just crack. Will have to see how long it will last for.</li>
            <li> Cheap but it does it&#x27;s job perfectly. I&#x27;ve been using two of these for almost a year and have had no problem like others have mentioned. Works well with thick liquids (shampoo, soaps) and the tube on the pump is actually bent and is long enough to reach the rim on the bottom so it suctions pretty well without getting &#x27;leftovers&#x27; on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Works. No build up using a 1:3 dilution of liquid Dr Bronners soap and water.</li>
            <li> I put my Jojoba oil in this dispenser. It makes dispensing and using the oil so much easier! No more waste or mess!</li>
            <li> I have more control over how much lotion I pump at once than I did with the lotion&#x27;s original bottle. The &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; that draws the lotion (or whatever you put in there) is taller than the bottle and has to be cut- so you can control just how far it reaches. It&#x27;s sturdy and came well packaged.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle, but I was dissapointed when the pump didnt work. Otherwise, i would had given this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I buy bath gel in large quantities and needed a dispenser to put in the shower.  For the price I thought these wouldn&#x27;t last long, but actually they are working fine after months of every day use.</li>
            <li> Design was great and 16 oz was the size I needed. The pump is smooth, it doesn&#x27;t jam and you don&#x27;t have to apply a lot of pressure to push down. I use this to store liquid glucosamine supplements for my dogs. It works very well. There are no leaks either. For $4 and prime shipping this was a great deal.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect. i bought it to hold my body wash. i got tired of fighting with the bottles in the shower when i&#x27;m running late for work. i like everything Soft &#x27;N Style makes they&#x27;re well made</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this dispenser. I purchased a total of 8 (a set of 6 and 2 additional). I made 4 different types of lotion for my now 7-year-old&#x27;s birthday party. The girls at the party were supposed create their own smaller bottles of lotion (by layering different colors/scents). Well, none of the pumps worked as they should. It was pretty much a nightmare trying to help 10 first graders simultaneously since they couldn&#x27;t merely pump the lotion out.</li>
            <li> It works great to use for shampoo.  Pump dispenses appropriate amount and works well.&lt;br /&gt;Plan to order more.  Good price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought it for dish soap. I was afraid it would look cheap (I thought it looked kind of cheap on the picture). And once I poured in the dish soap, it actually looked kind of nice. And now it&#x27;s so much more comfortable/convenient when I have a dish in one hand, the sponge in the other, and I need another squeeze of soap.</li>
            <li> I use this for lotion for my baby&#x27;s nighttime massage. it works great because i don&#x27;t have to work to squeeze the lotion out of a bottle while getting him ready for bed.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap I have to say. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but this is a very low end bottle. I had a hard time finding alternate options on Amazon so I went with this one. It will do whatever you&#x27;re buying it for, I just don&#x27;t think it displays well.</li>
            <li> Because I tend to buy in bulk, I need clear containers to store products on counters, shelving, etc... These bottles are just awesome.  I use them for creams, lotions, hair gels, hand sanitizers, anti bacterial soaps, baby soaps and shampooes,etc....whatever I need and they never leak or clog up like most bottles do.  They also hold quite a bit reducing the frequency to refill, yet compact enough not to clutter up space in your area.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> It was in a good condition when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time to open up a screw-on lid but over all I like this bottle and I use it for my hand made lotion.</li>
            <li> We have been on a quest to find the perfect soap dispenser, and after many purchases this one is very close.  It is lightweight, clear, easy to clean,and the pump has an excellent spring that does not stick.  It is also cheaper than any other model we have purchased.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> very lightweight, not sure it will hold up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dispenser bottle with a pump, it works, it hasn&#x27;t failed, what else is there to say?  Maybe the pump could have been a little bigger but if you&#x27;re dispensing body wash, it&#x27;s more than adequate.  This is like trying to write a review on how well a pencil works.  I bought it, it works, I guess my life is complete now.  Well sort of.</li>
            <li> These are great for lotion, hand soap, shampoo, bath wash, etc. in our new bathroom and powder room. Looks great and works very well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough for 2 regular size shampoo bottles.</li>
            <li> I wanted to create my own facial cleaner and this was exactly what I was looking for. Perfect Size. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I have an eye problem that causes my eyes to have dry flaky skin at my lash line.  My eye doctor told me to wash my eye lashes &amp; eye lids with a soft cloth and baby shampoo daily.  I have a problem with squeeze bottles.  I poured they shampoo into this &amp; it makes it easy to pump the shampoo onto a soft cloth.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  Pump did not work.</li>
            <li> We use this 16 ounce Soft &#x27;N Style Dispenser Bottle with Dawn \\&quot;Green Apple\\&quot; antibacterial hand soap.  It works great and looks great.  We love it.  What a bargain, at such a low price!</li>
            <li> Bottle gets hard to pump after a while, but it&#x27;s a good bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this from loveotc for $4.15 with $0.00 shipping in August and gee do I wish I had bought more.  Now it is $7.99 as a add-on Prime item.  I was waiting to see how I liked it before I purchased more but with this increase I think I&#x27;ll wait a while and if I ever see them closer to what I paid for the first one I&#x27;ll buy a dozen or more.  I use the first one for shampoo in the shower because I can only use one hand and using a pump bottle makes shampooing my hair so much easier and this is the best pump bottle I have ever used.  Plus it&#x27;s clear and you can see when it is getting empty.  The tube for the pump goes all the way to the bottom so you can get get almost all of the contents out via the pump.  The long tube, that is also slanted near the bottom, does make it a little harder to screw the pump on straight but even with using just one hand I can get it on straight.  I just have to make sure I take my time and hold the threaded areas straight and tight as I screw the pump on.  I love this bottle and have several other areas where I could use one to make my life a little easier but for now since I don&#x27;t have a pressing need I&#x27;ll wait for a better price.</li>
            <li> The pump stopped working so I just gave up. You get what you pay for...you&#x27;re better off going to bed bath and beyond - they have decently priced bottles of much better quality.</li>
            <li> ....the pump mechanism stopped working in less than a week. I bought it to use for liquid shower wash but it seems like it couldn&#x27;t handle the thickness. I wish it worked because it is very nice looking.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these bottles and one is defective and has a round bottom. This was an add-on so the shipping was free. The problem with this is that sending it back would cost about the same as I paid for the bottle, therefore being a wash. If the company paid for shipping, then they would lose. So I decided to just let it go. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle. The other bottle is okay, very thin plastic with a cheap pump.</li>
            <li> I purchased to get a certain width. the one I received is wider than the coffee cup in the picture so it does not fit the area in my car.</li>
