            <li>I use fig when I need more control in humid weather.</li>
            <li>I love  there products</li>
            <li>My stylist uses Paul Mitchell and I was in love with PM and all of his products , until I decided to give WEN a try.</li>
            <li>One of the top ingredients is alcohol but the product is not drying at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just started 2 months ago and really love this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t suds up like shampoo, but makes my hair so nice and soft and smells so good.  </li>
            <li>great product, my hair is manageable soft and not falling anymore</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money .. maybe for occasional use at best</li>
            <li>made a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Wen is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and then when I want it clean</li>
            <li>First off for $32 it is not a very big bottle and using 15 pumps at a time means i would have to buy a bottle fairly often.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference in the FIRST shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I have very fine, straight hair and this product leaves my hair feeling flat and over conditioned (greasy).</li>
            <li>I love the Wen products, my hair has never been this soft and I color my hair</li>
            <li>I Love this cleanser it leaves your hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I have bleached hair and it has made it much healthier!</li>
            <li>On a positive note, it did make a difference in frizz.</li>
            <li>and I like to blow it out and have it straight.</li>
            <li>( I have black hair) and it worked wonders way better than Carol&#x27;s daughter.</li>
            <li>high school they called me Roseanne Roseannadanna because of my hair.</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>just wow.</li>
            <li>It still frizzed, but it&#x27;s a soft frizz.</li>
            <li>Fig is my least favorite scent, but I do like the product.  </li>
            <li>next time i felt like there was just too much residue left in my hair.  </li>
            <li>not sure what else to say - I love this product and will use it as long as it Is on the market.  </li>
            <li>I ended up switching to another brand&#x27;s sulfate free shampoo with much better results...and much less expensive.</li>
            <li>NY&#x27;s humid weather plays havoc on natural, coarse curls</li>
            <li>Being in the beauty industry, I&#x27;m a natural critic to products that make big claims; this one delivered!</li>

            <li> I tried less and less and tried to find the right amount of product to not be a grease pit.</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble with dry hair and was finding no product, no matter what I paid, was working very well.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it left my dry hair greasy.</li>
            <li> It left it so dry.</li>
            <li> I had less hair in the drain, I used less styling products afterwards because my hair was so soft and my curls, so defined.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FOR 30 DOLLARS</li>
            <li> I will never use another shampoo other than WEN&#x27;s no poo.</li>
            <li> Shampoo was to heavy for my hair&lt;</li>
            <li> After blowdrying my hair, it felt thick and weighed my style down.</li>
            <li> , they lie about WEN not rinsing out hair color; it does rinse out hair color - at least the FIG version does.</li>
            <li> I have thick med length hair.</li>
            <li> That was not enough to make up for the nasty way it made my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Wen fig and sorry to say it did not worked for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin, but this helps give it a fuller look.  </li>
            <li> Another disappointment.</li>
            <li> But very expensive</li>
            <li> Although I like this product, this Fig smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, it ruined my hair.</li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve ever had the displeasure of using.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like this I LOVE IT! But very expensive</li>
            <li> I love, love this product!&lt;br /&gt;In high school they called me Roseanne Roseannadanna because of my hair. I could tell you when it was going to rain!&lt;br /&gt;I love my hair and this Fig WEN. I am NEVER going back to regular shampoo. I just wish I had tried it sooner.</li>
            <li> Wen is fantastic. I have found the ratio that works for me and go with it. ((for the record, shoulder length hair, 4 pumps, wash every day, 1/2 pump leave in)) I color and spend time in the sun at the pool... excellent!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how it could work so well. No lather, none. I had been having trouble with dry hair and was finding no product, no matter what I paid, was working very well. My daughter insisted I use WEN and wow...just wow. I will never use anything else. I have medium, shoulder length hair and I like to blow it out and have it straight. Works like a charm each and every time. Love it, simply love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I have very fine, straight hair and this product leaves my hair feeling flat and over conditioned (greasy).</li>
            <li> I tried to like this and gave it many chances. I followed the instructions and it left my dry hair greasy. I tried less and less and tried to find the right amount of product to not be a grease pit. On a positive note, it did make a difference in frizz.That was not enough to make up for the nasty way it made my hair feel.  I ended up switching to another brand&#x27;s sulfate free shampoo with much better results...and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t suds up like shampoo, but makes my hair so nice and soft and smells so good.  Lovely product.</li>
            <li> I like this for my frizzy hair. It still frizzed, but it&#x27;s a soft frizz.</li>
            <li> I love wen products. I use fig when I need more control in humid weather. I love  there products</li>
            <li> Although I like this product, this Fig smells bad.  All of the WEN products don&#x27;t smell great but this one is gross.  The WEN product does make my hair look great though.</li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve ever had the displeasure of using. Makes hair greasy, oily, and gives no volume. Run away from this over priced garbage.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best no poo product ever! My stylist uses Paul Mitchell and I was in love with PM and all of his products , until I decided to give WEN a try. I will never use another shampoo other than WEN&#x27;s no poo. I noticed a significant difference in the FIRST shampoo. I had less hair in the drain, I used less styling products afterwards because my hair was so soft and my curls, so defined. NY&#x27;s humid weather plays havoc on natural, coarse curls and I did not have a problem with frizz whatsoever! Being in the beauty industry, I&#x27;m a natural critic to products that make big claims; this one delivered!</li>
            <li> Shampoo was to heavy for my hair&lt;br /&gt;A lot of build up</li>
            <li> First off for $32 it is not a very big bottle and using 15 pumps at a time means i would have to buy a bottle fairly often.  I have always used Nexus products and decided to try this.  First time was wonderful.. i had lots of curls and the smell ( i purchased Pomegrante) was heavenly..  next time i felt like there was just too much residue left in my hair.  I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money .. maybe for occasional use at best</li>
            <li> Wen Girl for life - not sure what else to say - I love this product and will use it as long as it Is on the market.  made a huge difference in my hair.  I have used it since 2011.</li>
            <li> I decided to try WEN to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my hair after exercising.  I have to say that I don&#x27;t feel that it does a great job of cleaning the hair but it is a great conditioner.  Basically, I consider WEN a CO-WASH and then when I want it clean I use a SHAMPOO.  One of the top ingredients is alcohol but the product is not drying at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they lie about WEN not rinsing out hair color; it does rinse out hair color - at least the FIG version does.</li>
            <li> I love the Wen products, my hair has never been this soft and I color my hair the color lasts longer with minimum fading</li>
            <li> My stylist has been telling me to use this product for 2 years.  I just started 2 months ago and really love this. My hair is very thin, but this helps give it a fuller look.  Fig is my least favorite scent, but I do like the product.  Mint almond is a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!! Love this stuff! I have bleached hair and it has made it much healthier!</li>
            <li> I have thick med length hair. This product smelled like teatree oil ; Although its supposed to be fig.&lt;br /&gt; After blowdrying my hair, it felt thick and weighed my style down. The next morning  hair looked oily..</li>
            <li> I tried the Wen fig and sorry to say it did not worked for me. I was very disappointed, it ruined my hair. I have to go see my hairstylist to cut my hair. It left it so dry. I Have a wedding this coming month and already had my do up style picked out now I have to wear my hair short. Another disappointment.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FOR 30 DOLLARS</li>
            <li> great product, my hair is manageable soft and not falling anymore</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I Love this cleanser it leaves your hair soft and manageable ( I have black hair) and it worked wonders way better than Carol&#x27;s daughter.</li>
