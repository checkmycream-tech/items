            <li>Honestly, though there is not a safety seal on this product,  someone could have used it a couple of times and then re-sold it to me.  </li>
            <li>Mascara ever, goes on nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>If the mascara itself was better then I feel certain this would be excellent mascara because of the brush.</li>

            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>Overall, very impressed.</li>
            <li>Thumbs up if this helped :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara..</li>
            <li>I receive  lash love lengthening mascara, not lash love.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet, but everything else about my purchase was excellent.</li>
            <li>daughter has been purchasing Mary Kay Lash Love for a while, so I decided to order one for her.</li>
            <li>Kay Lash Love will be my choice until it&#x27;s discontinued...</li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay mascara.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>

            <li>My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mascara (Max Factor) was discontinued and I&#x27;ve struggle for years to find anything close to it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li>I love the wand.</li>
            <li>I think the waterproof version goes on better...</li>
            <li>To this day, my favorite mascaras are by Cover Girl (the ones where you can see the wand visible in the packaging before you buy and use it).</li>
            <li>I tried every application technique under the sun and wanted to love this mascara...</li>
            <li>If you are like me and have tried many different types of mascara this is a great one!</li>
            <li>I love the brush on it.  </li>

            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>; mascara, you shipped the &amp;#34;Lash Love Lengthening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have tried this mascara before and really love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Another of my favorite eye products</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara ever.....</li>
            <li>I love that there is no clumping</li>
            <li>I love everything about it, however I do not like the waterproof one.  </li>
            <li>It is a good mascara, but not in any way better than much cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara and Amazon delivers quickly!</li>
            <li>Also great for people who have sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>Separates lashes very nicely for natural look.</li>
            <li>This is not the original Lash Love mascara.</li>
            <li>Good mascara for volume and lengthening great price Product comes out a little clumpy on brush</li>
            <li>My Sister says this product work best with her Contacts, I put this in with my other Mary Kay Products that I was buying for A gifts.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t flake and it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>It spreads on easy with no clumps.  </li>
            <li>Also, easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Love goes on nicely &amp; does a decent job of separating each lash...</li>
            <li>but this was great, and brand new and safe to use on my sensitive eyes :)</li>
            <li>I wondered why she liked it so much, so when it arrived, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, that I told her I was keeping it, &amp; she&#x27;d have to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lash</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>so far so good,  i will reorder again if it is available when i need it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was told that I got it right :)</li>
            <li>I got this mascara for Christmas, and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind I will ever use!</li>
            <li>I ordered the original &amp;#34;Lash Love&amp;#34; and was sent the &amp;#34;Lengthening Lash Love&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I used to receive tons of compliments on my lashes with the original formula.</li>
            <li>Luckily I got it for free in</li>
            <li>This Mary Kay Lash Love is super easy to apply and separates lashes and makes them appear much, much longer.</li>
            <li>The first coat was great, clump free, but use caution on the second coat because it can look goopy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, love this product.</li>
            <li>Yep, after so many, many years of purchasing mascara, seeing some of my favorite brands come &amp; go, my patience is slowly slipping away.</li>
            <li>Lash Love even gives my lashes a gentle  lift without my having to use an eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind I can use (or have been brave enough to try, anyway)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, really lifts and doesn&#x27;t flake like most.</li>
            <li>Mascara is full of clumps.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.  </li>
            <li>Will I be lucky &amp; choose one that doesn&#x27;t clump?  </li>
            <li>I finally found this lash love mascara and fell in love.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was in a packing envelope.</li>
            <li>daughter&#x27;s lashes have been looking very pretty...</li>
            <li>I plan to use this for a good long time!</li>
            <li>The mascara I was using with Mary Kay was no longer being sold, so I decided to try their new product Lash Love.</li>
            <li>way better product for natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Even with this minor drawback, I am very pleased with this mascara.</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove and looks very natural even though it magnifies your lashes.</li>
            <li>The product consistency is excellent, especially compared to two hypoallergenic drugstore brands I had  tried just previously to Mary Kay.  </li>
            <li>If it has a decent shelf life, it will definitely be my new fave :)</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly and used it the very day I received it.  </li>
            <li>my eye lashes are not long at all , but mary kay love lash mascara make them look longer</li>
            <li>Love this mascara and will continue to purchase in the future!</li>
            <li>A trick I learned is to set it in hot water for a few minutes, then it is good to go.</li>
            <li>I wanted the original Lash Love Mascara in Black, not the lengthening version as I have used it in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>But I really have nothing to complain about this product, it doesn&#x27;t clump up, it has a pretty rich black color, and it&#x27;s elongates lashes just enough to be good for work and school.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t believe this product is actually advertised as being hypoallergenic, it is pretty comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li>I have used all types of mascara and all different brands from the 2$ to the 32$ and this one is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li>Should I buy one with a curved brush, a fat brush, a straight brush...</li>
            <li>This mascara really did nothing for my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Did not remove very well either.  </li>
            <li>Seems like it lasts forever because you don&#x27;t have to apply much.  </li>
            <li>Buy from the real Mary Kay</li>
            <li>I decided to try it out anyway as it would be too much of a hassle to return.</li>
            <li>It really does not add much length.</li>
            <li>It does not provide much volume to the lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent mascara</li>
            <li>This mascara is great for lengthening and picking up every single little hair on your eye!  </li>
            <li>I really like this product so far!</li>
            <li>As a product I highly recommend this brand as a product ...</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and does not clump like other mascaras.</li>
            <li>I think this mascara might have been old - it really clumps up on the wand</li>
            <li>I like that it has a &#x27;normal&#x27; size wand.....</li>
            <li>Nice deep black.</li>
            <li>First experience with any Mary Kay product and expected higher quality.  </li>
            <li>The non-waterproof version is okay, but too much of the mascara fluid gets trapped in the wand and gets clumpy in your lashes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my go to for everyday, and layered at night for full effect!</li>
            <li>The brush does not allow for easy application and the mascara itself is clumpy and messy.</li>
            <li>but the last two times I have purchased it I have gotten a CURVED brush, and the one pictured is the normal straight brush.</li>
            <li>It was way too wet and super clumpy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting more &amp; more frustrated with mascara choices.</li>
            <li>The item i received was EXPIRED, over 2 years old.</li>
            <li>It gives me natural looking depth and length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product has been completely re-designed, and appears fresher, ununsed.</li>
            <li>and it looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It was kind of dry and didn&#x27;t last very long; have used this before &amp; lasted a long time; also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes but still like them super long</li>
            <li>It really makes lashes look long</li>
            <li>I normally purchase this locally, but I needed it ASAP ..</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, makes your lashes long and dark, and stays on until your eye-make-up remover takes it off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However lo real telescopic mascara  is about the same in final looks.</li>
            <li>I have to scrape a little off before applying its worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I could barely get any of this mascara off.</li>
            <li>Seems to be new mascara, not dried out or anything like other reviews I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>The formula isn&#x27;t as thick and seemed kind of dried compared to the last mascara I used from Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>much longer &amp; a little bit fuller.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara but it dried out a little faster than expected.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This Mary Kay Lash Love is super easy to apply and separates lashes and makes them appear much, much longer.</li>
            <li> The first coat was great, clump free, but use caution on the second coat because it can look goopy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love this product.</li>
            <li> Yep, after so many, many years of purchasing mascara, seeing some of my favorite brands come &amp; go, my patience is slowly slipping away.</li>
            <li> Lash Love even gives my lashes a gentle  lift without my having to use an eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only kind I can use (or have been brave enough to try, anyway)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, really lifts and doesn&#x27;t flake like most.</li>
            <li> Mascara is full of clumps.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.  </li>
            <li> Will I be lucky &amp; choose one that doesn&#x27;t clump?  </li>
            <li> I finally found this lash love mascara and fell in love.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was in a packing envelope.</li>
            <li> daughter&#x27;s lashes have been looking very pretty...</li>
            <li> I plan to use this for a good long time!</li>
            <li> The mascara I was using with Mary Kay was no longer being sold, so I decided to try their new product Lash Love.</li>
            <li> way better product for natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Even with this minor drawback, I am very pleased with this mascara.</li>
            <li> It is easy to remove and looks very natural even though it magnifies your lashes.</li>
            <li> The product consistency is excellent, especially compared to two hypoallergenic drugstore brands I had  tried just previously to Mary Kay.  </li>
            <li> If it has a decent shelf life, it will definitely be my new fave :)</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and used it the very day I received it.  </li>
            <li> my eye lashes are not long at all , but mary kay love lash mascara make them look longer</li>
            <li> Love this mascara and will continue to purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> A trick I learned is to set it in hot water for a few minutes, then it is good to go.</li>
            <li> I wanted the original Lash Love Mascara in Black, not the lengthening version as I have used it in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> But I really have nothing to complain about this product, it doesn&#x27;t clump up, it has a pretty rich black color, and it&#x27;s elongates lashes just enough to be good for work and school.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t believe this product is actually advertised as being hypoallergenic, it is pretty comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li> I have used all types of mascara and all different brands from the 2$ to the 32$ and this one is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li> Should I buy one with a curved brush, a fat brush, a straight brush...</li>
            <li> This mascara really did nothing for my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Did not remove very well either.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it lasts forever because you don&#x27;t have to apply much.  </li>
            <li> Buy from the real Mary Kay</li>
            <li> I decided to try it out anyway as it would be too much of a hassle to return.</li>
            <li> It really does not add much length.</li>
            <li> It does not provide much volume to the lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent mascara</li>
            <li> This mascara is great for lengthening and picking up every single little hair on your eye!  </li>
            <li> I really like this product so far!</li>
            <li> As a product I highly recommend this brand as a product ...</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and does not clump like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I think this mascara might have been old - it really clumps up on the wand</li>
            <li> I like that it has a &#x27;normal&#x27; size wand.....</li>
            <li> Nice deep black.</li>
            <li> First experience with any Mary Kay product and expected higher quality.  </li>
            <li> The non-waterproof version is okay, but too much of the mascara fluid gets trapped in the wand and gets clumpy in your lashes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my go to for everyday, and layered at night for full effect!</li>
            <li> The brush does not allow for easy application and the mascara itself is clumpy and messy.</li>
            <li> but the last two times I have purchased it I have gotten a CURVED brush, and the one pictured is the normal straight brush.</li>
            <li> It was way too wet and super clumpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting more &amp; more frustrated with mascara choices.</li>
            <li> The item i received was EXPIRED, over 2 years old.</li>
            <li> It gives me natural looking depth and length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product has been completely re-designed, and appears fresher, ununsed.</li>
            <li> and it looks natural.  </li>
            <li> It was kind of dry and didn&#x27;t last very long; have used this before &amp; lasted a long time; also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes but still like them super long</li>
            <li> It really makes lashes look long</li>
            <li> I normally purchase this locally, but I needed it ASAP ..</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, makes your lashes long and dark, and stays on until your eye-make-up remover takes it off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However lo real telescopic mascara  is about the same in final looks.</li>
            <li> I have to scrape a little off before applying its worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I could barely get any of this mascara off.</li>
            <li> Seems to be new mascara, not dried out or anything like other reviews I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> The formula isn&#x27;t as thick and seemed kind of dried compared to the last mascara I used from Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> much longer &amp; a little bit fuller.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara but it dried out a little faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> previous mascara order was old stock from unsold mary kay distributor trying to recover some of her initial financial output.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to curl my lashes and my lashes were long and curled.  </li>
            <li> I mean VERY clumpy.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes amazingly long!</li>
            <li> Also lasts a very long time, I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 months and use every day.</li>
            <li> I felt like it takes a while for it to dry</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed in that</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it tends to get clumpy after awhile, especially in winter months.</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer than I expected to dry.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> the only problem with waterproof is that it&#x27;s hard to remove.</li>
            <li> With one coat it made my lashes wonderfully dark and it defined my lashes.</li>
            <li> sometimes there is a slight clumping.</li>
            <li> dark, long, thick, separated lashes -</li>
            <li> and I have to wipe a little off with a kleenex before using it.  </li>
            <li> The last one I purchased clumped worse than any</li>
            <li> After about a month, the mascara will begin to flake a few hours after application, though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this product, but there wasn&#x27;t anything special about it either.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the formula seems really thick resulting in my lashes stick together!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li> I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> can make your lashes thin and long or thick and long!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts All Day and Night!</li>
            <li> A lash comb helps get some out, but it&#x27;s hard to get an even amount on all lashes.</li>
            <li> It is s hard to get off and amost rips out your lashes trying to get the clumps out.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick as well.</li>
            <li> this mascara is thick and clumpy...</li>
            <li> A long time mascara user this is by far the worst product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I had received the lengthening product (different than shown in the images).</li>
            <li> The wand is really thin so that took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rubber and thin, the formula is also thin.</li>
            <li> it makes ut seems am wearing a false lashes</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting a stale product- as I have never purchased Mary Kay online-</li>
            <li> but the formula was just all wrong.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use this product.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> The wrong product was returned and has not yet been reordered as I&#x27;m hesitant that I might receive the wrong product again.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, i bought three tubes of the mascara.  </li>
            <li> A bit difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Have a difficult time buying eye makeup because I am allergic to it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this particular tube was bad or if the seller had a bad product, but I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just bad.  </li>
            <li> It dosn&#x27;t clump (unless you mercilessly apply it), and it stays put for hours.</li>
            <li> since I had a horrible allergic reaction and a very, very nasty eye infection due to another mascara I tried once.</li>
            <li> and I have been disappointed with all of them.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed, promise!</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Bad product!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s clumpy, flakes, isn&#x27;t waterproof, it&#x27;s just horrible.</li>
            <li> It clumped horribly (an issue I&#x27;ve never had this this brand before ..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this mascara. Only I ordered the regular one and they sent the lengthening one. Kind of disappointed in that but I&#x27;ll just use it.</li>
            <li> I think this mascara might have been old - it really clumps up on the wand and I have to wipe a little off with a kleenex before using it.  I had a sample from a Mary Kay distributor and it wasn&#x27;t like this at all.  It does stay on well and doesn&#x27;t get under your eyes like some do.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it doesn&#x27;t flake and it comes off easily. It really makes lashes look long and I have gotten numerous compliments on my lashes since using it. The wand is really thin so that took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara for Christmas, and was excited to try it. And it worked beautifully! With one coat it made my lashes wonderfully dark and it defined my lashes. My only complaint is that the formula seems really thick resulting in my lashes stick together! Maybe that&#x27;s what all mascara does but just thought you should know. Overall, very impressed. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed, promise! Thumbs up if this helped :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.. but the last two times I have purchased it I have gotten a CURVED brush, and the one pictured is the normal straight brush. The mascara doesn&#x27;t go on as well. Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product. I purchased the mascara based on your advertising and picture. I receive  lash love lengthening mascara, not lash love.</li>
            <li> Best. Mascara. Ever. &amp;#60;333333 my eye lashes are so BIG and HAWT! &amp;#60;3 fukfdksjk  btw follow me on Instagram @josiecupp &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love this product.</li>
            <li> This mascara does everything mascara is supposed to do.  It goes on smoothly, makes your lashes long and dark, and stays on until your eye-make-up remover takes it off.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet, but everything else about my purchase was excellent.</li>
            <li> It is clumpy. It takes an additional brush to try to separate my lashes. I have had this problem before with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting more &amp; more frustrated with mascara choices. Should I buy one with a curved brush, a fat brush, a straight brush...should I buy one that makes my lashes longer or fuller? (I need both) Will I be lucky &amp; choose one that doesn&#x27;t clump?  Yep, after so many, many years of purchasing mascara, seeing some of my favorite brands come &amp; go, my patience is slowly slipping away. The last one I purchased clumped worse than any I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has been purchasing Mary Kay Lash Love for a while, so I decided to order one for her. I wondered why she liked it so much, so when it arrived, I decided to try it. I liked it so much, that I told her I was keeping it, &amp; she&#x27;d have to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lash Love goes on nicely &amp; does a decent job of separating each lash...sometimes there is a slight clumping. If I brush over my lashes a couple times, I can get them looking longer &amp;  fuller; the brush gets the tiny lashes too. Lash Love even gives my lashes a gentle  lift without my having to use an eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s lashes have been looking very pretty...much longer &amp; a little bit fuller.  We thought they were growing, but now I think it&#x27;s her mascara choice (Mary Kay Lash Love).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Kay Lash Love will be my choice until it&#x27;s discontinued...then I&#x27;ll have to start the search all over again.</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay mascara. It&#x27;s the only kind I can use (or have been brave enough to try, anyway) since I had a horrible allergic reaction and a very, very nasty eye infection due to another mascara I tried once. Mary Kay is kinda pricey, but it does the job and I love it.</li>
            <li> This Mary Kay Lash Love is super easy to apply and separates lashes and makes them appear much, much longer. I do not EVER get clumps when I use this. I always get compliments on my lashes when I am wearing it. It is easy to remove and looks very natural even though it magnifies your lashes. I really love it.</li>
            <li> It delivered quickly and I have always LOVED this mascara!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara is great and says on all day.</li>
            <li> This mascara really did nothing for my lashes.  Did not lengthen or volumize.  Did not remove very well either.  Lots of people seem to rant and rave about it though</li>
            <li> Love this mascara and Amazon delivers quickly!</li>
            <li> Product description is incorrect. This is not the original Lash Love mascara. It is the lengthening version.</li>
            <li> I was devastated when my favorite mascara halted production.  I have tried tons and tons of mascaras since then, probably around 30 and I have been disappointed with all of them. I finally found this lash love mascara and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting a stale product- as I have never purchased Mary Kay online- but this was great, and brand new and safe to use on my sensitive eyes :)</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  Seems like it lasts forever because you don&#x27;t have to apply much.  Separates lashes very nicely for natural look.</li>
            <li> The item i received was EXPIRED, over 2 years old. Gross that they would sell you a expired product. Especially since it goes on your eyes. BE CAREFUL! Buy from the real Mary Kay</li>
            <li> I really like this product so far! My favorite mascara (Max Factor) was discontinued and I&#x27;ve struggle for years to find anything close to it&#x27;s quality. Lash Love is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;m very happy so far. It doesn&#x27;t clump, really lifts and doesn&#x27;t flake like most. If it has a decent shelf life, it will definitely be my new fave :)</li>
            <li> I have been getting this mascara for months and months.  It spreads on easy with no clumps.  Also great for people who have sensitive eyes.  Great deal on amazon (as always).</li>
            <li> I love the wand. I think the waterproof version goes on better... dark, long, thick, separated lashes - the only problem with waterproof is that it&#x27;s hard to remove. The non-waterproof version is okay, but too much of the mascara fluid gets trapped in the wand and gets clumpy in your lashes. A lash comb helps get some out, but it&#x27;s hard to get an even amount on all lashes. To this day, my favorite mascaras are by Cover Girl (the ones where you can see the wand visible in the packaging before you buy and use it).</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever used! The brush does not allow for easy application and the mascara itself is clumpy and messy.</li>
            <li> This was a product that mm&amp;l had recommended. It wasn&#x27;t as spectacular as I hoped. The bristles are rubber and thin, the formula is also thin. It gives me natural looking depth and length.&lt;br /&gt;However lo real telescopic mascara  is about the same in final looks. I used one for each eye, and I preferred the loreal.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush on the mascara but the formula was just all wrong. It was way too wet and super clumpy. I mean VERY clumpy. I tried every application technique under the sun and wanted to love this mascara...but it&#x27;s just bad.  If the mascara itself was better then I feel certain this would be excellent mascara because of the brush.</li>
            <li> It was kind of dry and didn&#x27;t last very long; have used this before &amp; lasted a long time; also doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have tried many different types of mascara this is a great one! I love the brush on it.  Although. I have to scrape a little off before applying its worth it.  The brush works well and doesn&#x27;t clump lashes! Good deal online too!</li>
            <li> This is the only kind I will ever use! Better than anything from Walmart for sure! Very Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Mascara is full of clumps.  First experience with any Mary Kay product and expected higher quality.  I am unable to use this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the original &amp;#34;Lash Love&amp;#34; and was sent the &amp;#34;Lengthening Lash Love&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a decent mascara and I like it but I wish I would have received what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara--it&#x27;s my go to for everyday, and layered at night for full effect!</li>
            <li> This mascara is great for lengthening and picking up every single little hair on your eye!  I combine it with Loreal Voluminous or Jordana Best Lash (which is identical to LOR Voluminous).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve repurchase this many times already!</li>
            <li> Great lash coverage without clumps! Love it...</li>
            <li> Image displayed LL mascara. &amp;#34;Lengthening&amp;#34; mascara was shipped but not wanted.</li>
            <li> Awesome Mascara! I was introduced to Mary Kay products about a year ago and this mascara is the best! I have used all types of mascara and all different brands from the 2$ to the 32$ and this one is my favorite by far! The brush never gets clumpy and the mascara doesn&#x27;t either. Also lasts a very long time, I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 months and use every day. The brush also helps with seperating the eyelashes so they dont stick together which is a big problem for me since I sleep on my face. Love this mascara and will continue to purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> Love &amp;#34;Mary Kay Lash Love&amp;#34; mascara. Goes on easily and does not clump like other mascaras. Also, easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Great product and transaction.</li>
            <li> I wanted the original Lash Love Mascara in Black, not the lengthening version as I have used it in the past and loved it. I was disappointed that I had received the lengthening product (different than shown in the images). I decided to try it out anyway as it would be too much of a hassle to return. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just not the same. The formula isn&#x27;t as thick and seemed kind of dried compared to the last mascara I used from Mary Kay. I used to receive tons of compliments on my lashes with the original formula. I won&#x27;t be ordering from here again as I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll actually receive the product I ordered and will probably order from a Mary Kay representative in the future for mascara purchases.</li>
            <li> this product defines your lashes with just one coat... I didnt give it 5 stars cause I felt like it takes a while for it to dry &amp; I get it on my top lid.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara but it dried out a little faster than expected.  Overall, a good product.  I have bought several.</li>
            <li> cant help but to love this product . it makes ut seems am wearing a false lashes</li>
            <li> my eye lashes are not long at all , but mary kay love lash mascara make them look longer&lt;br /&gt;than they are. I love mary kay love lash mascara.</li>
            <li> Have loved this mascara for years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this product, but there wasn&#x27;t anything special about it either. It&#x27;s just like maybelline to me. But I really have nothing to complain about this product, it doesn&#x27;t clump up, it has a pretty rich black color, and it&#x27;s elongates lashes just enough to be good for work and school. However, I like my lashes to be a bit thicker and fuller, but this kinda just makes them spider-legy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be good for something with thicker eyelashes who are just looking for volume.</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED WITH THE MARY KAY LASH LOVE MASCARA!  I will order it again and share it as I did this time.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> The mascara I was using with Mary Kay was no longer being sold, so I decided to try their new product Lash Love. After about a month of use, I decided to dump the mascara. It was too clumpy...before I applied it I would have to wipe a ton of the clump off with a Kleenex. I use oil-free eye makeup remover and I could barely get any of this mascara off. It was glued to my eyelashes. I ordered the Mary Kay Ultimate Mascara and I love it...way better product for natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li> I received the wrong product.  Instead of the &amp;#34;Lash Love&amp;#34; mascara, you shipped the &amp;#34;Lash Love Lengthening&amp;#34; mascara.  There is a difference in the two products.  The wrong product was returned and has not yet been reordered as I&#x27;m hesitant that I might receive the wrong product again.</li>
            <li> A long time mascara user this is by far the worst product I have ever used. I have long lashes but still like them super long and this did zero for length, all it did was clump. Bad product!!</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have tried this mascara before and really love it.  However, this seller did not disclose that i was buying WATERPROOF mascara.  I did not want the waterproof version of this mascara and, unfortunately, i bought three tubes of the mascara.  I will have to throw it away.  The non-waterproof version is great!</li>
            <li> This mascara is so crappy. Luckily I got it for free in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clumpy, flakes, isn&#x27;t waterproof, it&#x27;s just horrible. The second you take the wand out of the thing you can see all the clumpy flakes on the wand. It&#x27;s so gross.</li>
            <li> Good mascara for volume and lengthening great price Product comes out a little clumpy on brush</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t clump. Goes on thick as well. Nice deep black. I plan to use this for a good long time!</li>
            <li> This falls short of what I was expecting. It really does not add much length. A bit difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> It is a good mascara, but not in any way better than much cheaper ones. It does not provide much volume to the lashes.</li>
            <li> My Sister says this product work best with her Contacts, I put this in with my other Mary Kay Products that I was buying for A gifts. I was told that I got it right :)</li>
            <li> This brand mascara is a great product. I normally purchase this locally, but I needed it ASAP .. so of course I turned to Amazon. I don&#x27;t know if this particular tube was bad or if the seller had a bad product, but I was very disappointed with this product. It clumped horribly (an issue I&#x27;ve never had this this brand before .. and this is the only mascara I use). As a product I highly recommend this brand as a product ... but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson on this one and wont be purchasing it online again. I purchased from Park Ave Cosmetics on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like nice mascara without nice mascara prices. This one fits the bill. Seems to be new mascara, not dried out or anything like other reviews I&#x27;ve seen. It arrived quickly and was in a packing envelope. The Mary Kay box was squished and ruined, but the mascara tube was unharmed. The first coat was great, clump free, but use caution on the second coat because it can look goopy. Takes a little longer than I expected to dry.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and more. Makes my lashes amazingly long! Lasts all day and does not smear,</li>
            <li> Another of my favorite eye products</li>
            <li> Loved it, ordered more.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara…the only problem is it flakes</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It dosn&#x27;t clump (unless you mercilessly apply it), and it stays put for hours. After about a month, the mascara will begin to flake a few hours after application, though. Overall, excellent mascara.</li>
            <li> vast improvement from prior ordering of this product.  previous mascara order was old stock from unsold mary kay distributor trying to recover some of her initial financial output.  this mascara  product has been completely re-designed, and appears fresher, ununsed. Honestly, though there is not a safety seal on this product,  someone could have used it a couple of times and then re-sold it to me.  Thats my only concern.  so far so good,  i will reorder again if it is available when i need it on amazon.  Denise S</li>
            <li> Ordered this product because it was listed as one of the best mascaras on the market by an online beauty site.  Have a difficult time buying eye makeup because I am allergic to it.  Although I don&#x27;t believe this product is actually advertised as being hypoallergenic, it is pretty comfortable for me.  The product consistency is excellent, especially compared to two hypoallergenic drugstore brands I had  tried just previously to Mary Kay.  However, I have to use a magnifying mirror to apply mascara, and Mary Kay does leave some microscopic flecks under my eyes after application.  Even with this minor drawback, I am very pleased with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because I wear contacts, and this mascara is wearable with them. I like the texture of the mascara, and the way it goes on my lashes when I apply it. The only complaint I have is that it tends to get clumpy after awhile, especially in winter months. A trick I learned is to set it in hot water for a few minutes, then it is good to go.</li>
            <li> very disappointed. this mascara is thick and clumpy...not like Mary Kay mascara I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever.....I like that it has a &#x27;normal&#x27; size wand.....anytime I&#x27;ve tried using those jumbo brush wands, I end up losing an eye.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and used it the very day I received it.  The mascara does everything it promises to do.  I didn&#x27;t have to curl my lashes and my lashes were long and curled.  I love that there is no clumping and it looks natural.  I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Delivered exatacly on time.&lt;br /&gt;Best Mascara ever, goes on nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;You can make your lashes thin and long or thick and long!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts All Day and Night!</li>
            <li> This is the Best mascara!!  I love everything about it, however I do not like the waterproof one.  It is s hard to get off and amost rips out your lashes trying to get the clumps out.</li>
