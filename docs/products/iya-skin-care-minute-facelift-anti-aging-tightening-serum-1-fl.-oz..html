            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this skin care line.</li>
            <li>It does tighten the skin for sure, but need to reapply every so often in order to keep it working.</li>
            <li>its ok but wont buy it again</li>
            <li>Got the top off to find that there isn&#x27;t a stem attached to the pump top.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended Minute Facelift to me and I have recommended it and will continue to recommend it to many others.</li>
            <li>I love this product , I have used it for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try with others and give more feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most tightening result I saw on forehead and around the eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend it to a friend for sure.</li>
            <li>I had a friend&#x27;s wedding coming up and wanted to reduce wrinkles around my eyes mostly.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply the eye make up and</li>
            <li>Did see the difference for sure.</li>
            <li>I used it first without makeup, loved the results, and then tried using it with makeup (foundation) in the manner they suggest, but that did not go so well.</li>
            <li>Im excited to use this product!</li>
            <li>If using alone it seems to work fine</li>
            <li>If you use the products correctly you will see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>Trying this as a way to smooth up or ?</li>
            <li>And I understand this is just a temporary thing, not to be considered something that over time-may improve any part of my skin, but I hoped again it would work to smooth out the temporary baggy/saggy/puffy under eye area.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fabulous when I use it</li>
            <li>But so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Will diffintly order again seen results the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li>I honestly think Iya Skincare should be sold at high end department stores.</li>
            <li>and she fall in love after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>It is great for the face but  BETTER for trouble areas around crease lines at nose, mouth and eye area.  </li>
            <li>I tried similar product claiming to reduce wrinkles and found this one so far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and the bottle is still full</li>
            <li>I wish the line offered make up as well because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I also thought it would be fun to use when I wear makeup and go out for cheap date night with the husband.</li>
            <li>Product does as it says and quick delivery with added instructions.</li>
            <li>a NEW batch!!&lt;br /&gt;The bottles were full :) and it does work.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have very good skin for my mid-50&#x27;s no real wrinkles &amp; crinkles and unlike the users who love this, I do not.</li>
            <li>It was a strange feeling, but I guess its really good for an occasion to use.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
            <li>Her version of this serum was $25 for .5 oz and its actually even better!</li>
            <li>(I break off the end of the Q-Tip and use the stick to gently and lightly apply the product).  </li>
            <li>worth keeping for emergencies</li>
            <li>It is also so economical.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have my under eye bags and smile.</li>
            <li>the Iya instant lift is the best I wear less makeup now that I am using this.</li>
            <li>This product works great for me because I can actually see the relax look instantly after applying it to my face.</li>
            <li>I tried the new formula and it&#x27;s really works!!!  </li>
            <li>I would say good to use it when going out and need a little fix for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seller has contacted me I&#x27;m now satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>I would definitely  recommend if you want a more youthful look</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried a product of this type</li>
            <li>Wow is only way can be describe this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Besides its full of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>A good tightening effect will last quite a long time.</li>
            <li>It certainly helped reduce puffiness and lines before putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does offer an immediate tightening effect.</li>
            <li>just right, it is minimal and can be easily wiped away or covered up.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s true you need to use very little, and I did put consealer on the top.</li>
            <li>I would say if you don&#x27;t wear much for makeup (foundation)</li>
            <li>Really like this</li>
            <li>as I am having some difficulty in mixing the two products together, perhaps I am using too much of foundation?</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried this, I really really recommend it.</li>
            <li>The instructions where very helpful.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really DO anything for me at all, and my under-eye bags aren&#x27;t problematic for me, but I hoped to see some  tightening up of the skin there, but again, nothing.</li>
            <li>The results where actually really visible.</li>
            <li>I mean, I loved my $130 per 1oz bottle of serum.</li>
            <li>I bought Minute face lift for my older sister for her birthday</li>
            <li>Overall worth the price.</li>
            <li>The real problem I had was when I smiled, the everything wrinkled up so much in and around my eye area that it looked worse</li>
            <li>A very gentle lift with instant tightness.  </li>
            <li>so I followed the directions exactly and have never had a problem with white film that one of my friends had described.  </li>
            <li>Maybe on young adults but any one from 60 like me just didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I would recommend this serum to to everyone that wants to look and feel younger</li>
            <li>and it is natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not ready to go under the knife yet, so I&#x27;m so glad these temporary facelift serums have been perfected to where you can use them everyday if you want, with or without make up.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised after applying the product that it did actually reduced the wrinkles, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Had to try it a few times before got it right.</li>
            <li>They were extremely inexpensive so I didn&#x27;t expect them to work very well.</li>
            <li>I tried it around my eyes first and a little on forehead lines.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the item dried up right away...unusable.  </li>
            <li>It lifts my eyebags and other major wrinkles of a 75-year old.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but this product does visibly reduce the look of fine lines!  </li>
            <li>Also I think you have to practice with it as too much makes wrinkles noticeable - too little does nothing.</li>

            <li> Dry time is about 1.5 minutes per application.  </li>
            <li> I do not over-apply the product or allow it to dry.</li>
            <li> It felt strange that my skin got so tight, but the results where obvious.</li>
            <li> When I put it on heavier, I could see little difference, however the effects do not last long.</li>
            <li> Good grief, I&#x27;m beyond let down....</li>
            <li> It dose tighten your skin,  but dries to a white flakey mess..</li>
            <li> I got some of the white residue around the edges, but moistened with a little water.</li>

            <li> not worth it,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously written a review giving it one star.  </li>
            <li> I now use nothing but her products for my skin care needs and it costs me so much less.</li>
            <li> It also make my skin feeling tight and keeps me from frowning a lot.</li>
            <li> It did tighten a little.</li>
            <li> When this arrived, the pump was broken--and I was a little upset as I didn&#x27;t get to use it at all.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims, however the application was a little tricky.</li>
            <li> some foundation too, although it was a little tricky.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money folks,&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> At first was very skeptical of what it claims....</li>
            <li> But keeping things small allows her to keep cost down</li>
            <li> Her products are truely unbelievable.</li>
            <li> recently I looked worse than I felt!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them to blend, it may be the thickness of my foundation, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> , I mean IT WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY!!!</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t mean I got a few pumps of serum out of it</li>
            <li> Was hard to keep my face still, but I did feel tightening and a feeling where applied.</li>
            <li> Seemed thick on skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit of a skin care snob and have used expensive brands like Skinceauticals, Dr. Peter Roth, Dermalogica, and La Mer for years.</li>
            <li> It reduced the bags under my eyes to a thin line under the eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> DO apply with a thin stick</li>
            <li> my puffy under - eyes when I&#x27;m tired.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with product--costly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful. Instant results that last.</li>
            <li> I tried the new formula and it&#x27;s really works!!!  I recommend!!!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for an immediate fix.  It certainly helped reduce puffiness and lines before putting on makeup.  Overall worth the price.</li>
            <li> Product became flaky when mixed with foundation. If using alone it seems to work fine but I need the evenness of a foundation.</li>
            <li> Need to buy more very good product for face..</li>
            <li> you need wait but the reseul are amazing</li>
            <li> This product preforms beautifully; is easy to apply, and makes you look years yiounger!</li>
            <li> This is a great product... My husband noticed the difference around my eyes... I will definitely buy from this seller again...</li>
            <li> I did not much of a difference. When I put it on heavier, I could see little difference, however the effects do not last long. worth keeping for emergencies</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I&#x27;ve got this product for my mom and this product was  able literally to lift and tighten my mom&#x27;s wrinkles in couple of minutes before friends wedding. The texture  is very light and the smell is awesome. Besides its full of natural ingredients. My mom was able to mix it with foundation and got an amazing lifting result\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought a product 8 months ago (for hundreds$$$) for eye lift and line decreaser.  First of all it was way too expensive but I was sucked in.  Secondly, the item dried up right away...unusable.  No return or refund. SAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this, said, hey I&#x27;ll try it.  AWESOME.  It is great for the face but  BETTER for trouble areas around crease lines at nose, mouth and eye area.  LASTS and LASTS.  GREAT product.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and can only use this product once in awhile.  It tends to product small, itchy spots under my eyes the next day.  I have to thoroughly wash it from my skin and use Elidel to offset the effects.  OTHERWISE:  if you do not have problematic skin, you can use this daily.  It reduced the bags under my eyes to a thin line under the eyelashes.  DO apply with a thin stick (I break off the end of the Q-Tip and use the stick to gently and lightly apply the product).  Apply a thin layer at a time and let it dry completely or the product will flake when you try to add your makeup.  Dry time is about 1.5 minutes per application.  Do not use moisturizers in the area with the serum as it will soften the skin and you will lose the tightening of the skin from the serum.  I would use it every day if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that I have psoriasis but when I do use it I am most pleased with the results provided I do not over-apply the product or allow it to dry.</li>
            <li> This leaves a white substance on my skin when it dries. It does tighten but it&#x27;s Not for people of color.</li>
            <li> Works well for about 3 hours but leaves a white residue where applied!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfection and it work perde t&#x27;y.  I&#x27;am vert Happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this product does visibly reduce the look of fine lines!  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I think it is awful. does not do the job. Maybe on young adults but any one from 60 like me just didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It does what it promises to do.  It lifts my eyebags and other major wrinkles of a 75-year old.  It is also so economical.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and the bottle is still full (i.e.  the drops are so miniscule that I figure this bottle can last for six months).</li>
            <li> I would say if you don&#x27;t wear much for makeup (foundation) and you aren&#x27;t going to smile alot - it is awesome.  So with that said, I patted it on, I looked in the mirror and I absolutely loved the fact that my under eye bags were truly gone.  It took years off me.  It does feel like you have something on your face for awhile, but I can handle that and you eventually don&#x27;t notice.  I tried to mix it with make-up, but the results weren&#x27;t as impressive.  The real problem I had was when I smiled, the everything wrinkled up so much in and around my eye area that it looked worse then if I had the bags and walked around smiling all the time.  It does have the consistency of egg white (which is what I&#x27;ve dabbled with in the past and yes, that does work too), but same as egg whites, it leaves a slight white residue.  But I found if you pat it on just right, it is minimal and can be easily wiped away or covered up.  Just don&#x27;t use water because you then totally lose the effect.  So with that - I&#x27;ll use up what I have for moments here and there - but it&#x27;s still not the fix I&#x27;m looking for.  I&#x27;d rather have my under eye bags and smile.</li>
            <li> Product does as it says and quick delivery with added instructions.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money folks,&lt;br /&gt;Its not worth it,&lt;br /&gt;used it for 2 months &amp; no results,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ponds cold creme ( heck works better than this )</li>
            <li> I just love this minute facelift serum the best that I ever bought. It tightens my skin makes me look younger that&#x27;s why I keep ordering it I have tried others but the Iya instant lift is the best I wear less makeup now that I am using this. I would recommend this serum to to everyone that wants to look and feel younger</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product.  I have tried 4 different brands to date and IYA&#x27;s Minute Facelift beats them all.  It tightens the skin so pores and wrinkles are concealed.  I put Maybelline Mousse make up over this product and it worked well.  A good tightening effect will last quite a long time. I have been wearing this product for 3 days now and each application gets easier.  I&#x27;m not ready to go under the knife yet, so I&#x27;m so glad these temporary facelift serums have been perfected to where you can use them everyday if you want, with or without make up.  Also, this product has an excellent price for the amount of serum received.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with product--costly</li>
            <li> I had previously written a review giving it one star.  The seller has contacted me I&#x27;m now satisfied overall. Im excited to use this product!</li>
            <li> Really like this and it is natural</li>
            <li> did not work as expected</li>
            <li> Love this product. It does what it says it does in minutes. Pours appear to smaller and skin feels tighter.</li>
            <li> I tried this serum alone and then mixed with foundation. Alone it was rather shiny, so tried with foundation. It did tighten a little. I think it maybe me as I am having some difficulty in mixing the two products together, perhaps I am using too much of foundation? The serum does feel nice on my skin. Can anyone let me know if there is a trick to combining?</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims to do! I tend to have bags under my eyes so I use Minute Facelift when I go out. The bags disappear within minutes and it also smoothes out my fine lines around my eyes! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this skin care line. Iya is my esthetician and she is amazing. Her products are truely unbelievable. I&#x27;m a little bit of a skin care snob and have used expensive brands like Skinceauticals, Dr. Peter Roth, Dermalogica, and La Mer for years. I finally decided to try her products. They were extremely inexpensive so I didn&#x27;t expect them to work very well. I mean, I loved my $130 per 1oz bottle of serum. I have used it for years because it worked so well. Her version of this serum was $25 for .5 oz and its actually even better! I now use nothing but her products for my skin care needs and it costs me so much less. I honestly think Iya Skincare should be sold at high end department stores. ITS THAT GOOD! But keeping things small allows her to keep cost down and I appreciate that about her. I wish the line offered make up as well because I love it so much. If you haven&#x27;t tried this, I really really recommend it. If you use the products correctly you will see a huge improvement. I&#x27;m 38 and when I wear makeup people say I look about 26 and without makeup I look 30. And I know that Iya skincare is the reason my skin looks this way.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly purchased this and I must say it&#x27;s really amazing stuff! I think the results are amazing. A very gentle lift with instant tightness.  Hoping it does all that it&#x27;s promised!</li>
            <li> I got this cream to reduce wrinkles around my eyes and forehead. Had to try it a few times before got it right. It does tighten the skin for sure, but need to reapply every so often in order to keep it working. But it&#x27;s true you need to use very little, and I did put consealer on the top. I got some of the white residue around the edges, but moistened with a little water. Overall I like the product it does what it claims. I think I&#x27;ll order it again next time</li>
            <li> I tried similar product claiming to reduce wrinkles and found this one so far the best. I&#x27;m quite surprised. The only thing that I had to work on was to figure it out if I can use it with my foundation. The instructions where very helpful. I do use a light base foundation and was able to mix it using a small brush. I retouch it during the day though. It also make my skin feeling tight and keeps me from frowning a lot. I would definitely  recommend if you want a more youthful look</li>
            <li> This product works great for me because I can actually see the relax look instantly after applying it to my face.</li>
            <li> Applying the product under my eyes ( where the bags are the worst) did wonders for my bags.... I bought a smaller version also to recommend to my friend...She loved it also.......</li>
            <li> its ok but wont buy it again</li>
            <li> Trying this as a way to smooth up or ? brighten up....my puffy under - eyes when I&#x27;m tired. I noticed after a head-cold recently I looked worse than I felt! When this arrived, the pump was broken--and I was a little upset as I didn&#x27;t get to use it at all. One half-pump and kaput! - nothing came out! Then I tried to get the top of the container off by pulling, and then I tried twisting---and to my great surprise, it is in a screw-off type container. Got the top off to find that there isn&#x27;t a stem attached to the pump top. Wrote the company and they replied, which was a big plus. So, I am unscrewing it to use. Doesn&#x27;t really DO anything for me at all, and my under-eye bags aren&#x27;t problematic for me, but I hoped to see some  tightening up of the skin there, but again, nothing. And I understand this is just a temporary thing, not to be considered something that over time-may improve any part of my skin, but I hoped again it would work to smooth out the temporary baggy/saggy/puffy under eye area. I also thought it would be fun to use when I wear makeup and go out for cheap date night with the husband. Oh well, I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t complain. Overall, I have very good skin for my mid-50&#x27;s no real wrinkles &amp; crinkles and unlike the users who love this, I do not. I have taken really good care of my skin through the years, but the best thing I have done is to drink a lot of water and stay away from junk food and not roast in the sun!</li>
            <li> This product does everything it claims to do.  My skin looks fabulous when I use it and I get compliments about my complexion. This is the first time I have tried a product of this type so I followed the directions exactly and have never had a problem with white film that one of my friends had described.  I can feel my skin tighten when I apply it.  A friend recommended Minute Facelift to me and I have recommended it and will continue to recommend it to many others.</li>
            <li> I love this product , I have used it for years. Have been using this product for years, love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;Without me contacting them, they took it upon themselves to REFUND my money AND send me a NEW batch!!&lt;br /&gt;The bottles were full :) and it does work. I used it first without makeup, loved the results, and then tried using it with makeup (foundation) in the manner they suggest, but that did not go so well. I couldn&#x27;t get them to blend, it may be the thickness of my foundation, I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;ll try with others and give more feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle, the one with the tightener, was empty. Now I don&#x27;t mean I got a few pumps of serum out of it, I mean IT WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY!!! I was shocked, I will never buy this, or from this company again! Good grief, I&#x27;m beyond let down....they have no quality control whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love it!!! Great product very happy with it!! Will diffintly order again seen results the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product.  Did not produce the advertised results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product often enough or long enough to render a final opinion.  It certainly does offer an immediate tightening effect. I will issue a follow up review in a month or two.  But so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Wow is only way can be describe this amazing product. I bought Minute face lift for my older sister for her birthday and she fall in love after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;Now she is really happy and as result me too, I used to fix her photos all the time in photoshop but not anymore. She likes her photos the way that comes from the camera now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Does what it claims, however the application was a little tricky. I used the primer that was included with the product and it did help. The most tightening result I saw on forehead and around the eyes. It also kept me from frowning my forehead. The results where actually really visible. Lasted about three hours. I would say good to use it when going out and need a little fix for wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to a friend for sure.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum for myself to try it. At first was very skeptical of what it claims.... I had a friend&#x27;s wedding coming up and wanted to reduce wrinkles around my eyes mostly. I did follow the directions included and used the primer spray they send to cleanse my skin from oils. I was very surprised after applying the product that it did actually reduced the wrinkles, especially around the eyes. It felt strange that my skin got so tight, but the results where obvious. I was able to apply the eye make up and some foundation too, although it was a little tricky. Lasted me for like three hours or so. I would say this product does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I think this product works well. I tried it around my eyes first and a little on forehead lines. Was hard to keep my face still, but I did feel tightening and a feeling where applied. Did see the difference for sure. the wrinkles got flat. It was a strange feeling, but I guess its really good for an occasion to use. I liked it.</li>
            <li> OMG this product is the absolute best ever!!!</li>
            <li> Diid not like it at all. Seemed thick on skin. Also I think you have to practice with it as too much makes wrinkles noticeable - too little does nothing.</li>
            <li> It dose tighten your skin,  but dries to a white flakey mess..</li>
