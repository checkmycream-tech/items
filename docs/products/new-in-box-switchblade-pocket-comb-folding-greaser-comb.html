            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>Make sure to slide the lock to open then press the button.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Smooth flipping action when you have the button in the  correct position.  </li>
            <li>Definitely more on the end of novelty than functionality, Wouldn&#x27;t recommend bringing it out in public but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>We needed a costume for a 1950s party and this was the perfect accessory for the slick haired grease monkey!</li>
            <li>Came in a nice little box.</li>
            <li>As others have said, not high build quality and the frame bends easy</li>
            <li>i just think of him as its new owner,the fonzie i know</li>
            <li>and now I have to give it to him as is rather than wrapped in the cute yellow box I&#x27;d planned on, but there are bigger problems in the world than a box for a switchblade comb being crushed, so I&#x27;ll live.  </li>
            <li>It does feel a little cheaply made</li>

            <li> LOL...the comb/switchblade is hilarious and high-quality plastic, but I was disappointed that the box itself was completely crushed in shipping.  It is going to be a gift for a little kid and now I have to give it to him as is rather than wrapped in the cute yellow box I&#x27;d planned on, but there are bigger problems in the world than a box for a switchblade comb being crushed, so I&#x27;ll live.  I suppose the 1,000,000 dollar bill makes up for it a bit too.  Bonus.</li>
            <li> It is what it is! Not expensive stuff here!</li>
            <li> This goes to a freind of mine,he&#x27;ll love it i just think of him as its new owner,the fonzie i know</li>
            <li> My husband loved this.  He had one as a kid and kept it in his back pocket.  He told me this story and I had to get him one as a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> id use this for pranks.</li>
            <li> Works well and a nice trick.</li>
            <li> Works OK and my 3 year old loves it.  He thinks he is so cool</li>
            <li> Awesome Awesome Awesome, this comb was just what I was looking for! It does feel a little cheaply made but I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything fabulous.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. A fun novelty item</li>
            <li> I bought several of these to use as props in a school play.  They worked well, even after painting the comb part silver for greater realism.  They stood up well to several rehearsals and performances.</li>
            <li> Make sure to slide the lock to open then press the button.&lt;br /&gt;A great compact pocket combo.&lt;br /&gt;Plus this type of comb keeps dust out of the teeth of the comb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and made of plastic but what do you expect for the price?</li>
            <li> Fun novelty gift for my husband&#x27;s  birthday. He got a big kick out of it.  Smooth flipping action when you have the button in the  correct position.  Came in a nice little box.</li>
            <li> Fits right in my pocket! Just don&#x27;t bring it to school!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as you&#x27;d expect. Very cheap, but still a fun novelty to have as a joke. Definitely not the best comb in the world. Sure is cool though. :)</li>
            <li> Very cool both work fine husband  and  son love them ty</li>
            <li> How cool was this! We needed a costume for a 1950s party and this was the perfect accessory for the slick haired grease monkey!</li>
            <li> I bought this to comb my beard during no shave November and am not disappointed.  It&#x27;s actually a good comb, and its novelty is undeniable.  I&#x27;ve even scared some people while pretending to shank them. Fun stuff.  Also it&#x27;s more sturdy than you&#x27;d expect.  Update: It&#x27;s been 10 months since purchasing this comb and it&#x27;s still fully functional.</li>
            <li> Loved the product bought it for my husband to use as a quick beard comb.</li>
            <li> One of the combs that was sent only opened halfway, had to manually open the rest of the way. Cheaply made, but I was able to fix it. Worth it to spend a couple bucks more and buying a better made comb.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to take it to school or work...thats all i&#x27;m saying! lol</li>
            <li> Definitely more on the end of novelty than functionality, Wouldn&#x27;t recommend bringing it out in public but it gets the job done. Disappointed that it&#x27;s not all metal and the handle is just plastic.</li>
            <li> after opening it a bunch (playing with it) it seems to wear off and now it cant close</li>
            <li> Works great my boyfriend loved it so it was well worth the money</li>
            <li> Umm mm no, I do not recommend this. You might be like me, saying: &amp;#34;Hey maybe it&#x27;ll be allright...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Well I say: DONT DO IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;By the third day, it wouldn&#x27;t stay shut.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m saying please please please please don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Cute gift for the guy who has almost everything.  Handsome enough to look like the real thing, but safer to help him always look his best.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Great quality got it for my boyfriend and he LOVES it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Stopped properly opening after just a few days. Comb part doesn&#x27;t pop out or close as it should.  Not that I thought it would be a quality product.</li>
            <li> this is a piece of poop.&lt;br /&gt;i could break it with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;the comb bends when used&lt;br /&gt;not worth the price</li>
            <li> Surprisingly useful for beards! As others have said, not high build quality and the frame bends easy (the plastic black part, has no real effect on the comb)</li>
