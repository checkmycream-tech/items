            <li>Gold Bond has always made wonderful products.</li>
            <li>This lotion does a very good job getting rid of my itching skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Goldbond makes good products, this one was very good at stopping the itching.</li>
            <li>worked great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for the money.</li>
            <li>Effective for itching.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive</li>
            <li>Ok, but Benadryl Gel works better.</li>
            <li>It has worked somewhat better than most I have tried although not at 100 per cent.</li>
            <li>Has a menthol scent that I love (some don&#x27;t)  </li>
            <li>For years I bought Gold Bond Medicated Anti-Itch Cream and foot powder at Walmart, always satisfied with product and price.</li>
            <li>like the Lotion better than Cream from tube.</li>
            <li>I love the minty feeling that cools my skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for dry or itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, fresh aroma as well.</li>
            <li>smell of the lotion is medium strong but not objectionable to me.</li>
            <li>Nice, non-sticky, and works well, the pump makes it easy to use, quite effective for anti-itch problem, my second choice when not terribly itchy</li>
            <li>Fantastic product....works as advertised; easy to use;</li>
            <li>However, both does fabulous job of getting rid of itch in minutes after applying on skin.</li>
            <li>Great work well on dry skin</li>
            <li>Really cools the irritation and has a tingling feeling and really does a good job of relieving the itchy skin</li>
            <li>It also clears up the redness quickly.</li>
            <li>The economical size is a bonus.</li>
            <li>When I saw this large container of Gold Bond Medicated Anti-Itch Lotion on Amazon, I ordered it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>A relative was using regular Gold Bond, tried this and is thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert--dry skin is a side effect of that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, this lotion has helped relieve my winter itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Heals well and offers relief.</li>
            <li>The goldbond product definitely does stop the itching, but its not that much of a moisturizing to help very dry skin so that it can be healed and prevented for the future, for that I can recommened the cetaphil restoderm</li>

            <li> The only suggestion I would make for those with very dry skin, which this does not alleviate is to use Cetaphil Restoderm moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use this for dry itchy skin and for instant relief after I scratch myself mindlessly at times.</li>
            <li> May work on other temporary itches - as from dry skin.</li>
            <li> One of the few anti itch products that actually does help to reduce itching !</li>
            <li> I think and hope that my winter itch is the thing of the past now.&lt;br</li>

            <li> My skin was itching, this defintely helped. The only suggestion I would make for those with very dry skin, which this does not alleviate is to use Cetaphil Restoderm moisturizer.  The goldbond product definitely does stop the itching, but its not that much of a moisturizing to help very dry skin so that it can be healed and prevented for the future, for that I can recommened the cetaphil restoderm moistuzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goldbond makes good products, this one was very good at stopping the itching.</li>
            <li> Effective for itching.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive</li>
            <li> I use this for dry itchy skin and for instant relief after I scratch myself mindlessly at times. It also clears up the redness quickly. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Ok, but Benadryl Gel works better.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert--dry skin is a side effect of that.  This lotion does a very good job getting rid of my itching skin.</li>
            <li> worked great. would buy again.</li>
            <li> I think and hope that my winter itch is the thing of the past now.&lt;br /&gt;So far, this lotion has helped relieve my winter itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the lotion is medium strong but not objectionable to me. And it doesn&#x27;t last too long.&lt;br /&gt;But the itchiness seems to be relieved with just one application and lasts for the day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Heals well and offers relief.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Fast shipping. Item as describe.</li>
            <li> Does not stop MY itch. I have a patch on my back that  has itched forever - still there after weeks of use. May work on other temporary itches - as from dry skin.</li>
            <li> One of the few anti itch products that actually does help to reduce itching !</li>
            <li> It has worked somewhat better than most I have tried although not at 100 per cent.</li>
            <li> Great work well on dry skin</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to relieve my itchy legs.  This works almost immediately.  Great stuff for the money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry or itchy skin.  Has a menthol scent that I love (some don&#x27;t)  Really cools the irritation and has a tingling feeling and really does a good job of relieving the itchy skin..  A relative was using regular Gold Bond, tried this and is thrilled with it.  Can be difficult to find in many stores.  Lots of different Gold Bond lotions but I found this only at Target.  I ended up ordering some on line for delivery to the relative.</li>
            <li> For years I bought Gold Bond Medicated Anti-Itch Cream and foot powder at Walmart, always satisfied with product and price.

However, both does fabulous job of getting rid of itch in minutes after applying on skin. I always keep this on hand. I now buy all my Gold Bond products from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product....works as advertised; easy to use; no smell.</li>
            <li> Mosquito bites for me have always been torture. This is the only cream I&#x27;ve ever found that stops the itch. I love the minty feeling that cools my skin. It has a nice, fresh aroma as well. The economical size is a bonus. Gold Bond has always made wonderful products. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice, non-sticky, and works well, the pump makes it easy to use, quite effective for anti-itch problem, my second choice when not terribly itchy</li>
