            <li>I had pretty much given up on sticks and creams and was looking at balms or even powder styles but still never found something I loved.</li>
            <li>SO worth it!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite cover up product!</li>

            <li>I first found this on ipsy, and now will always have this in my makeup collection!</li>

            <li>so it&#x27;s well worth the $20.</li>
            <li>Like my other reviewers, I also received this in my ipsy bag and safe to say this is my favorite concealer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The tiniest to covers a large area!</li>
            <li>I was able to rub in a tiny bit and it blended right in, plus it helps you heal.  </li>

            <li>I first discovered this product through &amp;#34;ipsy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have used it almost every day since I first received it</li>
            <li>,  i heal while i conceal.;-)</li>
            <li>Does an amazing job covering my dark circles</li>
            <li>One bottle could last you a year and a quarter easily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and blends very well.  </li>
            <li>A pea size covers your whole face.</li>
            <li>I also have very temperamental skin, and this product has never irritated it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just basically cover up doesn&#x27;t conceal much.</li>
            <li>And if you have a boo boo it really heals it.</li>
            <li>This works better than any other concealer I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Easy to blend and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and it gives a full and long lasting coverage for any imperfection one may have..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad thick and cake-y, but like i said, apply a little and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I live on this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have some scars from having bad acne as a teenager and this product does an awesome job of covering those up &amp; lasting for the entire day (with some translucent powder on top).</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more in the very near future..</li>
            <li>and the $20 is worth it totally.</li>
            <li>Works great coming up dark spots and small problem areas on the skin.</li>
            <li>I apply my scar cream first and then put a tiny bit to cover the redness.</li>
            <li>excellent product for concealing ugly red bug bites.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural and never bothers my skin.</li>
            <li>Worked on my 30 year old skin and my moms 65 year old skin.</li>
            <li>I love it because it isnt too heavy on my skin and helps to heal any marks I have when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li>I usually won&#x27;t spend too much on one product, but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone looking for a solid concealer.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too bad for me because I have combination skin, but for someone with dry skin this may not be the best option.</li>
            <li>it has provided amazing coverage when my face is pale in the winter and slightly tan in the summer.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to cover up a small skin graft under my eye which is darker than the rest of my skin</li>
            <li>Works well at first but doesn&#x27;t last very long, fades</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not really heavy enough to cover the discoloration unless I pile it on</li>
            <li>Boo Boo Coverup is serious stuff, and I love that it can cover major issues ad well as minor troubles.</li>
            <li>The shipping was right on date although not sure the size of the box it came in was necessary.</li>

            <li> The shipping was right on date although not sure the size of the box it came in was necessary.</li>
            <li> A little bit definitely does go a long way; It takes a while to get through the whole tube</li>
            <li> This concealer works very well on under eye circles and small blemishes.  </li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t kidding when they say just a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but this tube will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have had with it is that it seems to dry out my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> It is thick and very blendable.</li>
            <li> A HELLUVA  LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so one tube can last me about 5 or 6 months.</li>
            <li> I use it as my daily foundation a little can go a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> This tube will last me at least the year with daily use to my under eyes and acne!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I received this in a birchbox or ipsy box (I can&#x27;t remember which one) a few months back</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other cover ups won&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll keep using this for other areas that need a little help.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES</li>

            <li> This product is by far the best concealer that I have ever tried and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried plenty..It goes on smooth and it gives a full and long lasting coverage for any imperfection one may have..I am 100% satisfied with this item and I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more in the very near future..</li>
            <li> Received this in an ipsy bag and ordered another one. Not the best concealer but not bad!</li>
            <li> After 35 years in search of the perfect concealer for  my hereditary dark circles, I can truly say this is the best. Covers and stays on perfect. The shipping was right on date although not sure the size of the box it came in was necessary. Maybe a padded envelope would have been more appropriate.</li>
            <li> I use this as a concealer and it is amazing.  I have bought it multiple times.  One tube lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It covers like no concealer I have used, and it actually does heal as it conceals. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Got a sample before I bought it. Love this product. Great coverage. A little goes a long way :)</li>
            <li> I am giving this a four star because of the price. I like to use this daily as a foundation. It works great on my skin only wish it was cheaper! It stays on all day! I received this in a birchbox or ipsy box (I can&#x27;t remember which one) a few months back and glad I did!</li>
            <li> Best concealer ever for under eye circles and to cover booboos</li>
            <li> This,is the best concealer I have used. It is thick and very blendable. I love it!!!! I used to use MAC prolongwear and sometimes still used it but I like this one way more it is the best and it covers everything I use it for the under eye area and to cover blemishes. You have to try it!!!</li>
            <li> Like my other reviewers, I also received this in my ipsy bag and safe to say this is my favorite concealer I&#x27;ve ever used. It comes out super smooth and provides great coverage. Easy to blend and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. Blends into the skin for a smooth flawless finish. Can&#x27;t tell you are wearing anything! It&#x27;s so light &amp; natural.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 6 months now so the $20 is worthwhile to spend! It does cover up small bites, bumps and pimples pretty well. I&#x27;m definitely buying another one soon once my current one runs out</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my needs.</li>
            <li> Works well at first but doesn&#x27;t last very long, fades</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer ever!!! I literally cut it open to get every drop out.</li>
            <li> This concealer works very well on under eye circles and small blemishes.  It&#x27;s creamy and blends very well.  I originally purchased this to cover up a small skin graft under my eye which is darker than the rest of my skin but it&#x27;s not really heavy enough to cover the discoloration unless I pile it on but then it looks cakey.  I&#x27;ll look for something else for the skin graft but I&#x27;ll keep using this for other areas that need a little help.</li>
            <li> Now, first time users must know that A LITTLE GOES A HELLUVA  LONG WAY! I&#x27;m  telling you, pea sized is too big. A pea size covers your whole face. Literally just a pinprick of this stuff covers any blemish or boo boo you could possibly imagine. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a solid concealer. It&#x27;s a tad thick and cake-y, but like i said, apply a little and it&#x27;s perfect. One bottle could last you a year and a quarter easily.</li>
            <li> I had some surgery on my nose and the doc told me it would be very red for a while, just a suture line that would fade but very red.  Well, it was very red.  I&#x27;ve used cover ups in the past that did not look natural and were useless.  I decided to try this stuff and they aren&#x27;t kidding when they say just a tiny bit goes a long way.  I was able to rub in a tiny bit and it blended right in, plus it helps you heal.  Other cover ups won&#x27;t do that.  I went back to work after a week and had people say, I thought you were getting surgery?  They couldn&#x27;t even tell.  Well I need a second surgery to my nose later but this tube will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> My daughter has terrible breakouts and this cover up has taken them from weeklong problems to clear in less than 2 days.  She has very sensitive skin and has no problems with this product at all!!!</li>
            <li> Great coverage, blends beautifully, perfect for traveling or quick touch-ups</li>
            <li> excellent product for concealing ugly red bug bites.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Works great coming up dark spots and small problem areas on the skin. While healing at the same time.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product through &amp;#34;ipsy&amp;#34;. As soon as I tried it, I was hooked. I use the &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; shade and it has provided amazing coverage when my face is pale in the winter and slightly tan in the summer. A little goes a long way, so one tube can last me about 5 or 6 months. I also have very temperamental skin, and this product has never irritated it. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs quality concealer that will last all day.</li>
            <li> This a great cover-up that concealed all blemishes! I really liked it, smooth, easy to apply, blends in well.</li>
            <li> My daughter received a sample of this in her Ipsy and is the only cover up she will use now.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> Got this in an Ipsy bag and fell in love. Stopped using foundation this summer. I use this under my eyes, around my nose and chin (where i get redness) and I set my face with a powder and that is it! It looks so natural and never bothers my skin. I usually won&#x27;t spend too much on one product, but this one is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for YEARS for a really good concealer that blends well but still keeps great coverage. It was like a constant obsession. I had pretty much given up on sticks and creams and was looking at balms or even powder styles but still never found something I loved. SEARCH. OVER. Boo Boo Coverup is serious stuff, and I love that it can cover major issues ad well as minor troubles. I have some discoloration around my nose and this does the trick perfectly and it also covers my occasional blemishes. You can use a little or a lot and it stay ON with excellent coverage, even after blending and then applying liquid or cream foundation. It stays smooth and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s sitting on top of your skin. ALSO, it heals!! Best stuff and SO worth it! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The BEST coverup ever. Hands down.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best cover up for pimples that I have ever used.  It has excellent coverage and doesn&#x27;t further irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Not water based and stays on longer.</li>
            <li> Also got this in my ipsy bag. Hands down the most amazing coverage and staying power I&#x27;ve ever had in a concealer. Wearing all day and get no creases and it stays ON. Worked on my 30 year old skin and my moms 65 year old skin. Have worn it under tinted moisturizer and not. I&#x27;m officially a fan!! Will buy full size when finished.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer. I use it once when I apply in the morning and I RARELY need to touch up again when I go out at night. I love it because it isnt too heavy on my skin and helps to heal any marks I have when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite cover up product! The tiniest to covers a large area! It blends great on different skin tones and it helps heal what you are covering!!!!! So its a two for one product! This tube will last me at least the year with daily use to my under eyes and acne!!!</li>
            <li> ok stuff, I recommend you buy the shade darker than what you think as otherwise you may need to layer it.</li>
            <li> I got this in my Ipsy bag in May I believe. I have used it almost every day since I first received it and I am still not out of it! This stuff works wonders! When I am close to the end I will, without a doubt, be buying more.</li>
            <li> I recently got a rhinoplasty/ alarplasty. My incision scar still invisible but its healing properly. I use this to cover my scar while im waiting for it to fade. My surgeon said it will fade away as its only been 5 weeks post op. I apply my scar cream first and then put a tiny bit to cover the redness. I use a small brush to even out then i finish off with my foundation. I applied it at 9am and it lasted till 5pm. So yes boo boo,  i heal while i conceal.;-)</li>
            <li> Did not work well at all, it&#x27;s just basically cover up doesn&#x27;t conceal much.</li>
            <li> works amazing! got it in my ipsy bag in may 2014 and im just now using it and i love it! makes my make up stay on wayyyy longer after i put liquid foundation on after. cant say nothing bad about it other then its $20 dollars... other then that LOVE IT!!!! want more!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite concealer! I have some scars from having bad acne as a teenager and this product does an awesome job of covering those up &amp; lasting for the entire day (with some translucent powder on top). A little bit definitely does go a long way; It takes a while to get through the whole tube so it&#x27;s well worth the $20.</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job covering my dark circles</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..it works wonders. I use it as my daily foundation a little can go a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite concealers, doesn&#x27;t look caked on and doesn&#x27;t make me break out! I first found this on ipsy, and now will always have this in my makeup collection!</li>
            <li> I received this in my ipsy glam bag 4 days ago. I absolutely love it!! It hides my dark circles and any redness on my face and best of all it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. There are so few concealer a I can use because my skin has a reaction and the ones that don&#x27;t irritate my skin don&#x27;t cover up anything. This covers so well I decided to do an experiment and used it to cover a petal on one of my tattoos.....full coverage and it didn&#x27;t look all thick and unnatural!!!! I&#x27;m impressed and will be buying. I found my concealer!!</li>
            <li> It was all exploded when I received the product. Had to throw it out. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great! The coverage is awesome and it lasts quite a while. The only issue I have had with it is that it seems to dry out my skin a bit. It isn&#x27;t too bad for me because I have combination skin, but for someone with dry skin this may not be the best option.</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Conceal  and heal at the same time.</li>
            <li> Got this in my ipsy bag. I don&#x27;t use concealer but i started noticing some bags under my eyes and i thought to try this out. LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;works perfect for what i needed, blends with the rest of my makeup, brightens my eyes, its amazing. and the $20 is worth it totally. it lasts FOREVER. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it !!!  Works like magic !!</li>
            <li> I tried a friends first and loved it.  This works better than any other concealer I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but lasts a long time.  I don&#x27;t just use it to cover up &amp;#34;boo-boos&amp;#34; but use it all the time. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer, even though it wasn&#x27;t my skin tone, I bought it anyway along with the darker one. I didn&#x27;t use this medium color, but I know this product is great from when I used the darker version.</li>
            <li> Best concealer out there. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It conceals great! :-)</li>
            <li> I live on this stuff! Greatest concealer ever! And if you have a boo boo it really heals it. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
