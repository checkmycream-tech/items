            <li> These work fine but I am not using them. I purchased them to use with homemade eye lash serum but the formula I had was awful. I hope to use these again when I find a better formula. You get a lot for your money with this package though!</li>
            <li> works for giving out Younique mascara samples</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE AND THE COLOR</li>
            <li> They work great for eye brows and for separating lashes that clump together.</li>
            <li> Their good, nothing bad to say</li>
            <li> Perfect for demos! Great value!</li>
            <li> I really love these for my business. I own a salon and these allow for sanitation but also great application.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased these wands for my eyelash extensions. They work great in combing them out and arranging them after I shower. I love them and I haven&#x27;t had to use news ones too often as the brushes are well made. They&#x27;re sturdy and the bristles last for a long time.</li>
            <li> These are perfect! I do eyelash extensions and I was running low on mascara wands but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $3.00 for only 10 wands, then I found these on here and beside the fact that they&#x27;re PINK! It was about $0.90 for 10. Very good deal and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> These are super high quality brushes.  I would definitely by these again!!</li>
            <li> Great wands for applying oils to lashes. Very safe and hygienic.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eye lids on one eye from an eye disorder. Oh how happy I was to find such a great disposable mascara wand. I can use this without any contamination to my eye. The wands are generous and I was glad to get makeup on again! They last a long time, if anyone is sensitive and worried about application, these are great for everyday use. The brush is super and makes the lashes look thick!</li>
            <li> Super cute and my clients were very pleased and thought they were cute.</li>
            <li> Delivered as described and promised, can be used for mascara, as well as applying coconut or castor oil to lashes at night as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> slightly larger and fuller than most disposable mascara brushes and the color shows clearly that the brush is fresh and unused</li>
            <li> I use them to brush my eyebrows as well and I loved them in pink easier to find in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Soft, pink &amp; perfect! My clients LOVE their little lash wands lol&lt;br /&gt;These are the ONLY ones I buy. Great value!</li>
            <li> Just received them and haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use them, however, I am sure they will be just GREAT  Thank U  : )</li>
