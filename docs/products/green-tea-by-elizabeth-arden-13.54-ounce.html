            <li>It is a wonderful addition to the Green Tea Spray.  </li>
            <li>It is a very light lotion that has, for me, a very quick and positive effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is absorbed very quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh scent, with a non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Cream dries quickly, isn&#x27;t sticky even in humid climate.</li>

            <li>very moisturizing but not buying anymore because of cost</li>
            <li>At first application I was a bit skeptical as it goes on strong and almost masculine smelling, but after 30 minutes it softens and smells nice.</li>
