            <li>I&#x27;m recommending this product over the national brands to my many clients now.</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Lisa d. Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would buy again, but would use a shampoo containing saw palmetto along with it for sure if you are looking to block DHT at the scalp.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I feel that my hair is &#x27;getting better&#x27;--I will buy more</li>
            <li>I would love if they had this product in a color safe line as well since I dye my hair from time to time.</li>
            <li>and since it&#x27;s 80% organic, you feel better about using it.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t LOST any more hair</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner line.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job</li>
            <li>RX4 stopped me from taking more losses...</li>
            <li>I purchased both the shampoo and the coordinating conditioner, and I LOVE them.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know for sure yet</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with the product</li>
            <li>but I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I hope to see more of an improvement in about 6 months.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an overnight magic pill, then go look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the quality of this and that it doesn&#x27;t contain all of the harmful chemicals that most hair products do.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the shampoo,conditioner and cream and could not be more pleased already.</li>
            <li>Its okay</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but, I hope it helps you :)</li>
            <li>I love how this conditioner complements the shampoo that goes with it.</li>
            <li>Well, she has been using this for almost a month and her hair is so much better than before.</li>
            <li>Overall, she&#x27;s very happy with the results she has gotten from the Rx 4 hair loss system (shampoo and conditioner).</li>
            <li>They work so much better as a team, and I&#x27;ve already noticed change in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>does mostly every hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i really love it</li>
            <li>really satisfied</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited about the possibilities it can give to many of my clients.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results I have so far and will continue to use it until I achieve my desired results!!</li>
            <li>I loved it after my first use.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve complimented the product saying it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is all natural and great for you and the environment.  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients and it smells great.</li>
            <li>so far it works great</li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product.</li>
            <li>Received it for special promotion pricing so can&#x27;t wait to see results!</li>
            <li>So far, I really love these products!!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product as it is very reasonably priced and you do not have to use very much at all to get great results.  </li>
            <li>Before I started using this line, I made sure my brush was clean (no hair in it)...</li>
            <li>has a strong scent feels like lemon and cinnamon unnaturally</li>
            <li>it is still a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I was initially attracted to these products because of the beautiful packaging.</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed with this shampoo and conditioner overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is wonderful, I will say it is a little thinner conditioner than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li>If you are shopping around weighing your options, I can safely say this is worth trying.</li>
            <li>and I really look forward to seeing what kind of change I&#x27;ll experience.  </li>
            <li>and Free Shipping.</li>
            <li>but SO worth it for the end result, and mostly rinses out with product.</li>
            <li>Great product I have only been using it for about a month</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Despite the smell, the hair feels so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got the shampoo &amp; the conditioner and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to be using it myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what my hair will look like after a month of using</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful thing as I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about my hair ever since I lost it all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about hair regrowth yet because I have not been able to use it long enough yet, but I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to my family and friends.  </li>
            <li>how often you wash your hair will determine if you need to do this for 3 min each or 5min of cool water(3or 5min)</li>
            <li>-lukewarm(3 or 5min)- cool water again.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged from doing to many things to it like Keratin Treatments and color.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, my wife loves it so much she stole it from me.</li>
            <li>It really works unlike most hair loss products out there.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>which I suppose will help tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I was pleasantly surprised and extremely happy with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I posted the same review on the shampoo, because I&#x27;m really quite happy with this brand.</li>
            <li>My anxiety in the shower is quickly fading since the hair loss while rinsing has diminished to almost nothing.</li>
            <li>but it gone away quickly after drying my the hair</li>
            <li>and they really are all natural which made me feel very confident about using this product on my hair.</li>
            <li>but it feels wonderful and a tiny bit goes a really long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo (and conditioner) for several weeks now and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>This is my first review EVER!  </li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels so far</li>
            <li>I have tried many professional brands and never have I seen results like this.</li>
            <li>The whole DHT blocker really must have something to it, because my hair just feels and looks better after using this.</li>
            <li>it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Cool water, lukewarm and then cool water again pending on how much product and</li>
            <li>Still looking for an effective product for &amp;#34;hereditary&amp;#34; female hair loss.</li>
            <li>and for that alone, the shampoo and conditioner is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>&gt; When I first tried the product, I did make the mistake of applying to much to the top of my head without coating the ends of my hair first (I have longer hair).  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with results so far.</li>
            <li>know this product line is kinda pricey, but (in my opinion) it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice a manageable when wet and brushing it out &amp; the tangles come out effortlessly w/o pulling my hair-nice a smooth.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner combined with the shampoo and scalp cream have slowed my hair loss down remarkably.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty loyal when I find a product that works</li>
            <li>I used them right away.  </li>
            <li>Also, sometimes, after I use this and the conditioner, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean like I&#x27;ve used too much product (like gel).  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I felt my hair was heavier after I washed with this condition with warm to hot water only.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell full of fragrance, very lite scented oils.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is not very thick but it still makes my hair easy to comb in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy, smells fresh and clean, works well as a detangler, and I can&#x27;t believe how shiny and healthy it makes my hair look!</li>
            <li>So far so good, I have just tried the conditioner for the first time just last night.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see a huge difference in the quality of her hair.</li>
            <li>Im most likely going to buy the shampoo very soon!</li>
            <li>I could see my scalp under all my hair in so many places especially on the sides.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>one of my clients first told me about this product about a year ago.</li>
            <li>Honestly not sure how much it does for hair loss if it is being caused by DHT, as I do not believe this contains saw palmetto, but great conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Below is my review of this product when I purchased it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you want to see some fast results.</li>
            <li>Not heavy on the hair, leaves hair knot free.  </li>
            <li>My hair is growing back and looking more healthier than before.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order again :)</li>
            <li>But make sure you wash the hair and following the instruction.</li>
            <li>This product does take some time and consistent use.</li>
            <li>Needless to say we will be buying a lot more of this Conditioner and the shampoo too!!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo works into a rich, luxurious lather, and conditioner leaves my hair silky soft to touch.</li>
            <li>Lemony smell, leaves the hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent and that it leaves my hair squeaky clean, but mostly the big reduction of hair \\&quot;fallout\\&quot; that I usually get in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The sent is not too strong and the conditioner feels very very smooth and thick.</li>
            <li>When my hair got dry after using them, I noticed that my hair got fuller and more volume.  </li>
            <li>The big bonus is how easy my hair is to style.  </li>
            <li>The bald spot on the back of my head use to be a huge embarrassment for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been thinning for a couple years now (too much stress from college)</li>
            <li>So I have to pay attention to rinse really well.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>This procuct really does work.  </li>
            <li>Like this conditioner do not need to use much and it does not leave your hair greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot believe how well this conditioner works.</li>
            <li>beauty about this product is you do not have to use a whole lot to get the job done, so it lasts longer&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Its texture is very interesting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t notice any difference by using this profuct.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner left my hair feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I have VERY noticeable VOLUME to my hair</li>
            <li>; much fuller to the eye.  </li>
            <li>It really does what the seller says it would.</li>
            <li>Since using this it has really turned everything around for me.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, as well.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I do really like the feel of my hair after using and it does feel somewhat healthier.</li>
            <li>I think it is reasonable price~~</li>
            <li>Priced in the same range as other similar conditioners and I have enjoyed it, just do not expect amazing hair loss results/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a lot more affordable than the other products out there</li>
            <li>After the first time, my hair felt fuller and soft.  </li>
            <li>Even though the smell is not like perfume smell, but it is really not bad, and it actually grows on me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li>This caused the top of my head to have a sticky residue after my hair dried.  </li>
            <li>When I reversed the process and applied the conditioner to the ends first and just applied a small amount to the top of my  head, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m told this is normal).  </li>
            <li>so they emailed me right back (within the day) to suggest trying putting it on at night, before bed, and then washing my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for the new scalp treatment to come out.  </li>
            <li>ugh....leaves the hair feeling yucky and doesn&#x27;t promote any new growth....</li>
            <li>I feel like a new person.</li>
            <li>My Naturopath says that I do have some new hair growth that was lost after he discovered that I had an infection in my hair follicules.  </li>
            <li>the product is okay for hair growth, not sold on re-growth and hard to lather on whole head.</li>
            <li>Although, the second bottle seems to be working just as well as the first one and by looking at the ingredients, nothing had changed.</li>
            <li>personally dont like orange scent at first</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong but seems to be working</li>
            <li>Left my hair dry and brittle, but I do have baby fine hair</li>
            <li>The first bottle of conditioner I received has a broken top and she refunded my money immediately.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the product when it was received, but after a few weeks of use, I am thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li>However, over the last 4-5 months, it&#x27;s really thinning.  </li>
            <li>My husband is genetic bald, I wonder if that will really help him grow hair back.</li>
            <li>It has now started growing back, I&#x27;m not losing as much</li>
            <li>I have been using the shampoo and condition for about 2+ months now and my hair is so soft and health.  </li>
            <li>No heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I was truly surprised</li>
            <li>I have been losing my hair for a short time now and it has really been taking a toll on my self esteem.</li>
            <li>As far as seeing any improvement with hair loss</li>
            <li>YEARS OLD.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend both the conditioner and shampoo as well as the seller to anyone who is looking to find something that works and gets shipped fast.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>When I saw that Rx 4 Hair Loss was promoting their hair loss shampoo and conditioner, I thought, hey this is what she needs for her hair since it has no sulphates, no parabens, no toxins and no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>My hair started getting thicker and fuller, and healthier with the natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s very odd and unfortunate that one of the best qualities of this product, the ginger/lemon like smell, is gone.</li>
            <li>One of the biggest surprises for me was that I thought hair loss was, for many years, almost entirely genetic, And it is, to a certain degree, but I was really hard on myself after realizing that some of this I did to myself over a long period of time by the shampoos and conditioners I used.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair that has been thinning a great deal the past few years.  </li>
            <li>With my dry hair it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li>Within the 11 days I&#x27;ve been using the entire system, I have not only seen new growth, but my hair looks and feels thicker than it ever has before-YAY!.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner itself doesn&#x27;t have that normal thick conditioner feel like other products, but it sure seems to work on the tangles.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s growing so much more faster than I expected, and usually it takes months for my hair to grow as</li>
            <li>its not like regular conditioner that almost suds and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>I chose this brand because they use only natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 28 years old and already losing hair</li>
            <li>Now I see long thick and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product a few months ago when it was first listed on amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair loss is down to what seems like absolute minimum.</li>
            <li>Whether its less than before, well not by much yet.</li>
            <li>Advice for anyone when using products without the sulfates and other mess in shampoos and conditioners, rinse your hair with cool water just like they do at salons.  </li>
            <li>After a few months I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t think my hair loss has gotten any worse, I believe this has really slowed it down and has strengthened the hair that I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always had thin &amp; fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Also I live in a state where they require us to take 3 minute showers because of drought, so I cannot use in the shower and cannot wash my hair in the sink due to back problems.</li>

            <li> This an absolute great product.</li>
            <li> love the way my hair and scalp feels after using this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recommending this product over the national brands to my many clients now.</li>
            <li> Sincerely, Lisa d. Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would buy again, but would use a shampoo containing saw palmetto along with it for sure if you are looking to block DHT at the scalp.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I feel that my hair is &#x27;getting better&#x27;--I will buy more</li>
            <li> I would love if they had this product in a color safe line as well since I dye my hair from time to time.</li>
            <li> and since it&#x27;s 80% organic, you feel better about using it.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t LOST any more hair</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner line.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job</li>
            <li> RX4 stopped me from taking more losses...</li>
            <li> I purchased both the shampoo and the coordinating conditioner, and I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know for sure yet</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with the product</li>
            <li> but I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I hope to see more of an improvement in about 6 months.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an overnight magic pill, then go look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I also love the way it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this and that it doesn&#x27;t contain all of the harmful chemicals that most hair products do.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo,conditioner and cream and could not be more pleased already.</li>
            <li> Its okay</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> but, I hope it helps you :)</li>
            <li> I love how this conditioner complements the shampoo that goes with it.</li>
            <li> Well, she has been using this for almost a month and her hair is so much better than before.</li>
            <li> Overall, she&#x27;s very happy with the results she has gotten from the Rx 4 hair loss system (shampoo and conditioner).</li>
            <li> They work so much better as a team, and I&#x27;ve already noticed change in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> does mostly every hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i really love it</li>
            <li> really satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited about the possibilities it can give to many of my clients.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results I have so far and will continue to use it until I achieve my desired results!!</li>
            <li> I loved it after my first use.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve complimented the product saying it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is all natural and great for you and the environment.  </li>
            <li> All natural ingredients and it smells great.</li>
            <li> so far it works great</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good product.</li>
            <li> Received it for special promotion pricing so can&#x27;t wait to see results!</li>
            <li> So far, I really love these products!!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as it is very reasonably priced and you do not have to use very much at all to get great results.  </li>
            <li> Before I started using this line, I made sure my brush was clean (no hair in it)...</li>
            <li> has a strong scent feels like lemon and cinnamon unnaturally</li>
            <li> it is still a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I was initially attracted to these products because of the beautiful packaging.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with this shampoo and conditioner overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is wonderful, I will say it is a little thinner conditioner than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> If you are shopping around weighing your options, I can safely say this is worth trying.</li>
            <li> and I really look forward to seeing what kind of change I&#x27;ll experience.  </li>
            <li> and Free Shipping.</li>
            <li> but SO worth it for the end result, and mostly rinses out with product.</li>
            <li> Great product I have only been using it for about a month</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Despite the smell, the hair feels so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got the shampoo &amp; the conditioner and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to be using it myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what my hair will look like after a month of using</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful thing as I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about my hair ever since I lost it all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about hair regrowth yet because I have not been able to use it long enough yet, but I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to my family and friends.  </li>
            <li> how often you wash your hair will determine if you need to do this for 3 min each or 5min of cool water(3or 5min)</li>
            <li> -lukewarm(3 or 5min)- cool water again.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged from doing to many things to it like Keratin Treatments and color.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my wife loves it so much she stole it from me.</li>
            <li> It really works unlike most hair loss products out there.</li>
            <li> It smells so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> which I suppose will help tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I was pleasantly surprised and extremely happy with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I posted the same review on the shampoo, because I&#x27;m really quite happy with this brand.</li>
            <li> My anxiety in the shower is quickly fading since the hair loss while rinsing has diminished to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> but it gone away quickly after drying my the hair</li>
            <li> and they really are all natural which made me feel very confident about using this product on my hair.</li>
            <li> but it feels wonderful and a tiny bit goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo (and conditioner) for several weeks now and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> This is my first review EVER!  </li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels so far</li>
            <li> I have tried many professional brands and never have I seen results like this.</li>
            <li> The whole DHT blocker really must have something to it, because my hair just feels and looks better after using this.</li>
            <li> it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Cool water, lukewarm and then cool water again pending on how much product and</li>
            <li> Still looking for an effective product for &amp;#34;hereditary&amp;#34; female hair loss.</li>
            <li> and for that alone, the shampoo and conditioner is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> &gt; When I first tried the product, I did make the mistake of applying to much to the top of my head without coating the ends of my hair first (I have longer hair).  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with results so far.</li>
            <li> know this product line is kinda pricey, but (in my opinion) it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice a manageable when wet and brushing it out &amp; the tangles come out effortlessly w/o pulling my hair-nice a smooth.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner combined with the shampoo and scalp cream have slowed my hair loss down remarkably.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty loyal when I find a product that works</li>
            <li> I used them right away.  </li>
            <li> Also, sometimes, after I use this and the conditioner, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean like I&#x27;ve used too much product (like gel).  </li>
            <li> My hair is clean and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I felt my hair was heavier after I washed with this condition with warm to hot water only.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell full of fragrance, very lite scented oils.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is not very thick but it still makes my hair easy to comb in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy, smells fresh and clean, works well as a detangler, and I can&#x27;t believe how shiny and healthy it makes my hair look!</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have just tried the conditioner for the first time just last night.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see a huge difference in the quality of her hair.</li>
            <li> Im most likely going to buy the shampoo very soon!</li>
            <li> I could see my scalp under all my hair in so many places especially on the sides.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> one of my clients first told me about this product about a year ago.</li>
            <li> Honestly not sure how much it does for hair loss if it is being caused by DHT, as I do not believe this contains saw palmetto, but great conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Below is my review of this product when I purchased it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you want to see some fast results.</li>
            <li> Not heavy on the hair, leaves hair knot free.  </li>
            <li> My hair is growing back and looking more healthier than before.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order again :)</li>
            <li> But make sure you wash the hair and following the instruction.</li>
            <li> This product does take some time and consistent use.</li>
            <li> Needless to say we will be buying a lot more of this Conditioner and the shampoo too!!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo works into a rich, luxurious lather, and conditioner leaves my hair silky soft to touch.</li>
            <li> Lemony smell, leaves the hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent and that it leaves my hair squeaky clean, but mostly the big reduction of hair \\&quot;fallout\\&quot; that I usually get in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The sent is not too strong and the conditioner feels very very smooth and thick.</li>
            <li> When my hair got dry after using them, I noticed that my hair got fuller and more volume.  </li>
            <li> The big bonus is how easy my hair is to style.  </li>
            <li> The bald spot on the back of my head use to be a huge embarrassment for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been thinning for a couple years now (too much stress from college)</li>
            <li> So I have to pay attention to rinse really well.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> This procuct really does work.  </li>
            <li> Like this conditioner do not need to use much and it does not leave your hair greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot believe how well this conditioner works.</li>
            <li> beauty about this product is you do not have to use a whole lot to get the job done, so it lasts longer&lt;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Its texture is very interesting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t notice any difference by using this profuct.  </li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner left my hair feeling silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I have VERY noticeable VOLUME to my hair</li>
            <li> ; much fuller to the eye.  </li>
            <li> It really does what the seller says it would.</li>
            <li> Since using this it has really turned everything around for me.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, as well.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I do really like the feel of my hair after using and it does feel somewhat healthier.</li>
            <li> I think it is reasonable price~~</li>
            <li> Priced in the same range as other similar conditioners and I have enjoyed it, just do not expect amazing hair loss results/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot more affordable than the other products out there</li>
            <li> After the first time, my hair felt fuller and soft.  </li>
            <li> Even though the smell is not like perfume smell, but it is really not bad, and it actually grows on me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li> This caused the top of my head to have a sticky residue after my hair dried.  </li>
            <li> When I reversed the process and applied the conditioner to the ends first and just applied a small amount to the top of my  head, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m told this is normal).  </li>
            <li> so they emailed me right back (within the day) to suggest trying putting it on at night, before bed, and then washing my hair in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for the new scalp treatment to come out.  </li>
            <li> ugh....leaves the hair feeling yucky and doesn&#x27;t promote any new growth....</li>
            <li> I feel like a new person.</li>
            <li> My Naturopath says that I do have some new hair growth that was lost after he discovered that I had an infection in my hair follicules.  </li>
            <li> the product is okay for hair growth, not sold on re-growth and hard to lather on whole head.</li>
            <li> Although, the second bottle seems to be working just as well as the first one and by looking at the ingredients, nothing had changed.</li>
            <li> personally dont like orange scent at first</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but seems to be working</li>
            <li> Left my hair dry and brittle, but I do have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> The first bottle of conditioner I received has a broken top and she refunded my money immediately.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product when it was received, but after a few weeks of use, I am thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> However, over the last 4-5 months, it&#x27;s really thinning.  </li>
            <li> My husband is genetic bald, I wonder if that will really help him grow hair back.</li>
            <li> It has now started growing back, I&#x27;m not losing as much</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and condition for about 2+ months now and my hair is so soft and health.  </li>
            <li> No heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I was truly surprised</li>
            <li> I have been losing my hair for a short time now and it has really been taking a toll on my self esteem.</li>
            <li> As far as seeing any improvement with hair loss</li>
            <li> YEARS OLD.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend both the conditioner and shampoo as well as the seller to anyone who is looking to find something that works and gets shipped fast.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> When I saw that Rx 4 Hair Loss was promoting their hair loss shampoo and conditioner, I thought, hey this is what she needs for her hair since it has no sulphates, no parabens, no toxins and no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> My hair started getting thicker and fuller, and healthier with the natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s very odd and unfortunate that one of the best qualities of this product, the ginger/lemon like smell, is gone.</li>
            <li> One of the biggest surprises for me was that I thought hair loss was, for many years, almost entirely genetic, And it is, to a certain degree, but I was really hard on myself after realizing that some of this I did to myself over a long period of time by the shampoos and conditioners I used.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that has been thinning a great deal the past few years.  </li>
            <li> With my dry hair it seems to work really well.</li>
            <li> Within the 11 days I&#x27;ve been using the entire system, I have not only seen new growth, but my hair looks and feels thicker than it ever has before-YAY!.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner itself doesn&#x27;t have that normal thick conditioner feel like other products, but it sure seems to work on the tangles.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s growing so much more faster than I expected, and usually it takes months for my hair to grow as</li>
            <li> its not like regular conditioner that almost suds and makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand because they use only natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 28 years old and already losing hair</li>
            <li> Now I see long thick and healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago when it was first listed on amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair loss is down to what seems like absolute minimum.</li>
            <li> Whether its less than before, well not by much yet.</li>
            <li> Advice for anyone when using products without the sulfates and other mess in shampoos and conditioners, rinse your hair with cool water just like they do at salons.  </li>
            <li> After a few months I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t think my hair loss has gotten any worse, I believe this has really slowed it down and has strengthened the hair that I have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had thin &amp; fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Also I live in a state where they require us to take 3 minute showers because of drought, so I cannot use in the shower and cannot wash my hair in the sink due to back problems.</li>
            <li> You do not use nearly the same amount as you&#x27;d use of any other shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner in combination with the shampoo and have a seen a marked difference in the area of my scalp where my hair was thinning due to menopause.</li>
            <li> I mean, it wouldn&#x27;t damage her hair and the ingredients are natural and organic, so that means no serious side effects.</li>
            <li> So far I have tried the product several times, I do feel less hair dropping when washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I was losing so much hair that the sides of my head where my hair is parted was getting small bald spots.</li>
            <li> and I can only imagine the long term effects of using this product</li>
            <li> First time I used it, when I brushed my hair, lots of hair came out and thought it was going to be another disappointment but after the second time, I noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out as much.</li>
            <li> I still use the shampoo and just a regular leave-in conditioner because my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Have already noticed marked improvement in the strength of my hair, and less fall out.</li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel like other conditioners in the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; so it more difficult to comb out after using the product.</li>
            <li> Probably twice the amount I would normally need with other hair products; and given the price, this is definitely a down side.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use I began to see new growth and in addition; the conditioner did not leave my hair in a greasy state as some other&#x27;s I had tried prior to finding this product.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have always lost a ton during showers and brushing.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m at a loss (excuse the pun)</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for long term results.</li>
            <li> I have LONG hair</li>
            <li> know this is a LONG review...</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice whether or not it has helped with hair growth, I have noticed that I seem to lose less hair on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I prefer something like this over dumping strange chemicals onto my scalp!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take very long before my hair started to feel healthier/stronger and fuller.</li>
            <li> when its dry..</li>
            <li> only used few times cannot see obvious result.</li>
            <li> It normally was brittle and would not grow long or thick..</li>
            <li> No new growth yet,</li>
            <li> No good to much money</li>
            <li> and it slows down daily.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s like 1/2 way down my back)</li>
            <li> The only down side for me is the smell...</li>
            <li> I try out a new product, I look for ingredients which are organic, nature-made-- no more toxins and other &#x27;hair banes&#x27;, as I&#x27;ve come to call them.</li>
            <li> I have only used it 3 time and have much less hair loss.</li>
            <li> You can leave it in if your hair is very dry</li>
            <li> and people are different, Jane Doe might see results in a month, but John Doe might see it in two months, so don&#x27;t get discouraged if it takes a little bit longer for you to see result on your hair.</li>
            <li> I started using this after reading all of the reviews because my normally very thick hair was really thinning out around my scalp.  </li>
            <li> started losing my hair due to rapid weight loss,thinning hair and dry</li>
            <li> One of the reasons they do this is so make sure none of the chemicals/Big name brand shampoo and conditioner will have a bad reaction with products you have saturated into your hair ex.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a bigger bottle, but that is just about my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Already feels fuller after only a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> So for the cost I really do not thing</li>
            <li> I bought this with the shampoo and I while I definitely noticed a reduction in shedding after just a couple of uses, I couldn&#x27;t deal with the heavy waxy residue the conditioner leaves</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because it is not really a conditioner.</li>
            <li> but that he&#x27;s not very fond of the smell (but that&#x27;s preference).</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s not much in it now.  </li>
            <li> I do have to use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep my hair moisturized because this conditioner is not very rich so leaves my hair a little dry&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try it, worse case scenario you&#x27;ll get a decent bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I even went to the doctor and had my thyroid tested and other blood tests done.  </li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> and it works just like any other shampoo</li>
            <li> , I usually don&#x27;t get suds until the 2nd time I wash, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it ripped out my hair other than making it grow</li>
            <li> Her hair is also not dry and it no longer looks dull nor lifeless.</li>
            <li> My part was getting very wide too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful about what I put on my hair and skin</li>
            <li> However, the reason I bought this system is that I recently went through a death in my family...and was having a hard time dealing.  </li>
            <li> and recently I have been losing my hair, which is common around this time postpartum.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to use another conditioner after using this, or at least for my hair which is curly.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, I am just sensitive to smells and even though this is natural ...</li>
            <li> As for me, I am not comfortable with the product because it does not work as it is expected.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this product as it has helped me to strengthen my hair and after 4 months my hair looks like its growing back slowly.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any results yet.. Will keep using but so far seems like my scalp eczema got even worse...</li>
            <li> after i  washed my hair i can tell my hair loss is down.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I was feeling really down when a friend of mine told me to try this product.</li>
            <li> Less in my brush .</li>
            <li> and I have noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> Notices less hair loss</li>
            <li> but I feel hair fell out less before use it.</li>
            <li> I noticed less fallout after a week of using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work less than a thicker conditioner.</li>
            <li> After using both the shampoo and conditioner for about 5 weeks now my hair seems fuller and I notice there is a lot less hair in my brush.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that over time less hair would to the shower floor.</li>
            <li> I have alopecia and I have noticed that with use of these products, my hair loss is less.  </li>
            <li> and I still use less shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot less breakage.  </li>
            <li> the thickness if my hair and even less &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; stray hairs that seem like they never grow.</li>
            <li> Not full looking at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little less than a month just for a time reference&lt;</li>
            <li> Hair feels a little fuller</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not rich</li>
            <li> Still a little shedding after shampooing, but nothing like it used to be.  </li>
            <li> She has very fragile, dry, thin hair and lately, she&#x27;s experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li> I got this product about a week ago and have used it everyday since.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not leave you hair feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I started to use the about 3 months back when I started to notice that my hair was beginning to thin and fall out in the shower.</li>
            <li> It will be a waste of time to whoever will be trying to use this product.</li>
            <li> and it does not feel heavy</li>
            <li> am not sure it helps to hair loss less</li>
            <li> Less in my brush AND my shower drain (yuck!).</li>
            <li> Not sure why but my drying times been cut in half.</li>
            <li> Used according to instructions, I had less hair fall but made my hair like straw and very limp.</li>
            <li> Does that mean there&#x27;s no validity to the other products, no they just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has none of the nasty chemicals that are found in most other shampoos, another plus for me!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for years to find something that would slow down my hair loss.</li>
            <li> I was a little uncomfortable using hair loss products, but I finally decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all organic (no counterproductive, nasty chemicals).</li>
            <li> I have used this often for the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I lost less hair, it seemed expensive for the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> It stinks really bad too compared with other natural DHT blockers.  </li>
            <li> For the last year I&#x27;ve been shedding so bad</li>
            <li> I am sorry not sure who is writing these reviews.</li>
            <li> I think the depression &amp; not taking care of myself for several weeks after caused my hair to really thin and start falling out :(  </li>
            <li> I never thought twice about it because as I said, I&#x27;ve always had very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> However, since day 1 when I started using this product, my pile of hair in the shower has decreased to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> This is my 5th child and I had never experienced this symptom and was mortified when it started to happen.</li>
            <li> It has decreased hair loss and will reorder soon.j</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re already dealing with hair loss, don&#x27;t make it worse with stinky hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a month and her hair loss has decreased dramatically; hopefully, it keeps improving.</li>
            <li> unfortunately for me it did not work</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and am balding.</li>
            <li> SO TRY THEM, YOU WILL NOT BE UNHAPPY  FAYE</li>
            <li> I will wait until summer to test out with cold water.</li>
            <li> So This product was too expensive and doesn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> I am so sad because I thought based on the reviews this might work :(</li>
            <li> I feel like those who wrote the reviews saying that the smell is bad, including myself, got the bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> hate the company and the product..</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> No one mentioned that the shampoo does not make any suds and both the shampoo and conditioner smell terrible.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is awful, making my hair snap off in shower, so drying and sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> So yes, I&#x27;ll stick with it and recommend it to those who want to get away  from all those nasty chemical-laden shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair more tangled</li>
            <li> So far so good! I got this product about a week ago and have used it everyday since. My hair already feels thicker and looks healthier. Being only 24, I don&#x27;t want to lose my hair. It&#x27;s been thinning for a couple years now (too much stress from college) but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the product! Im most likely going to buy the shampoo very soon!</li>
            <li> I have only used the product a couple of times as I just received it last week. My hair is medium length with a lot of wave. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel like other conditioners in the fact it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; so it more difficult to comb out after using the product. I do like the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based upon customer reviews.  No one mentioned that the shampoo does not make any suds and both the shampoo and conditioner smell terrible.  The conditioner smells to me like shoe polish.  Will not be buying this product again for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> I started using this after reading all of the reviews because my normally very thick hair was really thinning out around my scalp.  I could see my scalp under all my hair in so many places especially on the sides.  My part was getting very wide too.  I have long hair and have always lost a ton during showers and brushing.  I never thought twice about it because as I said, I&#x27;ve always had very thick hair.  However, over the last 4-5 months, it&#x27;s really thinning.  I can&#x27;t determine why my hair has been thinning.  I&#x27;m not stressed. I even went to the doctor and had my thyroid tested and other blood tests done.  Nothing!  However, since day 1 when I started using this product, my pile of hair in the shower has decreased to almost nothing.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s making my hair grow any faster, but it&#x27;s definitely preventing it from falling out, which I suppose will help tremendously.  I use both the Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only put 4 stars because I do have to use a lot of the product to get it through all my hair.  Probably twice the amount I would normally need with other hair products; and given the price, this is definitely a down side.  Also, sometimes, after I use this and the conditioner, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean like I&#x27;ve used too much product (like gel).  Kind of sticky feeling.  So I have to pay attention to rinse really well.  When I feel like it&#x27;s rinsed out, I rinse again.  Other then that, this stuff seems to work great.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Still need time. Only used for a month but seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I got a set of this hair cleaning product. I just finished reviewing the shampoo, you can see http://www.amazon.com/review/RI2P3IPLYH0OT/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm.  As I said, I am not fan of the smell, but the result is really amazing. After shampooing, I was hoping the conditioner would help the smell, but no, they smell the same. Not horrible, it is just weird. Despite the smell, the hair feels so clean and smooth. I really love the hair after using this shampoo set. They are &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and very smooth. Even though the smell is not like perfume smell, but it is really not bad, and it actually grows on me. I am so hooked! I love it. My hair is clean and very manageable. My husband is genetic bald, I wonder if that will really help him grow hair back. I can&#x27;t wait to see. I highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner set. I will definitely buy again. I got this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The above is my unbiased review for this product.</li>
            <li> unfortunately for me it did not work</li>
            <li> I use shampoo and conditioner together, after i  washed my hair i can tell my hair loss is down. Less in my brush . but the it doesn&#x27;t smell good though.</li>
            <li> Feels good, but I still needs time to prove it&#x27;s effect.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and I hope that there is some validity to the hair loss prevention side to it. I cannot honestly say that it has stopped my hair from falling out as it has been thinning for many years. I&#x27;ve read a lot about the benefits of blocking DHT in preventing hair loss but I&#x27;m at a loss (excuse the pun) to honestly say whether there is any truth to it. I think just like anything else it all depends on the person. I know that if I have a headache for instance, all the Aspirin &amp; Tylenol in the world doesn&#x27;t help me. Ibuprofen works better for me. Does that mean there&#x27;s no validity to the other products, no they just don&#x27;t work for me. Try it, worse case scenario you&#x27;ll get a decent bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner for a couple of weeks, I am very happy with the product. It is not too heavy, smells fresh and clean, works well as a detangler, and I can&#x27;t believe how shiny and healthy it makes my hair look! Although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice whether or not it has helped with hair growth, I have noticed that I seem to lose less hair on a daily basis. Great product, with good ingredients!</li>
            <li> Wow, I was pleasantly surprised and extremely happy with this conditioner.  I am using it in conjunction with the shampoo and all I can say is yes, yes, yes!  It works very well.  I have very long hair that has been thinning a great deal the past few years.  This conditioner does not leave you hair feeling heavy or greasy.  I had no problems with tangles at all.  I will continue to use this product as it is very reasonably priced and you do not have to use very much at all to get great results.  I don&#x27;t know about hair regrowth yet because I have not been able to use it long enough yet, but I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to my family and friends.  I will update my review after I have used it longer, but I am very impressed so far.</li>
            <li> With my dry hair it seems to work really well. It makes my hair feel soft and tangle free. I use it with the shampoo and it seems like its working already.</li>
            <li> I am sorry not sure who is writing these reviews. This stuff is awful, making my hair snap off in shower, so drying and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo seems to work well. Sending the conditioner back..</li>
            <li> Great product just love the way it smells and now hair stopped falling as it was before... Use with Shampoo... Just Love it....</li>
            <li> This procuct really does work.  After several weeks of use my hair is thickier and silkier.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon because I definately don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels so far and I have noticed less breakage. I have bleach blonde hair and definitely needed this product ! I hope for continued results with further use!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks using it, I have not seen any improvement on my hair loss, so, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a hair loss product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a really good conditioner, smells great, and leaves your hair soft and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 wks now and I&#x27;m beginning to notice a difference.  Hair feels a little fuller</li>
            <li> good. my friend like this</li>
            <li> Like this conditioner do not need to use much and it does not leave your hair greasy feeling. will keep you posted on hair loss.</li>
            <li> My hair tingles! I just tried it and haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I do feel tingling when use it so I think it works by stimulating the hair folllicles. Will follow up with my review in  month.  Received it for special promotion pricing so can&#x27;t wait to see results!</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot believe how well this conditioner works. I was skeptical about the product when it was received, but after a few weeks of use, I am thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> This an absolute great product. I was losing my hair from medications and alow thyroid. It has now started growing back, I&#x27;m not losing as much and it slows down daily.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good product.</li>
            <li> this is nice!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; must have</li>
            <li> I JUST SENT IN A REVIEW ON THE SHAMPOO , ITS GREAT.  AND THE CONDITIONER IS THE BEST TOO&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  THEY WORK TOGETHER THE BEST  SO TRY THEM, YOU WILL NOT BE UNHAPPY  FAYE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad a friend told me about this shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;m so happy with the results.  My hair looks and feels fuller and healthier already.  It smells so fresh and clean.  I&#x27;m very careful about what I put on my hair and skin so I read the ingredients and they really are all natural which made me feel very confident about using this product on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Lemony smell, leaves the hair feeling clean and soft.  Already feels fuller after only a few weeks of use.  Wish it came in a bigger bottle, but that is just about my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the shampoo, conditioner and scalp cream  in this brand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty about this product is you do not have to use a whole lot to get the job done, so it lasts longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started losing my hair due to rapid weight loss,thinning hair and dry scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing, conditioning and applying scalp cream, my hair feels a lot thicker and I can only imagine the long term effects of using this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my hair and scalp feels after using this product and I am happy I was given the opportunity to try try it knowing my hair issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t know if it makes your hair grow just yet but it feels wonderful and a tiny bit goes a really long way. I will update this review when the results are in.</li>
            <li> I got the shampoo &amp; the conditioner and so far I&#x27;m very pleased. All natural ingredients and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser, one of my clients first told me about this product about a year ago. When I recently did her hair I was surprised to see a huge difference in the quality of her hair. It normally was brittle and would not grow long or thick.. Now I see long thick and healthy hair. I&#x27;m recommending this product over the national brands to my many clients now. I&#x27;m excited to be using it myself. I have tried many professional brands and never have I seen results like this. I now tell my clients who need hair loss products about it...I&#x27;m very excited about the possibilities it can give to many of my clients.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with this shampoo and conditioner overall. I posted the same review on the shampoo, because I&#x27;m really quite happy with this brand. As a younger dude dealing with thinning hair it can be a pain finding a relatively affordable product that actually works while combating the ever growing bald spot. This stuff smells nice and has a good consistency that washes out easily.  After a few months I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t think my hair loss has gotten any worse, I believe this has really slowed it down and has strengthened the hair that I have. The whole DHT blocker really must have something to it, because my hair just feels and looks better after using this. I&#x27;m pretty loyal when I find a product that works and I&#x27;m really impressed with the natural ingredients. I prefer something like this over dumping strange chemicals onto my scalp! If you are shopping around weighing your options, I can safely say this is worth trying. This is a good product-</li>
            <li> as stated in the headline.. the product is okay for hair growth, not sold on re-growth and hard to lather on whole head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner in combination with the shampoo and have a seen a marked difference in the area of my scalp where my hair was thinning due to menopause. After a few weeks of use I began to see new growth and in addition; the conditioner did not leave my hair in a greasy state as some other&#x27;s I had tried prior to finding this product. I highly recommend this product! Sincerely, Lisa d. Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Feels unreal but does the job, even when you have chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> Honestly not sure how much it does for hair loss if it is being caused by DHT, as I do not believe this contains saw palmetto, but great conditioner.  Smells good and refreshing.  Priced in the same range as other similar conditioners and I have enjoyed it, just do not expect amazing hair loss results/rejuvenation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again, but would use a shampoo containing saw palmetto along with it for sure if you are looking to block DHT at the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and condition for about 2+ months now and my hair is so soft and health.  Notices less hair loss and I hope to see my hair become thicker with continued use.  Can&#x27;t wait for the new scalp treatment to come out.  I love the fact that this is all natural and great for you and the environment.  So far great product and great value!  Customer service is awesome and very courteous and prompt! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It is best product. very effective.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two weeks and I have a reduction in visible hair loss. Completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have use this for 1 month--I do feel my hair feels thicker--I feel that my hair is &#x27;getting better&#x27;--I will buy more</li>
            <li> Its texture is very interesting.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not rich but it made silky hair.&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong scent feels like lemon and cinnamon unnaturally but I can stand it during wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure it helps to hair loss less but I feel hair fell out less before use it.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are highly praised wife is a product</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t notice any difference by using this profuct.  So for the cost I really do not thing it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I had a child about 4 months ago and recently I have been losing my hair, which is common around this time postpartum. This is my 5th child and I had never experienced this symptom and was mortified when it started to happen. I was losing so much hair that the sides of my head where my hair is parted was getting small bald spots. Something had to be done!! So when I was offered this hair loss conditioner to purchase and review during a promotional period I jumped on it! The conditioner comes in a nice brown professional looking bottle and it smell really good!  I noticed less fallout after a week of using the conditioner. I also purchased the shampoo so using them together truly make a difference! I am happy with the results I have so far and will continue to use it until I achieve my desired results!! * I purchased this item to review during a promotional period and any opinions expressed are my own**</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to regrow my hair post chemo and it still seems to be falling out some. I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for a short time but I have noticed a decrease in the amount of hair that is falling out. This is such a wonderful thing as I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about my hair ever since I lost it all. I would love if they had this product in a color safe line as well since I dye my hair from time to time. I purchased this product at a promotional rate for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is wonderful, I will say it is a little thinner conditioner than I&#x27;m used to but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work less than a thicker conditioner.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  Advice for anyone when using products without the sulfates and other mess in shampoos and conditioners, rinse your hair with cool water just like they do at salons.  One of the reasons they do this is so make sure none of the chemicals/Big name brand shampoo and conditioner will have a bad reaction with products you have saturated into your hair ex. hairspray, gels, pomades, ...  Cool water, lukewarm and then cool water again pending on how much product and how often you wash your hair will determine if you need to do this for 3 min each or 5min of cool water(3or 5min) -lukewarm(3 or 5min)- cool water again.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing. its not like regular conditioner that almost suds and makes your hair soft. I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Might work for some others, but I didn&#x27;t see any improvements.</li>
            <li> After the first time, my hair felt fuller and soft.  The shampoo and conditioner work the best when used together.  I guess it would depend on your hair type but my hair is the fullest I&#x27;ve ever seen it.  I think it&#x27;s because my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down.  No heavy feeling.  So far, I&#x27;m very happy with the products and I hope it helps hair loss as good as it does volume.</li>
            <li> ugh....leaves the hair feeling yucky and doesn&#x27;t promote any new growth....</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have just tried the conditioner for the first time just last night.  The conditioner left my hair feeling silky and smooth.  Looking forward to seeing how it helps with the hair loss.</li>
            <li> Below is my review of this product when I purchased it for the first time.  Although, the second bottle seems to be working just as well as the first one and by looking at the ingredients, nothing had changed. So it&#x27;s very odd and unfortunate that one of the best qualities of this product, the ginger/lemon like smell, is gone. I purchased the restoration scalp cream at the same time and that still had the same smell.  I feel like those who wrote the reviews saying that the smell is bad, including myself, got the bad batch or something. I need to know if my next bottle is going to be the same or not because it&#x27;s almost that time again...Anywho, please continue for my review when I received the good batch. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the shampoo for about a week now and my hair stopped falling out! First time I used it, when I brushed my hair, lots of hair came out and thought it was going to be another disappointment but after the second time, I noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out as much. Then after the third time, I started seeing lots of baby hair growing every where. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you want to see some fast results. It&#x27;s also a lot more affordable than the other products out there and since it&#x27;s 80% organic, you feel better about using it.</li>
            <li> THIS CONDITIONER WORKS! I have very thin hair and am balding. I have nothing to say but good news for me with RX4 Hair Loss Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t LOST any more hair and I have VERY noticeable VOLUME to my hair; much fuller to the eye.  I was initially attracted to these products because of the beautiful packaging. I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> I was a little uncomfortable using hair loss products, but I finally decided to give it a try.  I chose this brand because they use only natural and organic ingredients.  I ordered both shampoo and conditioner and received them on the same day.  I used them right away.  When my hair got dry after using them, I noticed that my hair got fuller and more volume.  I was truly surprised and it was a good one.  I will definitely continue to use them.  They say it will take up to 90 days to see the maximum results and I really look forward to seeing what kind of change I&#x27;ll experience.  So far, I really love these products!!</li>
            <li> Not heavy on the hair, leaves hair knot free.  Doesn&#x27;t smell full of fragrance, very lite scented oils.  After using both the shampoo and conditioner for about 5 weeks now my hair seems fuller and I notice there is a lot less hair in my brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo (and conditioner) for several weeks now and absolutely love it!  Love the scent and that it leaves my hair squeaky clean, but mostly the big reduction of hair \\&quot;fallout\\&quot; that I usually get in the shower.  This shampoo has none of the nasty chemicals that are found in most other shampoos, another plus for me!  I would recommend this shampoo without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I like it so far it works great</li>
            <li> Not sure if I lost less hair, it seemed expensive for the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> Bought shampoo and conditioner.Its a must to buy both together.  Product works. It has decreased hair loss and will reorder soon.j</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner line. I started to use the about 3 months back when I started to notice that my hair was beginning to thin and fall out in the shower. It didn&#x27;t take very long before my hair started to feel healthier/stronger and fuller. I immediately noticed that over time less hair would to the shower floor. If you are in need of a shampoo and conditioner system to help strengthen and stop hair loss, you must try this one!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pretty impressed with this product. It really does what the seller says it would. It works great. I have been losing my hair for a short time now and it has really been taking a toll on my self esteem. I was feeling really down when a friend of mine told me to try this product. Since using this it has really turned everything around for me. I feel like a new person. My hair is growing back and looking more healthier than before. I no longer have been losing any hair. So I no longer have to worry about going bald. I am really happy that I bought this product. It really does a great job and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> No good to much money and it works just like any other shampoo</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner together.  I have alopecia and I have noticed that with use of these products, my hair loss is less.  I have also noticed some hair regrowth.  The scent is earthy, but nice.</li>
            <li> Very good. I loved it after my first use.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Makes my hair greasy.  No volume was added.</li>
            <li> and Free Shipping. One of the biggest surprises for me was that I thought hair loss was, for many years, almost entirely genetic, And it is, to a certain degree, but I was really hard on myself after realizing that some of this I did to myself over a long period of time by the shampoos and conditioners I used. They hurt me, I know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I try out a new product, I look for ingredients which are organic, nature-made-- no more toxins and other &#x27;hair banes&#x27;, as I&#x27;ve come to call them. RX4 stopped me from taking more losses...</li>
            <li> Used according to instructions, I had less hair fall but made my hair like straw and very limp. Not full looking at all. Still looking for an effective product for &amp;#34;hereditary&amp;#34; female hair loss.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the shampoo and I while I definitely noticed a reduction in shedding after just a couple of uses, I couldn&#x27;t deal with the heavy waxy residue the conditioner leaves so I stopped using it.  I still use the shampoo and just a regular leave-in conditioner because my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago when it was first listed on amazon. I purchased both the shampoo and the coordinating conditioner, and I LOVE them. I&#x27;ve noticed quite a difference in the 3-4 months I&#x27;ve used it. My hair loss is down to what seems like absolute minimum. Less in my brush AND my shower drain (yuck!). And my hair is the longest and fullest it&#x27;s been in forever. I love that it&#x27;s all organic (no counterproductive, nasty chemicals). The shampoo works into a rich, luxurious lather, and conditioner leaves my hair silky soft to touch. The smell is a bit medicine-e but SO worth it for the end result, and mostly rinses out with product. Shipping was fast, as well. I will definitely order again :)</li>
            <li> Awesome! My dad loves it</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because it is not really a conditioner. I have only used it several times so I don&#x27;t know for sure yet if in fact it prevents hair loss but I will give it the benefit of the doubt. You definitely need to use another conditioner after using this, or at least for my hair which is curly.</li>
            <li> Began using both this and the shampoo, approx six months ago. Have already noticed marked improvement in the strength of my hair, and less fall out. Extremely pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my dad and he&#x27;s been using it for 2 days now. He says that it feels nice when using it but that he&#x27;s not very fond of the smell (but that&#x27;s preference). Will update at a later date when he has had time to fully try this product out and see what results he gets.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a discounted price for this product in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> This product is used on the head for treating the hair. As for me, I am not comfortable with the product because it does not work as it is expected. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product because there is no guarantee that you can prevent hair loss. It will be a waste of time to whoever will be trying to use this product. You will still suffer from hair loss.</li>
            <li> Was a gift to my friends who suffer from hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;The notice referred a friend to listen to heart glad.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is i will hear from him when to leave a review.</li>
            <li> So far I have tried the product several times, I do feel less hair dropping when washing my hair. But make sure you wash the hair and following the instruction. I felt my hair was heavier after I washed with this condition with warm to hot water only. I will wait until summer to test out with cold water.</li>
            <li> Great product I have only been using it for about a month but I love the way it makes my hair feel. You can leave it in if your hair is very dry and it does not feel heavy it just takes away the frizz. As far as seeing any improvement with hair loss I can&#x27;t say that it has helped yet. My hair is very damaged from doing to many things to it like Keratin Treatments and color. I hope to see more of an improvement in about 6 months.</li>
            <li> The best product I have tried yet. I feel like I owe them ! I would recommend using this product as it has helped me to strengthen my hair and after 4 months my hair looks like its growing back slowly. This product does take some time and consistent use. If you are looking for an overnight magic pill, then go look elsewhere. Again REALLY excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  The smell  is wonderful and  my hair looks so good  when its dry.. I would reccomend  this products...</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this stuff! I also love the way it feels in my hair. The conditioner is not very thick but it still makes my hair easy to comb in the shower. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s helping because I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks. Every time I wash my hair it gets thinner &amp; thinner so I try to only wash it every 3rd day or so. I will write another review after I&#x27;ve been using it for another month or so to give feedback on my results. I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars at this point because I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s slowing my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my hair loss , I have finished almost one bottle but nothing good happened.</li>
            <li> and for that alone, the shampoo and conditioner is well worth the price.  Love the quality of this and that it doesn&#x27;t contain all of the harmful chemicals that most hair products do.  My Naturopath says that I do have some new hair growth that was lost after he discovered that I had an infection in my hair follicules.  So yes, I&#x27;ll stick with it and recommend it to those who want to get away  from all those nasty chemical-laden shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve tried for years to find something that would slow down my hair loss. This conditioner combined with the shampoo and scalp cream have slowed my hair loss down remarkably.  Still a little shedding after shampooing, but nothing like it used to be.  No new growth yet, but it has only been two months.  I will be patient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I first tried the product, I did make the mistake of applying to much to the top of my head without coating the ends of my hair first (I have longer hair).  This caused the top of my head to have a sticky residue after my hair dried.  When I reversed the process and applied the conditioner to the ends first and just applied a small amount to the top of my  head, I was pleasantly surprised. Even my teenaged son remarked on how good my hair smelled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;d like to comment on the EXCELLENT customer service I received from Michelle.  The first bottle of conditioner I received has a broken top and she refunded my money immediately.  I&#x27;d buy from this company any day!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my wife loves it so much she stole it from me. Needless to say we will be buying a lot more of this Conditioner and the shampoo too!!!</li>
            <li> Have not seen any results yet.. Will keep using but so far seems like my scalp eczema got even worse...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to help prevent hair loss, but honestly I haven&#x27;t seen it work for me yet.  It stinks really bad too compared with other natural DHT blockers.  My girlfriend immediately pointed that out.  If you&#x27;re already dealing with hair loss, don&#x27;t make it worse with stinky hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo,conditioner and cream and could not be more pleased already. I have only used it 3 time and have much less hair loss. I will do another review in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Its okay..I still noticed hair shedding in the shower..I think Bosely&#x27; 3 step is the best! i.e Shampoo, conditioner and Hair Thickening foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with shampoo and cream. Only two weeks in and it would be an understatement to say this is amazing. My anxiety in the shower is quickly fading since the hair loss while rinsing has diminished to almost nothing. For the last year I&#x27;ve been shedding so bad I didn&#x27;t want to wash my hair. I&#x27;m now following the directions and using the shampoo and conditioner 5x per week.  The big bonus is how easy my hair is to style.  Not sure why but my drying times been cut in half.</li>
            <li> I wonder what makes this product &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; as claimed. I have been using as directed  for almost a month and I have noticed no difference except for my head smelling like lemon furniture polish. I still experience hair loss after washing. Also I live in a state where they require us to take 3 minute showers because of drought, so I cannot use in the shower and cannot wash my hair in the sink due to back problems. So This product was too expensive and doesn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> I have only used one bottle but it does seem to improve the thinning crown and overall thickness.  Great product</li>
            <li> Tried both the shampoo and conditioner because of thinning hair and immediately noticed my hair looked and felt thicker! I will continue to use it for long term results. All I can say is the product works but you have to keep up with it and give it time to do what it is meant to do. I already have recommended it to family and friends who noticed the difference in my hair and wanted to know what I was using.</li>
            <li> Using three times a week prior to applying scalp cream. Satisfied with results so far.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the shampoo. I&#x27;ve never had healthier stronger hair. The bald spot on the back of my head use to be a huge embarrassment for me. I would always wear hats trying to hide it. Now I don&#x27;t need to do that anymore because my hair has grown back. I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from hair loss. It really works unlike most hair loss products out there.</li>
            <li> easy to use and wash, smells good. Like it!</li>
            <li> This is my first review EVER!  I&#x27;m not one to do reviews...but, some of them helped me decide to  try this product.  So, I thought I&#x27;d write a review to help those of you who are \\&quot;on the fence\\&quot; about ordering.  I have only been using this product for almost 2 weeks.  You should know I was kinda sceptical, too :) See, I am an instant gratification kinda girl.  I like to see results immediately-lol.  I actually waited until I got all three products:  the shampoo, conditioner and scalp cream.  I figured using them all together would work faster than using just the shampoo...and, it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had thin &amp; fine hair.  However, the reason I bought this system is that I recently went through a death in my family...and was having a hard time dealing.  I think the depression &amp; not taking care of myself for several weeks after caused my hair to really thin and start falling out :(  I have to admit...this product line has truly been a blessing!  Within the 11 days I&#x27;ve been using the entire system, I have not only seen new growth, but my hair looks and feels thicker than it ever has before-YAY!.  It&#x27;s crazy!!!  I reallly noticed it when I pull my hair back in a ponytail...I didn&#x27;t have to wrap the pontytail holder around my hair as many times as I had before-COOL! I also have a lot of body...it&#x27;s AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also should know...the customer service is AMAZING! They are there for you anytime you need help.  It blew me away!  I had been putting the scalp cream on at night and noticed that my hair was kinda greasy in the morning...so they emailed me right back (within the day) to suggest trying putting it on at night, before bed, and then washing my hair in the morning.  Worked like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this product line is kinda pricey, but (in my opinion) it is worth it.  You do not use nearly the same amount as you&#x27;d use of any other shampoo and conditioner.  They do suggest shampooing twice before conditioning...and I still use less shampoo.I have LONG hair (it&#x27;s like 1/2 way down my back)...and I only use about a dime-nickel size squirt.  So, that lets me know that it&#x27;ll last a while-woo hoo!  I do have to say, I usually don&#x27;t get suds until the 2nd time I wash, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.  Oooh...oooh...I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot less breakage.  Before I started using this line, I made sure my brush was clean (no hair in it)...and there&#x27;s not much in it now.  I&#x27;m excited to see what my hair will look like after a month of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a LONG review...but, I hope it helps you :) Good luck &amp; God bless!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just about 1 month and there is still the same amount of hair fall out.  I am so sad because I thought based on the reviews this might work :(</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair very smooth and smelling great!</li>
            <li> Good smell but too liquid Like water. only used few times cannot see obvious result.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND ALMOST 60+ YEARS OLD.  HE DOESN&#x27;T  LIKE TO HAVE SHAMPOO. BECAUSE AFTER SHAMPOO ALWAYS A LOT HAIR LOSE IN THE SHOW TUB.  BUT HE USE THE BEST HAIR LOSS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER, HE FEEL NOT LOOSE A LOT HAIR IN THE SHOWER TUB.  HE THINK THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER HELP. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but seems to be working</li>
            <li> I love how this conditioner complements the shampoo that goes with it. I definitely recommend this conditioner along with the shampoo to anyone who is having problems with hair loss. I was given this condition at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I definitely recommend both the conditioner and shampoo as well as the seller to anyone who is looking to find something that works and gets shipped fast. The sent is not too strong and the conditioner feels very very smooth and thick.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if this works for hair loss but it left my hair feeling like the product was still in it and the smell was like Pine sol.  I used it twice and i wont be using it anymore. Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product. Leaves my hair nice a manageable when wet and brushing it out &amp; the tangles come out effortlessly w/o pulling my hair-nice a smooth.  I like that the best.  The conditioner itself doesn&#x27;t have that normal thick conditioner feel like other products, but it sure seems to work on the tangles.  However, I still have hair loss every day (I&#x27;m told this is normal).  Whether its less than before, well not by much yet. I&#x27;ve just started using this product and the shampoo about 2 weeks ago, time will tell.  Over all, I do like this product.</li>
            <li> I have let my bf&#x27;s sister test this out (along with the shampoo) for her hair. Her hair is damaged from all the &#x27;relaxer&#x27; she&#x27;s been using on her hair. She has very fragile, dry, thin hair and lately, she&#x27;s experiencing hair loss. When I saw that Rx 4 Hair Loss was promoting their hair loss shampoo and conditioner, I thought, hey this is what she needs for her hair since it has no sulphates, no parabens, no toxins and no harsh chemicals. I mean, it wouldn&#x27;t damage her hair and the ingredients are natural and organic, so that means no serious side effects. Well, she has been using this for almost a month and her hair is so much better than before. Note that this is not going to work overnight and people are different, Jane Doe might see results in a month, but John Doe might see it in two months, so don&#x27;t get discouraged if it takes a little bit longer for you to see result on your hair. It&#x27;s been almost a month and her hair loss has decreased dramatically; hopefully, it keeps improving. Her hair is also not dry and it no longer looks dull nor lifeless. Give it another couple of months and her hair will be fully restored. Overall, she&#x27;s very happy with the results she has gotten from the Rx 4 hair loss system (shampoo and conditioner). I got this for a great deal for reviewing and testing purposes and I have witnessed my bf&#x27;s sister gets good result from the Rx 4 Hair Loss system, therefore I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Started the product a couple days ago it really good doesn&#x27;t burn made my hair shiny and look healthy</li>
            <li> hate the company and the product.. the product feels like your putting honey on ur hair... I feel like it ripped out my hair other than making it grow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 28 years old and already losing hair so I bought into this. Should have know better but have been sad about losing hair. This product does absolutely nothing. Didn&#x27;t even smell good. Worthless.</li>
            <li> I bought the conditioner and the shampoo. They work so much better as a team, and I&#x27;ve already noticed change in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s growing so much more faster than I expected, and usually it takes months for my hair to grow as does mostly every hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this definitely helped me get to the length that I wanted. My hair started getting thicker and fuller, and healthier with the natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it, my family also uses it because I keep it in the bathroom and they&#x27;ve complimented the product saying it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Left my hair dry and brittle, but I do have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> it is so good and i really love it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a month and can tell no difference in hair loss.  If after using for a longer period will update status.  I do really like the feel of my hair after using and it does feel somewhat healthier.</li>
            <li> i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
            <li> Works good so far&lt;br /&gt;Reduce my hair greasy and stay good in shape all day&lt;br /&gt;I personally dont like orange scent at first but it gone away quickly after drying my the hair&lt;br /&gt;overall really satisfied</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. Smells good, makes my hair very smooth. I only used it couple times, so can&#x27;t tell if it can stop my hair loss yet.</li>
            <li> This is very good!! I think it is reasonable price~~</li>
            <li> great quality hair loss condition&lt;br /&gt;- no parabens&lt;br /&gt;- smell is okay&lt;br /&gt;- using this in combination with the hair loss shampoo I have seen a difference in the amount of hair I shed&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve been using this for a little less than a month just for a time reference&lt;br /&gt;- I do have to use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep my hair moisturized because this conditioner is not very rich so leaves my hair a little dry&lt;br /&gt;received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I have used this often for the past couple of weeks. i&#x27;m already noticing a difference with I the thickness if my hair and even less &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; stray hairs that seem like they never grow. The only down side for me is the smell... it doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, I am just sensitive to smells and even though this is natural ... it is still a bit too strong for me.</li>
