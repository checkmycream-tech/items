            <li>The product worked great for hair removal.  </li>
            <li>I am SO happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great experience used it twice</li>
            <li>werewolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days the hairs stopped pouring forth from the pores and growth has been greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>that I know it is successful.</li>
            <li>It is really effective!</li>
            <li>If you are fair with black/dark hair this should work great for you.</li>
            <li>but for now it is doing me some good.</li>
            <li>There was stubble a good 12 hours after the 8 hours so we&#x27;ll see how it feels in the morning when I go to shave again.</li>
            <li>There was stubble a good 12 hours after the 8 hours so we&#x27;ll see how it feels in the morning when I go to shave again.</li>
            <li>not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>Awesome results even the first use!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>After the first three sessions I am happy to say I have seen the results I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave all of the time now!  </li>
            <li>I really am satisfied and looking forward results!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It does kind of catch you off guard when it pops you, but you will eventually get used to it, I did...</li>
            <li>The instruction manual and dvd in the box is for the I-Light Pro which is what the unit is, just purple instead of that rose color.</li>
            <li>meh, honestly I didn&#x27;t even feel a rubber band pinch.</li>
            <li>but warm.  </li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because there is still chance for the device to be effective.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use and the directions were helpful.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great in the winter, horribly hot in the CArolina summer.</li>
            <li>Nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This has been a worthwhile purchase for me.</li>
            <li>I am hoping with more use it will do more to kill the hair</li>
            <li>DO NOT LOOK AT THE LIGHT, IT COULD BURN YOUR EYES!</li>
            <li>Not to mention how you dread anyone touching your face or even looking that close.</li>
            <li>I love this machine.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you are thinking as you read reviews about this product \\&quot;okay</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like going to bed feeling nice and smooth and then having cactus legs in the morning.</li>
            <li>I took out a pair of tweezers and couldn&#x27;t resist...pulled on another one (more like pinched,</li>
            <li>Maybe a one or two more?</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I bought this wacky contraption.</li>
            <li>Better get to it....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will have to follow up</li>
            <li>my favorite part of this machine is the plug-in, that there are no troubles with charging batteries and</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S ALREADY REMOVED MORE HAIR IN A MONTH -</li>
            <li>Gotta love that prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Also i read it in so many places that the cartridge they supply with the machine is mostly faulty.</li>
            <li>However, I recently went to the Lake and realized I had forgotten to shave when to my very happy surprise</li>
            <li>That might be the reason for better results than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>using the item for awhile, I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I can tell for sure is:&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I think I will soon be able to make a statement</li>
            <li>It was just the stubborn chest and stomach area, which is never shaved that caused the most pain.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Indeed a better investment than the IPL 6000 that is not Plus.</li>
            <li>but it sure felt like it would -</li>
            <li>and I still can&#x27;t be sure I didn&#x27;t miss a spot -</li>
            <li>I love it and think I will have better and better results as I keep using it.</li>
            <li>However, I find it to be relaxing and actually kind of fun!</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing pretty good...</li>
            <li>On their skin tone chart I am probably about a 2, so I am a pretty good candidate to see results from</li>
            <li>It is SOOO worth it!!</li>
            <li>I love the remington... easy to use once you get the angle.  </li>
            <li>I felt my legs and for the most part they were smooth.  </li>
            <li>The bulbs burn out VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>I-Light Pro Plus Permanent Hair Reduction System works perfectly easy to understand how to use it.</li>
            <li>The process was so easy.  </li>
            <li>but I know people that have been more patient with paying doctors and scheduling appointments, and I did this on my time in my own home, and for a decent price (compared to what pros charge).  </li>
            <li>It seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>The replacement ones are fine.</li>
            <li>Worthy of your $300 :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see if this makes a huge difference, say 6 months from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it, and find it is worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like I said, I bought this primarily for my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I bought this primarily for my face and neck.</li>
            <li>stayed smooth and stubble-free for about a month.</li>
            <li>The machine was making sound and beeping when put on skin but no flash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this item for a few months now, and I&#x27;m extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always great to find a product that actually does what it says it will, and does it beyond expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Venus razors ...</li>
            <li>When you use it, you need to place the light on your skin and wait for the \\&quot;chirp\\&quot;; once it sounds, you can press the button to make the light work.</li>
            <li>However, my armpits and my stomach are now hair free</li>
            <li>This one with the quartz light will have faster and permanent results.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would permanently remove hair and would work great with my skin tone and hair color, but the hair just keeps coming back.</li>
            <li>3/23/15 - Just got it yesterday but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The tone corresponds to about their second best for this purpose, or even slightly lighter, but not as light as the very first.&lt;br /&gt;(there is a scale of 1-2-3-4 suitable skin tones, with 1 to be the most suitable and 4 to be the border-line suitable tone, mine is two)&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>I think its very important before the first treatment.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this machine and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li>In addition, it seems to have permanently thinned the hair on all of the areas I&#x27;ve used it, which is a pleasant surprise to me since my hair is really light, especially on my arms.</li>
            <li>As I am dark-haired, light skin, it is true helping hand for me.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t regret the original purchase.</li>
            <li>You assume that this one must be more powerful, right?</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pretty fair with dark hair, and i also always put the strength on the highest level, so i&#x27;m definitely set up to get the best results.</li>
            <li>And you all have heard of the full body scanners that catch every clot and cancer bump you might have, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i can go the whole season w/o shaving... :)</li>
            <li>However I have read reviews on all the different systems and I think this is about as good as it gets when you use the system at home.</li>
            <li>It was actually very fun and exciting.</li>
            <li>Super Seeeeexy,</li>
            <li>I am Asian with kind of light brown skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the issue with the bulb running out: yeah, maybe they run out quickly?</li>
            <li>The hair is also more willing to stop growing after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>Those parts where the hair came out are still pretty hair free (about a month</li>
            <li>You could almost get a plastic surgeon to do a full skin graft, it would seem (not that that would be a fun or viable</li>
            <li>Remember how excited you were growing your first pubes?</li>
            <li>Plus, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>The I-Light Pro Plus is 100% worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The description of feeling as if you&#x27;re getting snapped with a rubber band was spot on and takes some getting used to but worth the ending</li>
            <li>As time goes by and I complete more rounds of treatment, I&#x27;ll update you of my progress.</li>
            <li>I probably wasn&#x27;t as meticulous as I could have been as far as making sure I got every inch but</li>
            <li>I probably wasn&#x27;t as meticulous as I could have been as far as making sure I got every inch but</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work worth a darn.  </li>
            <li>NO GAIN - WORTH</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li>, I think the light flash bothered me more than the actual pain.</li>
            <li>but it is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li>Directions clearly state not to use more than once every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Those results alone were worth the price of this machine.</li>
            <li>I started picking at one and it slid right out of my skin, literally GLIDED out.</li>
            <li>These products are cheaply made in China, and then sold here at high prices.</li>
            <li>light window is pretty small, and I have found it best to do three pulses on an area before moving on to the next area, so it takes some time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve done professional hair removal before and the shock from this machine isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work or not, but so far it seems to be.</li>
            <li>I even used up one light lifespan and bought a replacement light with the same results.</li>
            <li>I say for the most part because as I had mentioned before I am very sensitive to this and am only able to do a portion of my legs at a time... i quickly found out that I was going over the same portion of the leg because it was smooth</li>
            <li>The first week was on the lightest setting.</li>
            <li>The only difference in the two units is one costs about 70 dollars more.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to take the risk.</li>
            <li>goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;approx 8 hours after the first treatment, it seemed like the hair was &#x27;stunned&#x27;.</li>
            <li>goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;approx 8 hours after the first treatment, it seemed like the hair was &#x27;stunned&#x27;.</li>
            <li>So I invested in the machine and did it exactly as she said.</li>
            <li>I can attest that the highest setting zap on the I-Light is absolutely comparable to the medspa - YOWEE!</li>
            <li>So far I have gone through 4 light cartridges on my chest with zero results.</li>
            <li>: I just used this for the first time after reading the instructions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**2 weeks after first treatment*&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first time I used it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give a first time</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to know how much time and money I was wasting!</li>
            <li>had my first treatment 11 days ago</li>
            <li>worked exactly that the remington saids</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two months exactly as directed, still hair growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blonde with light skin that is easily irritated, so I have gotten dozens of professional IPL treatments to reduce irritation and lighten freckles and discolorations over the years.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t promise much of the result within first weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, as a small personal in home machine/device, I love the fact that I can use it on my schedule and in my own home instead of having to go to a clinic/office.  </li>
            <li>Used the first light for two session doing both legs completly, bikini area and armpits am current on my second light and completed one session with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice to know the power output of this little baby, as that erases any lingering doubts I had about efficacy.</li>
            <li>(I have a pretty high pain tolerance though.)</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this product - it is much cheaper than laser hair removal at a spa/clinic and I feel works just as well.  </li>
            <li>I still have to touch up and shave in situations when I definitely don&#x27;t want stubble, BUT it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Since this device costs about as much as 2 pro treatments, I figured why not give it a shot?</li>
            <li>I was nervous about using this product because of my very lacking pain tolerance but did not have any issues and if you did there is adjustable strength levels.</li>
            <li>Now I can go 2 or 3 days without shaving and still not have as much growth as I did after 12 hours of not shaving.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise it worked.</li>
            <li>and I also made sure my eyes were closed and looking away each time it flashed.</li>
            <li>and I also made sure my eyes were closed and looking away each time it flashed.</li>
            <li>, I get that there&#x27;s not as much of it, but</li>
            <li>It was much softer.</li>
            <li>THAT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>and I am ready to give up.</li>
            <li>Used a 2/5 setting - felt absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it really does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Currently on treatment 1 getting ready for 2.</li>
            <li>Hi, i need to buy a light only because turn off, how can i do?</li>
            <li>Because I was sensitive to the product I was initially only able to do a portion of my leg at a time.  </li>
            <li>Sorry guys if you are waiting for a more definitive evaluation, I am just trying to be honest.</li>
            <li>Their big 50% off promo was for the first treatment!!</li>
            <li>overall the product is fine so far but the cartridge went bust within the first 5 flashes.</li>
            <li>It still feels a little like a rubber band snapping lightly on the skin, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Although I was originally suspicious of its effectiveness, this product definitely works in reducing hair growth.</li>
            <li>Obviously, this is much more affordable than professional hair removal and its really not hard to do it on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this product u just have to use it weekly the first 2 months and then as needed for 6 months to get the hairs in the right stage of growth</li>
            <li>I had always wanted to try professional laser hair removal but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend the money so thought I would try the I-Light.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my leg first which I had shaved nearly 14 hours before.</li>
            <li>I had no stubble yet which is unusual for 8 hours when I normally shave.</li>

            <li>I had no stubble yet which is unusual for 8 hours when I normally shave.</li>
            <li>well I hope if after time there will be less hair I will be able to increase the power</li>
            <li>so I went around the backside of the laser&#x27;s main floor stand and saw that it was manufactured in 2006 and put out 70 joules per flash.</li>
            <li>The main reason I got this was to remove unwanted hair from my face.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product!ve to keep my razor around if I miss a spot, but that doesn&#x27;t happen often ...</li>
            <li>first experience with it was positive and it only took me like...5 minutes to treat what I wanted to treat.</li>
            <li>first experience with it was positive and it only took me like...5 minutes to treat what I wanted to treat.</li>
            <li>At first, I was pressing it pretty hard against my skin to get the sound.</li>
            <li>But a few days of discomfort, for greatly rediced hair growth and the ability to show off your hard earned 6 pack abs is well worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Does not slow my hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m not seeing much progress on legs and underarms, but I&#x27;m a patient gal.  </li>
            <li>do think that with regular use, pretty much all the hair would be gone.</li>
            <li>Starting working on the lower leg - about 50% success after two treatments.  </li>
            <li>Overall, completely worth it</li>
            <li>Overall, completely worth it</li>
            <li>I have had laser done professionally and this item does just as good a job for less money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yet when I opened the box, it says it right on the outside.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; to do it on a second power adjustment, so I did it on the first setting yet, I know that it is the least effective,</li>
            <li>I used it maybe 4 times and it quit working because it needs a new bulb.</li>
            <li>next time I&#x27;ll be more careful.</li>
            <li>next time I&#x27;ll be more careful.</li>
            <li>It was VERY clear that they weren&#x27;t attached to anything, and they literally slid out of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have light skin with dark hair, and it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>After my first and second treatments I had nothing...</li>
            <li>It says that you will not see results until the 2nd treatment, but I felt like I saw results the week of the first treatment.  </li>
            <li>(Except in one small spot which I&#x27;m sure I missed).</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working!</li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s going to take some time to work if for no other reason than it hurts a lot less than the treatments that I received in an office but as long as it works in the long run I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work a little bit (made some patchy hairless areas) but even after doing it about twice as much as recommended the hair all grew back pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>First of all, this product states that you can get at least 1,500 pulse of light from the lamp.</li>
            <li>My light is still working and my hair is 85% less .</li>
            <li>I tried a higher level at first and it hurt my skin, however, I turned down the machine to a lower level and had no problem after that.  </li>
            <li>there is less surface area to cover, and a larger person will use more.</li>
            <li>Its just hard for me to be sure and cover every area</li>
            <li>instructions are clear, I&#x27;ve read them all throughout and did it all right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 2 times so far</li>
            <li>and i surprised to find 40%-50% hair reduction in some areas of my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>I have used this 3 times so far about a week apart.</li>
            <li>THE HEFT PRICE - AS FAR AS MY RESEARCH GOES</li>
            <li>So, as far as pain goes, it can be managed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m only doing the right side of each area, to judge if it&#x27;s actually working vs. the unzapped side.  </li>
            <li>First  I have read every single word in the manual.</li>
            <li>no more &amp;#34;scary man with the hairy back at the pool.&amp;#34; I am excited to see what will happen after a few more uses.</li>
            <li>Other products haven&#x27;t worked out well for me in the past, but I&#x27;m glad this one did!</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical when I first got this product and nervous about using it, however I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s good, my hairs are dark and thick, some pores have 2-3 hairs, go figure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use on full power with little discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li>That is absolutely not true, you are lucky if you get 50.</li>
            <li>So I went into a laser shop because the light aperture is so small on the Remington (my only complaint) that even if I got someone to do my back with the handheld unit I do not think it could be done effectively.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their normal back treatments are $500 and they recommend 10 of them at 6 week intervals.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty fine and not really that thick.</li>
            <li>So like many of you I was skeptical, so after using the product I really wanted to leave a review.</li>
            <li>Having spent a bundle on professional laser hair removal for underarms and bikini this product is a real deal.  </li>
            <li>Like what many have complained, this unit only lasted for about 30 flashes.  </li>
            <li>, I did underarms and front bikini only, to give it a real test on those areas, so that I am not running out of flashes before the actual result can be</li>
            <li>This item was a major purchase, for me.</li>
            <li>There were noticeable patches that hadn&#x27;t grown any hair back at all, then some spots where the hair grew back but was very fine and thin, hardly noticeable, it seemed to work better under my arms than on my bikini area.</li>
            <li>Due to those two major cons and positive feedback from friends, I made the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bikini neighborhood is clearly showing results, I&#x27;d say a 25% reduction after only 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that there was quite a sting when I put it to my skin for the treatment but had to remind myself that this is an actual laser, it is a home product</li>
            <li>, I found it to be kind of scary before I tried it.</li>
            <li>, I found it to be kind of scary before I tried it.</li>
            <li>first day my skin cried out in pain because it was so used to being covered in the thick bushy hair the nerves were not used to so much stimulation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here looking for a good product and am annoyed annoyed that Amazon doesn&#x27;t do more to prevent this waste of our time.</li>
            <li>I am a (dang near albino) white female.</li>
            <li>mailing it back to Remington (apparently at my cost!)</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I was a little nervous to buy &amp; use this product at first.</li>
            <li>a single hair has fallen from me so far!</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used this on my neck, chin (gross I know, but remember My Big Fat Greek Wedding?), under my arms and started using it in my private areas/legs</li>
            <li>The professional service lasted 8 months and although I needed to shave less often, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results (80% hair removal is not good enough).  </li>
            <li>About 20 or less on first use, then only 10 flashes on second use (1 week later).  </li>
            <li>upper lip is completely bare and bikini area only grows back in patches.  </li>
            <li>Original instructions not good for second use not recommended.</li>
            <li>It is far less painful(and far longer lasting) than waxing any area.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old and had developed black facial hair on my lip, chin and neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, it seemed a little intimidating, but the instruction booklet explained the process really well and let me know what to expect.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fair skinned white person trying to zap blonde hairs stop giving this thing bad reviews, read the description.</li>

            <li> Great experience used it twice</li>

            <li> If you are fair with black/dark hair this should work great for you.</li>
            <li> but for now it is doing me some good.</li>
            <li> There was stubble a good 12 hours after the 8 hours so we&#x27;ll see how it feels in the morning when I go to shave again.</li>
            <li> There was stubble a good 12 hours after the 8 hours so we&#x27;ll see how it feels in the morning when I go to shave again.</li>
            <li> not as good as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Awesome results even the first use!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> After the first three sessions I am happy to say I have seen the results I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave all of the time now!  </li>
            <li> I really am satisfied and looking forward results!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It does kind of catch you off guard when it pops you, but you will eventually get used to it, I did...</li>
            <li> The instruction manual and dvd in the box is for the I-Light Pro which is what the unit is, just purple instead of that rose color.</li>
            <li> meh, honestly I didn&#x27;t even feel a rubber band pinch.</li>
            <li> but warm.  </li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because there is still chance for the device to be effective.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use and the directions were helpful.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great in the winter, horribly hot in the CArolina summer.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This has been a worthwhile purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I am hoping with more use it will do more to kill the hair</li>
            <li> DO NOT LOOK AT THE LIGHT, IT COULD BURN YOUR EYES!</li>
            <li> Not to mention how you dread anyone touching your face or even looking that close.</li>
            <li> I love this machine.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you are thinking as you read reviews about this product \\&quot;okay</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like going to bed feeling nice and smooth and then having cactus legs in the morning.</li>
            <li> I took out a pair of tweezers and couldn&#x27;t resist...pulled on another one (more like pinched,</li>
            <li> Maybe a one or two more?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad I bought this wacky contraption.</li>
            <li> Better get to it....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will have to follow up</li>
            <li> my favorite part of this machine is the plug-in, that there are no troubles with charging batteries and</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S ALREADY REMOVED MORE HAIR IN A MONTH -</li>
            <li> Gotta love that prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Also i read it in so many places that the cartridge they supply with the machine is mostly faulty.</li>
            <li> However, I recently went to the Lake and realized I had forgotten to shave when to my very happy surprise</li>
            <li> That might be the reason for better results than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> using the item for awhile, I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I can tell for sure is:&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I think I will soon be able to make a statement</li>
            <li> It was just the stubborn chest and stomach area, which is never shaved that caused the most pain.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Indeed a better investment than the IPL 6000 that is not Plus.</li>
            <li> but it sure felt like it would -</li>
            <li> and I still can&#x27;t be sure I didn&#x27;t miss a spot -</li>
            <li> I love it and think I will have better and better results as I keep using it.</li>
            <li> However, I find it to be relaxing and actually kind of fun!</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing pretty good...</li>
            <li> On their skin tone chart I am probably about a 2, so I am a pretty good candidate to see results from</li>
            <li> It is SOOO worth it!!</li>
            <li> I love the remington... easy to use once you get the angle.  </li>
            <li> I felt my legs and for the most part they were smooth.  </li>
            <li> The bulbs burn out VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> I-Light Pro Plus Permanent Hair Reduction System works perfectly easy to understand how to use it.</li>
            <li> The process was so easy.  </li>
            <li> but I know people that have been more patient with paying doctors and scheduling appointments, and I did this on my time in my own home, and for a decent price (compared to what pros charge).  </li>
            <li> It seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> The replacement ones are fine.</li>
            <li> Worthy of your $300 :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see if this makes a huge difference, say 6 months from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it, and find it is worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like I said, I bought this primarily for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I bought this primarily for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> stayed smooth and stubble-free for about a month.</li>
            <li> The machine was making sound and beeping when put on skin but no flash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for a few months now, and I&#x27;m extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always great to find a product that actually does what it says it will, and does it beyond expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Venus razors ...</li>
            <li> When you use it, you need to place the light on your skin and wait for the \\&quot;chirp\\&quot;; once it sounds, you can press the button to make the light work.</li>
            <li> However, my armpits and my stomach are now hair free</li>
            <li> This one with the quartz light will have faster and permanent results.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would permanently remove hair and would work great with my skin tone and hair color, but the hair just keeps coming back.</li>
            <li> 3/23/15 - Just got it yesterday but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The tone corresponds to about their second best for this purpose, or even slightly lighter, but not as light as the very first.&lt;br /&gt;(there is a scale of 1-2-3-4 suitable skin tones, with 1 to be the most suitable and 4 to be the border-line suitable tone, mine is two)&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> I think its very important before the first treatment.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this machine and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> In addition, it seems to have permanently thinned the hair on all of the areas I&#x27;ve used it, which is a pleasant surprise to me since my hair is really light, especially on my arms.</li>
            <li> As I am dark-haired, light skin, it is true helping hand for me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t regret the original purchase.</li>
            <li> You assume that this one must be more powerful, right?</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pretty fair with dark hair, and i also always put the strength on the highest level, so i&#x27;m definitely set up to get the best results.</li>
            <li> And you all have heard of the full body scanners that catch every clot and cancer bump you might have, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i can go the whole season w/o shaving... :)</li>
            <li> However I have read reviews on all the different systems and I think this is about as good as it gets when you use the system at home.</li>
            <li> It was actually very fun and exciting.</li>
            <li> Super Seeeeexy,</li>
            <li> I am Asian with kind of light brown skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the issue with the bulb running out: yeah, maybe they run out quickly?</li>
            <li> The hair is also more willing to stop growing after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> Those parts where the hair came out are still pretty hair free (about a month</li>
            <li> You could almost get a plastic surgeon to do a full skin graft, it would seem (not that that would be a fun or viable</li>
            <li> Remember how excited you were growing your first pubes?</li>
            <li> Plus, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> The I-Light Pro Plus is 100% worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The description of feeling as if you&#x27;re getting snapped with a rubber band was spot on and takes some getting used to but worth the ending</li>
            <li> As time goes by and I complete more rounds of treatment, I&#x27;ll update you of my progress.</li>
            <li> I probably wasn&#x27;t as meticulous as I could have been as far as making sure I got every inch but</li>
            <li> I probably wasn&#x27;t as meticulous as I could have been as far as making sure I got every inch but</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work worth a darn.  </li>
            <li> NO GAIN - WORTH</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li> , I think the light flash bothered me more than the actual pain.</li>
            <li> but it is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li> Directions clearly state not to use more than once every 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Those results alone were worth the price of this machine.</li>
            <li> I started picking at one and it slid right out of my skin, literally GLIDED out.</li>
            <li> These products are cheaply made in China, and then sold here at high prices.</li>
            <li> light window is pretty small, and I have found it best to do three pulses on an area before moving on to the next area, so it takes some time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve done professional hair removal before and the shock from this machine isn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work or not, but so far it seems to be.</li>
            <li> I even used up one light lifespan and bought a replacement light with the same results.</li>
            <li> I say for the most part because as I had mentioned before I am very sensitive to this and am only able to do a portion of my legs at a time... i quickly found out that I was going over the same portion of the leg because it was smooth</li>
            <li> The first week was on the lightest setting.</li>
            <li> The only difference in the two units is one costs about 70 dollars more.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to take the risk.</li>
            <li> goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;approx 8 hours after the first treatment, it seemed like the hair was &#x27;stunned&#x27;.</li>
            <li> goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;approx 8 hours after the first treatment, it seemed like the hair was &#x27;stunned&#x27;.</li>
            <li> So I invested in the machine and did it exactly as she said.</li>
            <li> I can attest that the highest setting zap on the I-Light is absolutely comparable to the medspa - YOWEE!</li>
            <li> So far I have gone through 4 light cartridges on my chest with zero results.</li>
            <li> : I just used this for the first time after reading the instructions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**2 weeks after first treatment*&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first time I used it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give a first time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to know how much time and money I was wasting!</li>
            <li> had my first treatment 11 days ago</li>
            <li> worked exactly that the remington saids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two months exactly as directed, still hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde with light skin that is easily irritated, so I have gotten dozens of professional IPL treatments to reduce irritation and lighten freckles and discolorations over the years.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t promise much of the result within first weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, as a small personal in home machine/device, I love the fact that I can use it on my schedule and in my own home instead of having to go to a clinic/office.  </li>
            <li> Used the first light for two session doing both legs completly, bikini area and armpits am current on my second light and completed one session with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nice to know the power output of this little baby, as that erases any lingering doubts I had about efficacy.</li>
            <li> (I have a pretty high pain tolerance though.)</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this product - it is much cheaper than laser hair removal at a spa/clinic and I feel works just as well.  </li>
            <li> I still have to touch up and shave in situations when I definitely don&#x27;t want stubble, BUT it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Since this device costs about as much as 2 pro treatments, I figured why not give it a shot?</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using this product because of my very lacking pain tolerance but did not have any issues and if you did there is adjustable strength levels.</li>
            <li> Now I can go 2 or 3 days without shaving and still not have as much growth as I did after 12 hours of not shaving.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise it worked.</li>
            <li> and I also made sure my eyes were closed and looking away each time it flashed.</li>
            <li> and I also made sure my eyes were closed and looking away each time it flashed.</li>
            <li> , I get that there&#x27;s not as much of it, but</li>
            <li> It was much softer.</li>
            <li> THAT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> and I am ready to give up.</li>
            <li> Used a 2/5 setting - felt absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> it really does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently on treatment 1 getting ready for 2.</li>
            <li> Hi, i need to buy a light only because turn off, how can i do?</li>
            <li> Because I was sensitive to the product I was initially only able to do a portion of my leg at a time.  </li>
            <li> Sorry guys if you are waiting for a more definitive evaluation, I am just trying to be honest.</li>
            <li> Their big 50% off promo was for the first treatment!!</li>
            <li> overall the product is fine so far but the cartridge went bust within the first 5 flashes.</li>
            <li> It still feels a little like a rubber band snapping lightly on the skin, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Although I was originally suspicious of its effectiveness, this product definitely works in reducing hair growth.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this is much more affordable than professional hair removal and its really not hard to do it on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this product u just have to use it weekly the first 2 months and then as needed for 6 months to get the hairs in the right stage of growth</li>
            <li> I had always wanted to try professional laser hair removal but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend the money so thought I would try the I-Light.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my leg first which I had shaved nearly 14 hours before.</li>
            <li> I had no stubble yet which is unusual for 8 hours when I normally shave.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my leg first which I had shaved nearly 14 hours before.</li>
            <li> I had no stubble yet which is unusual for 8 hours when I normally shave.</li>
            <li> well I hope if after time there will be less hair I will be able to increase the power</li>
            <li> so I went around the backside of the laser&#x27;s main floor stand and saw that it was manufactured in 2006 and put out 70 joules per flash.</li>
            <li> The main reason I got this was to remove unwanted hair from my face.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product!ve to keep my razor around if I miss a spot, but that doesn&#x27;t happen often ...</li>
            <li> first experience with it was positive and it only took me like...5 minutes to treat what I wanted to treat.</li>
            <li> first experience with it was positive and it only took me like...5 minutes to treat what I wanted to treat.</li>
            <li> At first, I was pressing it pretty hard against my skin to get the sound.</li>
            <li> But a few days of discomfort, for greatly rediced hair growth and the ability to show off your hard earned 6 pack abs is well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Does not slow my hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not seeing much progress on legs and underarms, but I&#x27;m a patient gal.  </li>
            <li> do think that with regular use, pretty much all the hair would be gone.</li>
            <li> Starting working on the lower leg - about 50% success after two treatments.  </li>
            <li> Overall, completely worth it</li>
            <li> Overall, completely worth it</li>
            <li> I have had laser done professionally and this item does just as good a job for less money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yet when I opened the box, it says it right on the outside.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; to do it on a second power adjustment, so I did it on the first setting yet, I know that it is the least effective,</li>
            <li> I used it maybe 4 times and it quit working because it needs a new bulb.</li>
            <li> next time I&#x27;ll be more careful.</li>
            <li> next time I&#x27;ll be more careful.</li>
            <li> It was VERY clear that they weren&#x27;t attached to anything, and they literally slid out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have light skin with dark hair, and it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> After my first and second treatments I had nothing...</li>
            <li> It says that you will not see results until the 2nd treatment, but I felt like I saw results the week of the first treatment.  </li>
            <li> (Except in one small spot which I&#x27;m sure I missed).</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working!</li>
            <li> I imagine it&#x27;s going to take some time to work if for no other reason than it hurts a lot less than the treatments that I received in an office but as long as it works in the long run I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work a little bit (made some patchy hairless areas) but even after doing it about twice as much as recommended the hair all grew back pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> First of all, this product states that you can get at least 1,500 pulse of light from the lamp.</li>
            <li> My light is still working and my hair is 85% less .</li>
            <li> I tried a higher level at first and it hurt my skin, however, I turned down the machine to a lower level and had no problem after that.  </li>
            <li> there is less surface area to cover, and a larger person will use more.</li>
            <li> Its just hard for me to be sure and cover every area</li>
            <li> instructions are clear, I&#x27;ve read them all throughout and did it all right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 2 times so far</li>
            <li> and i surprised to find 40%-50% hair reduction in some areas of my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I have used this 3 times so far about a week apart.</li>
            <li> THE HEFT PRICE - AS FAR AS MY RESEARCH GOES</li>
            <li> So, as far as pain goes, it can be managed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m only doing the right side of each area, to judge if it&#x27;s actually working vs. the unzapped side.  </li>
            <li> First  I have read every single word in the manual.</li>
            <li> no more &amp;#34;scary man with the hairy back at the pool.&amp;#34; I am excited to see what will happen after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> Other products haven&#x27;t worked out well for me in the past, but I&#x27;m glad this one did!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first got this product and nervous about using it, however I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s good, my hairs are dark and thick, some pores have 2-3 hairs, go figure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use on full power with little discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> That is absolutely not true, you are lucky if you get 50.</li>
            <li> So I went into a laser shop because the light aperture is so small on the Remington (my only complaint) that even if I got someone to do my back with the handheld unit I do not think it could be done effectively.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their normal back treatments are $500 and they recommend 10 of them at 6 week intervals.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty fine and not really that thick.</li>
            <li> So like many of you I was skeptical, so after using the product I really wanted to leave a review.</li>
            <li> Having spent a bundle on professional laser hair removal for underarms and bikini this product is a real deal.  </li>
            <li> Like what many have complained, this unit only lasted for about 30 flashes.  </li>
            <li> , I did underarms and front bikini only, to give it a real test on those areas, so that I am not running out of flashes before the actual result can be</li>
            <li> This item was a major purchase, for me.</li>
            <li> There were noticeable patches that hadn&#x27;t grown any hair back at all, then some spots where the hair grew back but was very fine and thin, hardly noticeable, it seemed to work better under my arms than on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> Due to those two major cons and positive feedback from friends, I made the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bikini neighborhood is clearly showing results, I&#x27;d say a 25% reduction after only 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that there was quite a sting when I put it to my skin for the treatment but had to remind myself that this is an actual laser, it is a home product</li>
            <li> , I found it to be kind of scary before I tried it.</li>
            <li> , I found it to be kind of scary before I tried it.</li>
            <li> first day my skin cried out in pain because it was so used to being covered in the thick bushy hair the nerves were not used to so much stimulation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here looking for a good product and am annoyed annoyed that Amazon doesn&#x27;t do more to prevent this waste of our time.</li>
            <li> I am a (dang near albino) white female.</li>
            <li> mailing it back to Remington (apparently at my cost!)</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a little nervous to buy &amp; use this product at first.</li>
            <li> a single hair has fallen from me so far!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used this on my neck, chin (gross I know, but remember My Big Fat Greek Wedding?), under my arms and started using it in my private areas/legs</li>
            <li> The professional service lasted 8 months and although I needed to shave less often, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results (80% hair removal is not good enough).  </li>
            <li> About 20 or less on first use, then only 10 flashes on second use (1 week later).  </li>
            <li> upper lip is completely bare and bikini area only grows back in patches.  </li>
            <li> Original instructions not good for second use not recommended.</li>
            <li> It is far less painful(and far longer lasting) than waxing any area.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old and had developed black facial hair on my lip, chin and neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, it seemed a little intimidating, but the instruction booklet explained the process really well and let me know what to expect.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fair skinned white person trying to zap blonde hairs stop giving this thing bad reviews, read the description.</li>
            <li> Also, after a small amount of use the reflector mirror for the lamp is already tarnished, which means less light coming through.</li>
            <li> our little Remingtons definitely have the juice to get it done, but again with such a small light aperture it is a bit of a chore for us guys and</li>
            <li> could only think of all the sham machines I had reviewed while in the stock business that were high priced units for the docs, but when looked at over the long term they paid for themselves 100 times over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, so I can&#x27;t comment yet on the long term amount of hair reduction.</li>
            <li> Before any major purchase I read reviews on Amazon and other sites.</li>
            <li> although they did work very well, they are so expensive and it takes so much time to shave.</li>
            <li> If it does not come with extra cartridges, then you spent an extra $50 for nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife , but its total failure , money wasting for 2 reason the first its doesn&#x27;t work and the second reason is the cartridge is stopped working after 2 session only despite that its say its last for 15000 flafhs, piece of crab , they waste my money and time</li>
            <li> just used this on the same areas for the second time today, and I&#x27;ve not done any other form of hair removal since then.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s 10 years of buying expensive razors, special shaving creams and lotions, dealing with the occasional razor burn and nicks.</li>
            <li> I had to shave legs every day but now can go at least 3-4 days and the hair re growth is much finer and lighter.  </li>
            <li> Takes a long time before the laser will flash between zaps.</li>
            <li> It is getting up to like 3/4 of an inch long.</li>
            <li> The prior laser treatments were OK, not too painful and somewhat effective but very expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve done 5 treatments by now, last time using power 4 and partially power</li>
            <li> A long way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use</li>
            <li> Legs is harder to tell, defiantly grows back a lot slower.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed the hair is not growing as fast or as thick.</li>
            <li> I noticed it was a little uncomfortable in the first few zaps, but after using it a little more, I saw that the error was on my end.</li>
            <li> and I use the machine every other week to prevent the hair from coming back.</li>
            <li> Four of them were submitted in one day (and another the very next day) all by \\&quot;people\\&quot; who supposedly have have not submitted a single other review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I shaved the areas, let them dry and relax before I began this endeavor.</li>
            <li> So I shaved the areas, let them dry and relax before I began this endeavor.</li>
            <li> I tried round one this weekend in the key areas - upper lip, armpits and a test area on my arm.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times on bikini (too lazy to shave that often!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing as a woman to have dark facial hair.  </li>
            <li> At this point all I can tell is that growth of the hair slowed down and reduced - even after only one procedure (three weeks ago).</li>
            <li> At some points it might have thinned out a little, but if I stopped the routine of using it every other week, even after 9 weeks of continued use, the hair would all grow back same as before.</li>
            <li> After shaving it all down and having at it on a 3 setting, wow, each zap was a little sting in the pore.</li>
            <li> I have been slacking off slightly, and can see some growing back.</li>
            <li> A smaller person will use less flashes bc</li>
            <li> It takes several months to start seeing results and start shaving less often</li>
            <li> So, to begin with, I am Russian, black hair, average-light skin.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, fast growing body hair - I have to shave my legs again in the evening if I&#x27;m going out and wearing shorts or a skirt.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to start since I would have to repeat again later</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I do have a few white hairs</li>
            <li> underarms were the easiest place to see the difference- after about a month of weekly (sometimes biweekly) use, there were only a few stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Not sure how permanent it is, but I used it on my armpits about 5 times, and now they are completely bare.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking that by Dec I may only be shaving my legs once a month, maybe less!  </li>
            <li> That little test spot on my arm is about half gone, but the hair that grew back is finer.</li>
            <li> but now I am going to expand to other parts now</li>
            <li> I am going to look around for other laser shops.</li>
            <li> I used to shave my legs every other 3days, but since I use this laser, The hair growth lessen.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t do facial hair or nipple hair, too small and too time consuming for other areas.  </li>
            <li> Every other day for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have pale to normal skin tone, depending on the season, with dark thick brown hair.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be 35 to 40 % less hair on the treated area due to i-light.</li>
            <li> Incredibly painful, this important detail isn&#x27;t listed on the product description.</li>
            <li> the record, I have tan/olive skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> Just so sad to spend so much money and have nothing to show for it.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It probably helps that I&#x27;m pale-skinned with dark hair.</li>
            <li> It is expensive at first and it does take time, but now I&#x27;ll be paying less for replacement bulbs than razors (so i&#x27;ll end up saving money over time!</li>
            <li> I have black, thick hair with olive skin (Yugoslavian &amp; German heritage), and after six treatments within 2 months, the hair fell out.  </li>
            <li> down there.</li>
            <li> That \\&quot;test patch down there\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I shaved them down to dul lthe sensation.</li>
            <li> After I turned it up to 5, my leg hair growth slowed way down after just 2 sessions.</li>
            <li> waxing.. i have dark skin N black hair.</li>
            <li> At first it was a little painful on my upper lip</li>
            <li> I used it starting out on level 4, and the pain really wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> I bought this device about a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> year and a half in</li>
            <li> but the rest were black and gone.</li>
            <li> I went all the way from 1 to 5 in setting and felt nothing but a slight warmth on my leg.</li>
            <li> I went all the way from 1 to 5 in setting and felt nothing but a slight warmth on my leg.</li>
            <li> Less noticeable?</li>
            <li> And none of them became any thinner or lighter or less</li>
            <li> After 4 treatments, I have ~80% less hair on them.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I did notice less hair and the machine does work as described.  </li>
            <li> I am using the IPL Pro to get rid of body hair on my chest , parts of my arms, the little bit that grows on my shoulders - and if it keeps working I may venture below the belt (to SOME degree</li>
            <li> As excited as I was about them is how disgusted I am at the other end of the spectrum with my back hair.</li>
            <li> , I guess you can say that, it just smarts a little in the tender areas...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money...not at all!</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BUT NO PAIN</li>
            <li> It has since been a few weeks and no hair, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> Nothing horrible just like burning hair, which is fine because that means it&#x27;s actually doing something.</li>
            <li> To start I have very dark brown hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 4 weeks, I noticed I wasn&#x27;t as shave crazy because there wasn&#x27;t as much stubble and hair to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fairly painful, but it&#x27;s worth it to ditch the hassle of shaving all time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> A lot of time and money wasted.</li>
            <li> I focused on just a few places to start</li>
            <li> where the hair is missing</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using it once a week on the highest level with just a few  stubborn hairs on my chin, maybe 5 of them.</li>
            <li> I shaved, dried thoroughly, and started zapping away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and can go almost two weeks w/o shaving (use to shave everyday)</li>
            <li> Another round of treatments was just too costly.  </li>
            <li> Will try to remember to update in a few months.</li>
            <li> When I did that, after a few zaps the bulb became hotter and resulted in discomfort.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s 10x&#x27;s worse to cut yourself shaving once than doing an entire treatment with the iLight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> so far the cartridge that comes with it hasnt failed me yet.</li>
            <li> I am kind of desperate to see some results, so I only waited for 1 week between treatments instead of 2 weeks (treatments 3 and 4), speaking of safety, nothing horrible has happened to me due to that shift.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had heard that it can be a little uncomfortable to use, but since the pro&#x27;s seemed to outweigh the possible discomfort, I decided to take the plunge!</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have done medspa laser treatments for underarms/bikini in the past, so I knew what to expect both from functionality and result.  </li>
            <li> no more \\&quot;I want to wear a skirt today ...</li>
            <li> Several of these reviews are obviously fake.  </li>
            <li> After about four weeks I have so.much less hair on my legs!!</li>
            <li> 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical because I couldn&#x27;t see any result for so long, now I did a measurement on some small square area (treated and untreated, adjacent)</li>
            <li> (apparently I am not good at zapping larger areas because I have random patches of growth in my bikini/leg areas)</li>
            <li> it was hard for me tto buy it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Writing this review has reminded me that I probably haven&#x27;t zapped in at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used to have really thick hair on my legs</li>
            <li> I really really hope to see results on underarms and legs, &#x27;cause I REALLY REALLY hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> No more prickly pear cactus in then morning!</li>
            <li> If it fails, I&#x27;ll bump it down.</li>
            <li> It is painful though, so I would recommend a topical cream</li>
            <li> Still doubtful, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a complete &#x27;nothing&#x27;.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m so desperate to try this thing out that I&#x27;d rather eat the 70 dollars than wait to return it and order the other one.</li>
            <li> No more expensive razors, razor burn, or knicks from shaving.</li>
            <li> Started to get a little crazy and did a \\&quot;test patch\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> It says on the instruction that you should use it every after two weeks, but because I am really annoyed by the hair on my legs, I used it every week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally wife was not happy at all with unit.</li>
            <li> Heavy and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> There was a slight tingle that bordered on a &#x27;rubber band popping&#x27; sensation but not too bad.</li>
            <li> There was a slight tingle that bordered on a &#x27;rubber band popping&#x27; sensation but not too bad.</li>
            <li> It was horrifically painful and when the hair pulled out, I think the little goosebump hair follicles got yanked up too</li>
            <li> Was it going to blind me because I was using it where I shouldn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> Was it going to blind me because I was using it where I shouldn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> tried an epilator, an expensive one at that.</li>
            <li> legs- still not perfect but probably about 50-70% of the hair is gone.</li>
            <li> It seemed a bit darker, weird looking, almost thicker.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to keep.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it stopped working after 30 days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been unable to get support from Remington to repair or replace the item.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it was incredibly expensive.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use and burns the legs.</li>
            <li> but weirdly reassuring.  </li>
            <li> Time consuming and not perfect.  </li>
            <li> so it was difficult to see if it was working.  </li>
            <li> I bought some and found it difficult to use this product while wearing the goggles.</li>
            <li> My wife was very unhappy with how it work, after 2 weeks we sent it back, She hated the heat burns it caused her.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other spots that are used to epilation and hair removal didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> It is not at all painful to me, unlike the pro treatments, which are tolerable but do hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it on the highest setting and it wasn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that is sick of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> hate stubble.</li>
            <li> Truly annoying.</li>
            <li> and it was driving me insane.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 2 times so far and I can already see it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Does not slow my hair regrowth. Takes a long time before the laser will flash between zaps. I am not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  The flash bulbs don&#x27;t last close to 1500 flashes.  I used it religiously for 3 months at the highest setting with no visible result.  A lot of time and money wasted.</li>
            <li> I bought this device about a year and a half ago. I&#x27;m a blonde with light skin that is easily irritated, so I have gotten dozens of professional IPL treatments to reduce irritation and lighten freckles and discolorations over the years. Since this device costs about as much as 2 pro treatments, I figured why not give it a shot? I&#x27;m pleased with it, and find it is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light window is pretty small, and I have found it best to do three pulses on an area before moving on to the next area, so it takes some time. However, I find it to be relaxing and actually kind of fun! It is not at all painful to me, unlike the pro treatments, which are tolerable but do hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year and a half in, I find that this device does seem to reduce irritation on my skin and has faded some of my freckles, which is obviously an off-label use of the device. In addition, it seems to have permanently thinned the hair on all of the areas I&#x27;ve used it, which is a pleasant surprise to me since my hair is really light, especially on my arms. This has been a worthwhile purchase for me.</li>
            <li> After the first three sessions I am happy to say I have seen the results I was hoping for! No more expensive razors, razor burn, or knicks from shaving. I was nervous about using this product because of my very lacking pain tolerance but did not have any issues and if you did there is adjustable strength levels. It is far less painful(and far longer lasting) than waxing any area. I highly recommend the I-Light Pro Plus, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have friends that work in the plastic surgery industry and they told me this would never work, but it did.  I have black, thick hair with olive skin (Yugoslavian &amp; German heritage), and after six treatments within 2 months, the hair fell out.  So far, I&#x27;ve used this on my neck, chin (gross I know, but remember My Big Fat Greek Wedding?), under my arms and started using it in my private areas/legs (apparently I am not good at zapping larger areas because I have random patches of growth in my bikini/leg areas) but I&#x27;m getting there!  Yes, you need to be patient but I know people that have been more patient with paying doctors and scheduling appointments, and I did this on my time in my own home, and for a decent price (compared to what pros charge).  Other products haven&#x27;t worked out well for me in the past, but I&#x27;m glad this one did!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected. The bulbs burn out VERY quickly. I have light skin with dark hair, and it doesn&#x27;t work well. I will say however that I like the softness it left in my skin after treatments.</li>
            <li> I found a result after 3 times treatment, I have a moderate  white skin and I had to shave every day before using this product. First  I have read every single word in the manual. I think its very important before the first treatment. After my first and second treatments I had nothing... I was thinking of returning the product, but then i decided to try it again and i surprised to find 40%-50% hair reduction in some areas of my legs and arms. I have had 4 treatments till now, and the last treatment was 4 days ago and there is NO hair. It grows slower and fewer than before. I am very happy with this product. The only thing I did not like that the cartridge needed to be changed after the third treatment for legs and arms.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found something that helps me keep my body hair and my husbands body hair under control. I was a little hesitant to start since I would have to repeat again later but it was well worth it. A big reduction in the amount of hair I am dealing with and no more &amp;#34;scary man with the hairy back at the pool.&amp;#34; I am excited to see what will happen after a few more uses. I focused on just a few places to start but now I am going to expand to other parts now that I know it is successful.</li>
            <li> I am a (dang near albino) white female. I don&#x27;t know if I it is because of age or what is going on but I started having to shave my legs twice a day or  I would look like I hadn&#x27;t shaved my legs in a week. I have used this 3 times so far about a week apart. The first week was on the lightest setting. The second week was on the 3rd setting, The third week was on the highest setting. I went tanning the next week and have to wait until that fades before I try it again. I haven&#x27;t noticed any places where the hair is missing but I have noticed the hair is not growing as fast or as thick. Now I can go 2 or 3 days without shaving and still not have as much growth as I did after 12 hours of not shaving. I am hoping with more use it will do more to kill the hair but for now it is doing me some good.</li>
            <li> I am using the IPL Pro to get rid of body hair on my chest , parts of my arms, the little bit that grows on my shoulders - and if it keeps working I may venture below the belt (to SOME degree - I am not planning on scalding my wikee!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I had to comment on was the fact that I can not reach my back, and while I never had any back hair when I was younger, I remember how unattractive I thought it was and now at 50 - it is The Devil&#x27;s punishment. Remember how excited you were growing your first pubes? As excited as I was about them is how disgusted I am at the other end of the spectrum with my back hair. It is getting up to like 3/4 of an inch long. Super Seeeeexy, huh ladies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a guy shave it for about a year, and that was like watering a Chia Pet after he stopped. I hate it. So I went into a laser shop because the light aperture is so small on the Remington (my only complaint) that even if I got someone to do my back with the handheld unit I do not think it could be done effectively. What was their 50% discount deal that caught my attention?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their normal back treatments are $500 and they recommend 10 of them at 6 week intervals. Their big 50% off promo was for the first treatment!! Jesus - $5000 to get your back hair zapped?  You could almost get a plastic surgeon to do a full skin graft, it would seem (not that that would be a fun or viable alternative).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They left me in the room alone so I went around the backside of the laser&#x27;s main floor stand and saw that it was manufactured in 2006 and put out 70 joules per flash. The Remington Pro puts out 90 joules per flash. FYI Joule was one of the pioneering scientists in thermodynamics, and a joule can be described as &amp;#34;The work required to produce one watt of power for one second, or one &amp;#34;watt second&amp;#34; (W·s) (compare kilowatt hour). This relationship can be used to define the watt.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So our little Remingtons definitely have the juice to get it done, but again with such a small light aperture it is a bit of a chore for us guys and our thicker hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could only think of all the sham machines I had reviewed while in the stock business that were high priced units for the docs, but when looked at over the long term they paid for themselves 100 times over. There&#x27;s a &amp;#34;fatfreezing&amp;#34; unit that literally takes 5 pounds off you in an hour (but its all waterweight - so alot of women use it before a big party night and pay like $350 for 45 minutes). And you all have heard of the full body scanners that catch every clot and cancer bump you might have, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the woman came back in to close me on the deal I just couldn&#x27;t do it, so she started me with one treatment for $250 and said to come back in a month to renegotiate. We will see what happens. I am going to look around for other laser shops. The advantage to the bigger machines is their aperture is about 4 times bigger than Remington&#x27;s. But what a racket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to know the power output of this little baby, as that erases any lingering doubts I had about efficacy.</li>
            <li> I am Asian with kind of light brown skin.  I used to have really thick hair on my legs and whenever I shave it, it grows back the next day.  I&#x27;ve had this laser hair removal for a month now. It says on the instruction that you should use it every after two weeks, but because I am really annoyed by the hair on my legs, I used it every week. It is really effective! I used to shave my legs every other 3days, but since I use this laser, The hair growth lessen. I would say, within a month, it is already reduced upto 40% of hair growth on my legs. I recommend this product. Worthy of your $300 :)</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine. I&#x27;ve only used it once, so I can&#x27;t comment yet on the long term amount of hair reduction. I used it on the highest setting and it wasn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li> Before any major purchase I read reviews on Amazon and other sites. This item was a major purchase, for me. After reading the reviews and watching a lady on Youtube I decided to give this a try. I am 56 years old and had developed black facial hair on my lip, chin and neck. I had been pulling them out with a lot of pain and sometimes bleeding. When they grew back, they could cause a sore or bump. If I just shaved in the morning they were back that night. I could not afford to go somewhere for treatment, so I thought I would give this a try. Much to my surprise it worked. Almost all the hair is gone. I started out with treatments two times a week on the lowest sitting, then after a couple of weeks I increased the power/strength. At first it was a little painful on my upper lip but I soon got use to it. Now I&#x27;m using it once a week on the highest level with just a few  stubborn hairs on my chin, maybe 5 of them. I do have a few white hairs and it does not work on them at all but the rest were black and gone. If you are fair with black/dark hair this should work great for you. When using, place the probe on the area you want to treat, then close your eyes and press the button. DO NOT LOOK AT THE LIGHT, IT COULD BURN YOUR EYES!</li>
            <li> First of all, this product states that you can get at least 1,500 pulse of light from the lamp. That is absolutely not true, you are lucky if you get 50. Also, after a small amount of use the reflector mirror for the lamp is already tarnished, which means less light coming through. These products are cheaply made in China, and then sold here at high prices. I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first got this product and nervous about using it, however I am so glad I tried it.  The machine has different levels and I recommened you start at the lowest level and work up.  I tried a higher level at first and it hurt my skin, however, I turned down the machine to a lower level and had no problem after that.  The lower level did not hurt my skin at all and I continued to use the device as recommended.  After a few weeks, I did notice less hair and the machine does work as described.  I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to shave all of the time now!  Also, as a small personal in home machine/device, I love the fact that I can use it on my schedule and in my own home instead of having to go to a clinic/office.  I am very impressed and happy with this product!  I only wish I had it sooner!</li>
            <li> The I-Light Pro Plus is 100% worth every penny.  I had always wanted to try professional laser hair removal but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend the money so thought I would try the I-Light.  It was very easy to use and the directions were helpful.  The description of feeling as if you&#x27;re getting snapped with a rubber band was spot on and takes some getting used to but worth the ending results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw noticeable results in one month with the Remington I-Light Pro Plus.</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing pretty good...It does kind of catch you off guard when it pops you, but you will eventually get used to it, I did...They say it feels similar to being popped by a rubber band, I guess you can say that, it just smarts a little in the tender areas...</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;ve come to this page, you&#x27;re probably looking at this unit and the I-Light Pro. You notice this one states permanent 12 month results while the I-light Pro only says 6 months. You assume that this one must be more powerful, right? Well. The only difference in the two units is one costs about 70 dollars more. I realized this after I bought it and thought that maybe it comes with that extra cartridge and the nose cone. Because if you look on Remington&#x27;s website, that&#x27;s one of the answers given as to what the difference is. The PLUS is plus because it&#x27;s the Pro PLUS those items. Nope. The instruction manual and dvd in the box is for the I-Light Pro which is what the unit is, just purple instead of that rose color. Remington customer service even said they were the same product!  It&#x27;s now even 2 dollars cheaper than it was when I bought it. However, I&#x27;m so desperate to try this thing out that I&#x27;d rather eat the 70 dollars than wait to return it and order the other one. If you&#x27;re torn between the two, go with the Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I&#x27;m going to fire this puppy up. I bought this for use on my face and I know it&#x27;s not supposed to be used for that, but I&#x27;m willing to take the risk. I&#x27;ve been shaving off unwanted facial hair for 10 years. That&#x27;s 10 years of buying expensive razors, special shaving creams and lotions, dealing with the occasional razor burn and nicks. Not to mention how you dread anyone touching your face or even looking that close. It&#x27;s debilitating. I&#x27;m overweight, suffer from acne, but THIS is the thing that haunts me. If this doesn&#x27;t work, I will be heartbroken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this a three to start out with. To me, it&#x27;s neutral. I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s going to turn out and it won&#x27;t be immediate. As time goes by and I complete more rounds of treatment, I&#x27;ll update you of my progress. If it&#x27;s working, I&#x27;ll bump it up. If it fails, I&#x27;ll bump it down. But I&#x27;m hoping to bring this baby up to all 5. So here goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta admit, I found it to be kind of scary before I tried it. Was it going to hurt? Was it going to blind me because I was using it where I shouldn&#x27;t? I even watched the DVD. So I shaved the areas, let them dry and relax before I began this endeavor. I tried it on my leg first which I had shaved nearly 14 hours before. I went all the way from 1 to 5 in setting and felt nothing but a slight warmth on my leg. On my face (sideburn area, chinline, neck), I kept it at 1 and I also made sure my eyes were closed and looking away each time it flashed. I probably wasn&#x27;t as meticulous as I could have been as far as making sure I got every inch but next time I&#x27;ll be more careful. Skin isn&#x27;t red or hurting. There was a slight tingle that bordered on a &#x27;rubber band popping&#x27; sensation but not too bad. Will have to try it on 2 next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first experience with it was positive and it only took me like...5 minutes to treat what I wanted to treat. Like I said, I bought this primarily for my face and neck. I might venture to the underarms but those I don&#x27;t mind shaving every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update if there&#x27;s a change and how my next treatment goes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;approx 8 hours after the first treatment, it seemed like the hair was &#x27;stunned&#x27;. I had no stubble yet which is unusual for 8 hours when I normally shave. There was stubble a good 12 hours after the 8 hours so we&#x27;ll see how it feels in the morning when I go to shave again., I found it to be kind of scary before I tried it. Was it going to hurt?

            <li> I love this machine.  I have had laser done professionally and this item does just as good a job for less money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased an extra bulb but have not had to use it yet and i am almost finished doing all the removal i wanted.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> the Remington Products IPL6000P I-Light Pro Plus Permanent Hair Reduction System works perfectly easy to understand how to use it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I have this product.  It says that you will not see results until the 2nd treatment, but I felt like I saw results the week of the first treatment.  The process was so easy.  I would recommend this product to anyone that is sick of shaving.  It is SOOO worth it!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I like that it is different strength levels so you can start out at the lowest and progressviely make it stronger.  Great results.</li>
            <li> I dont use this but ive watched the wife cringe in pain but the results are as described.  If you&#x27;re a fair skinned white person trying to zap blonde hairs stop giving this thing bad reviews, read the description.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you are thinking as you read reviews about this product \\&quot;okay, I get that it thins your hair, I get that there&#x27;s not as much of it, but WHAT ABOUT THE STUBBLE!?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate stubble. I don&#x27;t like shaving in the morning and then having prickly legs by nightfall. I also don&#x27;t like going to bed feeling nice and smooth and then having cactus legs in the morning. Because THAT is sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried an epilator, an expensive one at that. I had such high hopes. It was horrifically painful and when the hair pulled out, I think the little goosebump hair follicles got yanked up too so my legs always felt goosebumpy. And then when I went below the belt...well I thought that I may pass out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next attempt at smoothness: this LightPro thing. I thought that there is no way that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I followed all directions. I shaved, dried thoroughly, and started zapping away. Started to get a little crazy and did a \\&quot;test patch\\&quot;...down there. Hmmm. (Shave that too, first!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t listen to the rules, and zapped once a week. I started noticing, maybe after 2-3 weeks (\\&quot;sessions\\&quot;) that my stubble wasn&#x27;t as stubbly anymore. It was much softer. Possibly finer? Less noticeable? Definitely not as offensive. No more prickly pear cactus in then morning! Still there, but not piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 4 weeks, I noticed I wasn&#x27;t as shave crazy because there wasn&#x27;t as much stubble and hair to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The underarms were the easiest place to see the difference- after about a month of weekly (sometimes biweekly) use, there were only a few stray hairs. Awesome! And that underarm \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s been about 2 months now. That \\&quot;test patch down there\\&quot; stayed smooth and stubble-free for about a month. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs- still not perfect but probably about 50-70% of the hair is gone. I still have to touch up and shave in situations when I definitely don&#x27;t want stubble, BUT it has made a huge difference. Again- the stubble is softer, noticeably so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I want to mention is, at about a month in, one day I noticed the \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; looked different. It seemed a bit darker, weird looking, almost thicker. I started picking at one and it slid right out of my skin, literally GLIDED out. I realized it looked thicker/fatter because I was looking at that base/bulb part of the \\&quot;root\\&quot; of a hair. I took out a pair of tweezers and couldn&#x27;t resist...pulled on another one (more like pinched, didn&#x27;t have to PULL at all), and started easing out the hairs one by one. I basically was speeding up the \\&quot;falling out\\&quot; process. I have to stress that I was NOT tweezing these hairs. It was VERY clear that they weren&#x27;t attached to anything, and they literally slid out of my skin. It was actually very fun and exciting. Those parts where the hair came out are still pretty hair free (about a month later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think that with regular use, pretty much all the hair would be gone. I have been slacking off slightly, and can see some growing back. Gotta get back to zapping again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for pain- meh, honestly I didn&#x27;t even feel a rubber band pinch. Yes, there is SOMETHING, but not what I imagine a rubberband-snap to feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the issue with the bulb running out: yeah, maybe they run out quickly? I don&#x27;t know. I think I did both legs (calves and thighs), my \\&quot;other\\&quot; area, and both underarms about 5 thorough times. Maybe a one or two more? I think it depends on surface area too, though. A smaller person will use less flashes bc there is less surface area to cover, and a larger person will use more. I am about 5&#x27;4\\&quot; and about 135 lbs, to give you a sort of reference to go off of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I bought this wacky contraption. I can&#x27;t wait to see if this makes a huge difference, say 6 months from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing this review has reminded me that I probably haven&#x27;t zapped in at least 2 weeks. Better get to it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!ood luck!</li>
            <li> I was so scared to spend my money on chance.  This is alot of money for me. I got it for my chin N neck hairs. It&#x27;s embarrassing as a woman to have dark facial hair.  I have used this for a month now N only on chin N neck.  My light is still working and my hair is 85% less . I&#x27;m so happy.  I never even told my husband I ordered it cause like I said it&#x27;s alot of money for me. Now if it was something for all of us then great price but since it&#x27;s just for me nim a mom it was hard for me tto buy it.  My mom daughter N husband has asked me what was I doing to my chin N neck cause they dnt see any hair or bumps from shaving N waxing.. i have dark skin N black hair. I have Indian in me. And it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> My wife was very unhappy with how it work, after 2 weeks we sent it back, She hated the heat burns it caused her.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t do facial hair or nipple hair, too small and too time consuming for other areas.  Too expensive to keep.</li>
            <li> The product worked great for hair removal.  Unfortunately it stopped working after 30 days.  I&#x27;ve been unable to get support from Remington to repair or replace the item.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use. You definitely see results after the third session. I recommend this product. Bye bye bye</li>
            <li> My wife and I both used this on various areas.  Seemed to work a little bit (made some patchy hairless areas) but even after doing it about twice as much as recommended the hair all grew back pretty quickly.  We&#x27;re both the perfect skin tone and hair color for it and it didn&#x27;t work worth a darn.  Not worth the money...not at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite the instant painless miracle that it seems to be but after using it weekly for about a month I&#x27;m not shaving the treated areas at all, except maybe a touch up. It is painful though, so I would recommend a topical cream</li>
            <li> I love the remington... easy to use once you get the angle.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and can go almost two weeks w/o shaving (use to shave everyday) I could go longer than 2 weeks but am using the remington every 2 weeks to catch any growth. Used the first light for two session doing both legs completly, bikini area and armpits am current on my second light and completed one session with it. Hope by summer i can go the whole season w/o shaving... :)</li>
            <li> So like many of you I was skeptical, so after using the product I really wanted to leave a review. I was just like one of the ladies who commented below, I had a lot of facial hair--especially on my neck and chin. I had done everything... bleaching, waxing, tweezing, and threading. It was coming back darker than ever and it was driving me insane. Not to mention it was incredibly expensive. So I invested in the machine and did it exactly as she said. Every other day for 2 weeks. It has since been a few weeks and no hair, not even a little bit. (Except in one small spot which I&#x27;m sure I missed). I am SO happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done professional hair removal before and the shock from this machine isn&#x27;t as strong. But the hair falls out the same way and the smell is the same. I&#x27;m sure I will have to follow up but for me to go a week without hair is unheard of and 2 weeks is definitely progress! I highly recommend purchasing it. Obviously, this is much more affordable than professional hair removal and its really not hard to do it on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have tan/olive skin and dark hair.</li>
            <li> Aaah, I was so awaiting to get this babe! :D For me it is the best solution and my favorite part of this machine is the plug-in, that there are no troubles with charging batteries and so. I really am satisfied and looking forward results! At this point all I can tell is that growth of the hair slowed down and reduced - even after only one procedure (three weeks ago). As I am dark-haired, light skin, it is true helping hand for me. Thank You Remington! :D</li>
            <li> Just so you know, nowhere in the product description does is say NOT FOR USE ON THE FACE, CHIN OR NECK AREA.  Yet when I opened the box, it says it right on the outside.  So if you are buying this product for your face and neck area, don&#x27;t bother dishing out the money.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I purchased it in Feb 2014 and have used it religiously every 2 weeks.  It takes several months to start seeing results and start shaving less often but I&#x27;m thinking that by Dec I may only be shaving my legs once a month, maybe less!  Having spent a bundle on professional laser hair removal for underarms and bikini this product is a real deal.  The professional service lasted 8 months and although I needed to shave less often, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results (80% hair removal is not good enough).  Another round of treatments was just too costly.  While still not at 100% with underarms, I only need to shave about 1x/month so it&#x27;s getting there. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Like what many have complained, this unit only lasted for about 30 flashes.  About 20 or less on first use, then only 10 flashes on second use (1 week later).  The light displayed green which by the trouble shooting guide, it appears to be a defective flash unit.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally wife was not happy at all with unit.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use and burns the legs. Heavy and awkward to use. Original instructions not good for second use not recommended.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE HAD A NO NO AND IT WAS INEFFECTIVE AFTER A YEAR - GOT HER THIS FOR XMASS AND IT&#x27;S ALREADY REMOVED MORE HAIR IN A MONTH - IT CAN ZAP YA A LITTLE BUT NO PAIN NO GAIN - WORTH THE HEFT PRICE - AS FAR AS MY RESEARCH GOES IT&#x27;S TE ONLY PRODUCT OUT THERE THAT REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> Great experience used it twice and cal already see results. Gotta love that prime shipping. Overall I would recommend this product u just have to use it weekly the first 2 months and then as needed for 6 months to get the hairs in the right stage of growth</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have done medspa laser treatments for underarms/bikini in the past, so I knew what to expect both from functionality and result.  The prior laser treatments were OK, not too painful and somewhat effective but very expensive.  From those treatments I saw probably 50% reduction in bikini area and perhaps 30-40% underarms.  I can attest that the highest setting zap on the I-Light is absolutely comparable to the medspa - YOWEE! but weirdly reassuring.  So far, I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times on bikini (too lazy to shave that often!) and 3 times on legs/underarms.  And I&#x27;m only doing the right side of each area, to judge if it&#x27;s actually working vs. the unzapped side.  So far, I&#x27;m not seeing much progress on legs and underarms, but I&#x27;m a patient gal.  Bikini neighborhood is clearly showing results, I&#x27;d say a 25% reduction after only 2 uses.  So far I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  I really really hope to see results on underarms and legs, &#x27;cause I REALLY REALLY hate shaving.  Will try to remember to update in a few months.</li>
            <li> Awesome results even the first use!</li>
            <li> Does the PRO PLUS come with extra cartridges? it should. I do not see it in the description. If it does not come with extra cartridges, then you spent an extra $50 for nothing. They are the same device as just the PRO.</li>
            <li> So far I have gone through 4 light cartridges on my chest with zero results. 6 months of trying and I am ready to give up. Just so sad to spend so much money and have nothing to show for it. Or not show.</li>
            <li> I  have now used 4 times on my legs, 3 times under arms and 3 times on knuckles.  I have dark hair and medium skin tone.  I had to shave legs every day but now can go at least 3-4 days and the hair re growth is much finer and lighter.  I use on full power with little discomfort.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> To start I have very dark brown hair that&#x27;s pretty fine and not really that thick. On their skin tone chart I am probably about a 2, so I am a pretty good candidate to see results from this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression: I just used this for the first time after reading the instructions. It&#x27;s incredibly simple to get started, setup takes literally about 30 seconds. I used it on my underarms and bikini area only. I used it starting out on level 4, and the pain really wasn&#x27;t too bad, I think the light flash bothered me more than the actual pain. (I have a pretty high pain tolerance though.) Their website claims that it doesn&#x27;t smell, but it does. Nothing horrible just like burning hair, which is fine because that means it&#x27;s actually doing something. Since I just used it I&#x27;m obviously not seeing results yet, but I will update this at 2 weeks when I do the next treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**2 weeks after first treatment*&lt;br /&gt;I just used this on the same areas for the second time today, and I&#x27;ve not done any other form of hair removal since then. Before I shaved so I could do the treatment I checked the areas I treated last time, which were my underarms and bikini area, I checked if it had actually done anything and there were spots where the hair didn&#x27;t grow back!! I really wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work or not, but so far it seems to be. There were noticeable patches that hadn&#x27;t grown any hair back at all, then some spots where the hair grew back but was very fine and thin, hardly noticeable, it seemed to work better under my arms than on my bikini area. I am going to treat the same areas on the highest setting, and I will update this in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Time consuming and not perfect.  Does reduce hair.</li>
            <li> It works awesome! I love it! I should&#x27;ve bought it earlier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 6 treatments over 5 months and have seen no improvement</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  I used it maybe 4 times and it quit working because it needs a new bulb. I haven&#x27;t  seen any difference.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it...it worked like a charm. I used probably 150 flashes...the second time, after one flash...the cartridge died and did not flash again..Truly annoying. .I&#x27;m mailing it back to Remington (apparently at my cost!) to see about fixing or replacing under warranty. Note that Amazon has zero customer service after 30 days of purchase...I didn&#x27;t even open the unit until 3 months after receiving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after Remington gets back to me</li>
            <li> overall the product is fine so far but the cartridge went bust within the first 5 flashes. The machine was making sound and beeping when put on skin but no flash. I changed the cartridge and it started working again. Also i read it in so many places that the cartridge they supply with the machine is mostly faulty. The replacement ones are fine.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife , but its total failure , money wasting for 2 reason the first its doesn&#x27;t work and the second reason is the cartridge is stopped working after 2 session only despite that its say its last for 15000 flafhs, piece of crab , they waste my money and time</li>
            <li> I have thought about paying for laser hair removal when I found this product.  I was surprised that there was quite a sting when I put it to my skin for the treatment but had to remind myself that this is an actual laser, it is a home product but it is quite powerful.  Because I was sensitive to the product I was initially only able to do a portion of my leg at a time.  I often wear skirts so I am used to shaving almost daily as I do not like even the slightest stubble so it was difficult to see if it was working.  However, I recently went to the Lake and realized I had forgotten to shave when to my very happy surprise I felt my legs and for the most part they were smooth.  I say for the most part because as I had mentioned before I am very sensitive to this and am only able to do a portion of my legs at a time... i quickly found out that I was going over the same portion of the leg because it was smooth and I could feel the areas I had skipped or only gone over once.  I need to figure out a way to keep track of the parts of my leg I have covered but I am really happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I tried round one this weekend in the key areas - upper lip, armpits and a test area on my arm.  BEFORE trying it, I applied Greencaine.  Used a 2/5 setting - felt absolutely nothing but warm.  So, as far as pain goes, it can be managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I&#x27;d give a first time user - don&#x27;t look at the device when you&#x27;re using it.  It&#x27;ll hurt your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add on to my review after a couple of weeks to update on progress!&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;...about 5 weeks later.  Underarm hair virtually gone.  I used either a 4 or 5 setting about 4x.  Upper lip hair is still hanging on!  This is a surprise to me... but my skin is darker on my face that my underarm.  That little test spot on my arm is about half gone, but the hair that grew back is finer. Starting working on the lower leg - about 50% success after two treatments.  But my legs are chicken-white. That might be the reason for better results than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was a little nervous to buy &amp; use this product at first. I had heard that it can be a little uncomfortable to use, but since the pro&#x27;s seemed to outweigh the possible discomfort, I decided to take the plunge! I&#x27;ve had this item for a few months now, and I&#x27;m extremely impressed. It&#x27;s always great to find a product that actually does what it says it will, and does it beyond expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Venus razors ... although they did work very well, they are so expensive and it takes so much time to shave. I don&#x27;t even want to know how much time and money I was wasting! Due to those two major cons and positive feedback from friends, I made the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it seemed a little intimidating, but the instruction booklet explained the process really well and let me know what to expect. I noticed it was a little uncomfortable in the first few zaps, but after using it a little more, I saw that the error was on my end. When you use it, you need to place the light on your skin and wait for the \\&quot;chirp\\&quot;; once it sounds, you can press the button to make the light work. At first, I was pressing it pretty hard against my skin to get the sound. When I did that, after a few zaps the bulb became hotter and resulted in discomfort. After playing around, I realized my error and used a lighter touch ... so much better!!! It still feels a little like a rubber band snapping lightly on the skin, but it&#x27;s not bad at all. In my opinion, it&#x27;s 10x&#x27;s worse to cut yourself shaving once than doing an entire treatment with the iLight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the item for awhile, I&#x27;m SO GLAD I made the investment. It is expensive at first and it does take time, but now I&#x27;ll be paying less for replacement bulbs than razors (so i&#x27;ll end up saving money over time! score!) and I don&#x27;t need to worry about shaving all the time (no more \\&quot;I want to wear a skirt today ... oh wait, I can&#x27;t because I didn&#x27;t shave my legs and now I don&#x27;t have time\\&quot;). I still have to keep my razor around if I miss a spot, but that doesn&#x27;t happen often ... Overall, completely worth it and I highly recommend this product!ve to keep my razor around if I miss a spot, but that doesn&#x27;t happen often ... Overall, completely worth it and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Several of these reviews are obviously fake.  Four of them were submitted in one day (and another the very next day) all by \\&quot;people\\&quot; who supposedly have have not submitted a single other review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried this product--I&#x27;m just passing along a heads-up which each may do with as they will.  I&#x27;m here looking for a good product and am annoyed annoyed that Amazon doesn&#x27;t do more to prevent this waste of our time.</li>
            <li> After 3 uses you can see results. Love it!, I highly recommend this machine and you can do it in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> So, to begin with, I am Russian, black hair, average-light skin. The tone corresponds to about their second best for this purpose, or even slightly lighter, but not as light as the very first.&lt;br /&gt;(there is a scale of 1-2-3-4 suitable skin tones, with 1 to be the most suitable and 4 to be the border-line suitable tone, mine is two)&lt;br /&gt;So it should by all means work on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are clear, I&#x27;ve read them all throughout and did it all right.&lt;br /&gt;I had my first treatment 11 days ago, I did underarms and front bikini only, to give it a real test on those areas, so that I am not running out of flashes before the actual result can be evaluated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; to do it on a second power adjustment, so I did it on the first setting yet, I know that it is the least effective, well I hope if after time there will be less hair I will be able to increase the power then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can tell for sure is:&lt;br /&gt;Not a single hair has fallen from me so far! And none of them became any thinner or lighter or less dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet I give it 3 stars because there is still chance for the device to be effective. They didn&#x27;t promise much of the result within first weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be updated.&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;I did my second treatment, now waiting for the miracle to show up )&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I have just finished my 4th treatment. I am kind of desperate to see some results, so I only waited for 1 week between treatments instead of 2 weeks (treatments 3 and 4), speaking of safety, nothing horrible has happened to me due to that shift.&lt;br /&gt;I now managed to use 3rd intensity, it hurts, it really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the results... Well, maybe. Maybe I start noticing some. Still doubtful, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a complete &#x27;nothing&#x27;. Sorry guys if you are waiting for a more definitive evaluation, I am just trying to be honest. I think I will soon be able to make a statement here.&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done 5 treatments by now, last time using power 4 and partially power 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical because I couldn&#x27;t see any result for so long, now I did a measurement on some small square area (treated and untreated, adjacent) and it seems to be 35 to 40 % less hair on the treated area due to i-light. It is also noticeable by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added another star to my review because it has some effect, though it takes patience and patience and patience to get it. A long way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use and I don&#x27;t regret the original purchase.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, fast growing body hair - I have to shave my legs again in the evening if I&#x27;m going out and wearing shorts or a skirt.  In desperation, I purchased this product and am very happy with it!  After one treatment, only 2/5 of the hair grew back; after second treatment, only 1/3 of the hair grew back in!  I look forward to the next treatment - hopefully no hair will grow back in for the following 6 months!  I very highly recommend this product - it is much cheaper than laser hair removal at a spa/clinic and I feel works just as well.  Note:  The directions state you do not need to wear protective eyewear.  I bought some and found it difficult to use this product while wearing the goggles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pasty skinned hairy Italian. got it on my chest, stomach, arms. It&#x27;s great in the winter, horribly hot in the CArolina summer. So buh bye hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently on treatment 1 getting ready for 2. After shaving it all down and having at it on a 3 setting, wow, each zap was a little sting in the pore. But that&#x27;s good, my hairs are dark and thick, some pores have 2-3 hairs, go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day my skin cried out in pain because it was so used to being covered in the thick bushy hair the nerves were not used to so much stimulation. Each hair felt like a tiny needle in the skin as the pores no longer had any use for them and was pushing them out. I shaved them down to dul lthe sensation. It seemed like this didn&#x27;t work as the hairs kept coming as if I turned into some Italian werewolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days the hairs stopped pouring forth from the pores and growth has been greatly reduced. The hairs still grow a bit but treatment 2 is coming soon. Directions clearly state not to use more than once every 2 weeks and that is what i&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other spots that are used to epilation and hair removal didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad. The hair is also more willing to stop growing after the first treatment. It was just the stubborn chest and stomach area, which is never shaved that caused the most pain. But a few days of discomfort, for greatly rediced hair growth and the ability to show off your hard earned 6 pack abs is well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Burns when it starts to remove any hair, and does not remove hair when it does not burn the skin??? Go figure.</li>
            <li> I have used the remington pro for about 7months. I started doing treatments on my legs, bikini, stomach and armpits. I gave up on my legs and bikini because the treatment was not working in those places. However, my armpits and my stomach are now hair free and I use the machine every other week to prevent the hair from coming back. Those results alone were worth the price of this machine.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working! I love it. I have yet to see &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; results, but I&#x27;m seeing thinner hair!</li>
            <li> The main reason I got this was to remove unwanted hair from my face.  Nothing in the info online suggested I couldn&#x27;t use if for my face.  Once I got it I read the instructions and they specifically prohibit using on the face.  Some blogs suggested people have used it on their face, but who knows if they were trolls or not. I returned the product unused.  I did get a prompt refund with no hassles.</li>
            <li> It does permanently stop hair BUT you have to follow the instructions closely and keep up the repeated sessions until you don&#x27;t see any regrowth. The replacement cartridges are a bit pricey however I still think over time the investment will pay off.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I could never use it because the laser device does not contact and does nothing</li>
            <li> Incredibly painful, this important detail isn&#x27;t listed on the product description. 1 zap and I requested a refund.  It literally felt like being stabbed, yes literally.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, it actually worked. After I turned it up to 5, my leg hair growth slowed way down after just 2 sessions. It probably helps that I&#x27;m pale-skinned with dark hair. It is fairly painful, but it&#x27;s worth it to ditch the hassle of shaving all time. Now if only I can get up the courage to do my bikini line...</li>
            <li> worked exactly that the remington saids</li>
            <li> Although I was originally suspicious of its effectiveness, this product definitely works in reducing hair growth.</li>
            <li> Not sure how permanent it is, but I used it on my armpits about 5 times, and now they are completely bare.  working on upper lip hair and bikini area.  upper lip is completely bare and bikini area only grows back in patches.  if this holds up and it never grows back, this product needs to be in every woman&#x27;s home.  i&#x27;m pretty fair with dark hair, and i also always put the strength on the highest level, so i&#x27;m definitely set up to get the best results.</li>
            <li> I intend to have great results soon, but it looks like the product will perfectly work. Indeed a better investment than the IPL 6000 that is not Plus. This one with the quartz light will have faster and permanent results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; or not - but it sure felt like it would - I just found that it takes FOREVER and I still can&#x27;t be sure I didn&#x27;t miss a spot - I decided that I would spend the extra money and just go to a laser clinic -</li>
            <li> I have had this since September 2014 and have used it every 2 weeks as instructed. While the hair is growing back slower and softer, it&#x27;s still growing back. However I have read reviews on all the different systems and I think this is about as good as it gets when you use the system at home. I am  just going to continue to use it every 2 weeks and see what happens since it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I have pale to normal skin tone, depending on the season, with dark thick brown hair. I thought this product would permanently remove hair and would work great with my skin tone and hair color, but the hair just keeps coming back. At some points it might have thinned out a little, but if I stopped the routine of using it every other week, even after 9 weeks of continued use, the hair would all grow back same as before. I even used up one light lifespan and bought a replacement light with the same results.</li>
            <li> I would say 70% reduction of hair in underarms and bikini area. Legs is harder to tell, defiantly grows back a lot slower. I will keep doing it every two weeks and I believe it will remove all hair eventually. Its just hard for me to be sure and cover every area cause I rush through it. I love it and think I will have better and better results as I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times on the lowest setting. I can see some changes with the hair growth on same parts. It will take time to get yourself hairless with this... if you are patient you will achieve the permanent hair removal you want.  so far the cartridge that comes with it hasnt failed me yet.</li>
            <li> Hi, i need to buy a light only because turn off, how can i do?</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my legs.  After 4 treatments, I have ~80% less hair on them.  There was no effect on my armpits though.</li>
            <li> Love it! After about four weeks I have so.much less hair on my legs!! I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> not as good as I&#x27;d hoped. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months exactly as directed, still hair growth.</li>
            <li> 3/23/15 - Just got it yesterday but so far so good. I imagine it&#x27;s going to take some time to work if for no other reason than it hurts a lot less than the treatments that I received in an office but as long as it works in the long run I&#x27;ll be happy. I&#x27;ll keep updating as I go.</li>
