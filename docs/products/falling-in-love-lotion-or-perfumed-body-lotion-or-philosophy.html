            <li>Smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
            <li>The lotion makes a perfect finish.</li>
            <li>this is the best lotion I have ever used...</li>
            <li>Especially love Amazing Grace but thought I would try another scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Think it is a great buy</li>
            <li>My favorite scent ever!!</li>
            <li>The lotion is good quality apart from the fragrance</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful, light scent.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>My wife has fallen in love with Philosophy!</li>
            <li>Great product, nice strong scent</li>
            <li>It smells good, moisturises for ages and was promptly delivered in very secure packaging.</li>
            <li>But the product, like all philosophy skin products that I have tried so far is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Love it would order it again and send to friends</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>Lots of people love it...</li>
            <li>Love the feel and fragrance of this product not to mention</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the Falling</li>
            <li>In Love Summer</li>
            <li>The jasmine and amber in this really help to balance out the fruitiness, and I think help to make it a scent that women of many age ranges can happily wear.</li>
            <li>When it ran out I ordered more.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and get many compliments.</li>
            <li>My favorite....</li>
            <li>love this stuff....</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Have gotten many compliments on fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Amazing Grace and Pure Grace over the scent Falling in Love.</li>
            <li>Did not smell like the original Falling In Love fragrance.</li>
            <li>Absorbs in the skin easily</li>
            <li>Well the bright sides are that it works as claimed, smells very nice and actually works to make her hands soft!</li>
            <li>but I wish is was paraben free.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and keeps skin moist.</li>
            <li>the packaging is quite unique</li>
            <li>The other good thing is now I don&#x27;t have to guess what to buy her!</li>
            <li>The scent has a sweet blueberry smell covered up by a heavier, stronger scent.</li>
            <li>Was received quickly and wrapped well.</li>
            <li>purchased a large bottle when my sample was gone and have been using it loyally ever since!</li>
            <li>Love the pleasant but not overwhelming fragrance!</li>
            <li>my friend gave me the first bottle</li>
            <li>I like this lotion a lot, it was my first philosophy purchase.</li>
            <li>Such a clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I purchased the shower gel also, and the entire bathroom smells so fresh after showering with it!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say that I see or feel much in the way of a &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; action, but I can say that it really has made my arms (even my elbows) very soft.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it everyday after showwers.</li>
            <li>Smelled like a cheap imitation, a KNOCKOFF.</li>
            <li>Sexy soft scent, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with the fragrance and the fact that the scent and the lotion itself lasted throughout the day without feeling heavy or greasy on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent but the scent was too subtle for my taste.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t have any idea what black current smells like before trying this, but if this is what they smell like, I am most definitely a fan of that note!</li>
            <li>skin is not excessively dry without lotion</li>
            <li>I am unsure of how well it would moisturize very dry or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think the fragrance lasts as long as it should though.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry during the winter and this does wonders.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Have purchased previously.</li>
            <li> so I use this as just a little boost of moisture.</li>
            <li> I prefer a lighter, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> The reason I put 4 stars is because when it was received there was a part of the plastic pump that had been broken.</li>

            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product&lt;</li>
            <li> These chemicals are an irritant for my skin so using them is no longer an option:-(</li>

            <li> Excellent as always.  Especially love Amazing Grace but thought I would try another scent.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> That is the only word that I can use to describe the smell...heavenly!!! I absolutely love this lotion and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! My husband loves it too. My skin gets really dry during the winter and this does wonders.</li>

            <li> I prefer Amazing Grace and Pure Grace over the scent Falling in Love. The scent has a sweet blueberry smell covered up by a heavier, stronger scent. This scent has been around a while. Lots of people love it...I prefer a lighter, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice strong scent</li>
            <li> Love the feel and fragrance of this product not to mention the packaging is quite unique but I wish is was paraben free.  These chemicals are an irritant for my skin so using them is no longer an option:-(</li>
            <li> My favorite scent ever!!</li>
            <li> I only use this on my arms, and only to have a way of layering my fragrance. I keep one on my desk, and one in my bathroom so that I can use it whenever I feel like it. I absolutely LOVE the Falling In Love Summer scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that I see or feel much in the way of a &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; action, but I can say that it really has made my arms (even my elbows) very soft. I find myself using this on my hands as well, because it absorbs instantly with no greasy after feel whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have any idea what black current smells like before trying this, but if this is what they smell like, I am most definitely a fan of that note! The jasmine and amber in this really help to balance out the fruitiness, and I think help to make it a scent that women of many age ranges can happily wear.</li>
            <li> Love the pleasant but not overwhelming fragrance! Absorbs in the skin easily</li>
            <li> My Daughter gave me a set of this for a present.  When it ran out I ordered more.  I love the scent and get many compliments.</li>
            <li> My favorite....this was a gift to myself....love this stuff....this is the best lotion I have ever used...my friend gave me the first bottle and I have been hooked since.</li>
            <li> But the product, like all philosophy skin products that I have tried so far is excellent.  And like all the other scented products, it can be added to other scents.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Have purchased previously. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift, my cousin loves this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it everyday after showwers. Have gotten many compliments on fragrance.  It soothes your skin and helps keep it moist.  I would recommend to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my mother in law, she loves the smell and quality of the lotion. The reason I put 4 stars is because when it was received there was a part of the plastic pump that had been broken. I was going to return it but there was not an option to exchange so I kept it.</li>
            <li> The lotion is good quality apart from the fragrance and I love the fragrance</li>
            <li> I like this lotion a lot, it was my first philosophy purchase. I don&#x27;t think the fragrance lasts as long as it should though.</li>
            <li> Did not smell like the original Falling In Love fragrance. Smelled like a cheap imitation, a KNOCKOFF. I would NEVER recommend this product to a friend or relative.</li>
            <li> My wife has fallen in love with Philosophy! Too bad for me as now she expects it for birthdays, Valentines, etc... Well the bright sides are that it works as claimed, smells very nice and actually works to make her hands soft! The other good thing is now I don&#x27;t have to guess what to buy her!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion.  I have allergies and can&#x27;t wear perfume.  This has a wonderful, light scent.  Goes on smoothly and keeps skin moist.</li>
