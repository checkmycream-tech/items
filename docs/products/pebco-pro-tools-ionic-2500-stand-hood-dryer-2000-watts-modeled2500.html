            <li>For that reason, I strongly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>I guess the big guys win again.  </li>
            <li>The amazing thing is that even doing this, the dryer dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i still fit under the hood</li>
            <li>When wheeling the dryer, it seem like the head isn&#x27;t secure....</li>
            <li>Dries our hair in bout 20 mins tops great and quiet blow dryer.</li>
            <li>No base or five-star stand.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have experienced with this dryer is with the front hinged opening.  </li>
            <li>Great product, very quiet.</li>
            <li>Since I have being living in the US (almost 8 years), I have been taking care of my hair by my own and I have been using different kind of hair dryer.</li>
            <li>my clients love it, they say that it drys their hair very fast and it can be used anywhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $250 for my dryer and it is worth it!</li>
            <li>i love this item, it dries my hair fast, it doesnt make my hair over dy like straw, im</li>
            <li>is kind loud if that bothers you.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>It dries my roller set super</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and it isn&#x27;t a pain to sit under.  </li>
            <li>I love having the convenience of having a high quality,quiet, portable, hooded dryer in my home.  </li>
            <li>Plugged it in, turned hood on to hot full blast, got nothing but a whisper of cool air.  </li>
            <li>I can fit my large rollers in here.</li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer a few years ago and am still so happy I did.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This company shipped the dryer right away</li>
            <li>It is more than adequate heat, it is  fast and quiet, and delviery was quick.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast and leaves the hair with tremendous shine.  </li>
            <li>Had to make special trip to main post office after work to return it.</li>
            <li>I taped it shut with clear packing tape and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>You could not imagine my surprise when I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks to God that this seller has this attributes!</li>
            <li>It does get extremely HOT.</li>
            <li>I had too many problems receiving damaged dryers, so I didnt want to risk $350 on a third Pibbs.</li>
            <li>love shopping on Amazon, my entire family, co-workers,</li>
            <li>yes, it&#x27;s that quiet that I am able to hear the television and not disturb others in the room).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this dryer!</li>
            <li>I attribute this minor issue to user error more so than to a problem with the quality of the dryer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Physical description: It may look big in comparison with other hair dryer, but for me it just perfect because my rolls are big.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I ran into some trouble, but c/s was wonderful (missing wheel).</li>
            <li>His procedure showed me that they are very reliable company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use ear protectors and a hair net to secure them.</li>
            <li>that it is much heavier than the stand, like it wants to tilt over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are a REAL Company and INVESTIGATE before you assume and accuse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I use big rollers and they perfectly fit in the hood.</li>
            <li>I just receive this dryer today, i rolled my hair and it dried nice.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is quiet, portable, and powerful!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recall whether I ordered it from Amazon or Sally Beauty Supply, so I cannot comment with certainty on my experience with this particular seller.  </li>
            <li>Consequently, I reported it; and the seller immediately sent me a new product.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet and dries very fast...</li>
            <li>One thing that I appreciate about this dryer is that the hot air does not stay the same when you are drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>If I ever have to replace this dryer, I would choose the exact same brand (make and model).  </li>
            <li>I tried to contact amazon, and unfortunately no one has answered me or gotten back to me.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!!</li>
            <li>I studied professional hair care in my country Dominican Republic.</li>
            <li>In other words, when it is getting very hot, the hair dryer automatically reduces its speed, avoiding so that your hair get burn.</li>
            <li>It has four functions: The Timer button, which rings when the marked time finishes.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of drafting a complaint with the BBB- Better Business Bureau- and Consumer affairs.  </li>
            <li>Now, my eleven year old daughter looks forward to getting her hair washed because she gets to sit under this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something good quality as well as not so expensive...</li>
            <li>It was easy for me to assemble by myself, and when properly assembled it is quiet, and it dries my thick, curly, mid-back length hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>(I typically do not move it but once or twice I have rolled it into the living room so that I could watch something on TV and having the ability to do that</li>
            <li>The Speed Switch for high and low.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant about spending this much money on a hair dryer, but I believed, as long as it did what I needed it to do and held up to at least some of its review on YouTube, then it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Not the right product if your goal is just faster drying time than air drying, but with less frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s impossible and you will end up with a tangled mess in the best case scenario.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and use it for deep conditioning my daughters&#x27; natural hair.</li>
            <li>Other than having to duck under the hood it to enter and exit instead of raising and lowering the front opening the functioning of the dryer remains the same as when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>I only wish the hood was a bit bigger since the movable part of the hood could not shut completely</li>
            <li>Funny thing is this little detail is never mentioned in the item description.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I have natural hair (4a curls), and it takes 2.5 hours for my hair to dry with a tabletop dryer.</li>

            <li> I have natural hair (4a curls), and it takes 2.5 hours for my hair to dry with a tabletop dryer.</li>
            <li> We all know that before you get 1-2 hours inside of a dryer, you surely end up very tired.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t flat iron (</li>
            <li> As a result, you dry your hair without any back pain.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this product to someone who was using a curler set and wanted a faster dry time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it only took 45 minutes For my hair to dry</li>
            <li> This means that my hair is not so bad but it takes a too much time to dry it, because it is very long (almost to my waist) and strong.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, thereare some minor discomforts, which I would like to mention.</li>
            <li> So be extra carefully with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as they get out of the shower I put their hair in rollers, while it&#x27;s soaking wet, put the hair net on and sit them under the hood.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long for my hair to dry.</li>

            <li> Used it for the first time and I am very happy with the results. I had rollers on and my hair was dry in about 40 minutes. I only wish the hood was a bit bigger since the movable part of the hood could not shut completely but then again I had 3.5 inch rollers on. I am not sure if there are dryers with bigger hood in the market. In the end, results were great!</li>
            <li> i love this item, it dries my hair fast, it doesnt make my hair over dy like straw, im so happy with this item, definitly wort every dime!!</li>
            <li> I dont have anything good to say because I NEVER got my dryer.  I contacted Elsy&#x27;s Beauty Sales they said it was delivered..... NOT !!! I DID NOT get the dryer.  It&#x27;s been over 3 weeks I guess the big guys win again.  Elsy&#x27;s Beauty Sales takes your money and then will NOT contact you to fix the problem.  :(  If they ever fix the problem I will let you know.  :(</li>
            <li> Love it. Quiet and dries in no time.</li>
            <li> I studied professional hair care in my country Dominican Republic. Since I have being living in the US (almost 8 years), I have been taking care of my hair by my own and I have been using different kind of hair dryer. So I want to give you a description about my recent purchase of \\&quot;The PEBCO Pro Tools Ionic 2500 Stand Hood Dryer 2000 watts (Model ED 2500).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice a year, I used straightening treatment.  This means that my hair is not so bad but it takes a too much time to dry it, because it is very long (almost to my waist) and strong. Normally to dry my hair takes around from 2 to 2 ½ hours for drying it. However, this lasted until I bought the PEBCO Hood Dryer 2000w. You could not imagine my surprise when I used it for the first time. My hair was totally dry in just one hours and fifteen minutes! One thing that I appreciate about this dryer is that the hot air does not stay the same when you are drying your hair.  In other words, when it is getting very hot, the hair dryer automatically reduces its speed, avoiding so that your hair get burn. The amazing thing is that even doing this, the dryer dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physical description: It may look big in comparison with other hair dryer, but for me it just perfect because my rolls are big. The dryer is very quiet. I finally can watch my TV while I dry my hair--difficult thing to do with other brands. It has four functions: The Timer button, which rings when the marked time finishes. The Variable Temperature button includes warn, cold, and hot temperature. The Speed Switch for high and low. This button also turns off the dryer. In addition, the Hair dryer has the Ionic switch.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the dryer has a convenient design. Let me explain why. We all know that before you get 1-2 hours inside of a dryer, you surely end up very tired. But because of the way that the head cap is made, you can rest your back and shoulder in the process. As a result, you dry your hair without any back pain. Anyhow, thereare some minor discomforts, which I would like to mention. Because of space to storage, every time I use the hair dryers I assembly and disassembly, and I have experimented a little difficulty in putting in and out the dryer into the base. But if you don&#x27;t have my space problem, you can leave it, just as it is. Another thing is the opening hood, which is very delicate for being a professional hair dryer. So be extra carefully with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Finally, I do not know what you think about when you purchase a product. In my case, when I purchase a product of this category I hope that the seller company shows responsibility if any problems raises. Thanks to God that this seller has this attributes! Because when the dryer were delivery to my home, the timer was outworking. Consequently, I reported it; and the seller immediately sent me a new product. This process lasted less than four days to be completed. His procedure showed me that they are very reliable company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, I have being enjoying my hair dryer for a while and I am very happy of having it, because this hair dryer dries very fast and lets my hair very shining. It is for sure a good dryer. For that reason, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just receive this dryer today, i rolled my hair and it dried nice.  I like that i can have big rollers and i still fit under the hood but the best feature, ITS QUIET, it also has a timer that shuts off the dryer when its done..</li>
            <li> Great Product. I can fit my large rollers in here.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this hair dryer ..I have long hair and it only took 45 minutes For my hair to dry usually it take a longer Time to dry about 20 minute longer with my old dryer  luv it!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair dryer .  Very quiet and air is dispersed evenly.  I have long thick hair and takes forever to dry.  This saves me 20 minutes if dryer time.  Compact easy to roll in and out</li>
            <li> I have natural hair (4a curls), and it takes 2.5 hours for my hair to dry with a tabletop dryer. By then, my hair is so thirsty for moisture due to the extended time I&#x27;m under the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $250 for my dryer and it is worth it! It does get extremely HOT. I use ear protectors and a hair net to secure them. I love that it has a timer and a cool setting. It dries my roller set super fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the product four stars instead of five......&lt;br /&gt;I ran into some trouble, but c/s was wonderful (missing wheel). Initially, I purchased the Pibbs Kwik Dri from another company. I had too many problems receiving damaged dryers, so I didnt want to risk $350 on a third Pibbs. I found a review of this product on YouTube, so I took a risk.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this dryer is comparable to the Pibbs, but better. I also gave four stars instead of five, b/c the stand isn&#x27;t as sturdy. It is made of plastic instead of an iron base like the Pibbs.  When wheeling the dryer, it seem like the head isn&#x27;t secure....that it is much heavier than the stand, like it wants to tilt over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you would be pleased with your purchase. I would repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of drafting a complaint with the BBB- Better Business Bureau- and Consumer affairs.  not to mention my blog on google.  If your normal practice is to treat your customers poorly, decieve them, Charge, and NEVER send products, and then threaten them with credit agencies and false accusations. I will expose you for the savages that you are.- NEVER IN LIFE THREATHEN ME AGAIN!  The internet is full of profitable, HONEST, thriving beauty suppliers, -AMAZON should never, EVER accept this type of behavior from it&#x27;s SELLERs.- UNACCEPTABLE!!! I was charged , and then rightfully -refunded I NEVER received my product.- PERIOD -Pretend you are a REAL Company and INVESTIGATE before you assume and accuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love shopping on Amazon, my entire family, co-workers, Friends shop on AMAZON, everyone will know NOT to shop and purchase from your company.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great, the bell chime at the end of the cycle is kind loud if that bothers you.</li>
            <li> I love my hair dryer. It&#x27;s just like the one at my Dominican salon and it&#x27;s much better than blow drying my hair. My hair has such shine and softness after I use this dryer.</li>
            <li> Dries our hair in bout 20 mins tops great and quiet blow dryer. And we have really thick African American hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair dryer and convenient.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T EVEN BOTHER!!!&lt;br /&gt;Delivered hood only.  No base or five-star stand. Plugged it in, turned hood on to hot full blast, got nothing but a whisper of cool air.  Elsys blamed UPS must have shipped the base and stand separately, when Elsys sent it USPS not UPS!&lt;br /&gt;Even the box clearly states the contents includes a base and pole.  Had to make special trip to main post office after work to return it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer in 2011. I can&#x27;t recall whether I ordered it from Amazon or Sally Beauty Supply, so I cannot comment with certainty on my experience with this particular seller.  However, I can attest to the fact that this dryer is amazing!  It was easy for me to assemble by myself, and when properly assembled it is quiet, and it dries my thick, curly, mid-back length hair quickly.  Years ago when I used to go to the hair salon, it used to take almost an hour and a half with the dryer on the hottest setting to get my hair completely dry.  Now it only takes half that time (I think this has something to do with the ionic setting on the dryer).  I also appreciate the fact that the dryer is portable can be easily rolled from one spot to another.  (I typically do not move it but once or twice I have rolled it into the living room so that I could watch something on TV and having the ability to do that is nice-- yes, it&#x27;s that quiet that I am able to hear the television and not disturb others in the room).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three years of weekly use this dryer continues to work beautifully. The only problem I have experienced with this dryer is with the front hinged opening.  After about two or so years of weekly use, a screw or something on the left side (facing the unit) came out.  I attribute this minor issue to user error more so than to a problem with the quality of the dryer (I had a habit of letting the opening slam closed when exiting from under the dryer and eventually it damaged the hinge).  I taped it shut with clear packing tape and it looks fine. Other than having to duck under the hood it to enter and exit instead of raising and lowering the front opening the functioning of the dryer remains the same as when I first purchased it. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I love having the convenience of having a high quality,quiet, portable, hooded dryer in my home.  If I ever have to replace this dryer, I would choose the exact same brand (make and model).  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this dryer.  I was scheduled to arrive in 7 days and it came in 4 days.  I was everything I expected!  It dries fast and leaves the hair with tremendous shine.  I use it in my salon and it helps me move my clients in and out at lightening speed. Also very quiet, you wouldn&#x27;t even know it was on.  Great Investment.......</li>
            <li> the dryer got damaged and it started falling apart in less than 3 months. I&#x60;ve been contacting the company but the company continues to send me to the warranty and the company pebco claims that they&#x60;re not responsible for products from amazon, which left me hanging in the dark. I tried to contact amazon, and unfortunately no one has answered me or gotten back to me.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer a few years ago and am still so happy I did. I have very thick, long (a bit above my waist), dark hair. My two daughters ages 9 &amp; 10 have thick long spiral curls. This machine is wonderful and saved me a lot of money. Our hair is dry in about 1 hr under the hood. They can play on the computer or watch tv while their hair is drying, the wheels make it easy. As soon as they get out of the shower I put their hair in rollers, while it&#x27;s soaking wet, put the hair net on and sit them under the hood. I don&#x27;t flat iron (that is damaging), I just remove the curlers and add smooth and shine and they are good to go to their function. It&#x27;s so nice to have around! Thanks Pebco!!!!</li>
            <li> Forget it if you plan to use this without hair rollers. It&#x27;s impossible and you will end up with a tangled mess in the best case scenario. I am afraid it will rip the hair off my head. Currently, I am trying to return the item to the seller (BYPLE) who is making things difficult and saying that the product in not defective and MUST BE USED WITH ROLLERS. Funny thing is this little detail is never mentioned in the item description.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bomb tic tac is pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> Hood dryer worked ,however it does suck air up a bit towards the top of the dome as one review describes...so for a curly head of hair...this will NOT lessen your volume... It will increase it. Also, heat and air do not reach the nap of the neck well. Thus useless for a thick head of long hair. I would only recommend this product to someone who was using a curler set and wanted a faster dry time. Not the right product if your goal is just faster drying time than air drying, but with less frizz. You won&#x27;t get that.  Be very careful if you are considering this item.  Return process was very flawed.</li>
            <li> is bad worst company ever... omg inresponsable, they send wrong parts. also missing parts.. dont buy it. im still trying to get my money back after almost a month</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about spending this much money on a hair dryer, but I believed, as long as it did what I needed it to do and held up to at least some of its review on YouTube, then it would be worth it.  Well, it does!  This dryer is quiet, portable, and powerful!  It dries quickly and it isn&#x27;t a pain to sit under.  Now, my eleven year old daughter looks forward to getting her hair washed because she gets to sit under this hair dryer.  (She calls it the space shuttle because of the shield.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed in this purchase!</li>
            <li> This dryer is the BOMB!!! It doesn&#x27;t take long for my hair to dry. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this dryer! I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and use it for deep conditioning my daughters&#x27; natural hair. It&#x27;s so amazingly quiet that I find myself checking to see if it is on!</li>
            <li> I had this as a gift for my daughter tired of spending so much money at the salon.. I wanted something good quality as well as not so expensive... I found this machine that even though is not so expensive shipping brings it out a little close to 200 dollars; however, well worth it... In just three uses I already made up for the value and saved money. My daughter has long hair and she fits with big rollers and small... It dries fast and her hair looks wonderful... We love the machine... Its a great investment. 5 stars...</li>
            <li> Great product, very quiet.</li>
            <li> No more wasted time sitting under the dryer. It is more than adequate heat, it is  fast and quiet, and delviery was quick.  It was the perfect gift from my husband.</li>
            <li> It works great!  my clients love it, they say that it drys their hair very fast and it can be used anywhere.</li>
            <li> This company shipped the dryer right away but it was broken into pieces. I was very disappointed and I contacted them trying to get a refund but they said they could replace the broken part. I didn&#x27;t want to make a big deal, so I agreed. Well, It has been a month and I&#x27;m still waiting for the part. I email them again but they are not responding. Now they have my money and I have a broken dryer. I wasn&#x27;t going to give them a bad review but at this point, I see that THEY JUST DON&#x27;T CARE. Think about it three times before you buy anything from this company. As you can see, buying from this company has been an awful experience.</li>
            <li> Excelent dryer. It is very quiet and dries very fast...I love that! I use big rollers and they perfectly fit in the hood. I recommend it!</li>
