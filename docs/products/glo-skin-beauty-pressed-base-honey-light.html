            <li>I love the coverage of this powder foundation.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Authentic item.</li>
            <li>Very clean &amp; healthy makeup</li>
            <li>so it goes on thicker than if a brush is used, but it&#x27;s nice to be able to apply it both ways depending on how much coverage I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color matches with no glare, no weeping and is easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and covers well</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>do I ordered the full sized compact.</li>
            <li>They products have really helped my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend it for people with problem skin and does good coverage.</li>
            <li>Came quickly as advertised.</li>
            <li>High quality product, better than all competitors.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this light, last-all-day, finishing powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and is a really soft finish.</li>
            <li>There is no comparison when it comes to Glomineral and the other popular mineral makeup on QVC.</li>
            <li>I love this powder, is much lighter than the regular mineral make up.</li>
            <li>I seen amazon had it much cheaper than buying it at the Spa</li>
            <li>This powder goes on very evenly and doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li>The powder feels very silky on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few pressed powders in my time, but this one outshines all...probably as mineral based, but the cover is fantastic and still I feel its light enough for my skin to breathe.</li>
            <li>A very natural look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s developed by dermatologists...</li>
            <li>My only concern is, is it really GloMinerals or a &amp;#34;wanna</li>
            <li>Major plus for me!</li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin and the more expensive brands of mineral makeup have caused breakouts but this one doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>The base goes on easily and feels smooth.</li>

            <li> The base goes on easily and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I have skin issues and this is a GREAT cover which does not irritate or redden my angry, angry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this Glominerals pressed base for years, and I feel it is the most natural looking make-up that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time and no longer buy it from an aesthetician because I get the same product here for less.  </li>
            <li> i have been using this base for quite awhile and it has nice coverage.  </li>
            <li> Like any other makeup, needs to be touched up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I remembered that Glomineral is tripled milled giving it that creamy feel that other mineral makeup cannot come close to.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Bare Minerals which lit a skin fire that took years to bring under control.</li>
            <li> Love this base.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base makeup!</li>
            <li> I was recently recommended a different brand that&#x27;s a little less expensive, but I hate it.</li>
            <li> It comes with a thin round sponge applicator</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look fake or caked on.</li>

            <li> I love it ! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Very clean &amp; healthy makeup</li>

            <li> The best foundation ever for any king of skin.  Not oily not drying and won&#x27;t break you out.  It&#x27;s developed by dermatologists...love love love it!</li>
            <li> This powder goes on very evenly and doesn&#x27;t cake. It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne or make my skin too oily.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup! Don&#x27;t know why I stopped using it, oh yeah because its $44 at the spa, but the price on Amazon is so affordable, will never go back!</li>
            <li> The makeup I ordered was sold at an excellent price and the seller provided very fast shipment. My daughter was delighted to find a free gift with her makeup when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup!!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect powder for over make-up or alone.  Doesn&#x27;t feel cakey.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I have skin issues and this is a GREAT cover which does not irritate or redden my angry, angry skin. Coupled with the Yonka skin care, I look much younger and I&#x27;m not so emotionally devestated about my looks. Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Bare Minerals which lit a skin fire that took years to bring under control.</li>

            <li> Came quickly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Using this product is like using nothing at all. The color matches with no glare, no weeping and is easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The base goes on easily and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my esthetician...good product. Like any other makeup, needs to be touched up throughout the day. Overall tho, I think I&#x27;ve switched to this from a product Ive used for years.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery on exceptional product!</li>
            <li> The powder feels very silky on my skin.  It was recommended by my esthetician.  They products have really helped my skin look better.</li>

            <li> Beautiful color and quality. Authentic item. Glominerals is wonderful makeup!</li>
            <li> I like using GloMinerals -  My only concern is, is it really GloMinerals or a &amp;#34;wanna be&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> the best coverage without irritation even for the most sensitive skin type .</li>
            <li> This is the greatest make up. It&#x27;s easy to apply and is a really soft finish. I have bought at the local spas and this is a big money saver.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison when it comes to Glomineral and the other popular mineral makeup on QVC. Glomineral glides on beautifully and gives you just the right coverage. It doesn&#x27;t look fake or caked on. I remembered that Glomineral is tripled milled giving it that creamy feel that other mineral makeup cannot come close to.</li>
            <li> Have used this before and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base makeup! I&#x27;ve ordered it multiple times before. I was recently recommended a different brand that&#x27;s a little less expensive, but I hate it. Definitely going bak to my Glo Minerals!!!</li>
