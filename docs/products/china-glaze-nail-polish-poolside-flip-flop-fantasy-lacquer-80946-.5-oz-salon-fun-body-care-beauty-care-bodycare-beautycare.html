            <li>Love the color but it chips VERY easily</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and drys really fast</li>
            <li>My grandchildren love it</li>
            <li>I have more China glaze polishes and haven&#x27;t had that problem.</li>
            <li>I love the this peachey coral color.</li>
            <li>Love love love the color.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love this color.</li>
            <li>I really love this color, super vibrant and perfect for summer!</li>
            <li>I repainted them and I love to stay in the sun but</li>
            <li>However, this polish chipped super easily even with a good top coat.</li>
            <li>but i do still love the color and very very quick shipping</li>
            <li>But the contrast with my skin made my hands look tan and gave off a nice color without being too bold.</li>
            <li>but it also chipped really easily.</li>
            <li>It also began to chip very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its not the original fff</li>
            <li>I love the color but just be aware.</li>
            <li>It chips right after one day.</li>
            <li>The Lacquer color is not too dark or bright.</li>
            <li>This was my first China glaze polish and I&#x27;m sad to say I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I always use a top coat so not a big deal but still!</li>
            <li>I mixed it with a pale beige/coral to get a more suitable (for me) color.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to purchase the color make sure it the light colored pink, and not the bright orange, because China Glaze has changed the color, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty but even with a basecoat, 2 thin coats and a top coat it chipped almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s me, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to apply as smoothly as the other China Glaze products that I have.  </li>
            <li>This color is much better than the Pink one I got from the same brand.</li>
            <li>For such a pricey polish I really expected something grand.</li>
            <li>Seems to dry out really fast around the edge when you are using.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that I am in love with the color, but I ordered late Thursday night and was told I would get it by the 8th- two days after my birthday.. and received it Saturday morning!</li>
            <li>Always loved this brand but this must have just been a bad batch.</li>

            <li> Beautiful color, but the formula is terrible.</li>
            <li> It seems like it was mixed with something, as its really thin</li>
            <li> It did take a few coats to get it to cover fully.</li>
            <li> It would not go on right and looked really bad.</li>
            <li> The formula is so thin and runny and it wasn&#x27;t marked as a matte but dries very dull.</li>

            <li> It also looks dull.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will try it with a base coat in addition.</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> Hate the texture.</li>

            <li> Awesome color, but it Chips off the nails prematurely</li>
            <li> Got my nails done as this color in the salon and HAD to have it. Ordered 2 of them. Might even get more!</li>
            <li> Love the color but it chips VERY easily</li>
            <li> I have used it before at a spa.My grandchildren love it</li>
            <li> Its not the original fff but i do still love the color and very very quick shipping</li>
            <li> Love the color!!! Hate the texture. It chips right after one day.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, but the formula is terrible. It seems like it was mixed with something, as its really thin and it chipped the same day i put it on. I have more China glaze polishes and haven&#x27;t had that problem. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Very thin. Applied multiple coats and all nails chipped within 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Color looks different from picture</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out really fast around the edge when you are using. You have to close it up and shake it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a color like this for quite some time. This color is much better than the Pink one I got from the same brand. The Lacquer color is not too dark or bright. Goes along great with almost any clothing item making this a must have for the summer, for sure!!!</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty but even with a basecoat, 2 thin coats and a top coat it chipped almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and chip resistant. I tried this at a salon and had to have it. The neon orange/pink makes me look more tanned, and I love that!</li>
            <li> I like the colors but they start chipping within the day.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I am in love with the color, but I ordered late Thursday night and was told I would get it by the 8th- two days after my birthday.. and received it Saturday morning! Only a day after I ordered I received it! And now I have it for my birthday! I Didn&#x27;t pay a shipping fee either.. Would definitely recommend buying! &amp; Polish was perfect</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and drys really fast but it also chipped really easily. Practicing massage I need something that won&#x27;t chip as soon as I put it on and work on someone.</li>
            <li> Always loved this brand but this must have just been a bad batch. It would not go on right and looked really bad. I didn&#x27;t like the Matt look either.</li>
            <li> I purchased the flip flop fantasy because my nail spa stop caring this color. I love the this peachey coral color. Its a summer fav and looks great on hands &amp; feet. If you&#x27;re trying to purchase the color make sure it the light colored pink, and not the bright orange, because China Glaze has changed the color, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The polish is gooey. Meh.</li>
            <li> It seems like the product was mixed with something to make it thinner. Doesn&#x27;t go on the nail properly.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this nail polish.  Maybe it&#x27;s me, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to apply as smoothly as the other China Glaze products that I have.  It also looks dull.</li>
            <li> Love love love the color. Thanks</li>
            <li> Its nice and bright! Love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this color. Got my toes done with this color at the salon and had to get it myself! Best summer color of 2014 for sure!</li>
            <li> tried it on right away its awesome color got a lot of compliments I would definitely buy it again its the perfect color for a nice tan in the summer</li>
            <li> This was my first China glaze polish and I&#x27;m sad to say I wasn&#x27;t impressed. The formula is so thin and runny and it wasn&#x27;t marked as a matte but dries very dull. I always use a top coat so not a big deal but still! It also began to chip very quickly. For such a pricey polish I really expected something grand.</li>
            <li> Perfect summertime color!</li>
            <li> I really love this color, super vibrant and perfect for summer! However, this polish chipped super easily even with a good top coat. Next time I will try it with a base coat in addition.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see it in the photo, but Flip-Flop Fantasy is a very bright neon coral. I mixed it with a pale beige/coral to get a more suitable (for me) color.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this polish! But I wore it on my toes and went to the beach and it faded almost to where it looked completely white. I repainted them and I love to stay in the sun but not anymore than one would usually stay in the sun. They faded again!! I love the color but just be aware.</li>
            <li> Loved this color. I got a ton of compliments on it. It did take a few coats to get it to cover fully. But the contrast with my skin made my hands look tan and gave off a nice color without being too bold.</li>
            <li> Best summer color ever.</li>
