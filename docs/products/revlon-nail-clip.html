            <li>Everything was great and without problem.</li>
            <li>Great nail clipper but listing had me thinking there were 6 in the packet.  </li>
            <li>Good buy for a bachelor.  </li>
            <li>good for the price.  </li>
            <li>And they were a good pair...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of Amazon and 99.9% of the time have nothing except good to say about how they sell product.  </li>
            <li>all the roughness and sloppiness in the manufacturing of the jaws, you would think that they would carry that through to the edges of the file (where it might do some good).  </li>
            <li>Revlon clippers are usually good.  </li>
            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>This is not a luxury product for me, but rather a utilitarian tool that gets the job done, and in that regard, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews that it wasn&#x27;t the best, but some people said that it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>Easy to carry, and great for any situation</li>
            <li>and they do one thing they break all my nails,toe nail any kind of nail...</li>
            <li>kind of like socks in the lauhdry...</li>
            <li>ones.&lt;br /&gt;Order came quick .. that I am happy about.</li>
            <li>It is functional and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The old Revlon nail clips were the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy, i would buy again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, they look sturdy - better quality than what I had before.</li>
            <li>A COUPLE MORE DOLLARS AND GET A BETTER ONE...</li>
            <li>What more could you expect for the price?</li>
            <li>and I put that in place where we access our clippers the most, the master bath.  </li>
            <li>So, I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Gotta love Amazon.</li>
            <li>Get something with better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have been \\&quot;top quality\\</li>
            <li>What else can I say about nail clippers that can be more informative?</li>
            <li>It is a better made clipper than some of the others I have tried</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>It was especially challenging dealing with my big toe, where the nails are maybe a tenth of an inch (2mm)</li>
            <li>a $15 model might be better, but for the price difference it had better be.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love them</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not the right size for heavy-duty large toenails like my husband&#x27;s, but they&#x27;re strong and good quality and great for hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not give a nice, clean cut.</li>
            <li>a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>These are good clippers, I really have nothing more to say except that they fulfill their purpose.</li>
            <li>I had read on one of these reviews that the best clipper another customer found was a cheap generic from a drug store. .</li>
            <li>, shucks, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fancy for the price, but I needed some more nail clippers and these were cheap, so I bought them.</li>
            <li>great clippers at a great price, they are sturdy and just the same as you would find in stores, but these seem a lot better than the cheap ones that you usually get at walmart ect, and this was great deal, the same price for cheap ones and you get great ones!!!</li>
            <li>It was easy to work with this shipper.</li>
            <li>Obama sure is a liar but these clippers are true to their form.</li>
            <li>and I think they will work fine.</li>
            <li>For under $2 though, they work fine.</li>
            <li>Edit: Still works fine until today, after about 2 years.</li>
            <li>if you need something to do the job, then this is fine.  </li>
            <li>works fine.</li>
            <li>This works fine and hasn&#x27;t given me any problems to speak of.</li>
            <li>a todo el que pueda comprarlo fine</li>
            <li>I bought these yesterday and just cut my nails - they worked fine</li>
            <li>I feel this is fine....</li>
            <li>They work fine for fingernails though.</li>
            <li>Revlon is a good name brand a little pricey but good.................</li>
            <li>They are cheap, so that is what gets them 2 stars.</li>
            <li>And cheap.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I bought it, because, I thought Revlon is a known brand and can&#x27;t make cheap products.</li>
            <li>I have a cheap nailclipper which probably came from the dollar store</li>
            <li>This nail clipper does the job but feels cheap.</li>
            <li>If you want a quality nail clip then don&#x27;t buy this cuz you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap device</li>
            <li>Since it was so cheap, I decided to give it a try...</li>
            <li>So hart to control for getting a smooth edge.</li>
            <li>Works well with the cheap Revlon emery</li>
            <li>these are good clippers, cuts nice and so far has not dulled fast</li>
            <li>It absolutely would not cut a finger nail!!!  </li>
            <li>Clips my nails and hangnails super easily.</li>
            <li>Keep those nails cut and clean.  </li>
            <li>The new file is so smooth that it might be better suited for polishing the lacquer paint job on the hood of a fine automobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good nail clipper should produce a clean, even cut with a satisfying sharp click.</li>
            <li>I am glad that they were really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment and nailclippers are always a necessity.  </li>
            <li>(My toenails don&#x27;t grow quickly, so I&#x27;m guessing my fingernails are experiencing an overcompensation issue.)</li>
            <li>I have purchased Revlon nail clippers for as long as I can remember and always got a good product.</li>
            <li>The redesign is for the worse, and it does a fairly thorough job of messing up most of what was good about the decades old design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and quick delivery!  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t really &amp;#34;go wrong&amp;#34; buying it, but it does feel cheap.</li>
            <li>but I have my doubts they&#x27;ll even be useful there.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t worth the frustration.</li>
            <li>Definitely satisfied thus far.  </li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t worth my time to return them.</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for and it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>worth buying over than that of the store.</li>
            <li>and it works far better than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Far better than those for $0.99 in a plastic bin</li>
            <li>but if you want sharp and good feeling clippers, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>are the right color.it</li>
            <li>was just the right price.</li>
            <li>It clips cleanly, designed ergonomically (comfy to hold), and very affordable.</li>
            <li>The blade is nice and sharp and takes care of things cleanly.  </li>
            <li>but this clipper is much better than many I&#x27;ve had previously.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid Amazonian, and like reviewing things</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>they seem like rather blunt instruments -- it takes so much pressure to cut the nails that they aren&#x27;t really worth using.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Just find something higher quality.</li>
            <li>The file has smoothly beveled side edges, without a hint of serration near the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Firstly, it is bulkier in an unwelcome way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there, but I&#x27;m not sure which to recommend.</li>
            <li>At first glance, it looks like a well built quality product.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s built well and will last for many years though.</li>
            <li>could be better if it got a hole on the tail that I can somehow attach it to my key rings or something</li>
            <li>if I paid more I&#x27;d send it back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old design had an excellent file with deep serrations and sharp edges.  </li>
            <li>The blades do not come into contact with eachother through a nail, resulting in a very un clean cut, almost tearing the last bit of nail away.  </li>
            <li>This little tool has great leverage to cut nails with less effort than many others.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how solid and sturdy these are; these are probably the nicest nail clippers we own.</li>
            <li>These are apparently the new design with a chrome finish and a crosshatch design on the top surface of the lever.</li>
            <li>Beside being very cheap and flimsy and toy_like material, its design is very strange and not ergonomic.</li>
            <li>so they must be decent, right??</li>
            <li>This is certainly an example of \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is a decent clipper to use, I like it!</li>
            <li>and it was too much for the clippers to handle.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap and actually cut the nail rather than mangling it.</li>
            <li>I expected better from a name like Revlon.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I can write all these reviews on Amazon at a speed much quicker than when I was trying to type with my feet.</li>
            <li>Everything seems much easier with this Revlon.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>think it would be mostly guys who would face this difficulty as our nails are generally tougher, so if you are a guy with strong toenails, I would advise against buying these and look for a larger/more heavy duty set.</li>
            <li>these are quality  nail clippers with sharp blades and a nice spring action.  </li>
            <li>it was super cheap and cuts your nails but isn&#x27;t very sharp.....</li>
            <li>But other than that its ok.</li>
            <li>Better than some other nail clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Apparently they were in her way whenever she wanted to hold my hand, and she was tired of being &amp;#34;punched in the face by a nightstick&amp;#34; whenever I moved around in my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it has been months since we split up, but now life has become incredibly convenient.</li>
            <li>For the reasonable price, these are decent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right out of the package its very noticeable that these are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>Its kind of small for me..</li>
            <li>A small nail clipper can always come in handy and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Is good for clipping nails but not good if you try to clip skin.</li>
            <li>They were kind enough to send me one of the old one&#x27;s mixed in with the 11 new ones.  </li>
            <li>These nail clippers are okay, and they&#x27;re less than two dollars</li>
            <li>particular listing is showing a photo for the reliable nail clipper design that Revlon marketed for decades.  </li>
            <li>(but, not all) of the listings, but someone keeps wanting to describe this product as &#x27;Classic.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>And unlike many on Amazon that are more expensive, it comes with a file.</li>
            <li>It gives a decent cut, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those looking to make nail care quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>Price too high for one.</li>
            <li>Makes a click sound when pressed hard and ensures a clean cut.</li>
            <li>I tried adding a shim (about 1/16\\&quot;) to get a little more leverage</li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t the make one that is large enough to fit a big toe nail.</li>
            <li>gripes about Revlon&#x27;s new re-design on this classic product still stand.  </li>
            <li>There were older nail clippers by Revlon, and the new ones.  </li>
            <li>Stay away from this clipper, spend a few bucks more for quality</li>
            <li>I promise, I&#x27;m not Shrek and my nails are normal.</li>
            <li>Not just your normal mediocre-made-in-China-quality-product-not-sharp, but sore-palms-from-squeezing-these-damn-things-so-hard-not-sharp.</li>
            <li>They are not sharp enough to make a clean cut.</li>
            <li>A while ago it chipped on one side, so I figured I&#x27;d get a new nail clipper aka this one.</li>
            <li>Its not - its new junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>found that the deficiencies in this new design were widespread -</li>
            <li>For something as simple as this, I would have expected better.</li>
            <li>In the meantime stay FAR away from this junk!</li>
            <li>Amazon usually has better descriptions.  </li>
            <li>The Revlon part numbers on the packaging for the old design and the new were exactly the same part number</li>
            <li>Especially when compared to what others are charging for clippers that pretty much provide the same results.</li>
            <li>Finally, I ordered a few from an online shop outside of Amazon, just to make sure they truly were horrid - they consistently</li>
            <li>if you use and force it to cut the nail it will most likely split the nail like it did to me causing it to bleed and mess up your toe.</li>
            <li>These things are so poorly-designed and dull that you&#x27;d be better off chewing your nails off.</li>
            <li>the older ones were very, very good, the new ones are junk, worthless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The previous old design had a file that was very good for both flat surface and edge work; at least good enough for people who don&#x27;t care for a proper manicure (I&#x27;ll say it: that would probably mean men, mostly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t always clip skin near the nail very well.  </li>
            <li>This redesign turned them into complete garbage.  </li>
            <li>only consolation is they don&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li>I would consider there professional grade.</li>
            <li>&quot;, these are not.&lt;br /&gt;I notice on Amazon&#x27;s web site search the old style is</li>
            <li>I guess this will have to be used by my 3 young children.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be the only kind that Target carries lately.  </li>
            <li>Spend a few extra dollars and buy something with better build quality.</li>
            <li>At least, it was only $1.49, and not your nice ones.</li>
            <li>These are not as good as the ones I left behind, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Revlon clippers for decades but am now shopping for expensive trendy clippers just to find something decent.</li>
            <li>For the price compared to other nail clippers, this definitely is worth it.</li>
            <li>Due to the curved top lever, I could not push any harder as the back end of the lever was completely in contact with the bottom part of the clipper!</li>
            <li>This clipper is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>During the first use, my nail was nearly torn off and the produced a very rough, jagged cut.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever used a very rough circular saw blade to try to make a fine cut, you know what I&#x27;m talking about when it leaves the last bit of wood un-cut on the bottom, and these nail clippers do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nail clipper that is actually shipping is a new Revlon redesign.  </li>
            <li>new inferior design can be avoided if you are shown a proper photo of it.  </li>
            <li>The new design has a diagonal cross-hatch pattern formed into the outer surface of the upper lever handle.  </li>
            <li>in hand, the new design can be further identified.  </li>
            <li>I just bought these in April 2014 from another store and have only been able to use them a second time before replacing them with another brand (not sure which yet).  </li>
            <li>clippers are not sharp.</li>
            <li>Not sharp at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li>These are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>The center of the jaws close first and even with extra pressure applied to the levers, the jaws cannot close down enough on the outer edges to make a fully clean cut.  </li>
            <li>As someone who loses clippers every couple of months, I need cheap ones and that&#x27;s what these are.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly visible in product photos (when the proper photo is shown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly, it is made in China, while &#x27;old reliable&#x27; was made in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will only softly bend the nail and will not cut through it,</li>
            <li>Although, they aren&#x27;t even worth the few dollars I paid for them.</li>
            <li>They only lasted 2 months before they were too dull to easily cut.  </li>
            <li>The pin that holds the two pieces together also comes out pretty frequently, so it&#x27;s a good thing I have a degree from MIT to put this stupid thing back together</li>
            <li>This product is ok with fingernails, for toe nails get the bigger and tough</li>
            <li>The metal has not broken or fallen apart, but the blade is slightly duller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like I have super thick nails</li>
            <li>Might be OK for cutting a baby&#x27;s fingernails just after a bath, but does not have the leverge to cut adult fingernails well.  </li>

            <li> Good buy for a bachelor.  </li>
            <li> good for the price.  </li>
            <li> And they were a good pair...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of Amazon and 99.9% of the time have nothing except good to say about how they sell product.  </li>
            <li> all the roughness and sloppiness in the manufacturing of the jaws, you would think that they would carry that through to the edges of the file (where it might do some good).  </li>
            <li> Revlon clippers are usually good.  </li>
            <li> It is good.</li>
            <li> This is not a luxury product for me, but rather a utilitarian tool that gets the job done, and in that regard, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews that it wasn&#x27;t the best, but some people said that it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> Easy to carry, and great for any situation</li>
            <li> and they do one thing they break all my nails,toe nail any kind of nail...</li>
            <li> kind of like socks in the lauhdry...</li>
            <li> ones.&lt;br /&gt;Order came quick .. that I am happy about.</li>
            <li> It is functional and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The old Revlon nail clips were the best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy, i would buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, they look sturdy - better quality than what I had before.</li>
            <li> A COUPLE MORE DOLLARS AND GET A BETTER ONE...</li>
            <li> What more could you expect for the price?</li>
            <li> and I put that in place where we access our clippers the most, the master bath.  </li>
            <li> So, I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Gotta love Amazon.</li>
            <li> Get something with better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been \\&quot;top quality\\</li>
            <li> What else can I say about nail clippers that can be more informative?</li>
            <li> It is a better made clipper than some of the others I have tried</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> It was especially challenging dealing with my big toe, where the nails are maybe a tenth of an inch (2mm)</li>
            <li> a $15 model might be better, but for the price difference it had better be.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love them</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not the right size for heavy-duty large toenails like my husband&#x27;s, but they&#x27;re strong and good quality and great for hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not give a nice, clean cut.</li>
            <li> a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li> These are good clippers, I really have nothing more to say except that they fulfill their purpose.</li>
            <li> I had read on one of these reviews that the best clipper another customer found was a cheap generic from a drug store. .</li>
            <li> , shucks, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fancy for the price, but I needed some more nail clippers and these were cheap, so I bought them.</li>
            <li> great clippers at a great price, they are sturdy and just the same as you would find in stores, but these seem a lot better than the cheap ones that you usually get at walmart ect, and this was great deal, the same price for cheap ones and you get great ones!!!</li>
            <li> It was easy to work with this shipper.</li>
            <li> Obama sure is a liar but these clippers are true to their form.</li>
            <li> and I think they will work fine.</li>
            <li> For under $2 though, they work fine.</li>
            <li> Edit: Still works fine until today, after about 2 years.</li>
            <li> if you need something to do the job, then this is fine.  </li>
            <li> works fine.</li>
            <li> This works fine and hasn&#x27;t given me any problems to speak of.</li>
            <li> a todo el que pueda comprarlo fine</li>
            <li> I bought these yesterday and just cut my nails - they worked fine</li>
            <li> I feel this is fine....</li>
            <li> They work fine for fingernails though.</li>
            <li> Revlon is a good name brand a little pricey but good.................</li>
            <li> They are cheap, so that is what gets them 2 stars.</li>
            <li> And cheap.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> I bought it, because, I thought Revlon is a known brand and can&#x27;t make cheap products.</li>
            <li> I have a cheap nailclipper which probably came from the dollar store</li>
            <li> This nail clipper does the job but feels cheap.</li>
            <li> If you want a quality nail clip then don&#x27;t buy this cuz you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap device</li>
            <li> Since it was so cheap, I decided to give it a try...</li>
            <li> So hart to control for getting a smooth edge.</li>
            <li> Works well with the cheap Revlon emery</li>
            <li> these are good clippers, cuts nice and so far has not dulled fast</li>
            <li> It absolutely would not cut a finger nail!!!  </li>
            <li> Clips my nails and hangnails super easily.</li>
            <li> Keep those nails cut and clean.  </li>
            <li> The new file is so smooth that it might be better suited for polishing the lacquer paint job on the hood of a fine automobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good nail clipper should produce a clean, even cut with a satisfying sharp click.</li>
            <li> I am glad that they were really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and nailclippers are always a necessity.  </li>
            <li> (My toenails don&#x27;t grow quickly, so I&#x27;m guessing my fingernails are experiencing an overcompensation issue.)</li>
            <li> I have purchased Revlon nail clippers for as long as I can remember and always got a good product.</li>
            <li> The redesign is for the worse, and it does a fairly thorough job of messing up most of what was good about the decades old design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and quick delivery!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t really &amp;#34;go wrong&amp;#34; buying it, but it does feel cheap.</li>
            <li> but I have my doubts they&#x27;ll even be useful there.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t worth the frustration.</li>
            <li> Definitely satisfied thus far.  </li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t worth my time to return them.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for and it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> worth buying over than that of the store.</li>
            <li> and it works far better than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Far better than those for $0.99 in a plastic bin</li>
            <li> but if you want sharp and good feeling clippers, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> are the right color.it</li>
            <li> was just the right price.</li>
            <li> It clips cleanly, designed ergonomically (comfy to hold), and very affordable.</li>
            <li> The blade is nice and sharp and takes care of things cleanly.  </li>
            <li> but this clipper is much better than many I&#x27;ve had previously.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid Amazonian, and like reviewing things</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> they seem like rather blunt instruments -- it takes so much pressure to cut the nails that they aren&#x27;t really worth using.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just find something higher quality.</li>
            <li> The file has smoothly beveled side edges, without a hint of serration near the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Firstly, it is bulkier in an unwelcome way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there, but I&#x27;m not sure which to recommend.</li>
            <li> At first glance, it looks like a well built quality product.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s built well and will last for many years though.</li>
            <li> could be better if it got a hole on the tail that I can somehow attach it to my key rings or something</li>
            <li> if I paid more I&#x27;d send it back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The old design had an excellent file with deep serrations and sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> The blades do not come into contact with eachother through a nail, resulting in a very un clean cut, almost tearing the last bit of nail away.  </li>
            <li> This little tool has great leverage to cut nails with less effort than many others.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how solid and sturdy these are; these are probably the nicest nail clippers we own.</li>
            <li> These are apparently the new design with a chrome finish and a crosshatch design on the top surface of the lever.</li>
            <li> Beside being very cheap and flimsy and toy_like material, its design is very strange and not ergonomic.</li>
            <li> so they must be decent, right??</li>
            <li> This is certainly an example of \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a decent clipper to use, I like it!</li>
            <li> and it was too much for the clippers to handle.  </li>
            <li> It was cheap and actually cut the nail rather than mangling it.</li>
            <li> I expected better from a name like Revlon.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I can write all these reviews on Amazon at a speed much quicker than when I was trying to type with my feet.</li>
            <li> Everything seems much easier with this Revlon.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> think it would be mostly guys who would face this difficulty as our nails are generally tougher, so if you are a guy with strong toenails, I would advise against buying these and look for a larger/more heavy duty set.</li>
            <li> these are quality  nail clippers with sharp blades and a nice spring action.  </li>
            <li> it was super cheap and cuts your nails but isn&#x27;t very sharp.....</li>
            <li> But other than that its ok.</li>
            <li> Better than some other nail clippers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Apparently they were in her way whenever she wanted to hold my hand, and she was tired of being &amp;#34;punched in the face by a nightstick&amp;#34; whenever I moved around in my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it has been months since we split up, but now life has become incredibly convenient.</li>
            <li> For the reasonable price, these are decent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right out of the package its very noticeable that these are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> Its kind of small for me..</li>
            <li> A small nail clipper can always come in handy and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Is good for clipping nails but not good if you try to clip skin.</li>
            <li> They were kind enough to send me one of the old one&#x27;s mixed in with the 11 new ones.  </li>
            <li> These nail clippers are okay, and they&#x27;re less than two dollars</li>
            <li> particular listing is showing a photo for the reliable nail clipper design that Revlon marketed for decades.  </li>
            <li> (but, not all) of the listings, but someone keeps wanting to describe this product as &#x27;Classic.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> And unlike many on Amazon that are more expensive, it comes with a file.</li>
            <li> It gives a decent cut, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those looking to make nail care quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> Price too high for one.</li>
            <li> Makes a click sound when pressed hard and ensures a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I tried adding a shim (about 1/16\\&quot;) to get a little more leverage</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t the make one that is large enough to fit a big toe nail.</li>
            <li> gripes about Revlon&#x27;s new re-design on this classic product still stand.  </li>
            <li> There were older nail clippers by Revlon, and the new ones.  </li>
            <li> Stay away from this clipper, spend a few bucks more for quality</li>
            <li> I promise, I&#x27;m not Shrek and my nails are normal.</li>
            <li> Not just your normal mediocre-made-in-China-quality-product-not-sharp, but sore-palms-from-squeezing-these-damn-things-so-hard-not-sharp.</li>
            <li> They are not sharp enough to make a clean cut.</li>
            <li> A while ago it chipped on one side, so I figured I&#x27;d get a new nail clipper aka this one.</li>
            <li> Its not - its new junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> found that the deficiencies in this new design were widespread -</li>
            <li> For something as simple as this, I would have expected better.</li>
            <li> In the meantime stay FAR away from this junk!</li>
            <li> Amazon usually has better descriptions.  </li>
            <li> The Revlon part numbers on the packaging for the old design and the new were exactly the same part number</li>
            <li> Especially when compared to what others are charging for clippers that pretty much provide the same results.</li>
            <li> Finally, I ordered a few from an online shop outside of Amazon, just to make sure they truly were horrid - they consistently</li>
            <li> if you use and force it to cut the nail it will most likely split the nail like it did to me causing it to bleed and mess up your toe.</li>
            <li> These things are so poorly-designed and dull that you&#x27;d be better off chewing your nails off.</li>
            <li> the older ones were very, very good, the new ones are junk, worthless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The previous old design had a file that was very good for both flat surface and edge work; at least good enough for people who don&#x27;t care for a proper manicure (I&#x27;ll say it: that would probably mean men, mostly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t always clip skin near the nail very well.  </li>
            <li> This redesign turned them into complete garbage.  </li>
            <li> only consolation is they don&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li> I would consider there professional grade.</li>
            <li> &quot;, these are not.&lt;br /&gt;I notice on Amazon&#x27;s web site search the old style is</li>
            <li> I guess this will have to be used by my 3 young children.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be the only kind that Target carries lately.  </li>
            <li> Spend a few extra dollars and buy something with better build quality.</li>
            <li> At least, it was only $1.49, and not your nice ones.</li>
            <li> These are not as good as the ones I left behind, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon clippers for decades but am now shopping for expensive trendy clippers just to find something decent.</li>
            <li> For the price compared to other nail clippers, this definitely is worth it.</li>
            <li> Due to the curved top lever, I could not push any harder as the back end of the lever was completely in contact with the bottom part of the clipper!</li>
            <li> This clipper is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> During the first use, my nail was nearly torn off and the produced a very rough, jagged cut.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used a very rough circular saw blade to try to make a fine cut, you know what I&#x27;m talking about when it leaves the last bit of wood un-cut on the bottom, and these nail clippers do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nail clipper that is actually shipping is a new Revlon redesign.  </li>
            <li> new inferior design can be avoided if you are shown a proper photo of it.  </li>
            <li> The new design has a diagonal cross-hatch pattern formed into the outer surface of the upper lever handle.  </li>
            <li> in hand, the new design can be further identified.  </li>
            <li> I just bought these in April 2014 from another store and have only been able to use them a second time before replacing them with another brand (not sure which yet).  </li>
            <li> clippers are not sharp.</li>
            <li> Not sharp at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> These are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> The center of the jaws close first and even with extra pressure applied to the levers, the jaws cannot close down enough on the outer edges to make a fully clean cut.  </li>
            <li> As someone who loses clippers every couple of months, I need cheap ones and that&#x27;s what these are.  </li>
            <li> It is clearly visible in product photos (when the proper photo is shown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secondly, it is made in China, while &#x27;old reliable&#x27; was made in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will only softly bend the nail and will not cut through it,</li>
            <li> Although, they aren&#x27;t even worth the few dollars I paid for them.</li>
            <li> They only lasted 2 months before they were too dull to easily cut.  </li>
            <li> The pin that holds the two pieces together also comes out pretty frequently, so it&#x27;s a good thing I have a degree from MIT to put this stupid thing back together</li>
            <li> This product is ok with fingernails, for toe nails get the bigger and tough</li>
            <li> The metal has not broken or fallen apart, but the blade is slightly duller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I have super thick nails</li>
            <li> Might be OK for cutting a baby&#x27;s fingernails just after a bath, but does not have the leverge to cut adult fingernails well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve waited a few months for a break in my schedule to find the time to write this properly, and to cool my venom a little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten at least 5 of these and the have all been pretty</li>
            <li> Lining it up with about 1/3rd of my toenail, I pressed down completely on the clippers and they would not cut through.</li>
            <li> even then they barely cut and they also leave very rough edges on my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fancy, but it has what matters--a nice aligned sharp cutting edge.</li>
            <li> , I only hope that people will stop buying this miserable product, and that Amazon will further work to clean up the photos to only show the true product being sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I like this brand although it is smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> And when I pushed it harder and harder it clipped two nails and left vety rough edges and BROKE in the middle of clipping my third nail.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, it barely even made a mark in my fingernail.</li>
            <li> This one was dull and quickly found it&#x27;s way to the waste basket.</li>
            <li> I was using other clippers that would chip and peel my nails because they did not cut cleanly or sharply enough.</li>
            <li> I will spend the extra few bucks in the future.</li>
            <li> so I bought several to keep a few extra around.</li>
            <li> I will spend the extra few bucks in the future.</li>
            <li> Then I ordered a single unit.  </li>
            <li> I hope Revlon loses money on this new design and is forced to reintroduce their proven, classic design.  </li>
            <li> I can also walk down the street without being issued citations for wearing Halloween props and scaring families in the middle of March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Its tiny, and the file is too small obviously, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> Revlon redesigned this (you can tell the new, inferior design by the cross hatching on the top) and it is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Several, but not all, of them have also gotten really loose to the point where they are unusable within just a few months.</li>
            <li> Buy a couple extra of these little wonders and they will put your mind at ease.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off there are multiple listings for the same product (at least 4 for this product).  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected from a Revlon product.</li>
            <li> They often leave a rough jagged cut.</li>
            <li> They leave nails with rough, jagged edges.</li>
            <li> for me, these clippers do the job - plain and simple.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, BE WARNED: If you have thick/tough toenails, these clippers are not strong enough to cut through!</li>
            <li> The clipper blades are obviously not sharp enough for the job and also seem somewhat misaligned which make them cut even worse.  </li>
            <li> Below is my review of this product before Amazon got the photo correct on this listing (it is still incorrect on some of the other listings - so be careful of those others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clippers are not that sharp, they always leave my nails rough on the edges.</li>
            <li> When cutting finger nails, it does not make clean cuts; just sort of breaks the nail away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The new design removes the ability of the cutting surfaces to cut completely through at the outboard sides of the jaws.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but I want other people to avoid my mistake.</li>
            <li> Sharp and well built.</li>
            <li> foreign made junk, shame on you Revlon</li>
            <li> It does leave cut nails sharper than other models I&#x27;ve had before, but not to the point that it&#x27;s a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> Terrible clipper which does not work most of the time, it is not firm and hard enough to cut through the nail.</li>
            <li> The clipping edges are so dull that instead of clipping my nails, they dent or rip them (depending on whether they are aligned with the edge or middle of my nail).</li>
            <li> Having seen numerous reviews claiming that the clippers were dull, I was rather worried, but I ordered them anyways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not cut, larger and hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> They cut much worse than the old ones they replaced.  </li>
            <li> DOn;t you hate not being able to find your nail clipper?</li>
            <li> Works well on nails - just need to file them down.  </li>
            <li> See review by Hrrrmph for all the other things that are bad about this design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop buying these and let&#x27;s tell Revlon to bring back the old design!</li>
            <li> I have never owned an expensive pair of clippers before, So I do not know how long those should last, but a pair of these is equivalent to the checkout</li>
            <li> Not a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Has that little cuticle poker thingy.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not very precise and it has to be pressed down very firmly sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I may have tough nails, but mine stopping working only after a few days</li>
            <li> The last 2-3 times have just been such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 of these, because my nail clippers kept going missing...</li>
            <li> Its ok,i received it a few days after i purchased..</li>
            <li> Get some and clip your own nasty toenails.</li>
            <li> One order was for a 12 pack (something I do once every few years or so).  </li>
            <li> This is the worse nail clipper I have ever bought in my entire life.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap at all, and cuts my nail without hassle.</li>
            <li> Even, if it was sharp and sturdy, it is still hard to hold in hand.</li>
            <li> How hard is it to make a sharp and aligned nail clipper?</li>
            <li> , they cut cleanly and evenly without any annoying blunt spots that leave hanging or \\&quot;frayed\\&quot; nails.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s less leverage and the blade gets dull</li>
            <li> Dull, you have to press down hard and</li>
            <li> This one is small</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure).</li>
            <li> Still too small.  </li>
            <li> Big FAIL, Revlon.</li>
            <li> but it was one of those small ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> They should list that they are compact or small.</li>
            <li> bad could these possibly be??&amp;#34; They are from Revlon, not an unknown brand</li>
            <li> The nail file is even worse: use it slightly and it gets the nail a rougher edge...</li>
            <li> They bend before clipping nails, and our nails aren&#x27;t particularly hard or anything.</li>
            <li> always start out dull.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a couple of pairs of these from this seller and they were both fairly dull.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully not that hard,</li>
            <li> but if you have really hard nails then this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you.  </li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find a nail clippers that works well.</li>
            <li> But these came out of the package dull.</li>
            <li> Will be filing a complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d given it a negative star if I could.</li>
            <li> but this Revlon nail clipper I received was not properly aligned (the two cutting edges are off by a fraction of a millimeter) and don&#x27;t cut as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews, so i reviewed to give it justice.</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews</li>
            <li> (I guess I thick nails?)</li>
            <li> Poor quality and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The weird thing is, when I buy them from a retail store they are sharp.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re a little difficult to hold because the clippers are so small.</li>
            <li> They are very small.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was inspired to go hunt down another Revlon one</li>
            <li> This nail clip is probably the worse one I&#x27;ve used.. Stiff in cutting and gives a very rough edge on the nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had nail cutters that were this bad my entire life.</li>
            <li> It works for nails, but sometimes I use it to clip skin or hang nails, and that&#x27;s where it just plain fails.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I am definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I am definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This Revlon clipper style is a poor quality for</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s piss poor in its performance.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s sloppy housekeeping on the duplicate postings.  </li>
            <li> These newly redesigned clippers are awful.  </li>
            <li> I had to squeeze real hard to cut the nail.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!!!!</li>
            <li> nail clippers are quite possibly the worst I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately none of them cut nails well..</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with them,</li>
            <li> (unfortunately, I tossed the packaging and have forgotten the number).  </li>
            <li> It is also difficult to clip your toenails with these because of their size.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the seller, the service was very poor</li>
            <li> This is a very poorly manufactured nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Its a miserable excuse for a nail</li>
            <li> The cutting edges could be a lot sharper.  </li>
            <li> As crazy as it sounds, I had a Revlon brand nail clip for about 10yrs</li>
            <li> It was broken after 1 month!!</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t a bad buy</li>
            <li> You may wonder, how bad a nailclipper can be.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to contact Amazon, but so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Instead of receiving a nail clipper, I received a very bad, useless epilator (hair plucker!)</li>
            <li> look on wards some where else this products is crap and broke my nail instead of snipping it it literally cracked it.</li>
            <li> So awful!!!</li>
            <li> Trust me, they are terrible.</li>
            <li> Awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> No surprises here.  They are clippers.  They clip.  No defects of quality noted.  I am using them for a fishing tool and I think they will work fine.</li>
            <li> these are good clippers, cuts nice and so far has not dulled fast I&#x27;m pretty happy, i would buy again</li>
            <li> caution, this is a tiny pocket clipper.</li>
            <li> Purchased one order that was supposed to be three pieces and only received one. When I contacted the seller, the service was very poor and I was essentially told it was a listing error and was supposed to only be one piece. The clipping edges are so dull that instead of clipping my nails, they dent or rip them (depending on whether they are aligned with the edge or middle of my nail). So awful!!!</li>
            <li> Photo is misleading, you receive one nail clipper, not two. Will be filing a complaint. It&#x27;s a quality item, but the picture is deceptive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, but I want other people to avoid my mistake. I&#x27;m an avid Amazonian, and like reviewing things I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These nail clippers are quite possibly the worst I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;m demoting them to my vape kit but I have my doubts they&#x27;ll even be useful there.  The old Revlon nail clips were the best.  This redesign turned them into complete garbage.  The blades do not come into contact with eachother through a nail, resulting in a very un clean cut, almost tearing the last bit of nail away.  If you&#x27;ve ever used a very rough circular saw blade to try to make a fine cut, you know what I&#x27;m talking about when it leaves the last bit of wood un-cut on the bottom, and these nail clippers do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, don&#x27;t buy these ones.</li>
            <li> We are always losing nail clippers. I think my son runs off with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these clippers to anyone! They bend before clipping nails, and our nails aren&#x27;t particularly hard or anything. Save your money and head to the store.</li>
            <li> I may have tough nails, but mine stopping working only after a few days and I had to throw it away.  Stay away from this clipper, spend a few bucks more for quality</li>
            <li> I ordered fingernail clippers and got toenail clippers...</li>
            <li> I have never owned an expensive pair of clippers before, So I do not know how long those should last, but a pair of these is equivalent to the checkout stand clippers you see at the grocery store.  They only lasted 2 months before they were too dull to easily cut.  I tried adding a shim (about 1/16\\&quot;) to get a little more leverage and it was too much for the clippers to handle.  The lever broke into a couple pieces. They are cheap, so that is what gets them 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper does its job. Looks like it&#x27;s a quality item. Picture is deceiving; you get one clipper not two.</li>
            <li> what can you say about a nail clip? the don&#x27;t break your nails,i got another one pay around $ 10.00 and they do one thing they break all my nails,toe nail any kind of nail... and this not even $2.00 and they do the job how it suppose to...great buy..I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li> Its tiny, and the file is too small obviously, but it is what it is. it cuts nails and is as described lol</li>
            <li> Clips my nails and hangnails super easily.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and nailclippers are always a necessity.  Reasonable price and quick delivery!  It was an item purchased to use up my rewards money. . .nevertheless, Revlon makes quality products.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry, and great for any situation</li>
            <li> FYI, despite the picture of two (and the fact they do not state the quantity in the description) you only get one for the listed price of $1.80. A bit misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, they look sturdy - better quality than what I had before.</li>
            <li> look on wards some where else this products is crap and broke my nail instead of snipping it it literally cracked it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Solidly built.  Big enough for man hands to manipulate.  Has that little cuticle poker thingy.  And cheap.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Good buy for a bachelor.  Works and even has a mini nail file.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only kind that Target carries lately.  I&#x27;ve gotten at least 5 of these and the have all been pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They always start out dull.  Several, but not all, of them have also gotten really loose to the point where they are unusable within just a few months.</li>
            <li> Not a clean cut. It takes multiple passes to trim your cuticles.  Misaligned blades.  I didn&#x27;t give it only one star simply because it included a nail file.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 of these, because my nail clippers kept going missing... Unfortunately none of them cut nails well.. they seem like rather blunt instruments -- it takes so much pressure to cut the nails that they aren&#x27;t really worth using.  I&#x27;ve never had nail cutters that were this bad my entire life.</li>
            <li> Its ok,i received it a few days after i purchased..Its kind of small for me..But other than that its ok.</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple of pairs of these from this seller and they were both fairly dull.  I thought it must be an isolated incident, so I just threw them in with my fishing tackle, they work well enough to cut fishing line.  So this is my second order and they arrived in the same condition!  Dull, you have to press down hard and even then they barely cut and they also leave very rough edges on my fingernails.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying these.  The weird thing is, when I buy them from a retail store they are sharp.</li>
            <li> The cutting edges could be a lot sharper.  When cutting finger nails, it does not make clean cuts; just sort of breaks the nail away.  Not what I expected from a Revlon product.</li>
            <li> These are good clippers, I really have nothing more to say except that they fulfill their purpose. Nothing wrong with them,</li>
            <li> I just bought these in April 2014 from another store and have only been able to use them a second time before replacing them with another brand (not sure which yet).  They cut much worse than the old ones they replaced.  The clipper blades are obviously not sharp enough for the job and also seem somewhat misaligned which make them cut even worse.  They often leave a rough jagged cut.</li>
            <li> This was shipped to me as an eyeliner pencil sharpener.  The tag that was scanned on the package said that it was a nail clipper.  This was mislabeled.  Thankfully, my mother needed one, so i sent it to her.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Revlon nail clippers for as long as I can remember and always got a good product. I can&#x27;t say that any longer. The last 2-3 times have just been such a disappointment. I had read on one of these reviews that the best clipper another customer found was a cheap generic from a drug store. . So last night I went out and bought one of those. It was cheap and actually cut the nail rather than mangling it. No longer buying Revlon.</li>
            <li> As someone who loses clippers every couple of months, I need cheap ones and that&#x27;s what these are.  They work well enough but if you want sharp and good feeling clippers, look elsewhere.  If you want disposables that work and don&#x27;t break or tear your nails, these are for you.</li>
            <li> This is certainly an example of \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot;. We kept misplacing nail clippers so I finally had to stop by a local drug store to pick up a pair of these Revlon nail clippers (one regular and a toe nail clipper). These are apparently the new design with a chrome finish and a crosshatch design on the top surface of the lever. These things are so poorly-designed and dull that you&#x27;d be better off chewing your nails off. I am glad that they were really inexpensive. Although, they aren&#x27;t even worth the few dollars I paid for them. I expected better from a name like Revlon.</li>
            <li> A small nail clipper can always come in handy and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Works really well. Awesome price.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are eh. For under $2 though, they work fine. I ordered two sets simply because of the low price. They don&#x27;t cut as well as slightly more expensive nail clippers for me, they work.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t complain but I realized that I should&#x27;ve bought a bigger nail clipper. This one is small so there&#x27;s less leverage and the blade gets dull so I have to exert a lot of force to cut my nails (I guess I thick nails?) It does that job though and it&#x27;s cheap so it isn&#x27;t a bad buy</li>
            <li> It was broken after 1 month!! I recently purchased this product and I am definitely disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t work the way it should. I will spend the extra few bucks in the future.</li>
            <li> good for the price.  Get some and clip your own nasty toenails. Obama sure is a liar but these clippers are true to their form.</li>
            <li> Instead of receiving a nail clipper, I received a very bad, useless epilator (hair plucker!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nail clip. Don&#x27;t over think it.</li>
            <li> To all the people who are complaining about this nail-clipper:&lt;br /&gt;SPEND A COUPLE MORE DOLLARS AND GET A BETTER ONE...&lt;br /&gt;as for me, these clippers do the job - plain and simple. What more could you expect for the price?</li>
            <li> Clippers disappear from our house...it happens.  I inadvertently left a pair at my parents house during my last visit.  And they were a good pair...so I ordered 5 pairs of these.  These are not as good as the ones I left behind, but they get the job done. 1 of the five pair worked great and I put that in place where we access our clippers the most, the master bath.  5 pairs of clippers for under 10 dollars delivered in two days...a pretty good deal.  Especially when compared to what others are charging for clippers that pretty much provide the same results. Not one of the five pair tested left a jagged cut.  So, I am 100% satisfied with my purchase.  And ordering on a Saturday, they arrived on a Monday, basically one day shipping.  Gotta love Amazon.</li>
            <li> These newly redesigned clippers are awful.  I&#x27;ve been using Revlon clippers for decades but am now shopping for expensive trendy clippers just to find something decent. I hope Revlon loses money on this new design and is forced to reintroduce their proven, classic design.  In the meantime stay FAR away from this junk!</li>
            <li> You may wonder, how bad a nailclipper can be. You can buy one and experience yourself. I bought it, because, I thought Revlon is a known brand and can&#x27;t make cheap products. What a mistake. It could not clip my nails. And when I pushed it harder and harder it clipped two nails and left vety rough edges and BROKE in the middle of clipping my third nail. I promise, I&#x27;m not Shrek and my nails are normal. I used my last clipped for 8 years without any issue till I lost it. I&#x27;d given it a negative star if I could. Beside being very cheap and flimsy and toy_like material, its design is very strange and not ergonomic. Even, if it was sharp and sturdy, it is still hard to hold in hand. I didn&#x27;t bother to contact Amazon, but so disappointed.</li>
            <li> They work great at all angles at all times.came on time.easy to care for.they are the right color.it was just the right price.</li>
            <li> Should you buy it: Nah. Get something with better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It cuts nails...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: ... poorly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are not sharp. Not just your normal mediocre-made-in-China-quality-product-not-sharp, but sore-palms-from-squeezing-these-damn-things-so-hard-not-sharp. It&#x27;s not like I have super thick nails (I&#x27;m a computer programmer with a vitamin D deficiency). These things just do not work well. The pin that holds the two pieces together also comes out pretty frequently, so it&#x27;s a good thing I have a degree from MIT to put this stupid thing back together again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just find something higher quality. These aren&#x27;t worth the frustration.</li>
            <li> We keep losing all the nail clippers and couldn&#x27;t find any when needed so I bought several to keep a few extra around. Right out of the package its very noticeable that these are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> great clippers at a great price, they are sturdy and just the same as you would find in stores, but these seem a lot better than the cheap ones that you usually get at walmart ect, and this was great deal, the same price for cheap ones and you get great ones!!!</li>
            <li> Having seen numerous reviews claiming that the clippers were dull, I was rather worried, but I ordered them anyways. It turns out they they weren&#x27;t. At this point they&#x27;re just ordinary nail clippers, which is exactly what I saw and paid for. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more! Definitely satisfied thus far.  Edit: Still works fine until today, after about 2 years. The metal has not broken or fallen apart, but the blade is slightly duller. I use it to clip my finger and toenails about every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a cheap nailclipper which probably came from the dollar store (though I got it from family so I&#x27;m not sure). It&#x27;s not fancy, but it has what matters--a nice aligned sharp cutting edge. A while ago it chipped on one side, so I figured I&#x27;d get a new nail clipper aka this one. How hard is it to make a sharp and aligned nail clipper? Hopefully not that hard, but this Revlon nail clipper I received was not properly aligned (the two cutting edges are off by a fraction of a millimeter) and don&#x27;t cut as well. It works for nails, but sometimes I use it to clip skin or hang nails, and that&#x27;s where it just plain fails. For something as simple as this, I would have expected better.</li>
            <li> Below is my review of this product before Amazon got the photo correct on this listing (it is still incorrect on some of the other listings - so be careful of those others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gripes about Revlon&#x27;s new re-design on this classic product still stand.  Its a miserable excuse for a nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of Amazon and 99.9% of the time have nothing except good to say about how they sell product.  If you haven&#x27;t guessed it already, this isn&#x27;t one of those times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off there are multiple listings for the same product (at least 4 for this product).  One listing would be plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular listing is showing a photo for the reliable nail clipper design that Revlon marketed for decades.  But, that isn&#x27;t what is actually shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail clipper that is actually shipping is a new Revlon redesign.  The redesign is for the worse, and it does a fairly thorough job of messing up most of what was good about the decades old design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new inferior design can be avoided if you are shown a proper photo of it.  The new design has a diagonal cross-hatch pattern formed into the outer surface of the upper lever handle.  It is clearly visible in product photos (when the proper photo is shown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve waited a few months for a break in my schedule to find the time to write this properly, and to cool my venom a little.  I see that Amazon is now showing the proper photo in some (but, not all) of the listings, but someone keeps wanting to describe this product as &#x27;Classic.&#x27;  Its not - its new junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design removes the ability of the cutting surfaces to cut completely through at the outboard sides of the jaws.  The center of the jaws close first and even with extra pressure applied to the levers, the jaws cannot close down enough on the outer edges to make a fully clean cut.  Forget about doing edge nips with it - it won&#x27;t bite, it just tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old design had an excellent file with deep serrations and sharp edges.  The new file is so smooth that it might be better suited for polishing the lacquer paint job on the hood of a fine automobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the roughness and sloppiness in the manufacturing of the jaws, you would think that they would carry that through to the edges of the file (where it might do some good).  Nope.  The file has smoothly beveled side edges, without a hint of serration near the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous old design had a file that was very good for both flat surface and edge work; at least good enough for people who don&#x27;t care for a proper manicure (I&#x27;ll say it: that would probably mean men, mostly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in hand, the new design can be further identified.  Firstly, it is bulkier in an unwelcome way.  Secondly, it is made in China, while &#x27;old reliable&#x27; was made in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the deficiencies in this new design were widespread - I ordered them three times.  Yes, I&#x27;m stubborn.  Twice I ordered through Amazon.  One order was for a 12 pack (something I do once every few years or so).  Then I ordered a single unit.  I ordered from different Amazon sellers each of these two times.  Finally, I ordered a few from an online shop outside of Amazon, just to make sure they truly were horrid - they consistently are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two Amazon vendors were &#x27;dream store inc&#x27; and &#x27;Bethany&#x27;s Necessities.&#x27;  I have no quarrel with the sellers, as I believe they were victims of Revlon&#x27;s ill-advised design and marketing decisions and Amazon&#x27;s sloppy housekeeping on the duplicate postings.  But, that remains a guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bethany&#x27;s was where I bought the 12 pack.  They were kind enough to send me one of the old one&#x27;s mixed in with the 11 new ones.  The Revlon part numbers on the packaging for the old design and the new were exactly the same part number (unfortunately, I tossed the packaging and have forgotten the number).  So all paths on this fiasco lead to backto Revlon as the root cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only consolation is they don&#x27;t cost much.  I gave them one star for their scrap metal content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I forgave Amazon and vendors for their one or two &#x27;aw-shucks.&#x27; I figure that the thousand &#x27;atta-boys&#x27; they deserve should be enough to cancel out the occasional flub.  Taking that into consideration, I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to file for refunds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I only hope that people will stop buying this miserable product, and that Amazon will further work to clean up the photos to only show the true product being sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Knowing that Revlon is a respected brand name, I thought that I was getting a bargain and I bought two of them. So I&#x27;m going to keep it simple. These nail clippers don&#x27;t cut. I had to squeeze real hard to cut the nail. I didn&#x27;t pay a lot so it wasn&#x27;t worth my time to return them.</li>
            <li> As crazy as it sounds, I had a Revlon brand nail clip for about 10yrs and it always worked great.  It finally broke, so I grabbed a generic one at the store... but it didn&#x27;t work well.  Needless to say, I was inspired to go hunt down another Revlon one and this works great!</li>
            <li> This nail clipper does the job but feels cheap. I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there, but I&#x27;m not sure which to recommend. I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars because it does do the job. You won&#x27;t really &amp;#34;go wrong&amp;#34; buying it, but it does feel cheap.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for and it&#x27;s well worth whatever 2 bucks you dish out. Don&#x27;t expect all that and a bag of chips.</li>
            <li> Sharp and well built. Makes a click sound when pressed hard and ensures a clean cut. worth buying over than that of the store.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect example of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.  it was super cheap and cuts your nails but isn&#x27;t very sharp.....it works for me bc i don&#x27;t have coarse nails but if you have really hard nails then this probably isn&#x27;t the one for you.  if you need something to do the job, then this is fine.  If you want a quality nail clip then don&#x27;t buy this cuz you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Is good for clipping nails but not good if you try to clip skin. (Think hang nails).  I could not believe that it would not cut my skin.  It is a cheap device and I think I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers are great! I was using other clippers that would chip and peel my nails because they did not cut cleanly or sharply enough. I would consider there professional grade. Great product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a very poorly manufactured nail clipper. The design is the same one that has been used for years. A good nail clipper should produce a clean, even cut with a satisfying sharp click. Nothing of that sort with this clipper. During the first use, my nail was nearly torn off and the produced a very rough, jagged cut. Spend a few extra dollars and buy something with better build quality.</li>
            <li> clippers are not that sharp, they always leave my nails rough on the edges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nail clipper.  Still too small.  Why don&#x27;t the make one that is large enough to fit a big toe nail.</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to find a nail clippers that works well. This one was dull and quickly found it&#x27;s way to the waste basket.</li>
            <li> Been using Revlon compact nail clippers for years. They worked great.  Revlon redesigned this (you can tell the new, inferior design by the cross hatching on the top) and it is terrible.  Might be OK for cutting a baby&#x27;s fingernails just after a bath, but does not have the leverge to cut adult fingernails well.  See review by Hrrrmph for all the other things that are bad about this design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop buying these and let&#x27;s tell Revlon to bring back the old design!</li>
            <li> Revlon Nail Clipper / B004NZDY42&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, shucks, I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything fancy for the price, but I needed some more nail clippers and these were cheap, so I bought them. I was pleasantly surprised at how solid and sturdy these are; these are probably the nicest nail clippers we own. These will definitely handle my finger and toenails and will handle my husband&#x27;s fingernails without difficulty. They&#x27;re not the right size for heavy-duty large toenails like my husband&#x27;s, but they&#x27;re strong and good quality and great for hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
            <li> Revlon clippers are usually good.  It seems like we can never have enough in the house....kind of like socks in the lauhdry...they disappear.</li>
            <li> This Revlon clipper style is a poor quality for Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;It does not cut, larger and hard to handle.  Revlon&lt;br /&gt;needs to go back to the compact style as they have&lt;br /&gt;always have been \\&quot;top quality\\&quot;, these are not.&lt;br /&gt;I notice on Amazon&#x27;s web site search the old style is&lt;br /&gt;pictured but what you receive is the newer inferior,&lt;br /&gt;poor quality clippers.</li>
            <li> At first glance, it looks like a well built quality product.  But it&#x27;s piss poor in its performance.  The clipper has a gap in it so it&#x27;s not very precise and it has to be pressed down very firmly sometimes.  Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for clipping nails.</li>
            <li> This is the worse nail clipper I have ever bought in my entire life. I read many reviews that it wasn&#x27;t the best, but some people said that it worked fine. Since it was so cheap, I decided to give it a try... NEVER AGAIN! It didn&#x27;t even cut through my nail. It just made a pressure mark. I tried it on one nail and threw it away... What a waste of my money. Big FAIL, Revlon.</li>
            <li> Pro:  $1.49&lt;br /&gt;Con:  Not sharp at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for traveling only.  Just in case the TSA takes it away.  At least, it was only $1.49, and not your nice ones.</li>
            <li> I like it. It is good. Revlon is a good name brand a little pricey but good................. I not longer have it</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when my three feet of nails irritated my girlfriend. Apparently they were in her way whenever she wanted to hold my hand, and she was tired of being &amp;#34;punched in the face by a nightstick&amp;#34; whenever I moved around in my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it has been months since we split up, but now life has become incredibly convenient. I can write all these reviews on Amazon at a speed much quicker than when I was trying to type with my feet. (My toenails don&#x27;t grow quickly, so I&#x27;m guessing my fingernails are experiencing an overcompensation issue.) I can also do things like cook, hold a baby like a football, and throw a baby like a football with the spiral grip and everything! I can also walk down the street without being issued citations for wearing Halloween props and scaring families in the middle of March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a life changing product.</li>
            <li> They clip my nails and keep them looking nifty. What else can I say about nail clippers that can be more informative?</li>
            <li> works fine. I&#x27;m a doc, so trimmed and filed nails are a must. This works fine and hasn&#x27;t given me any problems to speak of.</li>
            <li> This nail clip is probably the worse one I&#x27;ve used.. Stiff in cutting and gives a very rough edge on the nail. So hart to control for getting a smooth edge. The nail file is even worse: use it slightly and it gets the nail a rougher edge...</li>
            <li> These are the type of nail clippers that will last in the bathroom cabinet for 20 years. I bought two, so maybe I have a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> It works, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I was expecting it to be of &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size but it was one of those small ones. It seems like it&#x27;s built well and will last for many years though.</li>
            <li> What is there to say? It&#x27;s a great nail clipper. And unlike many on Amazon that are more expensive, it comes with a file. It&#x27;s small so I tend to leave a couple of them all over the apartment.</li>
            <li> This clipper is exactly what I expected. It is functional and very easy to use. It is a better made clipper than some of the others I have tried</li>
            <li> could be better if it got a hole on the tail that I can somehow attach it to my key rings or something</li>
            <li> Better than some other nail clippers I&#x27;ve used. Nothing too fancy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons that I can think of. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Revlon could possibly put their name on such a piece of junk.  It absolutely would not cut a finger nail!!!  I ended up buying one for 75 cents at the liquor store which worked perfectly.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!!!!</li>
            <li> es un producto exclente me gusto mucho es un producto de la calidad lo recomiendo a todo el que pueda comprarlo fine</li>
            <li> There were older nail clippers by Revlon, and the new ones.  the older ones were very, very good, the new ones are junk, worthless.</li>
            <li> It clips cleanly, designed ergonomically (comfy to hold), and very affordable. What more can you ask for? I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews, so i reviewed to give it justice.</li>
            <li> I bought these yesterday and just cut my nails - they worked fine one my fingernails , they cut cleanly and evenly without any annoying blunt spots that leave hanging or \\&quot;frayed\\&quot; nails. For the reasonable price, these are decent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, BE WARNED: If you have thick/tough toenails, these clippers are not strong enough to cut through! Lining it up with about 1/3rd of my toenail, I pressed down completely on the clippers and they would not cut through. Due to the curved top lever, I could not push any harder as the back end of the lever was completely in contact with the bottom part of the clipper! It was especially challenging dealing with my big toe, where the nails are maybe a tenth of an inch (2mm) thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would be mostly guys who would face this difficulty as our nails are generally tougher, so if you are a guy with strong toenails, I would advise against buying these and look for a larger/more heavy duty set.</li>
            <li> I like this brand although it is smaller than I expected.  I guess this will have to be used by my 3 young children.  This product is ok with fingernails, for toe nails get the bigger and tough ones.&lt;br /&gt;Order came quick .. that I am happy about.</li>
            <li> It gives a decent cut, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all. For the price compared to other nail clippers, this definitely is worth it.</li>
            <li> It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews but I still purchased these thinking &amp;#34;how bad could these possibly be??&amp;#34; They are from Revlon, not an unknown brand so they must be decent, right?? Trust me, they are terrible. They are not sharp enough to make a clean cut.</li>
            <li> These are not sharp at all. It does not give a nice, clean cut. They leave nails with rough, jagged edges.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, it barely even made a mark in my fingernail. foreign made junk, shame on you Revlon</li>
            <li> DOn;t you hate not being able to find your nail clipper? Buy a couple extra of these little wonders and they will put your mind at ease.</li>
            <li> Some reviews mentioned this falling apart on them.  Mine seems well made and works well for my purposes.  It does leave cut nails sharper than other models I&#x27;ve had before, but not to the point that it&#x27;s a problem for me.  I would guess that those who have had issues have thicker nails, and I can envision this model being problematic in that instance, but for &amp;#34;normal&#x27; nails I feel this is fine.... a $15 model might be better, but for the price difference it had better be.  This is not a luxury product for me, but rather a utilitarian tool that gets the job done, and in that regard, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for product. Could have bought in store I thought it was the big ones</li>
            <li> Keep those nails cut and clean.  This little tool has great leverage to cut nails with less effort than many others.  The blade is nice and sharp and takes care of things cleanly.  It seems all of these would be the same but this clipper is much better than many I&#x27;ve had previously.  Everything seems much easier with this Revlon.  Highly recommended for those looking to make nail care quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> Great nail clipper but listing had me thinking there were 6 in the packet.  I only received one.  Price too high for one.</li>
            <li> Terrible clipper which does not work most of the time, it is not firm and hard enough to cut through the nail. It will only softly bend the nail and will not cut through it, if you use and force it to cut the nail it will most likely split the nail like it did to me causing it to bleed and mess up your toe. STAY AWAY from this nail clipper it will not work and hurts to use. I used another I found in a plastic jar at a liquor store which was 50 cents and it works far better than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Awful.  They are very small.  The ones I got don&#x27;t line up so they won&#x27;t cut.  Amazon usually has better descriptions.  They should list that they are compact or small.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I am definitely disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t work the way it should. I will spend the extra few bucks in the future. 1 Star.</li>
            <li> No this isn&#x27;t your fancy nail clipper, but it gets the job done and was relatively inexpensive. If you&#x27;re looking for budget, then this is it.</li>
            <li> Works well on nails - just need to file them down.  Works well with the cheap Revlon emery boards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t always clip skin near the nail very well.  Sometimes it&#x27;ll pinch and tear as oppose to actually cut.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are okay, and they&#x27;re less than two dollars so I can&#x27;t really complain. But they&#x27;re a little difficult to hold because the clippers are so small. It is also difficult to clip your toenails with these because of their size. They work fine for fingernails though. I don&#x27;t love them but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a decent clipper to use, I like it! It&#x27;s not cheap at all, and cuts my nail without hassle.</li>
            <li> This did not cut, they just ripped the nail. Poor quality and a waste of money. if I paid more I&#x27;d send it back. But these came out of the package dull.</li>
            <li> these are quality  nail clippers with sharp blades and a nice spring action.  Far better than those for $0.99 in a plastic bin a the check out stand.</li>
