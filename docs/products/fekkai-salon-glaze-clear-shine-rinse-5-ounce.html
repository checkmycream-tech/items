            <li>it makes my hair soft + shiny, and it smells nice too!  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fine.</li>
            <li>Wish I could afford to use large amounts with every hair wash, because my hair truly does look amazing when I do.</li>
            <li>This worked fantastic for me.  </li>
            <li>Bizarre, as I like Fekkai products.</li>
            <li>Like it very much...does a nice job.....</li>
            <li>Low and behold, the shine result was superior.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it to anyone who wants some glow.</li>
            <li>my hair is looking so smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...makes my normally coarse and frizzy hair look amazing, even when it&#x27;s raining or humid outside.  </li>
            <li>I have first purchased Fekkai Salon Glaze at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Left my hair looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>IS MORE OF A CONDITIONER AND NOT A CLEAR HAIR COLOR RINSE !&lt;</li>
            <li>Not bad for a home glaze, creamy texture, goes on smoothly, leaves a slight shine</li>
            <li>I have brittle, fine, dry hair and after using this religiously along with my regular shampoo and conditioner my hair stopped breaking and the shine is amazing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I very like .Fekkai - Salon Glaze Clear Shine Rinse</li>
            <li>I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE , A CLEAR SHINNING SHIMMERING TYPE OF RINSE,&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything it promised to do for my naturally curly 3A hair.</li>
            <li>This all surprised the -- out of me.</li>
            <li>I grabbed an old bottle to use up when I was pressed for time.</li>
            <li>Nothing wrong with the experience, which is why I put 4 stars -  the price was good and the delivery prompt, it is</li>
            <li>My hair is really thin and most of the the products i&#x27;ve used to make my hair shine really weighed it down and made it look \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; looking.</li>

            <li> However, you must use a large quantity to get the desired results and it is EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A THICK WHITE CREAM , WHICH</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff...makes my normally coarse and frizzy hair look amazing, even when it&#x27;s raining or humid outside.  I&#x27;ve had people ask if I&#x27;ve gotten a Brazilian blowout b/c my hair is looking so smooth and straight.  I used it every other day when I wash my hair and it works wonderfully...high recommend!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and bought it based on that alone. My hair was spectacular! However, you must use a large quantity to get the desired results and it is EXPENSIVE. I have decided to reserve my use for &amp;#34;special occasions&amp;#34;. Wish I could afford to use large amounts with every hair wash, because my hair truly does look amazing when I do.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED !  IT WAS A THICK WHITE CREAM , WHICH I WAS NOT EXPECTING !,&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE , A CLEAR SHINNING SHIMMERING TYPE OF RINSE,&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS MORE OF A CONDITIONER AND NOT A CLEAR HAIR COLOR RINSE !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M GOING TO RETURN THIS ONE .</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have always had trouble finding the correct item and this is it.  Strongly recommend it to anyone who wants some glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used only once, but noticed absolutely no difference at all.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft + shiny, and it smells nice too!  I&#x27;ve used this  product many times, + this is my  second  bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the shine, but the price!  So expensive so I use it sparingly and not daily as I would like. Loves the way my hair feels after.</li>
            <li> I have first purchased Fekkai Salon Glaze at Macy&#x27;s. It&#x27;s worth the money. Left my hair looking shiny and healthy. It even made my hair color look a shade lighter. My hair is really thin and most of the the products i&#x27;ve used to make my hair shine really weighed it down and made it look \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; looking. But This product is does not weigh the hair down and works wonderfully with my hair type LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It was pretty good. I have very hard water, and it doesn&#x27;t matter what I use, my hair is never happy. I will continue to use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, unruly color treated hair.  This worked fantastic for me.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the experience, which is why I put 4 stars -  the price was good and the delivery prompt, it is just the glaze was - meh - not as good as I had hoped. I will try another brand.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fine. However, the product was not good! Bizarre, as I like Fekkai products. Maybe just not a good match. Made my long, straight fine hair feel coated, dirty and sticky.</li>
            <li> Made no difference to my hair. In fact I needed to supplement the product with drugstore conditioner in order to get any use out of it. Save your money don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> It works great for my hair which is hi-lighted.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything it promised to do for my naturally curly 3A hair. returned it after three uses. easy return process.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a home glaze, creamy texture, goes on smoothly, leaves a slight shine but I have extra thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years and while I find that it also conditions, the shine slowly builds over the weeks.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t rave enough about this glaze. it has made such a difference in my hair. i have shine and terrific texture. amazing product. i use it every other day when i shampoo. have been looking for just such a hair product for years. so glad i found this. hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> Went back to it after a 3 year hiatus. Gives me a better shine result than Redken&#x27;s EQ a and easier to apply. This all surprised the -- out of me. I grabbed an old bottle to use up when I was pressed for time. Low and behold, the shine result was superior. I&#x27;m back. Just bought it again. Have two half bottles of the other if anyone wants.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.I very like .Fekkai - Salon Glaze Clear Shine Rinse&lt;br /&gt;by Frederic Fekkai. Size: 5.0 fl. oz.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference with this product after using it for a week.  Considering the price, I probably will not repeat the purchase.</li>
            <li> Like it very much...does a nice job.....</li>
            <li> I have brittle, fine, dry hair and after using this religiously along with my regular shampoo and conditioner my hair stopped breaking and the shine is amazing. It takes a few weeks to &amp;#34;get up to speed&amp;#34; but don&#x27;t give up or slack off! My advice is to use it every time you wash your hair if you have hair like mine and care about the way it looks.</li>
            <li> I use it every now and then, but then I remember that it makes my hair kind of...coated feeling? Not in a good way. I shampoo again after use and it helps with that feeling and it does seem to help my hair a little bit but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
