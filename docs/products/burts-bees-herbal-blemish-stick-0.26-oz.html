    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are awesome.  </li>
            <li>It is awesome!</li>
            <li>it wonderful.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s perfect for applying before bed.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s hands-down the best blemish remover we have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works best when out of the shower or when a blemish is open/near the surface of your skin.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Burt Bees for making this incredible, yet inexpensive product.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended it and it smells lovely and it works !!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Most acne products irritate my skin, but this blemish stick is wonderful.</li>
            <li>the upside the company I purchased this from had a good price and great shipping I would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li>The liquid inside has a pleasant smell of mint, licorice, outdoors, and any number of adjectives that are in that herbal genre.</li>
            <li>After doing some research, I purchased this product after reading the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed by how quickly the stick reduced the redness of blemishes from my face.</li>
            <li>I love this blemish stick and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I was very on top of applying this on my pimples as well (morning and night after cleansing and before putting on moisturizer)</li>
            <li>MAGIC!</li>
            <li>This product is like magic!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Always have one handy.</li>
            <li>(I honestly apply it all over my face.)</li>
            <li>It smells nice, too.</li>
            <li>After reading so many good reviews, I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus it smells pleasant and the application is easy with the roll on tube.</li>
            <li>It is easy and efficient to apply and smells good.</li>
            <li>Best natural blemish control out there!</li>
            <li>I am on my way to a clear face, also use the acne solutions lotion it awesome!</li>
            <li>It was so strong and licorice-ish smell wasn&#x27;t very appealing either.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, and while the tea tree has a strong presence as always, there is a pleasant lemon background that I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I use this blemish stick when I have a major breakout, and it works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many different kind of products targeted towards acne, but this is probably the best thing, AND one of the cheapest.</li>
            <li>For those like myself who are worried about the roller ball bringing more bacteria into the product, it can be easily removed!</li>
            <li>The glass tube makes this portable, tidy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This product also contains tea tree oil, along with willowbark (\\&quot;natural\\&quot; salicylic acid), calendula, parsley, eucalyptus, juniper, yarrow oil, and many more.</li>
            <li>It dries acne very quickly as do most tea tree oil products.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap, and effortless to apply and yet it is so effective.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the blemish stick, it works without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t (like getting one more blackhead) or after shaving to reduce redness and inflammation.</li>
            <li>So hey, this stuff isn&#x27;t just for pimples! :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>By morning, my acne spots are better and the smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Love the medicinal smell, the way it feels when it hits my skin.</li>
            <li>this stuff is my favorite blemish treatment.</li>
            <li>And it works much, much better, than the tea tree oil alone</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand because everyone in these reviews says it is great.</li>
            <li>(in most cases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more details</li>
            <li>What I can tell you is that for me, and the many friends I&#x27;ve recommended it to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unscrew the top, turn it over, and start rolling it across your face where the blemishes are.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;ve tried many of the Oxy-style pads)</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>do think adding more of the product 2-3 times a day</li>
            <li>produces better results than one application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dries up whiteheads and does not cause more of a problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Excellent for smaller blemishes.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite go to.</li>
            <li>You get more bang for your buck</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll feel better about skipping out on a list of ingredients that you have to research and verify.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited when it came.</li>
            <li>It comes in about an inch long glass container with a roller application perfect purse size.</li>
            <li>best part about tea tree oil is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin all peely and dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong—smells strong and is potent in ingredients, but I feel like the application method isn&#x27;t that sanitary.</li>
            <li>The Burt’s Bees Herbal Blemish Stick is much more effective than any pure tea tree oil I&#x27;ve used, not to mention many better brand spot treatments.</li>
            <li>Great for my oily sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>is uncommon though, so if your skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive like mine is, I&#x27;d say give this a shot.</li>
            <li>Great natural ingredients, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and you need very good light to see if it actually applied to your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Another downside is that the product is used up very quickly, so you may need to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li>* Easy to apply&lt;br</li>
            <li>On some the silicon ball tends to slide easily and on others it needs to be primed in order to roll and bring the liquid out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really strong.</li>
            <li>Also has a strong medicinal smell that some may not like, but I got used to it after a while.</li>
            <li>When I first got this product I liked it.</li>
            <li>It helps my skin, but not as quickly and drastically as my benzoyl peroxide cream (partly because its more sanitary).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that I use this one up quickly, so it must be doing something!</li>
            <li>Something that literally takes seconds to do it astonishes me that it is the answer to my huge acne problem all these years.</li>
            <li>It made my pores huge wherever I put it, and it gave me blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>Dries well, just don&#x27;t use too much because the stuff kind of stings, as</li>
            <li>It is great for blemishes on your back, shoulders and chest too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the stick to be most useful when treating a pimple in its earliest stages.  </li>
            <li>This blemish stick is working good so far.</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell: woody and naturally clean and not at chemical-y, but it doesn&#x27;t matter since it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t find it as wildly effective as Kiehl&#x27;s Blue Herbal Spot Treatment, but it gets its job done, is relatively cheap, and is 100% natural, so I&#x27;m still a happy gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for minor acne and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I just dab a bit on my pimples after I wash my face at night and by morning they are significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I promise it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the willow bark, which is where salicylic acid is derived.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous acne products throughout the years and this is, by far, the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to get rid of stubborn acne.</li>
            <li>After I roll the product on, my skin feels refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product, it&#x27;s not going to hurt to try it out, especially if you&#x27;ve had problematic skin for a while.  </li>
            <li>About 2-3 weeks after purchase it broke out my skin (not a reaction a full breakout) where I had applied</li>
            <li>has come close to the herbal power of Burt&#x27;s Bees, and it&#x27;s nice knowing that I&#x27;m using completely natural and organic stuff on my face vs. a lot of chemicals that don&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li>Has a strong herbal/medicinal scent, which fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>* Quickly reduces redness/soreness&lt;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself having mild acne either.</li>
            <li>and it quickly gets rid of pimples and has been helping scars to fade.</li>
            <li>It HAS cleared my blemishes but just not as quickly as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared tremendously with another system I have been using.</li>
            <li>No scarring, quick healing</li>
            <li>Helps it to heal quickly.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using it, but i&#x27;m starting to not like the idea of how the roller ball is in contact with so many pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent natural alternative to conventional acne care products.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most of acne products out in the market</li>
            <li>its kind of a gross design to be honest, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t share with anyone else</li>
            <li>Love the fact that Burts Bees are natural.</li>
            <li>so I love the fact that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Kind of gross</li>
            <li>I happened to have no prepared remedy at the time, and in rummaging through a drawer to find something I came across the Burt&#x27;s Bees Blemish Stick which I had gotten but rarely used.  </li>
            <li>I decided to switch over to natural remedies and this was a natural spot treatment that seemed to get pretty good reviews</li>
            <li>I give Burts Bees props for a step in the right direction but this product did not work for me.uld</li>
            <li>I have been trying to use more natural products which is why I chose this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>It works great, is not harsh and clears up minor pimples in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong, licorice and fennel, but not a big deal for me.  </li>
            <li>I think that in combination with other treatments (an effective cleanser for instance), this product is helpful in reducing the number of full blown pimples.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, but oily skin, and sometimes the patches of skin where I use this turn bright red.</li>
            <li>It was nice that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but I used it twice a day for two weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any effect.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty natural and strong, but I got used to it after awhile.</li>
            <li>* Dries very fast</li>
            <li>It does have a tingly refreshing sensation on the skin, but it stings of is an open cut.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty killer.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>first discovered it years ago at an apothecary and have been hooked ever since (a tube can lasts me years).</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s the only thing I use now for blemishes, and I&#x27;ve converted many friends over to it as well.</li>
            <li>I decided to try oil cleansing and this was my first purchase.</li>
            <li>I first put it on, everywhere it touched felt like it was on fire.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reserving a 5 star rating for the ever elusive magic acne fighter that can take down a pimple over night, so a 4 star rating is absolutely fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>When you feel the volcano forming (that is a zit before it has come to a head) rub some of this on and it will pretty much disappear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this stuff works pretty much in the course of a day on a blemish if I put it on periodically throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Usually Burt&#x27;s Bees is good to me, so I think this one is just a fluke because of the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product because my persistent acne was becoming very stressful to deal with.</li>
            <li>I roll this on after a good facial cleanser, let it air dry, then add some moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In 20 minutes the swelling had decreased greatly and the itching had largely subsided.  </li>
            <li>I tried clean and clear acne moisturizing lotion, every peroxide based spot treatment, all the masks you could think of and even slept on a new pillowcase every night-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a huge Burt&#x27;s Bees fan but this specific product</li>
            <li>The scent is unusual but you will get used to it with time.</li>
            <li>really helps reduce the pain.</li>
            <li>Really like this herbal stick for blemishes, it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>Salicylic acid, I don&#x27;t have much problem.</li>
            <li>And works really well,</li>
            <li>really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They go away so fast and do not spread.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so it is very un-hygienic.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle product, but it does just what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, I didn&#x27;t assume it would make them all vanish in a day, but geesh, after two weeks I was hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel.</li>
            <li>if you really think about it.</li>
            <li>The rolling ball at the top  that you use to apply it with does allow for it to drip so be careful around eyes.</li>
            <li>but if you really want to try it, give it a shot, you never know until you try it.</li>
            <li>This blemish stick does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product, I&#x27;m 60 years old and still get pimples from time to time, this is the only product that dries them up within 3 days</li>
            <li>Although they work fairly well, they have never been able to get rid of my acne completely and often dry out my skin so much that it becomes excessively oily; a real pain when putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot better than any other products that I have tried to combat acne.</li>
            <li>And I use this all the time, and they&#x27;re pretty natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>It works better than any other product for breakouts I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes at first and it burned my sensitive skin, so instead of using it once every day, I used it once every three days.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, WOW it stung like you know what.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this, I thought it would do wonders since this is supposed to be a natural acne treatment</li>
            <li>While not always 100% effective, this blemish stick seems to help diminish my acne and scars from past breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The irritation does not last too long, but my skin&#x27;s reaction to it is proof that it is very strong and may irritate some skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent alternative.</li>
            <li>My acne is mainly hormonal and sometimes depending on what I eat, I&#x27;ll get a pimple or two, so I thought if I applied this when I felt a pimple coming, it could help.</li>
            <li>Although I think it was strange that it didn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s original packaging</li>
            <li>and when they do, they disappear much faster, there is far less redness, they aren&#x27;t as big, and the best part - less scarring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne since I was a sophomore in HIGH SCHOOL</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Burts Bees skin line compared to any other line offered in drug stores (natural or not).</li>
            <li>I love this little blemish stick.</li>
            <li>really suggest looking them up online and seeing if there is a store near you.</li>
            <li>I remembered an old favorite from back in the day and went searching at my local Target for this blemish stick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin, but since I got pregnant I have been getting bigger breakouts around my chin, and my old product was no longer working.  </li>
            <li>Not sure about the price at Amazon being so great, I&#x27;ve seen it cheaper at some other stores.</li>
            <li>The next day, the path I had rolled with it was bright red and slightly raised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this a try for longer just to try and stay natural, but its not a miracle product just a decent alternative.</li>
            <li>Better than the really expensive department store acne treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Not too drying, but I do use a light moisturizer a fee minutes after this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not do much for deep or very inflamed blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I have been suffering from adult acne ever since I graduated from high school</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and it should last for a while.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use it myself when I feel a blemish start to form (when you first start feeling pain before anything pops up), and this treatment keeps the spot from getting bigger and inflamed.</li>
            <li>I always have had a significant amount of red acne on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>The thing is they only work for a certain period of time because your skin builds tolerance.</li>
            <li>I put this on once in the morning and once before bed and wake up to a clear face.</li>
            <li>I think it works really well on the occasional adult acne spot.  </li>
            <li>Warning: stings immensely for a few seconds when applied to an open blemish, but it will likely be greatly reduced by the next day.  </li>
            <li>I use it directly on problem areas when i have blemishes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and takes care of blemishes in days.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The ingredients contain willow bark, the extract of which is a natural form of salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a natural alternative to the seeming barrage of chemicals that we ingest and put on our skin daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are highly sensitive to scents, however, locate a store that sells this product and try a display sample.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>That being said, my experience with natural products has been that you have to be patient and give it some time to work.</li>
            <li>I can apply it to a pimple, wether it has surfaced or not, and by the time I wake up, the redness is gone, and the zit is almost complete disappeared.</li>
            <li>like that the product is 100% natural, and it smell like it.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin then this is the zit care for you.  </li>
            <li>If I had to pick a gender, it&#x27;s a masculine scent and</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, and these products work well without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li>and then suddenly my face wants to break out over winter break.</li>
            <li>I work for a Derm Doctor and have used all kinds of RX&#x27;s and still had adult blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>but, so far, nothing.</li>
            <li>All natural acne solution.</li>
            <li>Initial use of it cleared up the acne very well.</li>
            <li>well but for my sensitive skin, it did not work well at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has saved me many embarrassing moments in public when I catch something the night before and give it a few swipes of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a bit strong at first but after a few uses you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;It does sting a bit when you apply it so be careful not to apply it anywhere near the eyes</li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t believe in all this treatment, as most of skin problems come from the inside (because of some hormone or any other health issue) and usually can&#x27;t be that easily treated from the outside.</li>
            <li>I pretty much had given up hope and said what do I have to lose except the few bucks.</li>
            <li>You will notice that on normal skin there is some visible drying that can occur after several days of use - watch for that if you have sensitive</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong though, but not enough to deter me from using this.</li>
            <li>by the time it arrived the bottle was pretty much empty</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or aggravated after applying, though it can burn a tiny bit if you put it on right after a shower.</li>
            <li>I was really optimistic about this product, but it did not do much for my occasional cystic pimples (which was what I got it for) nor any the other bumps and blemishes.</li>
            <li>It really diminishes the problem, as long as you apply it twice a day!</li>
            <li>It really helps and doesn&#x27;t leave your sink dry.</li>
            <li>They give free samples as well if you want to try a few different things out!</li>
            <li>There is very little that I have found that effectively treats acne without harsh burning or peeling.  </li>
            <li>It also dries quickly, not leaving a sticky residue or tight feeling like many drugstore products out there, even without a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m concerned because acne thrive on bacteria and while yes there is alcohol in the product, its definitely spreading old grimy cells and hairs over and over again on your infected skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>Obviously the direct contact with your face will result in bacteria buildup on the rollerball, but I don&#x27;t know how else they could make the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son uses this on his sensitive teenage skin without complaining that it burns.</li>
            <li>Wanted to go natural and saw this on Amazon (now how come I can&#x27;t find this in my local Target?)</li>
            <li>I would like to keep this my secret weapon, but I will share :)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and adult acne, so I was hoping this product would do the trick since tea tree oil has always soothed my skin when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>Pimples that I could not get rid of for the life of me have dried up and the dark spots from old healed ones is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from someone with SUPER sensitive skin, this is like a miracle.</li>
            <li>It smells a little strong, because duh it&#x27;s tea tree oil, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>, so I definitely recommend it if you want all-natural skin care products at a reasonable price and wide availability.</li>
            <li>Now, several decades later, I still get adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product 2 stars because I like that Burt&#x27;s Bees is putting our natural products (although it does have alcohol in it which can actually irritate your skin) but overall, this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference within the first few days.</li>
            <li>other times it came out so quickly it would start running down my face.</li>
            <li>If I catch the problem early, it never gets worse and heals quickly.</li>
            <li>I have really never found a product that truly helps clear my face until now.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Most acne products irritate my skin, but this blemish stick is wonderful.</li>
            <li> the upside the company I purchased this from had a good price and great shipping I would purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> The liquid inside has a pleasant smell of mint, licorice, outdoors, and any number of adjectives that are in that herbal genre.</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I purchased this product after reading the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed by how quickly the stick reduced the redness of blemishes from my face.</li>
            <li> I love this blemish stick and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I was very on top of applying this on my pimples as well (morning and night after cleansing and before putting on moisturizer)</li>
            <li> MAGIC!</li>
            <li> This product is like magic!</li>

            <li> (I honestly apply it all over my face.)</li>
            <li> It smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> After reading so many good reviews, I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus it smells pleasant and the application is easy with the roll on tube.</li>
            <li> It is easy and efficient to apply and smells good.</li>
            <li> Best natural blemish control out there!</li>
            <li> I am on my way to a clear face, also use the acne solutions lotion it awesome!</li>
            <li> It was so strong and licorice-ish smell wasn&#x27;t very appealing either.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, and while the tea tree has a strong presence as always, there is a pleasant lemon background that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I use this blemish stick when I have a major breakout, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many different kind of products targeted towards acne, but this is probably the best thing, AND one of the cheapest.</li>
            <li> For those like myself who are worried about the roller ball bringing more bacteria into the product, it can be easily removed!</li>
            <li> The glass tube makes this portable, tidy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This product also contains tea tree oil, along with willowbark (\\&quot;natural\\&quot; salicylic acid), calendula, parsley, eucalyptus, juniper, yarrow oil, and many more.</li>
            <li> It dries acne very quickly as do most tea tree oil products.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap, and effortless to apply and yet it is so effective.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the blemish stick, it works without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t (like getting one more blackhead) or after shaving to reduce redness and inflammation.</li>
            <li> So hey, this stuff isn&#x27;t just for pimples! :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> By morning, my acne spots are better and the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> Love the medicinal smell, the way it feels when it hits my skin.</li>
            <li> this stuff is my favorite blemish treatment.</li>
            <li> And it works much, much better, than the tea tree oil alone</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand because everyone in these reviews says it is great.</li>
            <li> (in most cases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more details</li>
            <li> What I can tell you is that for me, and the many friends I&#x27;ve recommended it to</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unscrew the top, turn it over, and start rolling it across your face where the blemishes are.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve tried many of the Oxy-style pads)</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do think adding more of the product 2-3 times a day</li>
            <li> produces better results than one application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dries up whiteheads and does not cause more of a problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent for smaller blemishes.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite go to.</li>
            <li> You get more bang for your buck</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll feel better about skipping out on a list of ingredients that you have to research and verify.</li>
            <li> so I was very excited when it came.</li>
            <li> It comes in about an inch long glass container with a roller application perfect purse size.</li>
            <li> best part about tea tree oil is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin all peely and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong—smells strong and is potent in ingredients, but I feel like the application method isn&#x27;t that sanitary.</li>
            <li> The Burt’s Bees Herbal Blemish Stick is much more effective than any pure tea tree oil I&#x27;ve used, not to mention many better brand spot treatments.</li>
            <li> Great for my oily sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> is uncommon though, so if your skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive like mine is, I&#x27;d say give this a shot.</li>
            <li> Great natural ingredients, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and you need very good light to see if it actually applied to your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Another downside is that the product is used up very quickly, so you may need to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> * Easy to apply&lt;br</li>
            <li> On some the silicon ball tends to slide easily and on others it needs to be primed in order to roll and bring the liquid out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really strong.</li>
            <li> Also has a strong medicinal smell that some may not like, but I got used to it after a while.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I liked it.</li>
            <li> It helps my skin, but not as quickly and drastically as my benzoyl peroxide cream (partly because its more sanitary).  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that I use this one up quickly, so it must be doing something!</li>
            <li> Something that literally takes seconds to do it astonishes me that it is the answer to my huge acne problem all these years.</li>
            <li> It made my pores huge wherever I put it, and it gave me blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> Dries well, just don&#x27;t use too much because the stuff kind of stings, as</li>
            <li> It is great for blemishes on your back, shoulders and chest too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the stick to be most useful when treating a pimple in its earliest stages.  </li>
            <li> This blemish stick is working good so far.</li>
            <li> I personally love the smell: woody and naturally clean and not at chemical-y, but it doesn&#x27;t matter since it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t find it as wildly effective as Kiehl&#x27;s Blue Herbal Spot Treatment, but it gets its job done, is relatively cheap, and is 100% natural, so I&#x27;m still a happy gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for minor acne and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I just dab a bit on my pimples after I wash my face at night and by morning they are significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I promise it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the willow bark, which is where salicylic acid is derived.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous acne products throughout the years and this is, by far, the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to get rid of stubborn acne.</li>
            <li> After I roll the product on, my skin feels refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product, it&#x27;s not going to hurt to try it out, especially if you&#x27;ve had problematic skin for a while.  </li>
            <li> About 2-3 weeks after purchase it broke out my skin (not a reaction a full breakout) where I had applied</li>
            <li> has come close to the herbal power of Burt&#x27;s Bees, and it&#x27;s nice knowing that I&#x27;m using completely natural and organic stuff on my face vs. a lot of chemicals that don&#x27;t do the job</li>
            <li> Has a strong herbal/medicinal scent, which fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> * Quickly reduces redness/soreness&lt;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself having mild acne either.</li>
            <li> and it quickly gets rid of pimples and has been helping scars to fade.</li>
            <li> It HAS cleared my blemishes but just not as quickly as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared tremendously with another system I have been using.</li>
            <li> No scarring, quick healing</li>
            <li> Helps it to heal quickly.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using it, but i&#x27;m starting to not like the idea of how the roller ball is in contact with so many pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent natural alternative to conventional acne care products.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most of acne products out in the market</li>
            <li> its kind of a gross design to be honest, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t share with anyone else</li>
            <li> Love the fact that Burts Bees are natural.</li>
            <li> so I love the fact that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Kind of gross</li>
            <li> I happened to have no prepared remedy at the time, and in rummaging through a drawer to find something I came across the Burt&#x27;s Bees Blemish Stick which I had gotten but rarely used.  </li>
            <li> I decided to switch over to natural remedies and this was a natural spot treatment that seemed to get pretty good reviews</li>
            <li> I give Burts Bees props for a step in the right direction but this product did not work for me.uld</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use more natural products which is why I chose this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> It works great, is not harsh and clears up minor pimples in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong, licorice and fennel, but not a big deal for me.  </li>
            <li> I think that in combination with other treatments (an effective cleanser for instance), this product is helpful in reducing the number of full blown pimples.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, but oily skin, and sometimes the patches of skin where I use this turn bright red.</li>
            <li> It was nice that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but I used it twice a day for two weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any effect.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty natural and strong, but I got used to it after awhile.</li>
            <li> * Dries very fast</li>
            <li> It does have a tingly refreshing sensation on the skin, but it stings of is an open cut.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty killer.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> first discovered it years ago at an apothecary and have been hooked ever since (a tube can lasts me years).</li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s the only thing I use now for blemishes, and I&#x27;ve converted many friends over to it as well.</li>
            <li> I decided to try oil cleansing and this was my first purchase.</li>
            <li> I first put it on, everywhere it touched felt like it was on fire.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reserving a 5 star rating for the ever elusive magic acne fighter that can take down a pimple over night, so a 4 star rating is absolutely fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> When you feel the volcano forming (that is a zit before it has come to a head) rub some of this on and it will pretty much disappear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stuff works pretty much in the course of a day on a blemish if I put it on periodically throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Usually Burt&#x27;s Bees is good to me, so I think this one is just a fluke because of the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product because my persistent acne was becoming very stressful to deal with.</li>
            <li> I roll this on after a good facial cleanser, let it air dry, then add some moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In 20 minutes the swelling had decreased greatly and the itching had largely subsided.  </li>
            <li> I tried clean and clear acne moisturizing lotion, every peroxide based spot treatment, all the masks you could think of and even slept on a new pillowcase every night-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge Burt&#x27;s Bees fan but this specific product</li>
            <li> The scent is unusual but you will get used to it with time.</li>
            <li> really helps reduce the pain.</li>
            <li> Really like this herbal stick for blemishes, it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Salicylic acid, I don&#x27;t have much problem.</li>
            <li> And works really well,</li>
            <li> really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They go away so fast and do not spread.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so it is very un-hygienic.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle product, but it does just what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, I didn&#x27;t assume it would make them all vanish in a day, but geesh, after two weeks I was hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel.</li>
            <li> if you really think about it.</li>
            <li> The rolling ball at the top  that you use to apply it with does allow for it to drip so be careful around eyes.</li>
            <li> but if you really want to try it, give it a shot, you never know until you try it.</li>
            <li> This blemish stick does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m 60 years old and still get pimples from time to time, this is the only product that dries them up within 3 days</li>
            <li> Although they work fairly well, they have never been able to get rid of my acne completely and often dry out my skin so much that it becomes excessively oily; a real pain when putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot better than any other products that I have tried to combat acne.</li>
            <li> And I use this all the time, and they&#x27;re pretty natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> It works better than any other product for breakouts I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes at first and it burned my sensitive skin, so instead of using it once every day, I used it once every three days.</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, WOW it stung like you know what.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this, I thought it would do wonders since this is supposed to be a natural acne treatment</li>
            <li> While not always 100% effective, this blemish stick seems to help diminish my acne and scars from past breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The irritation does not last too long, but my skin&#x27;s reaction to it is proof that it is very strong and may irritate some skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent alternative.</li>
            <li> My acne is mainly hormonal and sometimes depending on what I eat, I&#x27;ll get a pimple or two, so I thought if I applied this when I felt a pimple coming, it could help.</li>
            <li> Although I think it was strange that it didn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s original packaging</li>
            <li> and when they do, they disappear much faster, there is far less redness, they aren&#x27;t as big, and the best part - less scarring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne since I was a sophomore in HIGH SCHOOL</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Burts Bees skin line compared to any other line offered in drug stores (natural or not).</li>
            <li> I love this little blemish stick.</li>
            <li> really suggest looking them up online and seeing if there is a store near you.</li>
            <li> I remembered an old favorite from back in the day and went searching at my local Target for this blemish stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin, but since I got pregnant I have been getting bigger breakouts around my chin, and my old product was no longer working.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the price at Amazon being so great, I&#x27;ve seen it cheaper at some other stores.</li>
            <li> The next day, the path I had rolled with it was bright red and slightly raised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this a try for longer just to try and stay natural, but its not a miracle product just a decent alternative.</li>
            <li> Better than the really expensive department store acne treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Not too drying, but I do use a light moisturizer a fee minutes after this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not do much for deep or very inflamed blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering from adult acne ever since I graduated from high school</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and it should last for a while.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use it myself when I feel a blemish start to form (when you first start feeling pain before anything pops up), and this treatment keeps the spot from getting bigger and inflamed.</li>
            <li> I always have had a significant amount of red acne on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> The thing is they only work for a certain period of time because your skin builds tolerance.</li>
            <li> I put this on once in the morning and once before bed and wake up to a clear face.</li>
            <li> I think it works really well on the occasional adult acne spot.  </li>
            <li> Warning: stings immensely for a few seconds when applied to an open blemish, but it will likely be greatly reduced by the next day.  </li>
            <li> I use it directly on problem areas when i have blemishes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and takes care of blemishes in days.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The ingredients contain willow bark, the extract of which is a natural form of salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a natural alternative to the seeming barrage of chemicals that we ingest and put on our skin daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are highly sensitive to scents, however, locate a store that sells this product and try a display sample.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> That being said, my experience with natural products has been that you have to be patient and give it some time to work.</li>
            <li> I can apply it to a pimple, wether it has surfaced or not, and by the time I wake up, the redness is gone, and the zit is almost complete disappeared.</li>
            <li> like that the product is 100% natural, and it smell like it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then this is the zit care for you.  </li>
            <li> If I had to pick a gender, it&#x27;s a masculine scent and</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, and these products work well without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li> and then suddenly my face wants to break out over winter break.</li>
            <li> I work for a Derm Doctor and have used all kinds of RX&#x27;s and still had adult blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> but, so far, nothing.</li>
            <li> All natural acne solution.</li>
            <li> Initial use of it cleared up the acne very well.</li>
            <li> well but for my sensitive skin, it did not work well at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has saved me many embarrassing moments in public when I catch something the night before and give it a few swipes of Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a bit strong at first but after a few uses you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;It does sting a bit when you apply it so be careful not to apply it anywhere near the eyes</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t believe in all this treatment, as most of skin problems come from the inside (because of some hormone or any other health issue) and usually can&#x27;t be that easily treated from the outside.</li>
            <li> I pretty much had given up hope and said what do I have to lose except the few bucks.</li>
            <li> You will notice that on normal skin there is some visible drying that can occur after several days of use - watch for that if you have sensitive</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong though, but not enough to deter me from using this.</li>
            <li> by the time it arrived the bottle was pretty much empty</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or aggravated after applying, though it can burn a tiny bit if you put it on right after a shower.</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic about this product, but it did not do much for my occasional cystic pimples (which was what I got it for) nor any the other bumps and blemishes.</li>
            <li> It really diminishes the problem, as long as you apply it twice a day!</li>
            <li> It really helps and doesn&#x27;t leave your sink dry.</li>
            <li> They give free samples as well if you want to try a few different things out!</li>
            <li> There is very little that I have found that effectively treats acne without harsh burning or peeling.  </li>
            <li> It also dries quickly, not leaving a sticky residue or tight feeling like many drugstore products out there, even without a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m concerned because acne thrive on bacteria and while yes there is alcohol in the product, its definitely spreading old grimy cells and hairs over and over again on your infected skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> Obviously the direct contact with your face will result in bacteria buildup on the rollerball, but I don&#x27;t know how else they could make the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son uses this on his sensitive teenage skin without complaining that it burns.</li>
            <li> Wanted to go natural and saw this on Amazon (now how come I can&#x27;t find this in my local Target?)</li>
            <li> I would like to keep this my secret weapon, but I will share :)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and adult acne, so I was hoping this product would do the trick since tea tree oil has always soothed my skin when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Pimples that I could not get rid of for the life of me have dried up and the dark spots from old healed ones is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from someone with SUPER sensitive skin, this is like a miracle.</li>
            <li> It smells a little strong, because duh it&#x27;s tea tree oil, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> , so I definitely recommend it if you want all-natural skin care products at a reasonable price and wide availability.</li>
            <li> Now, several decades later, I still get adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product 2 stars because I like that Burt&#x27;s Bees is putting our natural products (although it does have alcohol in it which can actually irritate your skin) but overall, this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within the first few days.</li>
            <li> other times it came out so quickly it would start running down my face.</li>
            <li> If I catch the problem early, it never gets worse and heals quickly.</li>
            <li> I have really never found a product that truly helps clear my face until now.</li>
            <li> I also heard that tea tree oil and some of the other ingredients in this list are supposed to be good for getting rid of cold sores, and I tried it on mine, and it worked SO well, especially in combination with Abreva!</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, be very careful with this and don&#x27;t use it so liberally, ONLY on big, noticeable blemishes.</li>
            <li> Other pimples take 2 days to be completely gone - you&#x27;ll just have to see what works with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used any other products but this and a neutrogena sensitive skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> use it at least two times a day when I feel a pimple coming on and usually have been able to stop a pimple in its tracks.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from mild to cystic acne for years now and the last three months, it has gone worse.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, small pimples throughout my face, and redness to my t-zone.</li>
            <li> but it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> It does its job well; zits appear far less often</li>
            <li> It does seem to clear and dry blemishes slightly faster than my old Desert Essence sticks, but it dries my skin less.</li>
            <li> the past, I&#x27;d always been incredibly sensitive to products containing the traditional acne fighters -- benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> It is a heavily fragrant alcohol-based acne spot treatment that you roll directly onto your blemishes.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to find locally where I live.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been on Accutane and countless other prescription and nonprescription products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> This will dry up any blemish that you may have within 2 days.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> it left a dark mark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS - If you do use it for cold sores, I mark my bottle with a permanent marker so as not to mistakenly use it for other applications, and to make sure my wife doesn&#x27;t try to use it for pimples.</li>
            <li> When I apply the stick to an already formed pimple, the next morning the pimple, while still present, is usually diminished in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They used to last about 14 days with about 7 days of that as a full blown swollen lip, oozing cold sore...</li>
            <li> It caused my skin to become very dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Make sure not to apply it too close to your eyes or broken skin because the alcohol can sting pretty badly.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other acne solutions.</li>
            <li> But still, the burning was persistent with each use and winded up causing my skin to become real dry and flaky and ugh</li>
            <li> I can hit a few red spots before bed and they are gone in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pimples tend to being shrinking within a few hours and in some cases on my face they have 90% vanished by the next morning.</li>
            <li> It rolls over your skin, picks up bacteria and dead skin cells and then puts them back into the container!</li>
            <li> Be careful to not use after blemish has started to heal...it will irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> The small bottle lasts a very long time even with regular use.</li>
            <li> I purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Blemish Stick after my usual stick - Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil - was no longer stocked at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> Enough wasted money on acne treatment systems that are multiple steps, time consuming, and not effective.</li>
            <li> It is making my upper lip and my T zone break out into small pimples.</li>
            <li> other product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply any other medication when using this product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite aspect is that it brings a painful pimple to a head within a few hours, giving me hope for deep cystic acne that usually just lurks under my skin for weeks.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of most Burt&#x27;s Bees products (as I&#x27;m allergic to beeswax) but this blemish stick isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Once this happened, my skin&#x27;s natural response was to produce more oil  Two weeks after using this product, my acne has gotten worst.  </li>
            <li> I have used every expensive brand under the sun to take care of an occasional blemish or pimple or any unexplained bump and this INSTANTLY dries out the area and heals it.</li>
            <li> I was fretful about potential peeling (you all probably know how hard it is to apply makeup to a peeling face)but</li>
            <li> When the dreaded breakout does occur, I can expect to have the pimple or pimple and subsequent blemish for at least three weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a product that helps to heal acne that is not irritating.  </li>
            <li> Every redness reducing product I&#x27;ve ever tried that contains salicylic acid just makes my face worse - red, burning, dry, and itchy.</li>
            <li> In a sentence: This product removes pimples and blemishes in less than 24-hours</li>
            <li> This product has even made my face less oily</li>
            <li> cow does it work!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned though that it burns and tingles like crazy for the first 30-45 seconds after I apply it.</li>
            <li> My pimples are shortened down to just a few days instead.</li>
            <li> It took a few days for the redness/swelling to go down.</li>
            <li> works a little bit</li>
            <li> One thing that creeps me out a little bit about this product is the application.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the applicator is a little tricky the liquid doesn&#x27;t always come out</li>
            <li> Yes it stings a little, yes it smells like licorice, and yes it clears up acne.</li>
            <li> a little pricey</li>
            <li> And you can always have this little bottle with you, just in case.</li>
            <li> And yes, it&#x27;s a little costly</li>
            <li> my face has these little bumps all over (like goosebumps)</li>
            <li> I rub this on the bite, and the swelling goes down and the pain disappears!</li>
            <li> I got this for roughly $8, Abreva is at least $20.</li>
            <li> It takes care of zits within just a few applications.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I do not recommend this product if you have truly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The others dried up.</li>
            <li> My lip swells up, it oozes puss, and is just a nightmare to deal with and look at.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Every once in awhile I get a few blemishes</li>
            <li> I use this religiously on trouble spots every day, morning and night.</li>
            <li> Her skin is the same as mine, which is combination-oily but she has it worse when it comes to pimples.</li>
            <li> If I forget to apply insect repellent before going to the garden, it is not uncommon for me to get a couple of dozen bites--for some reason mosquitos have always loved me.  </li>
            <li> I have never had horrible acne, usually the hormonal kind with one popping up here or there.</li>
            <li> After 3 uses, I held the product up and can see dried skin and small hairs floating in the solution, because the ball is rolling in and out with contact on your face and the medication...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s disappointing because when I finally found an amazing remedy against my acne, the allergic reaction I got from it as a side-effect is really devastating.</li>
            <li> I tried to work past the pain to see if it would improve my skin</li>
            <li> It usually begins drying out in about 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> I really was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 12 (now in my late 30&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> negative reactions I have had with synthetic counterparts to salicylic acid have been absent while using this stick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent the cold sore from appearing, but it definitely shortens the duration and intensity of them.  </li>
            <li> I discovered it quite by accident when one evening several years ago I had a mosquito bite that was itching like crazy and had swollen up.  </li>
            <li> I knew the herbs in it plus the alcohol would at least give some relief.  </li>
            <li> so I stopped using it for around 3 days and the bumps on my face slowly faded</li>
            <li> After trying on at least 3 different blemish creams, some very expensive, I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I bought this product earlier today, and used it only once, but it was horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the bodyshop&#x27;s teatree oil and proactiv&#x27;s spot treatments for a while for painful blemishes that I get occasionally.</li>
            <li> Yes it works for a bit, but in the end it was not good for me.  </li>
            <li> Now I look at the product and it is cloudy and &#x27;dusty&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I have some problem area behind my earlobes and an oily noise.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use this on my blemishes but it was way too irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> (sorry..</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the foot prints on my package.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after persistent use for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrifying experience with products (extreme redness and dryness) with benzol peroxide, so I tend to avoid them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 2 other tea tree oils and they both smelled horrible!</li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out, the rolling ball is a little disgusting as well.</li>
            <li> Worst case scenario you&#x27;re out a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I use this on cold sores.  </li>
            <li> If you deal with cold sores, you have to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I apply it about every 30min as soon as a cold sore appears and get no side effects.  </li>
            <li> The product smells bad (to me, anyway - like antiseptic licorice).</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t sting or smell bad either.</li>
            <li> The peeling and itchiness became painful.  </li>
            <li> I had 14 painful nodule pimples that had not surfaced, and in using this one night</li>
            <li> We are shocked.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t throw it away, but I&#x27;m still disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was going crazy!</li>
            <li> However, I get very bad cold sores about 1-2 times a year.  </li>
            <li> I know how terrible these types of cold sores can</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used organic tea tree oil which I hated because it smells so awful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible but it seemed to get rid of redness.</li>
            <li> Will pick at a pimple until there is a nasty scar &amp; it will linger for months from the picking.</li>
            <li> , it was just a terrible experience for me.</li>
            <li> A couple hours after I used it, I looked at my face and I was disgusted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> by the time it arrived the bottle was pretty much empty</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I recommend it to patients all of the time. I use it myself when I feel a blemish start to form (when you first start feeling pain before anything pops up), and this treatment keeps the spot from getting bigger and inflamed. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Blemish Stick after my usual stick - Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil - was no longer stocked at my local grocery store. This product also contains tea tree oil, along with willowbark (\\&quot;natural\\&quot; salicylic acid), calendula, parsley, eucalyptus, juniper, yarrow oil, and many more. I was impressed by how quickly the stick reduced the redness of blemishes from my face. It dries acne very quickly as do most tea tree oil products. It is easy to apply. It does seem to clear and dry blemishes slightly faster than my old Desert Essence sticks, but it dries my skin less. I use it several times a day on all areas of my face where zits have popped up before. It does its job well; zits appear far less often and when they do, they disappear much faster, there is far less redness, they aren&#x27;t as big, and the best part - less scarring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides? The product smells bad (to me, anyway - like antiseptic licorice). But once it dries on your skin, you will not smell it and neither should anyone else. The scent is unusual but you will get used to it with time. Another downside is that the product is used up very quickly, so you may need to buy in bulk. I wish they sold these sticks in 3-packs or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar product is the Burt&#x27;s Bees Targeted Spot Treatment. I have used both; the stick lasts longer and is easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> works a little bit but, no rapid results.  It does have a tingly refreshing sensation on the skin, but it stings of is an open cut.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m 60 years old and still get pimples from time to time, this is the only product that dries them up within 3 days</li>
            <li> Not only does this help get rid of the pimple but reduces the pain too! The willow bark (natures aspirin- that is what Salicylic acid is) really helps reduce the pain. I am also allergic to Mosquito bites, they swell to about the size of silver dollars or larger. I rub this on the bite, and the swelling goes down and the pain disappears!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are awesome.  I&#x27;ve always had issues with my skin, but since I got pregnant I have been getting bigger breakouts around my chin, and my old product was no longer working.  After doing some research, I purchased this product after reading the good reviews.  I apply it in the morning, and after I wash my face at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Quickly reduces redness/soreness&lt;br /&gt;* Dries acne out&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;* Dries very fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Smells like licorice&lt;br /&gt;* Does not produce overnight results (sorry..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good product, it&#x27;s not going to hurt to try it out, especially if you&#x27;ve had problematic skin for a while.  I would recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> One thing that creeps me out a little bit about this product is the application.  It&#x27;s a rolling silicone ball.  After 3 uses, I held the product up and can see dried skin and small hairs floating in the solution, because the ball is rolling in and out with contact on your face and the medication...its kind of a gross design to be honest, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t share with anyone else but I&#x27;m concerned because acne thrive on bacteria and while yes there is alcohol in the product, its definitely spreading old grimy cells and hairs over and over again on your infected skin.  Gross, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the applicator is a little tricky the liquid doesn&#x27;t always come out and you need very good light to see if it actually applied to your skin.  The smell is very strong, licorice and fennel, but not a big deal for me.  It helps my skin, but not as quickly and drastically as my benzoyl peroxide cream (partly because its more sanitary).  I&#x27;ll give this a try for longer just to try and stay natural, but its not a miracle product just a decent alternative.</li>
            <li> Really like this herbal stick for blemishes, it works. I use it directly on problem areas when i have blemishes. Not sure about the price at Amazon being so great, I&#x27;ve seen it cheaper at some other stores. Love the fact that Burts Bees are natural.</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic about this product, but it did not do much for my occasional cystic pimples (which was what I got it for) nor any the other bumps and blemishes. It did help soothe a bug bite though so I didn&#x27;t throw it away, but I&#x27;m still disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 12 (now in my late 30&#x27;s). I have really never found a product that truly helps clear my face until now. Thank you Burt Bees for making this incredible, yet inexpensive product. I didn&#x27;t think it would work since there are so many expensive treatment products that I have tried that didn&#x27;t help. I pretty much had given up hope and said what do I have to lose except the few bucks. Yes it stings a little, yes it smells like licorice, and yes it clears up acne. I don&#x27;t consider myself having mild acne either. I always have had a significant amount of red acne on a daily basis. It&#x27;s been very embarrassing. I put this on once in the morning and once before bed and wake up to a clear face. It is awesome! This product is cheap, and effortless to apply and yet it is so effective. Something that literally takes seconds to do it astonishes me that it is the answer to my huge acne problem all these years. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find it sooner. Enough wasted money on acne treatment systems that are multiple steps, time consuming, and not effective. Finally a simple solution that actually works. Give it a try, hopefully it will work for you as well as it does for me. Worst case scenario you&#x27;re out a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Wow!  A friend recommended it and it smells lovely and it works !!  After 2 applications (am and pm) a break out was gone.  I&#x27;ve never been a huge Burt&#x27;s Bees fan but this specific product it wonderful.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> We have found that this blemish stick works for bug bites. We were given a sample of it several years back &amp; happen to try it on a mosquito bite because it had tea tree oil in it &amp; we had found that tea tree oil calms the sting. We have used this since.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, and takes care of blemishes in days. I would like to keep this my secret weapon, but I will share :)&lt;br /&gt;Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty killer. I have acne-prone skin and it worked wonders. Dries well, just don&#x27;t use too much because the stuff kind of stings, as</li>
            <li> After trying on at least 3 different blemish creams, some very expensive, I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees. I am not kidding and this is not a placebo effect- I saw a reduction in my blemishes in 36 hours. I am so grateful because my acne marks were getting way too embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned though that it burns and tingles like crazy for the first 30-45 seconds after I apply it. But it goes away automatically and leaves a soothing herbal smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and occasional breakouts. Most acne products irritate my skin, but this blemish stick is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it quickly gets rid of pimples and has been helping scars to fade. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been on Accutane and countless other prescription and nonprescription products.  While the Accutane helped immensely in treating my skin issues, I still get breakouts on occasion.  When the dreaded breakout does occur, I can expect to have the pimple or pimple and subsequent blemish for at least three weeks.  So, I&#x27;d been searching for something that I could get without a prescription that would treat my acne and reduce the redness and blemishes left by my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;d always been incredibly sensitive to products containing the traditional acne fighters -- benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.  The peeling and itchiness became painful.  So I was leery of this stick. The ingredients contain willow bark, the extract of which is a natural form of salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative reactions I have had with synthetic counterparts to salicylic acid have been absent while using this stick. I have had no itching or redness.  I was fretful about potential peeling (you all probably know how hard it is to apply makeup to a peeling face)but have experienced no peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at least two times a day when I feel a pimple coming on and usually have been able to stop a pimple in its tracks.  When I apply the stick to an already formed pimple, the next morning the pimple, while still present, is usually diminished in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of this stick, I wholeheartedly urge you to try this product.  It is a natural alternative to the seeming barrage of chemicals that we ingest and put on our skin daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have a scent but it is not overpowering in my opinion.  If you are highly sensitive to scents, however, locate a store that sells this product and try a display sample.  Walk around the store with the scent on your hand or under your chin and see if you can tolerate the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the United States and not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I love the fact that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients. That being said, my experience with natural products has been that you have to be patient and give it some time to work. It HAS cleared my blemishes but just not as quickly as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> Best natural blemish control out there!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I use Burts Bees products, and this is a necessity! I don&#x27;t have to use it that often, but when I do it does the trick! I can apply it to a pimple, wether it has surfaced or not, and by the time I wake up, the redness is gone, and the zit is almost complete disappeared. It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other acne solutions. Plus it smells pleasant and the application is easy with the roll on tube. A must have to defeat blemishes!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for minor acne and blemishes.  I like it a lot better than any other products that I have tried to combat acne. The scent is a little strong though, but not enough to deter me from using this.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim searching through amazon to see what blemish products they got and it was a good purchase! I have been suffering from adult acne ever since I graduated from high school and I still have it despite the fact that I&#x27;m in my mid 20s. I have very sensitive skin and most of acne products out in the market don&#x27;t work for me. (Proactiv, Clinique... you name it) A lot of acne products use benzol peroxide and salicylic acid. I&#x27;ve had horrifying experience with products (extreme redness and dryness) with benzol peroxide, so I tend to avoid them.  Salicylic acid, I don&#x27;t have much problem. They do work a bit but doesn&#x27;t do any wonder. I&#x27;ve used the bodyshop&#x27;s teatree oil and proactiv&#x27;s spot treatments for a while for painful blemishes that I get occasionally. The thing is they only work for a certain period of time because your skin builds tolerance. This blemish stick is working good so far. It reduced ginormous blemishes I&#x27;ve had for days on my forehead almost over night. When I first applied it, WOW it stung like you know what. It was so strong and licorice-ish smell wasn&#x27;t very appealing either. I&#x27;d recommend you to use it before you go to sleep at night. The price is very reasonable and it should last for a while.</li>
            <li> I love the blemish stick, it works without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I just bought my 4th tube of this because it works. And works really well, really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first discovered it years ago at an apothecary and have been hooked ever since (a tube can lasts me years). I can hit a few red spots before bed and they are gone in the morning. MAGIC! I also like using it after doing things I know I shouldn&#x27;t (like getting one more blackhead) or after shaving to reduce redness and inflammation. It is great for blemishes on your back, shoulders and chest too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the product is 100% natural, and it smell like it. I personally love the smell: woody and naturally clean and not at chemical-y, but it doesn&#x27;t matter since it dissipates quickly. The Burt’s Bees Herbal Blemish Stick is much more effective than any pure tea tree oil I&#x27;ve used, not to mention many better brand spot treatments. The glass tube makes this portable, tidy and easy to apply. It makes EVERYTHING on my face heal quicker. This product is an essential for me. Buy a tube and it will be for you, too!</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I liked it. It comes in about an inch long glass container with a roller application perfect purse size. It smells terrible but it seemed to get rid of redness. About 2-3 weeks after purchase it broke out my skin (not a reaction a full breakout) where I had applied it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not think it is necessarily the product but the roller application causing this. You use the roller over and over again, the roller ball cycles back through the remaining product taking any bacteria with it. Now I look at the product and it is cloudy and &#x27;dusty&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;On the upside the company I purchased this from had a good price and great shipping I would purchase from them again. Although I think it was strange that it didn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s original packaging but maybe they did this for shipping reasons.</li>
            <li> A lot of times, you just have to be patient for your blemishes to go away. I&#x27;ve tried SO many different kind of products targeted towards acne, but this is probably the best thing, AND one of the cheapest. It smells a little strong, because duh it&#x27;s tea tree oil, but it works really well. My pimples are shortened down to just a few days instead. I also heard that tea tree oil and some of the other ingredients in this list are supposed to be good for getting rid of cold sores, and I tried it on mine, and it worked SO well, especially in combination with Abreva! So hey, this stuff isn&#x27;t just for pimples! :) Also, it way cheaper than Abreva. I got this for roughly $8, Abreva is at least $20. And I use this all the time, and they&#x27;re pretty natural ingredients! Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. The smell is indeed quite herbal but it&#x27;s perfect for applying before bed. Seems to work well at reducing inflammation and redness. I was never a big investor in beauty products but I&#x27;ve found that I use this one up quickly, so it must be doing something! My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry or aggravated after applying, though it can burn a tiny bit if you put it on right after a shower. Excellent natural alternative to conventional acne care products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Better than the really expensive department store acne treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Not too drying, but I do use a light moisturizer a fee minutes after this.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a tea-tree smell to it, though, so I only use it at night before bed. By morning, my acne spots are better and the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> I love this little blemish stick. Love the medicinal smell, the way it feels when it hits my skin. My skin has cleared tremendously with another system I have been using. Well I still get an occasional hormonal pimple. Which is nothing compared.to before. Well I am a picker also. Will pick at a pimple until there is a nasty scar &amp; it will linger for months from the picking. Well anytime I get the urge to pick, I slater this lovely.stuff on. It not only is helping to kill the bacteria in the blemish, but also keeps me from picking. I will not be without this product!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is my favorite blemish treatment. I&#x27;ve used organic tea tree oil which I hated because it smells so awful. this tea tree blend oil smells like nothing. I just dab a bit on my pimples after I wash my face at night and by morning they are significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best part about tea tree oil is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin all peely and dry. it doesn&#x27;t sting or smell bad either. I&#x27;ve tried 2 other tea tree oils and they both smelled horrible! so I always come back to this burts bees brand. a little pricey maybe but all you need is one dab. this lasts me months upon months</li>
            <li> I use this on cold sores.  It is amazing.  They go away so fast and do not spread.</li>
            <li> When you feel the volcano forming (that is a zit before it has come to a head) rub some of this on and it will pretty much disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Larger ones might take several applications.  Doesn&#x27;t show when applied.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of most Burt&#x27;s Bees products (as I&#x27;m allergic to beeswax) but this blemish stick isn&#x27;t bad. It is a heavily fragrant alcohol-based acne spot treatment that you roll directly onto your blemishes. It&#x27;s strong—smells strong and is potent in ingredients, but I feel like the application method isn&#x27;t that sanitary. Obviously the direct contact with your face will result in bacteria buildup on the rollerball, but I don&#x27;t know how else they could make the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, be very careful with this and don&#x27;t use it so liberally, ONLY on big, noticeable blemishes. I have sensitive, but oily skin, and sometimes the patches of skin where I use this turn bright red. The irritation does not last too long, but my skin&#x27;s reaction to it is proof that it is very strong and may irritate some skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it as wildly effective as Kiehl&#x27;s Blue Herbal Spot Treatment, but it gets its job done, is relatively cheap, and is 100% natural, so I&#x27;m still a happy gal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees is a standard drugstore brand that you can find everywhere (not only Amazon, but also Walmart, Target, CVS, etc.), so I definitely recommend it if you want all-natural skin care products at a reasonable price and wide availability.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. I have used every expensive brand under the sun to take care of an occasional blemish or pimple or any unexplained bump and this INSTANTLY dries out the area and heals it. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this, I thought it would do wonders since this is supposed to be a natural acne treatment so I was very excited when it came. I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes at first and it burned my sensitive skin, so instead of using it once every day, I used it once every three days. But still, the burning was persistent with each use and winded up causing my skin to become real dry and flaky and ugh, it was just a terrible experience for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous acne products throughout the years and this is, by far, the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to get rid of stubborn acne. Nothing works quiet like this, NOTHING. I thank the universe for helping me find it... and also Mr. Burt for making it.</li>
            <li> I have had problematic skin since I was a teenager.  Now, several decades later, I still get adult acne.  There is very little that I have found that effectively treats acne without harsh burning or peeling.  While not always 100% effective, this blemish stick seems to help diminish my acne and scars from past breakouts.  I&#x27;ve found the stick to be most useful when treating a pimple in its earliest stages.  I think that in combination with other treatments (an effective cleanser for instance), this product is helpful in reducing the number of full blown pimples.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t believe in all this treatment, as most of skin problems come from the inside (because of some hormone or any other health issue) and usually can&#x27;t be that easily treated from the outside. Yet this product was bought accidentally and worked really good! It really diminishes the problem, as long as you apply it twice a day! No scarring, quick healing, it&#x27;s great. And you can always have this little bottle with you, just in case. And it works much, much better, than the tea tree oil alone (it is one of the ingredients). Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is like magic! Reduces irritation and heals.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin then this is the zit care for you.  The stuff works great without drying out my skin.  It takes care of zits within just a few applications.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use the all the time when I have a pimple flare up. Helps it to heal quickly. Always have one handy.</li>
            <li> Great for my oily sensitive skin. It dries up zits without over drying. This works quite well for scalp blemishes as well. My son uses this on his sensitive teenage skin without complaining that it burns.</li>
            <li> I bought this product earlier today, and used it only once, but it was horrible. A couple hours after I used it, I looked at my face and I was disgusted. It made my pores huge wherever I put it, and it gave me blackheads on my nose. It is making my upper lip and my T zone break out into small pimples. I don&#x27;t really understand because everyone in these reviews says it is great. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin! Maybe I just had an allergic reaction to this product, but be warned it is a roller so it is very un-hygienic.</li>
            <li> After just one application of this stuff my blemishes already start to disappear by the next day. I have never found anything that works as well as this.</li>
            <li> This stick reduces redness and sore spots almost over night. Make sure not to apply it too close to your eyes or broken skin because the alcohol can sting pretty badly. It is easy and efficient to apply and smells good.</li>
            <li> In a sentence: This product removes pimples and blemishes in less than 24-hours (in most cases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With more details: I make no statements about how this product may work on your skin - you&#x27;ll just have to give it a shot and see. What I can tell you is that for me, and the many friends I&#x27;ve recommended it to, it&#x27;s hands-down the best blemish remover we have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has saved me many embarrassing moments in public when I catch something the night before and give it a few swipes of Burt&#x27;s Bees. But let&#x27;s talk about what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blemish stick itself is like a roll-on. The liquid inside has a pleasant smell of mint, licorice, outdoors, and any number of adjectives that are in that herbal genre. If I had to pick a gender, it&#x27;s a masculine scent and the bonus is that it seems to work well as a nasal decongestant too if you happen to have some blemishes on or under your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unscrew the top, turn it over, and start rolling it across your face where the blemishes are. I&#x27;ve noticed that there are some manufacturing differences across sticks. On some the silicon ball tends to slide easily and on others it needs to be primed in order to roll and bring the liquid out. Not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to give a blemish a coating every couple of hours if possible. You will notice that on normal skin there is some visible drying that can occur after several days of use - watch for that if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pimples tend to being shrinking within a few hours and in some cases on my face they have 90% vanished by the next morning. Other pimples take 2 days to be completely gone - you&#x27;ll just have to see what works with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other product (and I&#x27;ve tried many of the Oxy-style pads) has come close to the herbal power of Burt&#x27;s Bees, and it&#x27;s nice knowing that I&#x27;m using completely natural and organic stuff on my face vs. a lot of chemicals that don&#x27;t do the job anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try -it&#x27;s the only thing I use now for blemishes, and I&#x27;ve converted many friends over to it as well.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years for spot-treatment--clears it op in no time!</li>
            <li> I use this blemish stick when I have a major breakout, and it works great! It doesn&#x27;t bleach clothing or pillowcases (compared to acne products containing benzoyl peroxide). Has a strong herbal/medicinal scent, which fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I am never without it and buy it in bunches but it is hard to find locally where I live.  It really helps and doesn&#x27;t leave your sink dry.</li>
            <li> This was actually really great.  It is a gentle product, but it does just what it says it will do.  I need to place this item on auto-ship as well.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product because my persistent acne was becoming very stressful to deal with. I have very oily skin, small pimples throughout my face, and redness to my t-zone. I have tried proactive and countless over the counter products with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. Although they work fairly well, they have never been able to get rid of my acne completely and often dry out my skin so much that it becomes excessively oily; a real pain when putting on makeup. I decided to try oil cleansing and this was my first purchase. I have not used any other products but this and a neutrogena sensitive skin cleanser. I noticed a difference within the first few days. This dries out pimples without drying out my skin. This product has even made my face less oily (I honestly apply it all over my face.) I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** For those like myself who are worried about the roller ball bringing more bacteria into the product, it can be easily removed! I now apply mine with cotton pads and q-tips***</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the foot prints on my package.</li>
            <li> The product itself does the job, but only for the short period of time, you have to reapply it throughout the day. I started using it only because of facial burns from benzoil peroxide. It&#x27;s a decent alternative. But the screw cap cracked and broke after several days of use and now the solution is basically evaporating. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This will dry up any blemish that you may have within 2 days.  I love this blemish stick and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I roll this on after a good facial cleanser, let it air dry, then add some moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a toss up.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s helped some pimples, but then others have continued to flourish.&lt;br /&gt;I do think adding more of the product 2-3 times a day produces better results than one application.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not something I would necessarily recommend.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again myself.</li>
            <li> I have never had horrible acne, usually the hormonal kind with one popping up here or there. Nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle or would get stressed out about. In December, my face broke out in places it never has before and I was going crazy! I decided to switch over to natural remedies and this was a natural spot treatment that seemed to get pretty good reviews so I bought some. I really was disappointed with this product. Obviously, I didn&#x27;t assume it would make them all vanish in a day, but geesh, after two weeks I was hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel. I gave this product 2 stars because I like that Burt&#x27;s Bees is putting our natural products (although it does have alcohol in it which can actually irritate your skin) but overall, this product did not work for me. As another reviewer pointed out, the rolling ball is a little disgusting as well. It rolls over your skin, picks up bacteria and dead skin cells and then puts them back into the container! Kind of gross if you really think about it. I was very on top of applying this on my pimples as well (morning and night after cleansing and before putting on moisturizer) so that was not the reason for it not working. I also found that sometimes the liquid would not come out enough and other times it came out so quickly it would start running down my face. I give Burts Bees props for a step in the right direction but this product did not work for me.uld really suggest looking them up online and seeing if there is a store near you. They give free samples as well if you want to try a few different things out!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all. In fact, after I used it my acne seemed to spread. When a zit finally did go away (seemed like FOREVER) it left a dark mark.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Both the adults and kiddos in our home use this. I have very sensitive skin and this does the trick without over drying. Be careful to not use after blemish has started to heal...it will irritate the skin. The small bottle lasts a very long time even with regular use. The rolling ball at the top  that you use to apply it with does allow for it to drip so be careful around eyes.</li>
            <li> I find all Burt&#x27;s products are great but this ones steals the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it one once a night after watching with trader joes face wash. I have some problem area behind my earlobes and an oily noise.  Parter using this for a week these problem areas have cleared and and my oily skin has greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two places that tend to get ingrown hairs. I out this on those areas after shaving and haven&#x27;t had a problem since. Great natural ingredients, easy to apply. All around great product. And yes, it&#x27;s a little costly but it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Burts Bees skin line compared to any other line offered in drug stores (natural or not). My skin is sensitive, and these products work well without drying my skin out. The smell is pretty natural and strong, but I got used to it after awhile. After I roll the product on, my skin feels refreshed and clean.  Definitely recommend to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Target.  I tried to use this on my blemishes but it was way too irritating to my skin.  I tried to work past the pain to see if it would improve my skin or I would get used to it but I did not.  Needless to say I do not recommend this product if you have truly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a tea tree oil product and decided on this because I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees. My favorite aspect is that it brings a painful pimple to a head within a few hours, giving me hope for deep cystic acne that usually just lurks under my skin for weeks. It has a nice scent, and while the tea tree has a strong presence as always, there is a pleasant lemon background that I enjoy. It also dries quickly, not leaving a sticky residue or tight feeling like many drugstore products out there, even without a moisturizer. I do follow up with a dab of  jojoba oil however, which I recommend regardless of acne. I&#x27;m reserving a 5 star rating for the ever elusive magic acne fighter that can take down a pimple over night, so a 4 star rating is absolutely fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> So, I am a junior in university. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne since I was a sophomore in HIGH SCHOOL and then suddenly my face wants to break out over winter break. I tried clean and clear acne moisturizing lotion, every peroxide based spot treatment, all the masks you could think of and even slept on a new pillowcase every night- NOTHING WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I remembered an old favorite from back in the day and went searching at my local Target for this blemish stick. FOUND IT! And guess what? It worked. In ONE night. I had 14 painful nodule pimples that had not surfaced, and in using this one night I now only have two. The others dried up. Pimples that I could not get rid of for the life of me have dried up and the dark spots from old healed ones is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming from someone with SUPER sensitive skin, this is like a miracle. Give this a try. I promise it is worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a product that helps to heal acne that is not irritating.  This dries up whiteheads and does not cause more of a problem.  It does not sting.</li>
            <li> If you deal with cold sores, you have to try this product.  I&#x27;ve tried it on pimples with no luck, but wife swears by it for that.  However, I get very bad cold sores about 1-2 times a year.  My lip swells up, it oozes puss, and is just a nightmare to deal with and look at.  I tried all the medications, prescriptions or otherwise and nothing works.  Read online about tea tree oil and someone recommended this product just for its ease of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy cow does it work!  I apply it about every 30min as soon as a cold sore appears and get no side effects.  It doesn&#x27;t prevent the cold sore from appearing, but it definitely shortens the duration and intensity of them.  They used to last about 14 days with about 7 days of that as a full blown swollen lip, oozing cold sore...now I can have it knocked out in about 7 days and only 1-2 days of oozing.  It usually begins drying out in about 3-4 days.  I don&#x27;t apply any other medication when using this product.  It&#x27;s been nothing short of a miracle for me and hope it will work for you too, b/c I know how terrible these types of cold sores can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - If you do use it for cold sores, I mark my bottle with a permanent marker so as not to mistakenly use it for other applications, and to make sure my wife doesn&#x27;t try to use it for pimples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  I keep it with me even when traveling.  I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I think it works really well on the occasional adult acne spot.  Yes, it has the tea tree oil smell, but that goes away when it dries.  Within hours, the pimple looks smaller and redder.</li>
            <li> Well after a week of using this you will be smiling from ear to ear.  I can not believe how well this works.  I work for a Derm Doctor and have used all kinds of RX&#x27;s and still had adult blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Well I am on my way to a clear face, also use the acne solutions lotion it awesome!</li>
            <li> As an herbalist this is the one prepackaged item I use for insect bites.  I discovered it quite by accident when one evening several years ago I had a mosquito bite that was itching like crazy and had swollen up.  I happened to have no prepared remedy at the time, and in rummaging through a drawer to find something I came across the Burt&#x27;s Bees Blemish Stick which I had gotten but rarely used.  I knew the herbs in it plus the alcohol would at least give some relief.  I rubbed it on the bite and the entire area.  In 20 minutes the swelling had decreased greatly and the itching had largely subsided.  I reapplied before going to bed, and the next morning I couldn&#x27;t even find the location of the bite.  If I forget to apply insect repellent before going to the garden, it is not uncommon for me to get a couple of dozen bites--for some reason mosquitos have always loved me.  If that happens, in my experience I apply the Burt&#x27;s Bees Blemish Stick and within 30-45 minutes the itching and swelling are gone and some of the bites have disappeared altogether.  I heartily recommend it for insect bites.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin. My acne is mainly hormonal and sometimes depending on what I eat, I&#x27;ll get a pimple or two, so I thought if I applied this when I felt a pimple coming, it could help. I used it for a few weeks everytime I felt one coming, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything so I eventually stopped using it. I still use it once in a while just to see if it&#x27;ll do anything but, so far, nothing. I think you might just have to try it yourself and see since it seems to work for a lot of people.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit strong at first but after a few uses you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;It does sting a bit when you apply it so be careful not to apply it anywhere near the eyes or you might tear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it didn&#x27;t work for me but if you really want to try it, give it a shot, you never know until you try it.</li>
            <li> All natural acne solution. It sounds great but doesn&#x27;t work so well for me.  Initial use of it cleared up the acne very well. Unfortunately, after persistent use for two weeks. It caused my skin to become very dry and flaky. Once this happened, my skin&#x27;s natural response was to produce more oil  Two weeks after using this product, my acne has gotten worst.  Furthermore, there is a burning sensation when applying this ointment.  This product was used in combination with the facial cleansing soap.  This might work for others well but for my sensitive skin, it did not work well at all.  A friend says it worked well for her though.  In the end this product was not the solution for my acne problem.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Temporarily relieves irritation of acne&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;+Dries out skin&lt;br /&gt;+Smells horrible&lt;br /&gt;+Burns when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this for others?&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not recommend this product. Yes it works for a bit, but in the end it was not good for me.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different; so, it might work for you.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really strong. I really enjoyed using it, but i&#x27;m starting to not like the idea of how the roller ball is in contact with so many pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to start using tea tree with qtips after this.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use more natural products which is why I chose this product in the first place. Every once in awhile I get a few blemishes so I like to have a spot treatment product. This blemish stick does absolutely nothing. Even after applying it multiple times throughout the day you notice no difference.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t resist the pun but my wife put me up to it. We are shocked. This product actually works - and swiftly too. A def must buy if you struggle w acne.</li>
            <li> Wanted to go natural and saw this on Amazon (now how come I can&#x27;t find this in my local Target?) Dries your pimples in a matter of days (sometimes hours)! Love this stuff. It smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> I use this religiously on trouble spots every day, morning and night. If I catch the problem early, it never gets worse and heals quickly. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged woman with sensitive skin.  I get occasional blemishes and use this liquid roll on.  It works great, is not harsh and clears up minor pimples in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This is one of my go-to zit-zappers.  Works best when out of the shower or when a blemish is open/near the surface of your skin.  Does not do much for deep or very inflamed blemishes.  Excellent for smaller blemishes.  Warning: stings immensely for a few seconds when applied to an open blemish, but it will likely be greatly reduced by the next day.  Also has a strong medicinal smell that some may not like, but I got used to it after a while.</li>
            <li> Use this almost every day.</li>
            <li> this stuff works pretty much in the course of a day on a blemish if I put it on periodically throughout the day. It works better than any other product for breakouts I&#x27;ve tried. And I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING (salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, name a brand and I&#x27;ve tried it). This is my favorite go to.</li>
            <li> Skip the added ingredients and buy some essential oils instead.  I suggest tea tree oil.  You get more bang for your buck and you&#x27;ll feel better about skipping out on a list of ingredients that you have to research and verify.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and adult acne, so I was hoping this product would do the trick since tea tree oil has always soothed my skin when it&#x27;s dry. After reading so many good reviews, I decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on, everywhere it touched felt like it was on fire. The next day, the path I had rolled with it was bright red and slightly raised. It took a few days for the redness/swelling to go down. I tried it again a week later with the same results. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the willow bark, which is where salicylic acid is derived. Every redness reducing product I&#x27;ve ever tried that contains salicylic acid just makes my face worse - red, burning, dry, and itchy. If you&#x27;ve experience the same sensitivity to willow bark/salicylic acid, skip this product. I&#x27;ve read that sensitivity to salicylic acid is uncommon though, so if your skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive like mine is, I&#x27;d say give this a shot. Usually Burt&#x27;s Bees is good to me, so I think this one is just a fluke because of the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from mild to cystic acne for years now and the last three months, it has gone worse. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of remedies, including prescribed and alternative medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw my cousin use this when we were together and she said this has helped her A LOT. Her skin is the same as mine, which is combination-oily but she has it worse when it comes to pimples. But she calls this product her holy grail after her skin has cleared out of any blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in my case, the first few days I used this, I was amazed! It cleared out almost every pimple I have and it also did stop upcoming pimples! I use it twice a day. But after a week of using this product, I noticed my skin got an allergic reaction and my face has these little bumps all over (like goosebumps) and it&#x27;s really dry and itchy. I was wondering if it was this product that caused this so I stopped using it for around 3 days and the bumps on my face slowly faded away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s disappointing because when I finally found an amazing remedy against my acne, the allergic reaction I got from it as a side-effect is really devastating.</li>
            <li> It was nice that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but I used it twice a day for two weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any effect. It worked as well as leaving blemishes alone does (aside from regular cleansing). I also am concerned that rolling the ball over the actual blemish will transfer bacteria to the product inside. However, the product does not transfer well from bottle to finger to blemish. After using for two weeks, the bottle rolled off the sink counter onto tile floor and broke (since it&#x27;s glass). I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t reuse after a breakout.</li>
    </ol>
