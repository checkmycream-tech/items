            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This worked well for what I wanted it to, but like the review title says, the stopper/roller top is pretty easy to get off, which means can leak a bit if you&#x27;re not very careful about how you put it back on.  </li>
            <li>I can fit my perfume for when I travel no mess no fuss.</li>
            <li>These reminded me of the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34;; the roller is nice, but the bottle is quite heavy for something you want to carry in your purse.</li>

            <li> The top screws on tightly, there is no leakage and the glass bottle seems thick and solid so no fear of shatter despite rough handling.</li>
            <li> I received  these roll on perfume bottles and one of them had a chunk taken out of the glass and one of them leaked and a decent amount of my perfume went to waste.</li>

            <li> when I ordered this bottle, I was unaware that essential oils need to be in dark glass bottles--</li>
            <li> so, minus one</li>
            <li> But as other reviews have mentioned; this product will drip if turned on its side.</li>
            <li> There are other websites where you can purchases these for cheaper.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it took two and a half weeks to ship to me.  </li>
            <li> I can use less product yet since there&#x27;s less waste through dripping.</li>
            <li> These little bottles make it convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li> so I just use plain oil on my lips.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the duo with one plain and one swirl.  </li>
            <li> But with the price of the jars and shipping it is hard to complain to hard.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid to put expensive perfume in here at first, just in case something bad happened</li>
            <li> All in all I got what I needed and it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Had bad experience with the roller ball not working</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these. They do not leak at all.</li>
            <li> Ended up tossing in the trash.  I filled it with an expensive perfume oil only to find out that the roller ball would not budge.  I could not get any of the perfume out and ended up buying a different roller that works perfectly.  I would not recommend this roller.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I envisioned but fits the purpose for what I got it for. I&#x27;ve since been told of a website that sells them for 30 cents each so i&#x27;ll be checking that out next time I need one.</li>
            <li> I had no idea where I could get these. They were very cheap but the shipping was higher. All in all I got what I needed and it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles, makes great gifts</li>
            <li> Came on time, wasn&#x27;t damage and I love that it came with a tool that allowed me to transfer the perfume to the bottle itself. FANTASTIC PRODUCT! No leaks or anything</li>
            <li> These reminded me of the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34;; the roller is nice, but the bottle is quite heavy for something you want to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> Very good for mixing up essential oils. But as other reviews have mentioned; this product will drip if turned on its side. So I keep it in a Ziplock bag from staining my purse.</li>
            <li> I received  these roll on perfume bottles and one of them had a chunk taken out of the glass and one of them leaked and a decent amount of my perfume went to waste.</li>
            <li> Roll on perfume balls arrived safely packaged and none arrived broken. Very useful for what I&#x27;ll be up using them for. Had bad experience with the roller ball not working but these do every time. Great product</li>
            <li> This perfume bottle was exactly what I wanted.  The bottle was easy to fill and the right amount of perfume is distributed.  I have not tried traveling with it yet so I do not know how it handles in a horizontal position.</li>
            <li> This worked well for what I wanted it to, but like the review title says, the stopper/roller top is pretty easy to get off, which means can leak a bit if you&#x27;re not very careful about how you put it back on.  The price was extremely reasonable though and again for what I needed it to do, it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> These are good quality for the price I paid. However, the ball does not roll easily. It is only good to use for perfume or a liquid with water like consistency. The bottle size is about 2 inches in length.</li>
            <li> I can fit my perfume for when I travel no mess no fuss. Great for saving space. I would recomend.</li>
            <li> I love these travel bottle for my perfum. I ordered 4 of them and gave them as stocking stuffers, the family loved them</li>

            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use, small and doesn&#x27;t leak either. I travel quite frequently, so this is perfect for me. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this for my under eye oil.  I use fractionated coconut oil.  Use 2 passes and your under eye will feel silky smooth.  I keep it in my bathroom, in a standing position.  I love it!  The bottle and roller I received were new.</li>
            <li> I loved this bottle.  Great for trying them out.  There are other websites where you can purchases these for cheaper.  But these bottles work great and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> when I ordered this bottle, I was unaware that essential oils need to be in dark glass bottles--so, minus one star.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the bottles, the top goes on HARD the first time you use it. Of the two bottles I bought, one bottle&#x27;s roller ball keeps falling out--minus one star.&lt;br /&gt;So, my advise, find a better, darker bottle for your essential oils.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received is made of a clear glass body, a removable plastic rollerball applicator insert and a plastic cap. The insert fits well into the glass body and does not leak, the rollerball moves freely and the plastic cap screws on tightly and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased with the performance of this item.</li>
            <li> These bottles are perfect for my essential oils! I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon. They snap together well and stay together.</li>
            <li> Love it! The top screws on tightly, there is no leakage and the glass bottle seems thick and solid so no fear of shatter despite rough handling. I was a little afraid to put expensive perfume in here at first, just in case something bad happened so I tried it with a non-expensive one for a week or so. And since I had zero problems with, I just washed the bottle out with some diluted alcohol and put the new perfume in. Great way to carry your favorite fragrance around. Will definitely repurchase for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that I could put essential oil in to use more conveniently and this did it!  So easy to use!</li>
            <li> I am intolerant of any lip products so I just use plain oil on my lips.  These little bottles make it convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li> All the pieces were there. Item arrived exactly as described. Roller ball works great. I put essential oil mixes in it. The top isn&#x27;t hard to pop off but I know it stay on securely. I&#x27;ve been using them for a while and they are still in great shape and the ball doesn&#x27;t get stuck as I&#x27;ve had some rollers do on me.</li>
            <li> great bottles I use essential oil in them for daily use</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, packaged appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;No problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again.  It is to be used to hold Peppermint Essential Oil.</li>
