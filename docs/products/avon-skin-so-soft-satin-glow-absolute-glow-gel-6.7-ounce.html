            <li>Worth the price!!!</li>

            <li>It works better than Jerkins.</li>
            <li>I tell everyone I know what a wonderful product this is, and I&#x27;m hoping Avon will keep making it, but in the meantime I am ordering extra, just in case.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it doesn&#x27;t make it into the catalog, but you can look it up on [...] and find the order number</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments on \\&quot;my tan\\&quot; in my life, but they discontinued it,&amp; I don&#x27;t know why?</li>

            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I love</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer,and if your fair skinned then it would add that,\\&quot;kissed slightly by the sun\\&quot; to your skin.</li>
            <li>I like how easy this blends on your skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and gives it a nice glow!</li>
            <li>I first used this last summer, after asking someone who always had the best tan, if she was worried about skin cancer.</li>
            <li>Other than the &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s awesome, and still repels mosquitos like the original.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s silky smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on, never streaks, leaves a very soft glow on my legs and arms, I find it better than Jergens which I used before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to throw this away but will give it to someone because it&#x27;s really not a bad product.</li>
            <li>this was a smooth transaction an fast free shipping and it was cheaper then getting it from avon.</li>
            <li>It is easy to smooth out for a natural look and also a  tan look versus looking orange.</li>
            <li>Love skin so soft products as it is...</li>
            <li>I love the natural looking color that it gives.</li>
            <li>before u dry apply the product and let dry for best results.</li>
            <li>I had to shower it off right away and still felt greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my middle 40&#x27;s,&amp; have noticed my skin is becoming drier w/ age, this is a fantastic solution.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used it</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;ll be able to order it for you as a part of your regular Avon order.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I  know how great this product is (at least for me) and</li>
            <li>what I found out later to be the case for many others in their reviews of this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this at first bc I had read that this made one commenters skin greasy.</li>
            <li>I understand how frustrating it is to find a product that you love, and have it discontinued, so I hope this helps some of you out! :)</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin healthy, &amp; adds much needed moisture back.</li>
            <li>But the best thing about this product is it only takes a VERY small amt,</li>
            <li>the product doesn&#x27;t have smell of self tanners and really does make u r skin</li>
            <li>I found that my skin started feeling very sticky after application,</li>
            <li>I have a med olive skin tone the way it is, so this really didn&#x27;t have any effect or deepening of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to give much of a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and feels greasy - was recommended to me, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li>It really does give a nice subtle glow, so to me, the yuck smell is worth it.</li>
            <li>r smooth feeling after they dry.</li>
            <li>It absorbed fast, and it did not transfer at all onto my clothing,even my white clothing didn&#x27;t have any transfer of color.</li>
            <li>Gives you a very real, natural looking tan without having to lay in the sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother to go on &amp; really does give a natural satin glow that&#x27;s not orangey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it more if it dried faster.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t greasy on my skin,but for the brief time I rubbed it in,&amp; it absorbed.</li>
            <li>I bought this book for my daughter and her new baby.</li>
            <li>I especially notice it when I get a little warm (walking around outside).</li>
            <li>it goes on clear.</li>
            <li>Although the color achieved was pretty&lt;br /&gt;light, it made my skin feel so soft - hence the name.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft too.</li>
            <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t take you from white to orange in a few hours like most products, rather it builds over several days, it doesn&#x27;t streak, and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It does not dry very fast and leaves your skin feeling very oily and sticky for a few hours after.</li>
            <li>, it is a natural tan color, and lasts for several days.  </li>
            <li>This product seemed watered down and didn&#x27;t seem to add much, if any color to my legs.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The smell is really nice when you put it on, but the obligatory tanning lotion odor does eventually rear its ugly head.</li>
            <li> As usual the Amazon Vendors rise to new hiegths to satisfy the customer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Avon Skin so Soft Satin Glow Gel is awesome!  This is the first time I have used it and I will definitely continue using it! Makes my skin feel soft and gives it a nice glow!</li>
            <li> I love the product.It leaves a nice glow and tan on my legs.The product is very hard to find.Avon does not has it anymore</li>
            <li> The best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, with no streaks or missed places.  Hopefully Avon does not dscontinue making this product</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Worth the price!!! As usual the Amazon Vendors rise to new hiegths to satisfy the customer. That&#x27;s why I always come back!!!</li>
            <li> Product does whAt it says and feels really good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is easy to smooth out for a natural look and also a  tan look versus looking orange. Have tried other brands but return to this.</li>
            <li> Product comes out very quickly, otherwise does what it says (very subtle color changes...)</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and no streaks and it colors my legs in a day! No smell and no discolor issues! I bought it again. People thought I had actually been in the sun my legs came out so tan. It only takes one to two days and you have a regular tan. It works better than Jerkins. No smell and it goes on clear.</li>
            <li> I first used this last summer, after asking someone who always had the best tan, if she was worried about skin cancer. She laughed and showed me what she used ( she was doing my hair in a salon, and it was sitting at her station). She told me she used it every day after she showered. I bought some immediately and couldn&#x27;t believe how it gradually and evenly tanned. Because it doesn&#x27;t take you from white to orange in a few hours like most products, rather it builds over several days, it doesn&#x27;t streak, and looks natural. I tell everyone I know what a wonderful product this is, and I&#x27;m hoping Avon will keep making it, but in the meantime I am ordering extra, just in case.</li>
            <li> Love skin so soft products as it is...the product doesn&#x27;t have smell of self tanners and really does make u r skin so....soft.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the stink, you may like the product. Been using for only a few days, I can handle the smell but my mom can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product does work gradually as advertised and the tanning affect you get is not yellow.  My only concern is the fragrance, I am not fond of it.</li>
            <li> I like this  works well on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is just a BLAH product. Too expensive for what it offers. Too liquid compared to the other ones I have bought from AVON before. Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Other than the &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s awesome, and still repels mosquitos like the original.</li>
            <li> Hello all! Just a (hopefully) helpful hint from an Avon Rep! This product is not discontinued! I order some every other campaign, and recommend it to all of my customers. Most of the time it doesn&#x27;t make it into the catalog, but you can look it up on [...] and find the order number (as of today, April 11, 2014, the order number is 326-620) and give it to your Avon Rep and she&#x27;ll be able to order it for you as a part of your regular Avon order. Also, you can always order it yourself from the website if you would like. Anyways, I  know how great this product is (at least for me) and I understand how frustrating it is to find a product that you love, and have it discontinued, so I hope this helps some of you out! :)</li>
            <li> Good product that does everything it claims. I&#x27;d like it more if it dried faster.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I loved this product. Although the color achieved was pretty&lt;br /&gt;light, it made my skin feel so soft - hence the name. But as I continued to&lt;br /&gt;use it I found that my skin started feeling very sticky after application, which&lt;br /&gt;is what I found out later to be the case for many others in their reviews of this&lt;br /&gt;product. The stickiness never went away and caused me to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;Now I kind of wonder if it isn&#x27;t the humidity in the air causing this.&lt;br /&gt;I will try again in the fall, although the seller was gracious enough to&lt;br /&gt;take the product back.</li>
            <li> This is a greasy mess..I had to shower it off right away and still felt greasy. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this at first bc I had read that this made one commenters skin greasy. I went ahead though bc I used to use Avons, \\&quot;Skin So Soft medium to dark skin self tanner.\\&quot; It was produced in those dark brown containers (may had a hint of gold in the brown tube color?) I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments on \\&quot;my tan\\&quot; in my life, but they discontinued it,&amp; I don&#x27;t know why? So I went ahead &amp; tried this. It does have a oily base, but it absorbed into my skin nicely,&amp; the tan is very slight. I have a med olive skin tone the way it is, so this really didn&#x27;t have any effect or deepening of my skin tone. Anything it maybe evens it out some. This is a great moisturizer,and if your fair skinned then it would add that,\\&quot;kissed slightly by the sun\\&quot; to your skin. Only used it on my legs,torso,&amp; arms. I didn&#x27;t use on my face. It wasn&#x27;t greasy on my skin,but for the brief time I rubbed it in,&amp; it absorbed. It leaves my skin healthy, &amp; adds much needed moisture back. I&#x27;m in my middle 40&#x27;s,&amp; have noticed my skin is becoming drier w/ age, this is a fantastic solution. It absorbed fast, and it did not transfer at all onto my clothing,even my white clothing didn&#x27;t have any transfer of color. I&#x27;ll keep using this,&amp; keep my fingers crossed Avon makes it for us w/ a deeper completion. If that happens it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> this was a smooth transaction an fast free shipping and it was cheaper then getting it from avon. This produt works best on very fair skin. I used it for about 4 days and I didn&#x27;t see a difference, but my husband did, (he works off)he asked if I had been laying out tanning my legs. Great huh? But the best thing about this product is it only takes a VERY small amt, and it Helps to keep down razor rash and ur legs r smooth feeling after they dry. Just take ur bath or shower then before u dry apply the product and let dry for best results.</li>
            <li> This is a sweet and beautiful book.  The artwork is just lovely.  I bought this book for my daughter and her new baby.</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that works for me.  It is subtle. Does not sweat off.  I like the fragrance, and it is not streaky.</li>
            <li> Application is very easy. The gel smooths on very easily and evenly reducing the possibility of streaks.  I love the natural looking color that it gives. It does not dry very fast and leaves your skin feeling very oily and sticky for a few hours after.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to give much of a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and feels greasy - was recommended to me, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this gel. It is easy to put on, never streaks, leaves a very soft glow on my legs and arms, I find it better than Jergens which I used before. Doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion. Gives you a very real, natural looking tan without having to lay in the sun. Makes your skin so soft too. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever and they discontinued it.  What a mistake.  IT never streaks, it is a natural tan color, and lasts for several days.  I do hope Avon wakes up and continues to produce it.</li>
            <li> I actually like how this applies. It&#x27;s smoother to go on &amp; really does give a natural satin glow that&#x27;s not orangey. However the problem iwith me is that it clogs my legs, my skin for some reason cannot breath with it on. It&#x27;s a shame because I love it&#x27;s silky smooth texture. But not meant for me. So I have to stick with Jergen&#x27;s. It does give some streaks and can come out a bit orangey, but my legs can breath. Thought I am going to try the avon instant glow moisturizer and see how that works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to throw this away but will give it to someone because it&#x27;s really not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I like how easy this blends on your skin. I don&#x27;t have the typical orange elbows and ankles like previous lotions I&#x27;ve used. The smell is really nice when you put it on, but the obligatory tanning lotion odor does eventually rear its ugly head. I especially notice it when I get a little warm (walking around outside). It really does give a nice subtle glow, so to me, the yuck smell is worth it.</li>
            <li> This definitely is not like the gel I&#x27;ve bought from Avon.  This product seemed watered down and didn&#x27;t seem to add much, if any color to my legs.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon again.</li>
