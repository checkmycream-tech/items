            <li>I love my thera cane got this one to replace a lost one...</li>

            <li>It is a fabulous tool!</li>
            <li>I was able to pull up the manual online.</li>
            <li>I think this requires some study to use it correctly, but it has many uses and should hold up indefinitely.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I have had this item for many years and use it on a regualr basis.  </li>
            <li>I love this massager.  </li>
            <li>works well bought more for friends and family</li>
            <li>It has reduced so many inflamed trigger points that mobility has increased and quality of life has improved.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I found out how awesome it is because my son left it at my house by mistake.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>Hilarious.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the improvement in my arms and back.  </li>
            <li>It works like magic.</li>
            <li>The instruction booklet even points out that many people when they first get it, overdo it because it feels so good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>This implement does an excellent job of getting to the right spots and I can actually control my own pressure.</li>
            <li>We loved it so much we shared it with our family and friends and then bought more and gave them away as gifts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really bruised myself good with this thing.</li>
            <li>It is not the easy tool to use.</li>
            <li>I wish it was collapsible for easy travel .</li>
            <li>Even then, I tend to build a resistance to medications very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and does wonders to help relieve my aches and pains.</li>
            <li>I need stock or a commission would be nice ;-)</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, light weight to carry on travels.</li>
            <li>Excellent for home therapy for trigger points and tight muscles.  </li>
            <li>This is the best tool to loosen tight muscles.</li>
            <li>My one son works out with weights and he finds this a wonderful tool to work out tight and sore muscles.  </li>
            <li>I have used the theracane for a few weeks now and it is so great to be able to get into muscles and work the knots out!</li>
            <li>Good to use and comfortable, used frequently, tried another product &amp; did not like it.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my physical therapist, it&#x27;s great to get those pressure points</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks goofy but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>this is great for the knots and spasms in my back and neck</li>
            <li>The cane does come with a great instruction booklet with pictures that illustrate how to target specific troublesome spots.  </li>
            <li>What a great feel on your back and neck.</li>
            <li>The Thera Cane Deep Pressure Massager is a great product and an alternative when you can&#x27;t go get a massage.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have seen the pamphlet before and it has great pictures and various positions and uses.</li>
            <li>Saw this at a physical therapy place, bought it for my son the gymnast, it is great for after working out or loosening up before hand.</li>
            <li>, it works great in the shoulders however, there is a larger Thera Cane</li>
            <li>And to be honest who&#x27;s got that much time?</li>
            <li>There is nothing in the world as exciting as being able to work on knots in the shoulders by yourself.  </li>
            <li>A chiropractor is not always available and you may not have someone who can massage it for you.  </li>
            <li>Quality is good, same as those you pay $10 - $20 more for...</li>
            <li>Absolutely the next best thing to a massage therapist!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome massager that really hits the knots in my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>It also is very useful on my neck, in-between my shoulder blades, etc.  </li>
            <li>Very handy back massage</li>
            <li>Other than that, for the price this thing sturdy, and works incredibly well as it is.</li>
            <li>BTW, the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook is perfect for pinpointing where your true trouble lies.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderfully unique item that helps &amp;#34;ease the pain&amp;#34; of knotted muscles.</li>
            <li>I am excited to test it out all over my body using the techniques that came in the package with the Thera Cane.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for getting the pressure on those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was a little more effective in letting you apply MORE pressure to the points.</li>
            <li>The Thera-Cane is easy to use and is a great help at working out the &#x27;kinks&#x27; in tight muscles.</li>
            <li>Just place one of the several knobs on the knot and hold for a bit with a fair amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li>I had three different buddies that came over and laughed at me using it and after trying it themselves</li>
            <li>works really good for him on his back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Overall a good value.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought one for my daughter and my mother and had it shipped to them.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful tool and helps so much with my shoulder and neck tight spots.  </li>
            <li>use this for a quick fix.  </li>
            <li>The BBB has more knobs and is bigger, so it&#x27;s easier to reach more trigger points.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super sturdy.</li>
            <li>Now the family of one may be buying more since their kids are grown up and live away from their parents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this one is new and I am glad to get it.</li>
            <li>This device is so simple and amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and comes with a very helpful and detailed instruction manual.</li>
            <li>amazing product and Body back buddy&lt;br /&gt;Work! !!!</li>
            <li>It was worth purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Was referred by my physician and was worth the money.</li>
            <li>The Thera Cane is a wonderful product - especially for those with severe back muscle knots - you can really work them out without trying to explain to someone else just where the issue is.</li>
            <li>And with the design, I can get into my own back and gluts to keep them supple and moving!</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every bit paid.</li>
            <li>The next day I was on line researching my own to purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and I am able to really rip into my knots along my scapulas with ease.</li>
            <li>obviously helps if you have some strength and knowledge of your own musculature, but that&#x27;s why they have a lil&#x27; book with tips and tricks.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>My main line of work is in musculoskeletal medicine, so a good working knowledge of trigger points and muscle physiology is essential.</li>
            <li>That is a testament to the product right there.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of strength or skill to use and it seems to just apply pressure in the right areas once you find &amp;#34;the spot&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hits all the right spots.</li>
            <li>Anyone that tends to get tight shoulders or a pinch in the neck or back this is the perfect item for you.  </li>
            <li>I would have gladly paid a few more bucks for a sturdier version.</li>
            <li>Great for loosening those knots you get in your upper back.</li>
            <li>It is great for getting the hard to reach places on your own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for hard to reach places on the body</li>
            <li>Product arrived BEFORE the scheduled delivery date and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>It was also delivered exactly when estimated.</li>
            <li>and he actually left feeling better then when he came.</li>
            <li>I wish the ball on the hooked end was larger so that the pressure you put on it is more spread out.  </li>
            <li>I gave the first one I bought to my daughter.</li>
            <li>Exactly the tool I have need.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>Paid for itself the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It was better than advertised for deep tissue relaxation.</li>
            <li>you want exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amaze-balls.</li>
            <li>I work on the computer for my job and the Thera Cane is the only way I can be working on the computer for more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>This helped a lot but left many areas untouched.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You are the best one to know where and how hard to attack a knot in your back.  </li>
            <li>Used one at a physical therapy office and was glad to find one for a reasonable price for home use.</li>
            <li>The Thera Cane deep pressure massager came for a good price and was delivered one day earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The Thera Cane has helped with this by allowing me to focus pressure on specific areas to get more effective stretches of tight muscle groups.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this to anyone, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as it looks - a massage friend really recommended this.  </li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic, it is durable and can get to so many different places where I could not possibly get.</li>
            <li>At the end they had packed pretty much everything for me except this.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this one to anyone having back problems, love it.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a massage therapist and this handy tool make it easy to reach trigger points that are aching like the back of my shoulders or low back.</li>
            <li>Someone (apparently an employee) had liked it well enough to take it home with them, so the therapist couldn&#x27;t show it to me but highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li>It works amazing on the specific points on my back that I wanted to get.</li>
            <li>For the most part it solves the problem and saves your time, effort and money that you would have spent to have someone else work on you.  </li>
            <li>I really need this since Obamacare has eliminated massage therapy at chiro for me.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy but very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>Very helpful apparatus.</li>
            <li>Really helps to get those kinks out...</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants to buy</li>
            <li>I really like this cane.  </li>
            <li>It really does reduce pain levels.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It took a few minutes to understand how to manipulate it with my own leverage to achieve the desired effects, but I now use it every day and always keep it in arms length.</li>
            <li>For me, I just hook the Theracane over the armchair, and when I sit with my family to watch tv I can treat my own neck and back at the same time!</li>
            <li>My global pain level has dropped considerably and I sleep better as well.</li>
            <li>Great device for tense shoulders!  </li>
            <li>So excited by this, I have also bought extra and gave them away as gifts.</li>
            <li>Love it, really helps break down those knots in my neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have relieved my pain in shoulders that was impossible from acupuncture and 4 massages a week from top strong masseuses!!</li>
            <li>Forget trying to explain to your better half your pain...</li>
            <li>A terrific tool that most anyone can use, regardless of physical condition!</li>

            <li>and I highly recommend you watch it.  </li>
            <li>Love the thera cane, it does give a little but</li>
            <li>So nice for hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>The product is fantastic as expected but the description states there is a 14 page manuel included</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this item at such a reasonable rate!</li>
            <li>My physical therapist recommended this to me and it has been wonderful for especially hard to reach areas in the back and apply the right pressure points.</li>
            <li>and this is your new BFF</li>
            <li>Good for releasing muscle tension and hard to reach places on the back, neck and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I got this to use at work because it seemed like it would be less obtrusive than the Body Back Buddy, but I am much happier with that product and will get a lot more use out of it.</li>
            <li>I loned my original to a friend and hadn&#x27;t gotten it back yet, so bought another since she used it regularly as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to help ease the tight spots and reach heretofore unreachable trigger points in upper and mid back.  </li>
            <li>Convenient and nice to get hard to reach areas myself!</li>
            <li>I have had some disc issues in my back and could not find anyone strong enough to pinpoint where my back was sore.  </li>
            <li>Exactly the right spot, exactly the right amount of pressure, and with a little practice, can do it with very little arm tension.  </li>
            <li>construction is sound and it is just a little bit flexible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to be easy to work with, unlike that other brand that is blue, which I returned.  </li>
            <li>They did not want to touch it, clearly they had no idea what it was</li>
            <li>this tool allowed me to directly put pressure where it needed to be.  </li>
            <li>says the same thing &amp;#34;WOW, this really helped&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I use it frequently, every day</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have someone to massage your back, I HIGHLY recommend the Thera Cane!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It did hit the spots, but, I don&#x27;t have the strength to work my whole back, also, I am under a lot of stress, which puts those pressure points on steroids.</li>
            <li>Bye bye expensive massage therapy that does not do as good of a job.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t handle the pain I get in my back right under my left scapula and leading up to the peak of my traps.</li>
            <li>Also, either a pointy attachment or replacing one of the small ball-tips with something pointy (so a person can really dig into a tight muscle) would have been nice.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these for my husband who has had back pain for decades and this is the first product that he can control and massage away those knots in his entire body.  </li>
            <li>product was recommended by my physiotherapist and it works particularly well on the back muscles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone with back tension.</li>
            <li>This theracane is a superb device to massage painful trigger points, especially on the back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly discovering new areas on my body where I can use it, from feet to neck.</li>
            <li>Once they got to our new place to offload the boxes, one of them finally got up the nerve to ask what it was</li>
            <li>/&gt;About a year and a half ago I moved and it was fun to watch the movers try to avoid this thing.  </li>
            <li>It lets me get to those hard to reach shoulder points and pretty much anywhere else as well.  </li>
            <li>Slight movement of the cane helps provide substantial pressure on the trigger points.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this product did a huge service for people who have chronic pain and cant afford or are limited by health insurance companies, to obtain professional physical therapy.</li>
            <li>My physical therapist recommended this for me to use to aide in relief from both muscle and nerve pain issue from an old injury...</li>
            <li>Very useful to reach on the parts of the back that are difficult to get to and to create the right amount of pressure because of how it can be angled</li>
            <li>Great for people who have a bad back &amp; for me it works so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a medical acupuncturist for the last 2 decades and still run a busy clinic in Melbourne Australia.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had deep behind my shoulder blade for many years, and after two-weeks of working on it, the knot released.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately for me, I can&#x27;t actually reach my own mid back and shoulder regions without contorting and tiring myself out in the meanwhile.</li>
            <li>and I could definitely see it breaking (if I&#x27;m not careful) in the next year or two).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overnight cure but using it consistently for a few minutes in the morning and in the evening provided me with some relief which then lead eventually to the knotting up muscles releasing and no longer causing daily discomfort.  </li>

            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t understand why anyone would buy it until I saw it demonstrated.</li>
            <li> I love my thera cane got this one to replace a lost one...</li>
            <li> So I was finally gifted one this year for my birthday.  </li>
            <li> But when in need, the Thera Cane is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t care - it really did feel so good - kind of that &amp;#34;hurts</li>

            <li> Awesome at getting the knots out of my shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> My hips, back and shoulders feel great!</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous tool!</li>
            <li> I was able to pull up the manual online.</li>
            <li> I think this requires some study to use it correctly, but it has many uses and should hold up indefinitely.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I have had this item for many years and use it on a regualr basis.  </li>
            <li> I love this massager.  </li>
            <li> works well bought more for friends and family</li>
            <li> It has reduced so many inflamed trigger points that mobility has increased and quality of life has improved.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I found out how awesome it is because my son left it at my house by mistake.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t get them to do it!)  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> how much better I will feel.  </li>
            <li> Hilarious.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the improvement in my arms and back.  </li>
            <li> It works like magic.</li>
            <li> The instruction booklet even points out that many people when they first get it, overdo it because it feels so good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> This implement does an excellent job of getting to the right spots and I can actually control my own pressure.</li>
            <li> We loved it so much we shared it with our family and friends and then bought more and gave them away as gifts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really bruised myself good with this thing.</li>
            <li> It is not the easy tool to use.</li>
            <li> I wish it was collapsible for easy travel .</li>
            <li> Even then, I tend to build a resistance to medications very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and does wonders to help relieve my aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I need stock or a commission would be nice ;-)</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, light weight to carry on travels.</li>
            <li> Excellent for home therapy for trigger points and tight muscles.  </li>
            <li> This is the best tool to loosen tight muscles.</li>
            <li> My one son works out with weights and he finds this a wonderful tool to work out tight and sore muscles.  </li>
            <li> I have used the theracane for a few weeks now and it is so great to be able to get into muscles and work the knots out!</li>
            <li> Good to use and comfortable, used frequently, tried another product &amp; did not like it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my physical therapist, it&#x27;s great to get those pressure points</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks goofy but it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> this is great for the knots and spasms in my back and neck</li>
            <li> The cane does come with a great instruction booklet with pictures that illustrate how to target specific troublesome spots.  </li>
            <li> What a great feel on your back and neck.</li>
            <li> The Thera Cane Deep Pressure Massager is a great product and an alternative when you can&#x27;t go get a massage.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have seen the pamphlet before and it has great pictures and various positions and uses.</li>
            <li> Saw this at a physical therapy place, bought it for my son the gymnast, it is great for after working out or loosening up before hand.</li>
            <li> , it works great in the shoulders however, there is a larger Thera Cane</li>
            <li> And to be honest who&#x27;s got that much time?</li>
            <li> There is nothing in the world as exciting as being able to work on knots in the shoulders by yourself.  </li>
            <li> A chiropractor is not always available and you may not have someone who can massage it for you.  </li>
            <li> Quality is good, same as those you pay $10 - $20 more for...</li>
            <li> Absolutely the next best thing to a massage therapist!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome massager that really hits the knots in my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> It also is very useful on my neck, in-between my shoulder blades, etc.  </li>
            <li> Very handy back massage</li>
            <li> Other than that, for the price this thing sturdy, and works incredibly well as it is.</li>
            <li> BTW, the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook is perfect for pinpointing where your true trouble lies.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully unique item that helps &amp;#34;ease the pain&amp;#34; of knotted muscles.</li>
            <li> I am excited to test it out all over my body using the techniques that came in the package with the Thera Cane.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for getting the pressure on those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little more effective in letting you apply MORE pressure to the points.</li>
            <li> The Thera-Cane is easy to use and is a great help at working out the &#x27;kinks&#x27; in tight muscles.</li>
            <li> Just place one of the several knobs on the knot and hold for a bit with a fair amount of pressure.  </li>
            <li> I had three different buddies that came over and laughed at me using it and after trying it themselves</li>
            <li> works really good for him on his back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Overall a good value.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought one for my daughter and my mother and had it shipped to them.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tool and helps so much with my shoulder and neck tight spots.  </li>
            <li> use this for a quick fix.  </li>
            <li> The BBB has more knobs and is bigger, so it&#x27;s easier to reach more trigger points.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super sturdy.</li>
            <li> Now the family of one may be buying more since their kids are grown up and live away from their parents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this one is new and I am glad to get it.</li>
            <li> This device is so simple and amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and comes with a very helpful and detailed instruction manual.</li>
            <li> amazing product and Body back buddy&lt;br /&gt;Work! !!!</li>
            <li> It was worth purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Was referred by my physician and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Thera Cane is a wonderful product - especially for those with severe back muscle knots - you can really work them out without trying to explain to someone else just where the issue is.</li>
            <li> And with the design, I can get into my own back and gluts to keep them supple and moving!</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every bit paid.</li>
            <li> The next day I was on line researching my own to purchase.  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and I am able to really rip into my knots along my scapulas with ease.</li>
            <li> obviously helps if you have some strength and knowledge of your own musculature, but that&#x27;s why they have a lil&#x27; book with tips and tricks.</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> My main line of work is in musculoskeletal medicine, so a good working knowledge of trigger points and muscle physiology is essential.</li>
            <li> That is a testament to the product right there.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of strength or skill to use and it seems to just apply pressure in the right areas once you find &amp;#34;the spot&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hits all the right spots.</li>
            <li> Anyone that tends to get tight shoulders or a pinch in the neck or back this is the perfect item for you.  </li>
            <li> I would have gladly paid a few more bucks for a sturdier version.</li>
            <li> Great for loosening those knots you get in your upper back.</li>
            <li> It is great for getting the hard to reach places on your own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for hard to reach places on the body</li>
            <li> Product arrived BEFORE the scheduled delivery date and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> It was also delivered exactly when estimated.</li>
            <li> and he actually left feeling better then when he came.</li>
            <li> I wish the ball on the hooked end was larger so that the pressure you put on it is more spread out.  </li>
            <li> I gave the first one I bought to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Exactly the tool I have need.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> Paid for itself the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It was better than advertised for deep tissue relaxation.</li>
            <li> you want exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amaze-balls.</li>
            <li> I work on the computer for my job and the Thera Cane is the only way I can be working on the computer for more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> This helped a lot but left many areas untouched.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> You are the best one to know where and how hard to attack a knot in your back.  </li>
            <li> Used one at a physical therapy office and was glad to find one for a reasonable price for home use.</li>
            <li> The Thera Cane deep pressure massager came for a good price and was delivered one day earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The Thera Cane has helped with this by allowing me to focus pressure on specific areas to get more effective stretches of tight muscle groups.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this to anyone, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as it looks - a massage friend really recommended this.  </li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic, it is durable and can get to so many different places where I could not possibly get.</li>
            <li> At the end they had packed pretty much everything for me except this.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this one to anyone having back problems, love it.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and this handy tool make it easy to reach trigger points that are aching like the back of my shoulders or low back.</li>
            <li> Someone (apparently an employee) had liked it well enough to take it home with them, so the therapist couldn&#x27;t show it to me but highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li> It works amazing on the specific points on my back that I wanted to get.</li>
            <li> For the most part it solves the problem and saves your time, effort and money that you would have spent to have someone else work on you.  </li>
            <li> I really need this since Obamacare has eliminated massage therapy at chiro for me.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy but very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Very helpful apparatus.</li>
            <li> Really helps to get those kinks out...</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who wants to buy</li>
            <li> I really like this cane.  </li>
            <li> It really does reduce pain levels.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to understand how to manipulate it with my own leverage to achieve the desired effects, but I now use it every day and always keep it in arms length.</li>
            <li> For me, I just hook the Theracane over the armchair, and when I sit with my family to watch tv I can treat my own neck and back at the same time!</li>
            <li> My global pain level has dropped considerably and I sleep better as well.</li>
            <li> Great device for tense shoulders!  </li>
            <li> So excited by this, I have also bought extra and gave them away as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love it, really helps break down those knots in my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have relieved my pain in shoulders that was impossible from acupuncture and 4 massages a week from top strong masseuses!!</li>
            <li> Forget trying to explain to your better half your pain...</li>
            <li> A terrific tool that most anyone can use, regardless of physical condition!</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend to have this tool at hand.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone with pressure point pain.</li>
            <li> Again, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend you watch it.  </li>
            <li> Love the thera cane, it does give a little but</li>
            <li> So nice for hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> The product is fantastic as expected but the description states there is a 14 page manuel included</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this item at such a reasonable rate!</li>
            <li> My physical therapist recommended this to me and it has been wonderful for especially hard to reach areas in the back and apply the right pressure points.</li>
            <li> and this is your new BFF</li>
            <li> Good for releasing muscle tension and hard to reach places on the back, neck and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I got this to use at work because it seemed like it would be less obtrusive than the Body Back Buddy, but I am much happier with that product and will get a lot more use out of it.</li>
            <li> I loned my original to a friend and hadn&#x27;t gotten it back yet, so bought another since she used it regularly as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to help ease the tight spots and reach heretofore unreachable trigger points in upper and mid back.  </li>
            <li> Convenient and nice to get hard to reach areas myself!</li>
            <li> I have had some disc issues in my back and could not find anyone strong enough to pinpoint where my back was sore.  </li>
            <li> Exactly the right spot, exactly the right amount of pressure, and with a little practice, can do it with very little arm tension.  </li>
            <li> construction is sound and it is just a little bit flexible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to be easy to work with, unlike that other brand that is blue, which I returned.  </li>
            <li> They did not want to touch it, clearly they had no idea what it was</li>
            <li> this tool allowed me to directly put pressure where it needed to be.  </li>
            <li> says the same thing &amp;#34;WOW, this really helped&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I use it frequently, every day</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have someone to massage your back, I HIGHLY recommend the Thera Cane!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It did hit the spots, but, I don&#x27;t have the strength to work my whole back, also, I am under a lot of stress, which puts those pressure points on steroids.</li>
            <li> Bye bye expensive massage therapy that does not do as good of a job.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle the pain I get in my back right under my left scapula and leading up to the peak of my traps.</li>
            <li> Also, either a pointy attachment or replacing one of the small ball-tips with something pointy (so a person can really dig into a tight muscle) would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my husband who has had back pain for decades and this is the first product that he can control and massage away those knots in his entire body.  </li>
            <li> product was recommended by my physiotherapist and it works particularly well on the back muscles.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone with back tension.</li>
            <li> This theracane is a superb device to massage painful trigger points, especially on the back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly discovering new areas on my body where I can use it, from feet to neck.</li>
            <li> Once they got to our new place to offload the boxes, one of them finally got up the nerve to ask what it was</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a year and a half ago I moved and it was fun to watch the movers try to avoid this thing.  </li>
            <li> It lets me get to those hard to reach shoulder points and pretty much anywhere else as well.  </li>
            <li> Slight movement of the cane helps provide substantial pressure on the trigger points.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this product did a huge service for people who have chronic pain and cant afford or are limited by health insurance companies, to obtain professional physical therapy.</li>
            <li> My physical therapist recommended this for me to use to aide in relief from both muscle and nerve pain issue from an old injury...</li>
            <li> Very useful to reach on the parts of the back that are difficult to get to and to create the right amount of pressure because of how it can be angled</li>
            <li> Great for people who have a bad back &amp; for me it works so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a medical acupuncturist for the last 2 decades and still run a busy clinic in Melbourne Australia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had deep behind my shoulder blade for many years, and after two-weeks of working on it, the knot released.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I can&#x27;t actually reach my own mid back and shoulder regions without contorting and tiring myself out in the meanwhile.</li>
            <li> and I could definitely see it breaking (if I&#x27;m not careful) in the next year or two).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overnight cure but using it consistently for a few minutes in the morning and in the evening provided me with some relief which then lead eventually to the knotting up muscles releasing and no longer causing daily discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really in a position where I can afford the time or money for consistent deep-tissue massage services, so I was more than willing to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muscle relaxers and other meds can help, but I hate feeling dependent on pills to function.</li>
            <li> It is great for working out muscle knots that are impossible to reach!</li>
            <li> No one in my family would be willing to massage that spot for me as hard as it needs to be massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at work when I&#x27;m starting to get a knot, after work-outs &amp; after long days.</li>
            <li> It has too much flex, so when I use it on my back, I can&#x27;t press as hard as I need to.</li>
            <li> My Neurologist at the VA medical center recommended that I look into the Thera Cane to supplement my treatments for constant tension headaches and migraines.</li>
            <li> Thera Cane has helped me recover from an injury by relieving tight muscles that were exerting pressure on the soft tissue areas.  </li>
            <li> Better than m&#x27;lady and her small weak hands trying to get the kinks out.</li>
            <li> I get this tight spot in my left upper back, around the shoulder blade area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on long roadtrips when my shoulders start bunching up...</li>
            <li> Wish I had discovered the Cane a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I wish I had not waited so long to get it!</li>
            <li> When it got here I was skeptical but excited.</li>
            <li> I knew how to use the regular cane part, but am clueless about how to use the other protrusions.</li>
            <li> After continued weight lifting and training hard I have developed a lot of muscle in my back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it radiates pain down the entire left side of my spine, all the way down to my foot.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how I train I can sometimes overdo it and get knots in my back or slightly pinch a nerve.</li>
            <li> After tearing a muscle in my back rock climbing, I was looking for anything to help loosen the muscles and release the tight spots.  </li>
            <li> This item works out the tight knots in my neck, shoulders, back, and any place else that needs a massage.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if at least one of them purchased one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve given it as a present to a few friends who are treating themselves using the Trigger Point Therapy</li>
            <li> I spent this year.</li>
            <li> My chiropractor recommended this to me due to the fact that I kept getting tight in between my shoulder blades where I could not possibly reach.</li>
            <li> have had severe morning stiff neck pain limiting motion and range for several years.</li>
            <li> The hand grips are well placed so you don&#x27;t end up straining other muscles while trying to ease discomfort elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve talked to other Thera Cane owners who said their canes were not flexible at all.</li>
            <li> When I leave it over the tense knot in my muscles for a long enough period of time, I find it reduces or eliminates the tightness.  </li>
            <li> This tool you use on yourself and is great for dissolving those uncomfortable or painful knots in your muscle.  </li>
            <li> its fabulous for relieving those impossible to reach knots</li>
            <li> I also was shocked that I received the order so quickly!</li>
            <li> It was hard to get the physical therapy in the amount that was needed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go too hard initially or you&#x27;ll feel it.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s really flared up, like when I&#x27;m feeling ill or stressed, and I dig the Theracane into it</li>
            <li> I fell down eleven stairs a year ago and broke eleven bones and collapsed a lung.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what i wanted and my arm goes numb seldom</li>
            <li> I recommend this for everyone even if they don&#x27;t have aches and tight muscles but likes a massage.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with tight muscles.  </li>
            <li> I was familiar with the theracane but disappointed it did not come with the instruction pamphlet.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist recommended it and let me borrow hers to use for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I have had my Theracane for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to reach near or under my shoulder blade and helps to work themout or at least minimize my painnn/discomfort.</li>
            <li> It reaches those hard to reach areas and allows you to apply just the right a,punt of pressure to those painful knots.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice and trying to find the pressure points and/or sore spots, usually muscles that need some pressure to relieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Difficult to use especially with shoulder issues.</li>
            <li> I was sad when we moved this summer, because I left my cane at the house.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I would beg people to rub them for me.  </li>
            <li> No more begging.  </li>
            <li> There is also a booklet that comes with it, but if it&#x27;s too small, there is a PDF online you can get.  </li>
            <li> If you have deep tissue and muscle pain that is hard to reach- buy this dang thing!!!</li>
            <li> Can be used anywhere anytime for those hard to reach places along spinal column.</li>
            <li> This helps me reach those hard to reach spots to relax those muscles.</li>
            <li> It allows you to find those trigger points that are hard to reach (between shoulder blades, etc.).  </li>
            <li> You can apply as much or as little pressure as needed!!</li>
            <li> A little hard for use on (painful) trigger spot on my back.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m only angry I didn&#x27;t purchase sooner!</li>
            <li> I decided to finally order one for myself and was disappointed when it arrived to find it was made of a hard plastic and not the sturdier version of what I used in rehab.</li>
            <li> If they used material that was a notch or two stronger (and, this is not at all to say that it&#x27;s weak...</li>
            <li> This has been extremely helpful in reaching those painful hard-to-reach tension spots between our shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> I seriously think every household should have this!  </li>
            <li> I found this item rather awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Buy one for yourself and buy one for someone you know who suffers from knots as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these for years, and thought it looked stupid.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gets those hard-to-reach areas between massages!</li>
            <li> Ever get a sore muscle in your back or shoulder all of a sudden and can&#x27;t figure why but you know it is an impingement to your day.  Maybe you don&#x27;t have a massage or chiropractor appointment.....use this for a quick fix.  For the most part it solves the problem and saves your time, effort and money that you would have spent to have someone else work on you.  This tool you use on yourself and is great for dissolving those uncomfortable or painful knots in your muscle.  Just place one of the several knobs on the knot and hold for a bit with a fair amount of pressure.  Before you know it, the knot is gone.  I would highly recomend to have this tool at hand.  Maybe even keep one at the office for yourself or co-workers, you&#x27;ll be sure to get brownie-points.</li>
            <li> Forget trying to explain to your better half your pain...just do it yourself.. Gets those spots deep in da back..</li>
            <li> I got this for sore back muscles and soon found it works on arms, legs, back, neck, basically anywhere. I would recommend to anyone, especially at that price.</li>
            <li> Product arrived BEFORE the scheduled delivery date and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic as expected but the description states there is a 14 page manuel included and it is not.  It was also delivered exactly when estimated.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this thing. He uses it every day. What else can I say? It was worth purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my physical therapist, it&#x27;s great to get those pressure points</li>
            <li> Reaches places you cannot and massages them.</li>
            <li> So nice for hard to reach areas.  I&#x27;m a hockey player/climber and this is a lifesaver when I don&#x27;t have anyone around to massage the knots out of my back/neck.</li>
            <li> simply awesome! it helps me a lot. I am really glad I bought it. I have been using it for one month already!</li>
            <li> I am in total haven and every friend who has seen this and tried it has bought one - I need stock or a commission would be nice ;-)</li>
            <li> Convenient and nice to get hard to reach areas myself!</li>
            <li> Directions sold separately.</li>
            <li> This has been extremely helpful in reaching those painful hard-to-reach tension spots between our shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> This was prescribed to me by my doctor - I love it. I worked and worked on a knot I&#x27;d had deep behind my shoulder blade for many years, and after two-weeks of working on it, the knot released. I cannot tell you how wonderful it felt... now I&#x27;m moving on to the rest of my body, bit at a time... Quality is good, same as those you pay $10 - $20 more for...</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have had some disc issues in my back and could not find anyone strong enough to pinpoint where my back was sore.  this tool allowed me to directly put pressure where it needed to be.  It also is very useful on my neck, in-between my shoulder blades, etc.  It is great for getting the hard to reach places on your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks goofy but it is well worth it.  I had three different buddies that came over and laughed at me using it and after trying it themselves, they purchased one off Amazon within minutes.  That is a testament to the product right there.</li>
            <li> My husband recently had neck surgery and he was getting knots all over his back. In the course of 10 minutes using one of these he was able to relieve most of the pain he was feeling. They had one at where his was going to physical therapy and he actually left feeling better then when he came.</li>
            <li> Excellent for home therapy for trigger points and tight muscles.  It&#x27;s used in rehab facilities and recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> this is great for the knots and spasms in my back and neck</li>
            <li> This helps work the knots out.  Will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This thing is great, I love it! It&#x27;s perfect for getting the pressure on those hard to reach places. Now I need one for the office.</li>
            <li> Good for releasing muscle tension and hard to reach places on the back, neck and shoulders.  Helps me to get relief until I can get to my chiropractor or massage therapist.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as it looks - a massage friend really recommended this.  I wish the ball on the hooked end was larger so that the pressure you put on it is more spread out.  I just don&#x27;t love it.  It is a very good execution of the power of leverage.</li>
            <li> love this! After years of getting muscle spasms in my shoulder and only having it relieved by massage this product was a miracle for me. I can now relieve the muscle spasm myself anytime it happens. I highly recommended this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I had used this item over Thanksgiving at my friend&#x27;s house and had to order one for myself. It took a few minutes to understand how to manipulate it with my own leverage to achieve the desired effects, but I now use it every day and always keep it in arms length. I bought one for home and at work.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for getting out knots</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully. I really need this since Obamacare has eliminated massage therapy at chiro for me. Was covered before with a 30 copay- now 57 + copay. Thank you for the Thera Cane. I gave the first one I bought to my daughter.</li>
            <li> My Thera Cane arrived on time and in good shape. It works well to loosen up my muscles. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> If therapeutic massage helps you, buy this. I recommend you look at the YouTube video to understand why. I sure didn&#x27;t understand why anyone would buy it until I saw it demonstrated.</li>
            <li> I love my thera cane got this one to replace a lost one... the best self massage tool for a massage therapist!</li>
            <li> Love the thera cane, it does give a little but thats good for this application</li>
            <li> My mom has owned one of these for 20+ years, and it has definitely been an item that is fought over.  So I was finally gifted one this year for my birthday.  I use it almost every day.  Anyone that tends to get tight shoulders or a pinch in the neck or back this is the perfect item for you.  You can apply as much or as little pressure as needed!! I could go on for days about what a great product this is, but anyone should try it out for them selves!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage Therapist and don&#x27;t have time to get a massage myself. But when in need, the Thera Cane is the next best thing. I also was shocked that I received the order so quickly!</li>
            <li> This item was recommended to me by my Occupational Therapist for trigger point release.  It&#x27;s been an amazing tool to pin point the areas and apply appropriate pressure to help release the tension.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for people with chronic pain. I have used it everyday &amp; get so much relief. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the next best thing to a massage therapist! Can be used anywhere anytime for those hard to reach places along spinal column.</li>
            <li> I am plagued by trigger points and upper middle back tightness. This helps me reach those hard to reach spots to relax those muscles. Works AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This device is so simple and amazing. I&#x27;m constantly discovering new areas on my body where I can use it, from feet to neck.</li>
            <li> Great way to relieve tension on your own. Was referred by my physician and was worth the money. Would recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. This is a wonderfully unique item that helps &amp;#34;ease the pain&amp;#34; of knotted muscles. Thanks for offering this item at such a reasonable rate! I would purchase from this seller again and again!</li>
            <li> I saw this at my Chiropractors office and tried it out there then immediately I had to buy one myself. It works amazing on the specific points on my back that I wanted to get. I am excited to test it out all over my body using the techniques that came in the package with the Thera Cane.</li>
            <li> It enables one to put pressure &amp; massage on those unreachable places on your back. I wish I had not waited so long to get it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the recommendation of a physical therapist family member.  I did something to a muscle in my upper back that was causing constant pain and discomfort for over 2 months.  The doctor recommended physical therapy or a series of massages.  I did one massage and it helped but only provided temporary relief.  Not wanting to take time off work for multiple PT sessions and not wanting to pay for multiple massages, I decided to try this.  It worked great!  The cane does come with a great instruction booklet with pictures that illustrate how to target specific troublesome spots.  The instruction booklet even points out that many people when they first get it, overdo it because it feels so good.  They are warning you not to overdo it but I didn&#x27;t care - it really did feel so good - kind of that &amp;#34;hurts so good&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s not an overnight cure but using it consistently for a few minutes in the morning and in the evening provided me with some relief which then lead eventually to the knotting up muscles releasing and no longer causing daily discomfort.  Very sturdy but very lightweight.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly the tool I have need.  This helps hit all those sore spots I otherwise would not reach.  I had whiplash in both my neck and back years ago and continue to have chronic issues.  This Thera Cane is amazing at helping to alleviate the pain and tension. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> What a great feel on your back and neck. Would highly recommend this one to anyone having back problems, love it.</li>
            <li> The Thera Cane is a wonderful product - especially for those with severe back muscle knots - you can really work them out without trying to explain to someone else just where the issue is. I also got one for my sister - she loves it!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> I saw this on a rehab unit when I was a patient. I had to have one!  It is great for working out muscle knots that are impossible to reach!</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice and trying to find the pressure points and/or sore spots, usually muscles that need some pressure to relieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therecane is a wonderful tool once one learns how and when to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best tool to loosen tight muscles. I get knots in my back between the shoulder blades and i use the Thera cane to work it out and man does that ever work. It&#x27;s the best, i recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> The Thera-Cane is easy to use and is a great help at working out the &#x27;kinks&#x27; in tight muscles. The hand grips are well placed so you don&#x27;t end up straining other muscles while trying to ease discomfort elsewhere. It&#x27;s well made and comes with a very helpful and detailed instruction manual.</li>
            <li> It is not the easy tool to use. I do not pick it every day, only if my pain is above level five.</li>
            <li> I agree with the person who said they don&#x27;t make these like they used to. It has too much flex, so when I use it on my back, I can&#x27;t press as hard as I need to. I&#x27;ve talked to other Thera Cane owners who said their canes were not flexible at all. I got this to use at work because it seemed like it would be less obtrusive than the Body Back Buddy, but I am much happier with that product and will get a lot more use out of it. The BBB has more knobs and is bigger, so it&#x27;s easier to reach more trigger points.</li>
            <li> I love my Theracane. I started researching where to buy it Aftee using a friends, saw it on Amazon, and ordered it. It showed up quickly, at a good price, and we have been using it ever since. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does help relief pain from nerve damage, etc.  My bone doctor uses one.  Must be good.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday gift for my husband and he loves it and uses it a lot.  works really good for him on his back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend for neck pain, very effective for severe neck stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;I have had severe morning stiff neck pain limiting motion and range for several years. this product helps release and improve stiffness almost immediately.</li>
            <li> The Thera Cane Deep Pressure Massager is a great product and an alternative when you can&#x27;t go get a massage.  This is a product for individuals who have muscle tension and stress muscles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these for years, and thought it looked stupid.  After tearing a muscle in my back rock climbing, I was looking for anything to help loosen the muscles and release the tight spots.  This thing does the job!  I now use one at home, and have one at work that I use when taking breaks from doing CAD work.  The instructions that come with it have also been really helpful in finding the best ways to use it to address the needs of my tightest muscles at the time.</li>
            <li> Awesome at getting the knots out of my shoulders and back. I&#x27;ve really bruised myself good with this thing. Better than m&#x27;lady and her small weak hands trying to get the kinks out.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this device before. I recommend it to all my friends and family too.  Anyone who has tried it, is impressed and thinks its amazing!</li>
            <li> found out about it at physical therapy and with their recommendation, order it.  its fabulous for relieving those impossible to reach knots</li>
            <li> Works great , I love it. I would highly recommend it to anyone with pressure point pain. I wish it was collapsible for easy travel .</li>
            <li> This tool was recommended to me by my therapist for neck and shoulder pain and it works!  I have not had a headache since I started using it.,  My husband is now  after seeing how it has helped me. I love it!</li>
            <li> Thera Cane has helped me recover from an injury by relieving tight muscles that were exerting pressure on the soft tissue areas.  i have recommended it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> The Thera Cane is an amazing tool to help me massage my trigger points, I have 2 of them one for the office and one for home.  and I&#x27;ve given it as a present to a few friends who are treating themselves using the Trigger Point Therapy</li>
            <li> I have used the theracane for a few weeks now and it is so great to be able to get into muscles and work the knots out! My hips, back and shoulders feel great! And with the design, I can get into my own back and gluts to keep them supple and moving! It is a fabulous tool!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. After continued weight lifting and training hard I have developed a lot of muscle in my back. Depending on how I train I can sometimes overdo it and get knots in my back or slightly pinch a nerve. My chiropractor recommended this to me due to the fact that I kept getting tight in between my shoulder blades where I could not possibly reach. When it got here I was skeptical but excited. This thing is fantastic, it is durable and can get to so many different places where I could not possibly get. I have ended up lending it out to friends/fellow lifters and everyone says the same thing &amp;#34;WOW, this really helped&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of strength or skill to use and it seems to just apply pressure in the right areas once you find &amp;#34;the spot&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift to someone who doesn&#x27;t know how to use it.  Therefore the only issue I have with it is that it didn&#x27;t come with the instruction booklet that is described.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  Shame on the vendor who shipped the item!  I was able to pull up the manual online. [...]</li>
            <li> I was familiar with the theracane but disappointed it did not come with the instruction pamphlet. I have seen the pamphlet before and it has great pictures and various positions and uses. I was expecting that to come with the product.</li>
            <li> Helps work out the kinks.</li>
            <li> Very good tool for hitting the trigger points.</li>
            <li> Saw this at a physical therapy place, bought it for my son the gymnast, it is great for after working out or loosening up before hand.</li>
            <li> Simple, well made.  I think this requires some study to use it correctly, but it has many uses and should hold up indefinitely.  Overall a good value.</li>
            <li> This Theracane helped my shoulder tremendously!!  I love it!!!  Fast delivery too!</li>
            <li> If you have a knot and this is your new BFF</li>
            <li> This is an awesome massager that really hits the knots in my back and shoulders. It is also very simple to use.</li>
            <li> My Neurologist at the VA medical center recommended that I look into the Thera Cane to supplement my treatments for constant tension headaches and migraines. I&#x27;m not really in a position where I can afford the time or money for consistent deep-tissue massage services, so I was more than willing to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muscle relaxers and other meds can help, but I hate feeling dependent on pills to function. Even then, I tend to build a resistance to medications very quickly. The Thera Cane has helped with this by allowing me to focus pressure on specific areas to get more effective stretches of tight muscle groups. It isn&#x27;t a surefire cure, but it does help. That&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Physical Therapist.  Very helpful apparatus.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I experience chronic neck and shoulder pain and this does a great job in helping ease the pain.  I use it frequently, every day</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Great results.  BTW, the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook is perfect for pinpointing where your true trouble lies.  Sometimes a pain in one muscle is a result of a trigger point in another muscle.  And, the Thera Cane is one of the tools referenced in the Trigger Point book.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my husband who has had back pain for decades and this is the first product that he can control and massage away those knots in his entire body.  We loved it so much we shared it with our family and friends and then bought more and gave them away as gifts.  Excellent product and design!</li>
            <li> A little hard for use on (painful) trigger spot on my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and this handy tool make it easy to reach trigger points that are aching like the back of my shoulders or low back. It just takes a seconds to apply the correct amount of pressure to release the pain.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i needed. It does exactly what i wanted and my arm goes numb seldom instead of daily like it used to.</li>
            <li> It hurts soo good! Always wishing you could give yourself a backrub? Workout the knots at your own pace and pressure</li>
            <li> Great for massaging those muscles that need some attention! I have mine at work.</li>
            <li> Love it, really helps break down those knots in my neck.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this &amp; I love it. Great for people who have a bad back &amp; for me it works so well. My friends use it whenever they come over too. Love, love, love it. Need I say more? lol :)</li>
            <li> I like the Thera Cane, it works great in the shoulders however, there is a larger Thera Cane and I wish I had decided to get it.</li>
            <li> I let a friend use it here at the house because he was having some back pain. Another friend came over and automatically there were 2 converts to the TheraCane, so I bought each one a TheraCane. Now the family of one may be buying more since their kids are grown up and live away from their parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 6 for family members as well as the fold-out &amp;#34;Acupressure map of the human body&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Helps touch those &amp;#34;knotty&amp;#34; spots in my back I&#x27;m unable to reach near or under my shoulder blade and helps to work themout or at least minimize my painnn/discomfort. Recommended by my physical therapist.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for many years and use it on a regualr basis.  I loned my original to a friend and hadn&#x27;t gotten it back yet, so bought another since she used it regularly as well.  This is the perfect tool for anyone with fibromyalgia!  Great product and seller.</li>
            <li> Very handy back massage</li>
            <li> Difficult to use especially with shoulder issues.</li>
            <li> Great device for tense shoulders!  Used one at a physical therapy office and was glad to find one for a reasonable price for home use.</li>
            <li> This thing is a life saver.  Paid for itself the first time I used it.  Bye bye expensive massage therapy that does not do as good of a job.</li>
            <li> It arrived without any instructions.  I knew how to use the regular cane part, but am clueless about how to use the other protrusions.</li>
            <li> Helps with my sore shoulders. Use it every night.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tool. It helps me get to all the knots I have unknowingly worked myself up into. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this massager.  A friend of mine let me use hers and I purchased two for my sons and one for myself.  Love it!!! This item works out the tight knots in my neck, shoulders, back, and any place else that needs a massage.  I recommend this for everyone even if they don&#x27;t have aches and tight muscles but likes a massage. My one son works out with weights and he finds this a wonderful tool to work out tight and sore muscles.  I would not want to be without this to the point that I take it with me on vacation!!</li>
            <li> The Thera Cane deep pressure massager came for a good price and was delivered one day earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended by my physiotherapist and it works particularly well on the back muscles.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations! I&#x27;ve been a medical acupuncturist for the last 2 decades and still run a busy clinic in Melbourne Australia. My main line of work is in musculoskeletal medicine, so a good working knowledge of trigger points and muscle physiology is essential. Unfortunately for me, I can&#x27;t actually reach my own mid back and shoulder regions without contorting and tiring myself out in the meanwhile. Such irony!&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold during a musculoskeletal workshop the TheraCane was mentioned and was recommended by some of the leading medical acupuncturists in Australia. So I went online and bought one just to see what it was all about.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I noticed it was lightweight but sturdy. This implement does an excellent job of getting to the right spots and I can actually control my own pressure. It is well worth the money. I used to go for regular massages which can cost quite a bit and with variable results. And to be honest who&#x27;s got that much time? For me, I just hook the Theracane over the armchair, and when I sit with my family to watch tv I can treat my own neck and back at the same time! My global pain level has dropped considerably and I sleep better as well. So excited by this, I have also bought extra and gave them away as gifts.</li>
            <li> works well bought more for friends and family</li>
            <li> I seriously think every household should have this!  A most remarkable tool to ease pain/muscle issues.  My physical therapist recommended this to me and it has been wonderful for especially hard to reach areas in the back and apply the right pressure points.</li>
            <li> The cane is wonderful.  Really helps to get those kinks out...nothing else that I have tried works like this does.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try this. It was better than advertised for deep tissue relaxation. I use is all the time for my sore hips and back. Purchase and</li>
            <li> The most amazing product ever! Every home should have one of these. It has reduced so many inflamed trigger points that mobility has increased and quality of life has improved. Thank you!</li>
            <li> You are the best one to know where and how hard to attack a knot in your back.  This lovely device is perfect for that.  You get just the proper amount of pressure you want exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li> Ahhh,  it hit the spot!</li>
            <li> Good to use and comfortable, used frequently, tried another product &amp; did not like it. Would recommend to anyone who wants to buy</li>
            <li> Great product. Simple and easy to use.  Hits all the right spots. Highly recommend this to anyone with back tension.</li>
            <li> The thera cane is very good for getting at trigger points so you can release some of the tightness and muscle spasm.  I just wish it was a little more effective in letting you apply MORE pressure to the points.</li>
            <li> Best $40 I spent this year. I&#x27;ve used it at work when I&#x27;m starting to get a knot, after work-outs &amp; after long days. I&#x27;ve used it on long roadtrips when my shoulders start bunching up...love it.&lt;br /&gt;When people are over at the house watching movies, it&#x27;s constantly getting passed around.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s popular because it works.</li>
            <li> I learned about this item in therapy.  Someone (apparently an employee) had liked it well enough to take it home with them, so the therapist couldn&#x27;t show it to me but highly recommended it.  It allows you to find those trigger points that are hard to reach (between shoulder blades, etc.).  This works!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have someone to massage your back, I HIGHLY recommend the Thera Cane! Nothing in this world is absolutely perfect... but, the T.C. is close. If they used material that was a notch or two stronger (and, this is not at all to say that it&#x27;s weak... it&#x27;s just that, to get the amount of pressure I like, the cane flexes quite a bit and I could definitely see it breaking (if I&#x27;m not careful) in the next year or two). Also, either a pointy attachment or replacing one of the small ball-tips with something pointy (so a person can really dig into a tight muscle) would have been nice. Other than that, for the price this thing sturdy, and works incredibly well as it is. Again, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use it to work out Knicks in my neck and between my shoulder blades.  Loosens the knots and feel relieve for several hours.</li>
            <li> Great vender, got my order right out and on time. Worth every bit paid. I&#x27;ll use these people for anything that carry.</li>
            <li> When I leave it over the tense knot in my muscles for a long enough period of time, I find it reduces or eliminates the tightness.  Gets to those &amp;#34;hard-to-reach&amp;#34; places!  The product was just as depicted.</li>
            <li> There is nothing in the world as exciting as being able to work on knots in the shoulders by yourself.  Exactly the right spot, exactly the right amount of pressure, and with a little practice, can do it with very little arm tension.  The joy of the relief brings tears to my eyes as I type about it.  This is a must have product if you suffer from shoulder tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is sound and it is just a little bit flexible.  It&#x27;s large enough to be easy to work with, unlike that other brand that is blue, which I returned.  This one is the keeper.  I love it so much I bought one for my daughter and my mother and had it shipped to them.  I found out how awesome it is because my son left it at my house by mistake.</li>
            <li> My physical therapist recommended this for me to use to aide in relief from both muscle and nerve pain issue from an old injury...It is so easy to use and does wonders to help relieve my aches and pains. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am a physical therapist assistant and have used thera canes with some of my patients. I decided to finally order one for myself and was disappointed when it arrived to find it was made of a hard plastic and not the sturdier version of what I used in rehab. Is has some bend to it which I don&#x27;t like. I would have gladly paid a few more bucks for a sturdier version.</li>
            <li> Incredible!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This amazing product and Body back buddy&lt;br /&gt;Work! !!!&lt;br /&gt;They have relieved my pain in shoulders that was impossible from acupuncture and 4 massages a week from top strong masseuses!!</li>
            <li> This is the best tool in the trade. My physical therapist recommended it for alleviating all sorts of knots in my back and neck. It is great!</li>
            <li> I found this item rather awkward to use. I bought I because I have no one to massage&lt;br /&gt;my back and get those trigger points.( I do. Just can&#x27;t get them to do it!)  :)&lt;br /&gt;It did hit the spots, but, I don&#x27;t have the strength to work my whole back, also, I am under a lot of stress, which puts those pressure points on steroids. I was referred by my Dr to get massages or acupuncture, so, it may work well for someone who is nust achy.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful device.  My massage therapist recommended it and let me borrow hers to use for a few days.  The next day I was on line researching my own to purchase.  This is a wonderful tool and helps so much with my shoulder and neck tight spots.  I would recommend this to anyone with tight muscles.  It&#x27;s a great way to help ease the tight spots and reach heretofore unreachable trigger points in upper and mid back.  YAY</li>
            <li> The theracane I purchased is wonderful. It is very sturdy and I am able to really rip into my knots along my scapulas with ease.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever picked one of these up, you know it is a life-changing thing. If getting a massage from a friend is an automatic massage machine, then this thing is the manual version. Y&#x27;know, cuz it&#x27;s basically just a fancy stick. BUT IT IS THE BEST FANCY STICK I&#x27;VE EVER EXPERIENCED. (yes, it is an experience)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It obviously helps if you have some strength and knowledge of your own musculature, but that&#x27;s why they have a lil&#x27; book with tips and tricks. It&#x27;s like the kama sutra of ways you can use this thing. It&#x27;s pretty amaze-balls.</li>
            <li> BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO HELP SORE SPOTS FOR YEARS.  WONDERFUL.  IF YOU HAVE MUSCLE SPASMS&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED</li>
            <li> This theracane is a superb device to massage painful trigger points, especially on the back. It is easy to use, light weight to carry on travels. Massaging by it daily has helped reduce the spasm in my muscles. Also, i noted that i do not need to exert a lot of pressure with my hands. Slight movement of the cane helps provide substantial pressure on the trigger points.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this product did a huge service for people who have chronic pain and cant afford or are limited by health insurance companies, to obtain professional physical therapy.</li>
            <li> I was sad when we moved this summer, because I left my cane at the house.  But this one is new and I am glad to get it.</li>
            <li> The best invention ever made!! I work on the computer for my job and the Thera Cane is the only way I can be working on the computer for more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I have had my Theracane for a few years now.  I get this tight spot in my left upper back, around the shoulder blade area.  It&#x27;s like it radiates pain down the entire left side of my spine, all the way down to my foot.  When it&#x27;s really flared up, like when I&#x27;m feeling ill or stressed, and I dig the Theracane into it, I know when I&#x27;ve hit the spot because of the incredible pain.  But once I&#x27;ve worked on it for awhile it&#x27;s amazing how much better I will feel.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  No one in my family would be willing to massage that spot for me as hard as it needs to be massaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year and a half ago I moved and it was fun to watch the movers try to avoid this thing.  They did not want to touch it, clearly they had no idea what it was or they assumed it was a very personal item.  At the end they had packed pretty much everything for me except this.  Once they got to our new place to offload the boxes, one of them finally got up the nerve to ask what it was and my daughter showed them--then they were all passing it around and using it.  Hilarious.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if at least one of them purchased one.</li>
            <li> I use the Thera Cane for back pain in the shoulder blade area.  It enables me to reach the inflamed spot and get release from pain in between adjustments and massage.</li>
            <li> Great tool! I keep it at my bedside for use in the morning and at night.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome since you can control the intensity yourself</li>
            <li> This is the best product!  I have knots along my shoulder blades.  In the past, I would beg people to rub them for me.  No more begging.  Now I just use my TheraCane.  Buy one for yourself and buy one for someone you know who suffers from knots as well.</li>
            <li> I went to pain management through the Army and I was written a prescription for one of these but Tricare took forever to finalize it so after 2 months of waiting I just ordered it on Amazon. I can&#x27;t handle the pain I get in my back right under my left scapula and leading up to the peak of my traps. We are talking 10/10 pain. Pain that can not be touched with drugs even prescription pain rx. This cane is my savior. I plan to take the doctor ordered cane to work if I ever get it so I can have one there too!  If you have deep tissue and muscle pain that is hard to reach- buy this dang thing!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this cane.  I fell down eleven stairs a year ago and broke eleven bones and collapsed a lung.  It was hard to get the physical therapy in the amount that was needed.  I was allowed three sessions a week for a month.  This helped a lot but left many areas untouched.  The Cane became a portable therapist.  It is helping me a lot on trigger points that have needed ongoing attention.  I am very happy with the improvement in my arms and back.  It really does reduce pain levels.</li>
            <li> Very useful to reach on the parts of the back that are difficult to get to and to create the right amount of pressure because of how it can be angled</li>
            <li> Wish I had discovered the Cane a long time ago. Great for loosening those knots you get in your upper back.</li>
            <li> This device is a great invention.  It reaches those hard to reach areas and allows you to apply just the right a,punt of pressure to those painful knots.  Best investment that I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time. I was hesitant to buy but I&#x27;m only angry I didn&#x27;t purchase sooner!</li>
            <li> The thera cane is one amazing product.  It works like magic. I would and have recommended it to every one I know that has fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> We all get muscle pain or &amp;#34;cramps&amp;#34; or the like, sooner or later.  A chiropractor is not always available and you may not have someone who can massage it for you.  Enter &amp;#34;Thera Cane&amp;#34; an effective, efficient, inexpensive DIY product that you can keep around for the times you need immediate relief.  A terrific tool that most anyone can use, regardless of physical condition!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on the recommendation of my massage therapist who also does PUSH therapy.  There is a YouTube video and I highly recommend you watch it.  There is also a booklet that comes with it, but if it&#x27;s too small, there is a PDF online you can get.  It just takes practice and regular use.  Can be used on lots of areas of the body.  But, after use, I can feel the knots relieving.  Caution--don&#x27;t over use--you will hurt--a lot!</li>
            <li> Feels good when using it. Helps sore muscles relax.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go too hard initially or you&#x27;ll feel it.  Once you get used to the technique, it&#x27;s great.  Worth it just to get the knot out of my neck.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great purchase and a bang for your buck. Shipping was good as well. My fiance&#x27; is hooked on this thing. Great for hard to reach places on the body and it&#x27;s super sturdy. I would definitely recommend this. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This allows me to work out my trigger points at home.  I can&#x27;t have injections, acupuncture or a massage every day, so this is a great product for those &amp;#34;on my own&amp;#34; days.  It lets me get to those hard to reach shoulder points and pretty much anywhere else as well.  Highly recommended!</li>
