            <li>I personally loved this stud!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>over all though, great item.</li>
            <li>This is a great stud.</li>
            <li>It was perfect for me because I like the silver body jewelry better than the colored ones.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>So I was on a mission to find one that fit my lip perfectly, and this one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>The gauge size is correct and the quality of the metal and threading is good.  </li>
            <li>it was good for the price though.</li>
            <li>Cheap and works great.</li>
            <li>and I just pierced my own tragus.</li>
            <li>It was packaged nicely, which was nice because the jewelry wasn&#x27;t damaged in any way.  </li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they were happy to make it right by sending me another one.</li>
            <li>Ordered because my piercing was too big, product was a perfect fit and looks great. :)</li>
            <li>so I hope I&#x27;m able to get used to it.</li>
            <li>Looks lovely.</li>
            <li>I have not yet received the lip ring yet, but I am happy that they are willing to make it right.</li>
            <li>Piercing is so cute and the right size.</li>
            <li>Much much better packaging than the first order.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly...</li>
            <li>I cleaned it off and put it right in.</li>
            <li>16g is right</li>
            <li>And it also came very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had a problem with balls falling off once with previous jewelry, but it would be a good idea to make a habit of checking, by re-tightening the balls every now and then to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>Very simple and lovely.</li>
            <li>Perfect size it&#x27;s not too big or small..  </li>
            <li>Need one buy this it most likely won&#x27;t disappoint you.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was hoping to get</li>
            <li>The ball fits my old Labret ring and that&#x27;s all I really wanted - a shiny new ball. :)</li>
            <li>The product was delivered relatively fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It screwed on easily and stays on tight.</li>
            <li>Maybe if they raise the price a little and include 1 or 2 extra balls then it would be even better.</li>
            <li>Came a day early.</li>
            <li>Love the size, not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li>If you have a super thick, jay z lip then this is for you,</li>

            <li> If you have a super thick, jay z lip then this is for you,</li>
            <li> which is what I was looking for, the only problem is the flat back</li>
            <li> I first got my piercing, they gave me a really long bar, and it looked pretty weird.</li>
            <li> It seems high quality but the ball is a little loose.</li>
            <li> Its too long for a lip labret..</li>
            <li> TOO LONG.</li>
            <li> just too long.</li>
            <li> Some of these tend to be too long to where they brush up against your teeth or even your gums which cause annoyance and irritation but this one turned out to be just what we wanted.</li>
            <li> way way way way to long</li>
            <li> n its too long.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered from this company I was not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a barbell that has a thick flat side then this ring isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> I bought two and within a few days the ball started falling off all the time and within a week I had lost them both.</li>
            <li> is a little thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the flat side of the Labret ring that is too small and thin - to small for my lip anyways.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is quite too small.</li>
            <li> I had a regular 14 gauge liprings and this was like a needle going thru :(</li>
            <li> i peirced my tragus at home and this lookz zuper gud in it but be warned, it is very hard to get the ball on!</li>

            <li> this is gr8!!!!!!!! i peirced my tragus at home and this lookz zuper gud in it but be warned, it is very hard to get the ball on!</li>
            <li> Great product. Ordered because my piercing was too big, product was a perfect fit and looks great. :)</li>
            <li> i wear this jewelry every day. it screws on and if done properly with pliers tightly enough it wont fall off. i made that mistake on my last lip jewelry. over all though, great item.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered relatively fast. It came before the estimated delivery date. I cleaned it off and put it right in. I use it as a lebret ring and it fits perfectly! It screwed on easily and stays on tight. Very simple and lovely.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive my package on Oct. 19th, and the tracking ID said it had already been delivered. I hadn&#x27;t gotten it from the mail, and my mail carrier never recalled dropping that package off. I contacted the seller and they were happy to make it right by sending me another one. I have not yet received the lip ring yet, but I am happy that they are willing to make it right.</li>
            <li> Its too long for a lip labret.. I keep biting it all the time when i eat. If you have a super thick, jay z lip then this is for you, otherwise NOPE. TOO LONG.</li>
            <li> Just got the piercing today and I just pierced my own tragus. Piercing is so cute and the right size. Came a day early. I have ordered from this seller three times and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these and I can never get the ball to stay on.  I&#x27;ve lost two now and I&#x27;ve never had that happen before.  Maybe if they raise the price a little and include 1 or 2 extra balls then it would be even better.</li>
            <li> It came quickly... It was perfect sizing. I loved it. I would use these people again without thinking twice about it.</li>
            <li> The bar and ball are both a PERFECT size!&lt;br /&gt;When I first got my piercing, they gave me a really long bar, and it looked pretty weird. So I was on a mission to find one that fit my lip perfectly, and this one does!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> The perfect length for my monroe. It seems high quality but the ball is a little loose.</li>
            <li> I personally loved this stud! It was perfect for me because I like the silver body jewelry better than the colored ones. So overall I give this purchase 5 stars!</li>
            <li> just too long. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wayyy too short. If my cartilage swells ANY it will get infected ASAP</li>
            <li> Lost ball within days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is quite too small. Like. I had a regular 14 gauge liprings and this was like a needle going thru :(</li>
            <li> Some of these tend to be too long to where they brush up against your teeth or even your gums which cause annoyance and irritation but this one turned out to be just what we wanted.</li>
            <li> way way way way to long</li>
            <li> Perfect size it&#x27;s not too big or small..  And it also came very fast. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Cheap and works great. No issues</li>
            <li> This is a great stud. Simple which is what I was looking for, the only problem is the flat back is a little thick and heavy. Its hitting my teeth some so I hope I&#x27;m able to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I like it! It&#x27;s good. Looks lovely. blah blah blah. Need one buy this it most likely won&#x27;t disappoint you.</li>
            <li> It was packaged nicely, which was nice because the jewelry wasn&#x27;t damaged in any way.  The gauge size is correct and the quality of the metal and threading is good.  I&#x27;ve only had a problem with balls falling off once with previous jewelry, but it would be a good idea to make a habit of checking, by re-tightening the balls every now and then to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> Nice. Love the size, not too big, not too small.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. It was exactly what I was hoping to get</li>
            <li> the item worked relatively well. the only issue i had was that the ball wouldn&#x27;t stay on the bar. it was good for the price though.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, perfect size for my Monroe piercing. Very happy!</li>
            <li> My fault!! I didn&#x27;t check length n its too long.</li>
            <li> I would not buy these again. I bought two and within a few days the ball started falling off all the time and within a week I had lost them both.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered from this company I was not a happy customer. The packaging was not up to par. I decided to give them another chance so I ordered another product. I received the product in the mail 4 days after I made the purchase and this time the jewelry was in a sealed baggy. Much much better packaging than the first order.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase even though I AGAIN purchased the wrong size. 16g is right, it&#x27;s the flat side of the Labret ring that is too small and thin - to small for my lip anyways. If your looking for a barbell that has a thick flat side then this ring isn&#x27;t for you.  The ball fits my old Labret ring and that&#x27;s all I really wanted - a shiny new ball. :)</li>
