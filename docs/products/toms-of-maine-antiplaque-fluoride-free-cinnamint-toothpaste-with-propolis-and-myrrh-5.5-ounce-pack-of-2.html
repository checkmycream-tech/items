            <li>Seriously, this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Much milder flavor/taste than mint toothpaste - therefore it does not have a strong after taste affecting the flavor if you eat or drink after brushing.</li>

            <li>I am going to see the allergist today to find out what exactly causes the reaction but it is no doubt one of the ingredients in the toothpaste.</li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite for years and it still wins over bigger brands (and lesser as well).</li>
            <li>You have to brush your teeth every day you might as well enjoy it at the same time.</li>
            <li>I really like cinnamon</li>
            <li>Recommend to those who want to be more health conscious and recognize what they are brushing with on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>teeth just don&#x27;t feel as clean if I brush with a different toothpaste.</li>

            <li>Yummy replacement for the additive filled other brands.  </li>
            <li>I should also say I have never had any food allergies or allergies of any kind, outside of a little hay fever.  </li>
            <li>stop using this product if you have any new mouth soreness - this will be the culprit.</li>
            <li>Even other Tom&#x27;s flavors don&#x27;t give me the same clean and fresh feeling</li>
            <li>Thanks to all who responded about their similar experiences with the Toms of Maine Propolis &amp; Myrrh &amp;#34;Cinnamint&amp;#34; toothpaste.  </li>

            <li>Been using it sense the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Wow, I had no known allergies up until now.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the reaction was caused by the paste, so I tried it again few days later  </li>

            <li>There&#x27;s no other taste like it on the market.</li>
            <li>Too bad, tastes great, but ended up at the doctor who could not figure it out.  </li>
            <li>I would be totally in the dark as to what is going on right.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it had a strong cinnamon flavour, but instead it was slightly cinnamon and slightly clay pasty tasting.</li>

            <li> This particular toothpaste has been hard to find.</li>

            <li> The pain started off as a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and in the past 12 hours has increased to a solid &amp;#34;9.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have used Tom&#x27;s Wholecare and other toothpaste (peppermint and spearmint flavored) products for years.</li>
            <li> Loved the taste, but did not put it together until recently...burning and numb tongue, numb lips that did not go away.  </li>
            <li> No thanks. :/</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not interested in floride toothpaste, so I&#x27;m forced to go alternative routes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first use I got terrible burning, and within couple of hours I had red spots in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Fluoride has never proven to reduce cavities and has awful side effects.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this stuff - nice mild cinnamon flavor and smooth texture.  And Myrrh?  Just the thing for feeling like 3 Kings brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it had a strong cinnamon flavour, but instead it was slightly cinnamon and slightly clay pasty tasting. No thanks. :/</li>
            <li> Bought it because I didn&#x27;t want Fluoride in my toothpaste.  No taste and did not freshen breath like a regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste twice. After the first use I got terrible burning, and within couple of hours I had red spots in my mouth. In addition, my throat was swollen, and I had some difficulties breathing. The symptoms disappeared after two days - I was using another paste during this time. I wasn&#x27;t sure the reaction was caused by the paste, so I tried it again few days later  - I had the same reaction. (I used it in the evening) In the following morning the right side of my mouth was numb and swollen. I am going to see the allergist today to find out what exactly causes the reaction but it is no doubt one of the ingredients in the toothpaste. By the way, antihistamine gave some relief, so it is an allergy.</li>
            <li> my mouth is in love with this tooth paste.....</li>
            <li> Thrilled with any fluoride free product they make! Great flavor too!</li>
            <li> I am happy that I tried this flavor. I have tried others but I like this one the best-great bold taste!</li>
            <li> DANGER!  It is 3:58 am and I am writing this in EXTREME pain.  I used this toothpaste once and my tongue and lips are so inflamed I can&#x27;t sleep.  OUCH OUCH OUCH!  Thanks to all who responded about their similar experiences with the Toms of Maine Propolis &amp; Myrrh &amp;#34;Cinnamint&amp;#34; toothpaste.  I would be totally in the dark as to what is going on right.  My wife had no reaction and used this product for months.  I should also say I have never had any food allergies or allergies of any kind, outside of a little hay fever.  The pain started off as a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and in the past 12 hours has increased to a solid &amp;#34;9.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. Sadly, it&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores, which is why I often buy in bulk here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth just don&#x27;t feel as clean if I brush with a different toothpaste. Even other Tom&#x27;s flavors don&#x27;t give me the same clean and fresh feeling the Cinnamint does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s good to know that it&#x27;s fluoride free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER!!! Thanks Tom&#x27;s :)</li>
            <li> Like the taste, the contents and the effectiveness! This has been a favorite for years and it still wins over bigger brands (and lesser as well).</li>
            <li> great taste and I love the no flouride!</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with bleeding gums. I started using this toothpaste several months ago. I rotate with Pronamel. During my last cleaning, my hygienist commented that there was less bleeding. I told her about this toothpaste. She commented that she had heard that Myrrh was good for your gums. I do not know it this is true, but I was happy with this result. Hoping for the same outcome at my next visit. Love the taste of cinnamon. It is hard to find in toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Good flavor and seems to work well at cleaning</li>
            <li> This is a really great tooth paste. It is flouride free. Flouride is a nurotoxcin and I read about a power plant that had a flouride spill that ate a hole through concreet so it dosen&#x27;t prevent cavites at all. My teeth improved after i started useing this stuff and I will not be switching back to conventional tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I have used Tom&#x27;s Wholecare and other toothpaste (peppermint and spearmint flavored) products for years. There was a sale going on, and I inadvertently grabbed the Cinnamint flavor. The first week I had no issue with using the Cinnamint flavored product, but after the first week my tongue (on top, along the sides, and underneath) developed sores and my taste buds became swollen and very painful. Even the top of my mouth and cheeks developed what looked like burnt areas. It took me awhile to so isolate the cause, and I was in pain for a week. So a warning should be on the label that this formula can cause severe reactions in sensitive people. My husband has no problem with it, so he will be finishing the tube if Cinnamint and I&#x27;m back to my old flavors with no more problems. But be aware: stop using this product if you have any new mouth soreness - this will be the culprit.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive. But I&#x27;m not interested in floride toothpaste, so I&#x27;m forced to go alternative routes.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean after using, but it doesn&#x27;t burn either. It really doesn&#x27;t leave your breath fresh either - use Tom&#x27;s mouth wash after.&lt;br /&gt;Despite my negative comments I really do love this stuff, and would never go back to crest!</li>
            <li> Been using it sense the early 80&#x27;s. There&#x27;s no other taste like it on the market. You have to brush your teeth every day you might as well enjoy it at the same time.</li>
            <li> Really love the flavors and the fact they are natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Loved the taste, but did not put it together until recently...burning and numb tongue, numb lips that did not go away.  Started the day I started using this product.  Too bad, tastes great, but ended up at the doctor who could not figure it out.  Once I stopped using it, symptoms finally disappeared few days later.  Wow, I had no known allergies up until now.  Wonder how many others had this reaction?  Back to the other flavors or Jason brand.</li>
            <li> fluoride Free Toms of Maine- The Propolis and Myrrh Cinnamint tootpaste is the best. Propolis and Myrrh is good for your gums. The best thing about it is there is no neurotoxin in this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend product as more natural product ( chemical free).  Much milder flavor/taste than mint toothpaste - therefore it does not have a strong after taste affecting the flavor if you eat or drink after brushing.</li>
            <li> Yummy replacement for the additive filled other brands.  A great product with wonderful flavor and cleaning power. Recommend to those who want to be more health conscious and recognize what they are brushing with on a daily basis.  Since I&#x27;ve switched from those fluoride filled toothpastes, my annual check-ups have produced better results.</li>
            <li> my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. I really love the cinnamon taste. It leaves my mouth refreshed and clean. I recommend this product highly.  Fluoride has never proven to reduce cavities and has awful side effects.</li>
            <li> Toms has always been a good quality toothpaste</li>
            <li> I like this product for the ingredients and taste. I have used the product before and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This particular toothpaste has been hard to find. I really like cinnamon so it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
