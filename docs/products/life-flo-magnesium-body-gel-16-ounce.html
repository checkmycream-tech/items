    <ol>
            <li>taking it in liquid form is the best</li>
            <li>Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li>A great product for leg cramps!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful not to have those nightly  cramps and a good nights sleep!</li>
            <li>all around good product !</li>
            <li>oils seems to have the highest amounts in them, from what I am learning...and it works great for muscle aches...</li>
            <li>being is great since I began taking this and liq.</li>
            <li>I have fibromyalgia and someone suggested this for some of my pain and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great to relieve pain.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good shape and in good time.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased about that, but am happy to apply it to a leg that is being &#x27;dressed&#x27; in shorts.</li>
            <li>It is very authentic, from a sea bed.  </li>
            <li>Good news is it is entirely effective in providing the needed magnesium into my body.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>have been thrilled with results..</li>
            <li>You can still get laxative effective if you are ALSO taking it orally.</li>
            <li>I thought that I could make my own</li>
            <li>So, then I get into a warm shower and rinse it off.</li>
            <li>I soak her in the flakes in warm water in the tub with baking soda as well, this way she does not lose the benefit of the magnesium.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use it the day before and right before my massages</li>
            <li>Nice, cool gel that spreads well and works!</li>
            <li>like the lotion so much better the lotion wasn&#x27;t itchy.</li>
            <li>I need more about the product, do have magnesium flakes to add</li>
            <li>it is worth it for good health.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to risk getting the runs in order to have optimal magnesium levels, which always happened with any oral supplements.</li>
            <li>I think this product helps but am not 100% sure.  </li>
            <li>Goopy and irritates the skin.... doesn&#x27;t make anything feel any better either...</li>
            <li>Astonishing in fact.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am using all over and  will probably update after more usage.  </li>
            <li>My dog enjoys it and has better movement when applied, I put a moist heating pad on top</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see more improvement.</li>
            <li>would love to try the plant derived minerals, but if I&#x27;m also using this product is there a danger of toxicity?&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>learn more for your wellness and you too will find out how easy to do correct things for better pain free life...</li>
            <li>I reacted strongly to the homemade stuff.  </li>
            <li>Best to apply in the morning about a half hour to an hour before showering.</li>
            <li>Great price and lot more than other sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it looens my muscles up significantly.</li>
            <li>I  have only been applying Life-Flo Magnesium Body Gel  for three nights, but have already seen a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>You will notice the skin on your feet start to peel but for me, that&#x27;s a good thing because once I peel away the dead layers, I have these beautiful soft feet underneath.</li>
            <li>, it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The stinging does go away rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super greasy.</li>
            <li>Great for Arthritis, stiff joints etc.</li>
            <li>Firstly, well its a good product if you have trouble absorbing nutrients or have digestive issues as taking it internally is likely to result in an imbalance between calcium and magnesium since ratio has to be perfect for benefits and if you take too much internally you also get the laxative effect.</li>
            <li>Very very itchy..</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>since, I have learned of our need for greater amounts of magnesium, also I take it daily with my liq.</li>
            <li>I recommend applying 30min before you shower and forewarning, it also burns at first when you rinse it off xD.</li>
            <li>Skin feels hot when applied.  </li>
            <li>I found this, however non-oily product to be pretty much oil based.  </li>
            <li>also a large bottle.</li>
            <li>It feels good on skin, not dry gel as I expected.</li>
            <li>Even after mixing with aleo and then tried mixing with coconut oil still very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>stuff really does get into the muscles, blood through the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No where can I seem to find out how much magnesium is in this gel....</li>
            <li>Product is much stickier in consistency than anticipated.  </li>
            <li>It really helped my leg cramps</li>
            <li>so it really gets into her muscles and spine.</li>
            <li>; HOW MUCH IS A GENEROUS AMOUNT?&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Bought this from wholefoods and It is really greasy, does not dry quickly, stains things and burns like hell.</li>
            <li>was hoping for more by the previous reviews</li>
            <li>After a month of topical application, I feel better overall.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Topical magnesium is very easily absorbed for those of us who have problems with the oral variety.  </li>
            <li>In the South,where I live, it is rare to have really low humidity unless it is mid-winter, so I resolve not to purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Be well and live well...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>Lastly it did seem to give a strange numbing sensation after it full dried and absorbed on my arms on my test run, along with more energy and instant relief to muscle knots.</li>
            <li>I purchased this only because it was the first one I saw online.  </li>
            <li>it will be absorbed into your skin in that time frame, no need to let is dry, again directions not given to you aid....</li>
            <li>Because it is concentrated, it may burn slightly if you rub more than needed into the same area.  </li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference (I am using Magnesium topically to address some heart issues.)</li>
            <li>Trans-dermally will only absorb as much as the body needs.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it but suggest starting out sparingly to see how much you can use and how often without itching.</li>
            <li>I bought this at my local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to help reduce pain from a low back injury, but as time went on</li>
            <li>the magnesium lays down the ability for Vit. D. to be taken in and absorbed...</li>
            <li>soon new research will give larger amounts we need to be taking from what I have read..</li>
            <li>The first time i applied Life-Flo Magnesium Body Gel, I was surprised at the moisture in the product, because one of the reasons I grew to dislike the Magnesium spray oil was that it was messy</li>
            <li>really prefer Epsom salts but is hard to find  it pure in a cream..</li>
            <li>I did not buy this on amazon, but at a local health supplement store for almost half as much.</li>
            <li>It does make my hands itch a little but not as much as the oil.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It does make my hands itch a little but not as much as the oil.</li>
            <li> And, though it was supposed to dry and leave a salt deposit, I found that it did not dry unless the atmosphere had low humidity.</li>
            <li> It does burn a little on sensitive areas and if you use a lot of it you may get diarrhea because magnesium is a laxative.</li>
            <li> 2ndly nearly all the oil/gel product reviews report the same burning stinging, intensity varies on individual and possibly how deficient you are.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it for other aches and pains, with similar effect to an epson salt bath.</li>
            <li> I have oil, gel and cream of another brand and amounts are listed clearly on each one, why not share, not sure I would re-purchase since what I am buying is not listed.</li>
            <li> and my skin would get very dry.  </li>
            <li> it did help a little but not enough to buy this product again</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how long my skin feels sticky from this gel, but if it helps with erratic heart issues, it&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> check out other sources</li>
            <li> My skin stung and small red spots appeared.</li>
            <li> This product helps to reduce the pain associated with leg cramping, due to lack of magnesium.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if I use it to often my skin starts itching.  </li>
            <li> The gel goes on and has a slight greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Magnesium \\&quot;Oil\\&quot; spray, but found it too messy and drying.  </li>
            <li> However, I do have sensitive skin, I am very deficient</li>
            <li> Overdosing on magnesium can cause weak muscles, other problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure about this product.</li>
            <li> I apply this topically to my Senior dog who is lame and getting therapy.</li>
            <li> sticky and hard to use</li>
            <li> have eye twitches, charley horses, and anxiety which at least tells me I need</li>
            <li> I was shocked that magnesium is required for over 300 metabolic functions, and that doctors often prescribe drugs for symptoms that are actually magnesium deficiency.</li>
            <li> My experience using it was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Oily and if skin broken will burn.</li>
            <li> Leaves a salty residue that is difficult to even wash off with water.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> i am very disappointed</li>
            <li> Works, but it&#x27;s awfully sticky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Very very itchy.. Even after mixing with aleo and then tried mixing with coconut oil still very itchy.&lt;br /&gt;I like the lotion so much better the lotion wasn&#x27;t itchy.</li>
            <li> I tried the Magnesium \\&quot;Oil\\&quot; spray, but found it too messy and drying.  And it didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference (I am using Magnesium topically to address some heart issues.) The first time i applied Life-Flo Magnesium Body Gel, I was surprised at the moisture in the product, because one of the reasons I grew to dislike the Magnesium spray oil was that it was messy and my skin would get very dry.

            <li> Works, but it&#x27;s awfully sticky.  Will try the lotion next time</li>
            <li> Relaxes my muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is also a large bottle. Great price and lot more than other sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No chemicals! Yippie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put in a glass container to avoid the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I been using Epsom salts, magnesium creams I have not had a cavity in over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really does get into the muscles, blood through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really prefer Epsom salts but is hard to find  it pure in a cream..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried another brand of Magnesium, a oil; it seemed to cause a overdose. Overdosing on magnesium can cause weak muscles, other problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Really works!</li>
            <li> No where can I seem to find out how much magnesium is in this gel....I have oil, gel and cream of another brand and amounts are listed clearly on each one, why not share, not sure I would re-purchase since what I am buying is not listed. I need more about the product, do have magnesium flakes to add but, don&#x27;t care for mystery buys, even though it was lower priced, should be on label somewhere and it is not, checked site and not listed there either.....that is a turn off for me...wipe off excess amounts after 20 minutes....it will be absorbed into your skin in that time frame, no need to let is dry, again directions not given to you aid.... oils seems to have the highest amounts in them, from what I am learning...and it works great for muscle aches...since, I have learned of our need for greater amounts of magnesium, also I take it daily with my liq. Vit. D....the magnesium lays down the ability for Vit. D. to be taken in and absorbed...taking it in liquid form is the best and I have had no troubles whatsoever...also no aches and pains and a feeling of well being is great since I began taking this and liq.Vit.D...Senior, so have been around awhile.......2mL.Liq. magnesium daily in my smoothie with 10,000IU of liquid vit.D. these two are troopers for fighting metabolic syndrome of heart, blood pressure, and diabetes... then also calms inflammation in our bodies which is at the root of every illness.......learn more for your wellness and you too will find out how easy to do correct things for better pain free life... have been thrilled with results..soon new research will give larger amounts we need to be taking from what I have read.. the amounts now are very low, infact to low.....check out other sources it is worth it for good health. Be well and live well...</li>
            <li> all around good product !</li>
            <li> It does burn a little on sensitive areas and if you use a lot of it you may get diarrhea because magnesium is a laxative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to risk getting the runs in order to have optimal magnesium levels, which always happened with any oral supplements. I was shocked that magnesium is required for over 300 metabolic functions, and that doctors often prescribe drugs for symptoms that are actually magnesium deficiency. After a month of topical application, I feel better overall.</li>
            <li> not sure about this product. it leaves a tingling  bother some feeling after applying</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it the day before and right before my massages and it looens my muscles up significantly.</li>
            <li> This product is brine from an ancient sea. My experience using it was not pleasant. My skin stung and small red spots appeared. And, though it was supposed to dry and leave a salt deposit, I found that it did not dry unless the atmosphere had low humidity. In the South,where I live, it is rare to have really low humidity unless it is mid-winter, so I resolve not to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this from wholefoods and It is really greasy, does not dry quickly, stains things and burns like hell. However, I do have sensitive skin, I am very deficient and I used liberally. I recommend applying 30min before you shower and forewarning, it also burns at first when you rinse it off xD. So at this point your probably asking yourself...why would I want to submit myself to such torture? Firstly, well its a good product if you have trouble absorbing nutrients or have digestive issues as taking it internally is likely to result in an imbalance between calcium and magnesium since ratio has to be perfect for benefits and if you take too much internally you also get the laxative effect. You can still get laxative effective if you are ALSO taking it orally. Trans-dermally will only absorb as much as the body needs. 2ndly nearly all the oil/gel product reviews report the same burning stinging, intensity varies on individual and possibly how deficient you are. (don&#x27;t use on areas that are already irritated) Lastly it did seem to give a strange numbing sensation after it full dried and absorbed on my arms on my test run, along with more energy and instant relief to muscle knots.</li>
            <li> I had both my Achilles damaged by one dose of an antibiotic.  It&#x27;s quite horrible and it&#x27;s been over 9 months.  I think this product helps but am not 100% sure.  My only complaint is that if I use it to often my skin starts itching.  I would recommend it but suggest starting out sparingly to see how much you can use and how often without itching.</li>
            <li> This product helps to reduce the pain associated with leg cramping, due to lack of magnesium.  I found this, however non-oily product to be pretty much oil based.  It does do the job and I am pleased about that, but am happy to apply it to a leg that is being &#x27;dressed&#x27; in shorts.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good shape and in good time.  Well-packaged.  Product is much stickier in consistency than anticipated.  Skin feels hot when applied.  Leaves a salty residue that is difficult to even wash off with water.</li>
            <li> i guess i was expecting the pain to go away it didnt it did help a little but not enough to buy this product again i am very disappointed was hoping for more by the previous reviews</li>
            <li> Goopy and irritates the skin.... doesn&#x27;t make anything feel any better either... save your money folks</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this product. Each time I have a pain in my body I just grab the bottle and apply wherever the pain is, it goes away fairly quickly. I keep it next to my bed in case I wake up with a cramp. I also apply it to the bottom of my feet before bed and it helps me sleep. You will notice the skin on your feet start to peel but for me, that&#x27;s a good thing because once I peel away the dead layers, I have these beautiful soft feet underneath. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Topical magnesium is very easily absorbed for those of us who have problems with the oral variety.  I purchased this only because it was the first one I saw online.  The gel goes on and has a slight greasy feel.  Almost like it has moisturizer in it.  It is very authentic, from a sea bed.  Because it is concentrated, it may burn slightly if you rub more than needed into the same area.  The stinging does go away rather quickly.  I gave this product a 4 star  because of the stinging sensation, and the fact that it does not totally absorb into the skin but leaves a moisturizing effect.  I tend to rub it onto my lower legs where it won&#x27;t come off on my clothing.  Good news is it is entirely effective in providing the needed magnesium into my body.</li>
            <li> It really helped my leg cramps</li>
            <li> It is a miracle. My pain is gone!</li>
            <li> Seems to alleviate knee pain I&#x27;ve had after two surgeries.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. Astonishing in fact.</li>
            <li> I thought that I could make my own but I was wrong.  This has not given me the reaction that I had with the magnesium oil that I made with magnesium flakes.  I reacted strongly to the homemade stuff.  It made my skin itch and I had a reaction of &amp;#34;depression&amp;#34; after using my homemade oil.  (has any one else had this sort of reaction?  I was almost in tears after using)  Anyway, I am using all over and  will probably update after more usage.  I did not buy this on amazon, but at a local health supplement store for almost half as much.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I use it</li>
            <li> After using this get three times on his back, my husband believes that it does indeed ease his pain. Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> sticky and hard to use</li>
            <li> This oil works well on my muscle spasms.I have chronic spasms since 1980&lt;br /&gt;Have had back surgeries, epidurals,acupuncture,chiropractic care,k laser treatments and massive amounts of physical therapy.Nothing has ever helped me with the spasms. This does! Only,I am finding that I get nauseous ten minutes after I apply it. So, then I get into a warm shower and rinse it off.It absorbs into the skin,and the excess is not needed anyway.But, if I don&#x27;t rinse it,the nausea gets severe. Has anyone else had this experience?</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and someone suggested this for some of my pain and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great for Arthritis, stiff joints etc. I apply this topically to my Senior dog who is lame and getting therapy. Dogs do not have a placebo affect. It does make my hands itch a little but not as much as the oil. I like their Flakes for the bathtub as well. It has helped my hands, neck, back with aches n severe pain in my neck as well. My dog enjoys it and has better movement when applied, I put a moist heating pad on top so it really gets into her muscles and spine. It will stay oily on their coat so a bath will be needed in 24 - 48 hours....I soak her in the flakes in warm water in the tub with baking soda as well, this way she does not lose the benefit of the magnesium.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local Whole Foods. At first it seemed to help reduce pain from a low back injury, but as time went on I didn&#x27;t see more improvement. I sometimes use it for other aches and pains, with similar effect to an epson salt bath. It can sting going on for about 20 minutes, although not always. I used to put it on at night but it does remain sticky. Best to apply in the morning about a half hour to an hour before showering.</li>
            <li> I  have only been applying Life-Flo Magnesium Body Gel  for three nights, but have already seen a remarkable improvement. Wonderful not to have those nightly  cramps and a good nights sleep! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A great product for leg cramps!  We use it at night on our legs to prevent cramps.  Nice, cool gel that spreads well and works!</li>
            <li> Great to relieve pain. Oily and if skin broken will burn.</li>
            <li> My Doctor suggested that I try this product to help relieve my leg cramps at night. I took his advice and bought a bottle of Life-Flo Magnesium Body gel and it has worked for me in stopping my leg cramps.</li>
            <li> Super greasy. Gave it away. I&#x27;ll stick with the oil.</li>
            <li> I just got it. Gave it 5 stars because of the feel of it. It feels good on skin, not dry gel as I expected. Hoping it works. I have a question...directions say, &amp;#34; put on a generous amount.&amp;#34; HOW MUCH IS A GENEROUS AMOUNT?&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t there a toxicity problem?&lt;br /&gt;I would love to try the plant derived minerals, but if I&#x27;m also using this product is there a danger of toxicity?&lt;br /&gt;They say diarrhea is a toxic symptom, but ONLY if you take it orally.&lt;br /&gt;I have eye twitches, charley horses, and anxiety which at least tells me I need magnesium.&lt;br /&gt;I would appreciate hearing if anyone understands the dose.</li>
