            <li>I love using the wipes as opposed to a washcloth for my face.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better</li>
            <li>Age Defying towelettes for years and love them.</li>
            <li>I have used them for a couple of years now and love them.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years and it has kept my skin beautiful and soft.  </li>
            <li>They were easy, convenient and nearby in my nightstand.</li>
            <li>They make it so easy to remove my make up at night.  </li>
            <li>Age Defyng Cloths are hands down the best!</li>
            <li>Leaves face smooth and soft;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>They do a good job removing makeup and leaving my face clean, soft and moist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, I believe I could recommend these towelettes for those occasions when you need to clean a make-up free face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I have to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my face after wiping it clean.  </li>
            <li>The cloths do get my face clean.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Pond&#x27;s Clean Sweep,</li>
            <li>They are gentle yet very effective in keeping skin clear</li>
            <li>This would include a quick after work out clean up, when sweat needs to be eliminated (from any body part), but there is no time for a shower.</li>
            <li>I use these towelettes on my face and they help keep my skin clean and fresh and  no breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I do however switch between the different ponds facial wipes: classing, age renewing, morning and evening, and they all are great!</li>
            <li>I believe they must have been stored somewhere too hot, but I could not use them!</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find these on Amazon, I cannot find them anywhere locally.     </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have a funny smell.  </li>

            <li>Ponds clean sweep age defying wet cleansing towelettes really works, I bought it for my wife, but turn around and tried it for myself and it does exactly what it will do, smooth your skin.</li>
            <li>plus this is a simple way to get your skin  looking tighter  and more vibrant .</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The age-defying removes my make-up very well</li>
            <li>Defying towelettes were my absolute must have for face and neck care.  </li>
            <li>Despite other reviewers&#x27; comments, I find that they do remove makeup, including mascara, and leave skin feeling smooth and clean but never dry.</li>
            <li>Ponds did an OK job removing oil from a make up free face, but did a poor job removing make</li>
            <li>Definitely much better than any other wipe I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have been searching for towelettes which would be strong enough to remove foundation and waterproof mascara, but gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li>I have found this item hard to find in town, and was pleased to  find that Amazon had them.</li>
            <li>They work very well; they stay moist in the wrapper and are big enough to wipe off my whole face.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these do not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally I run out and try, really try, to give another brand a try, but</li>
            <li>My face has been broken out since and doesn&#x27;t look near as smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>Enough that I paid the higher price when I couldn&#x27;t find them locally</li>
            <li>All I can say is that I&#x27;ve been using ponds everyday for years and they are better than any other brand.  </li>

            <li> The second day I used it on my face, my skin became red and rough and sore.  </li>
            <li> Other brands have left an oily film or have made my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was using the Ponds regular towelettes and found them to be hard on my skin.  </li>
            <li> After receiving this product, I opened them that night to cleanse my face and they had such a sour smell!  </li>
            <li> The cloth is soft and not in the least bit abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised to see the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Small size (six by seven inches); uncomfortable to handle in the palm of your hand; also, if you are trying to remove full make up (foundation, eyes, lipstick), one cloth is not enough, you need two, at least;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Though does not dry out face skin, it does dry out the delicate skin around the eyes;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have been using these in combination with other skin care for over a year.</li>
            <li> and I believe has fewer wrinkles and lines when I am using these wipes as opposed to washing my face with other wipes or cleansers.</li>
            <li> I was sometimes lazy about washing my face before going to bed and started using them for such nights when I would fall asleep before the nightly toilette.</li>
            <li> I have used them for years and noticed that they had stopped making them, so I started using other products.</li>
            <li> Now I use them at my desk job to freshen up mid-day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re hard to find, especially since they&#x27;re reportedly being discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding them in any store</li>
            <li> When I called the company to find out why they discontinued this product, I was told there really wasn&#x27;t a need for it and sales were poor!!  </li>
            <li> I do not know what I will do without them since Ponds has decided to market the silly lemon towelettes, and the same old stuff everyone else has, very sad.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find them in stores</li>
            <li> Despite the claim, it does NOT remove waterproof mascara; in fact, it is very difficult to remove make up using this product; after rubbing hard with two cloths, I ran a ball soaked in astringent over my face and the amount of make up left behind was unacceptable;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these towelettes have become hard to find in stores, so please keep providing them Amazon.</li>
            <li> I hate to wash my face in the evenings (you end up going to bed with wet hair).</li>
            <li> They remove make-up, daily grim and work on the lines and spots while doing it!  </li>
            <li> I will be very sad when they run out of these wipes.&lt;br /&gt;CVS</li>
            <li> Too bad that they no longer make it.</li>

            <li> I was so glad to find these on Amazon, I cannot find them anywhere locally.     Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to everything and I have very sensitive skin.  These cloths do not aggravate my sensitivities.  They work very well; they stay moist in the wrapper and are big enough to wipe off my whole face.  The cloth is soft and not in the least bit abrasive.  They don&#x27;t have a funny smell.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel coated with chemicals after I use a cloth.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my face after wiping it clean.  The cloths do get my face clean.  I am pleased with this product and would buy it again.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend these cloths to a friend.</li>
            <li> We all know that retinol can make a difference on facial skin. This product has retinol in it and IT WORKS. If you are  fifty plus this is a simple way to get your skin  looking tighter  and more vibrant . I have used this for five years but didn&#x27;t for about 6 months when I couldn&#x27;t find it locally. Thankfully I found it on line. My face showed the difference- great product!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have been using these for several years and I think they re the best cleansing cloth on the market. It is hard to find them in stores so I was very happy to find them available through Amazon.  The size is big enough to cleanse my face of all make up including mascara. They are gentle yet very effective in keeping skin clear and I believe that they help to minimize signs of aging.I use them on my neck as well.   I am surprised to see the negative reviews.I have tried so many brands and this is the only one I will use. Other brands have left an oily film or have made my skin breakout. Age Defyng Cloths are hands down the best!</li>
            <li> I have been using these in combination with other skin care for over a year. I love using the wipes as opposed to a washcloth for my face. My skin looks better and I believe has fewer wrinkles and lines when I am using these wipes as opposed to washing my face with other wipes or cleansers. Definitely much better than any other wipe I have tried so far. I have sensitive skin and these do not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was using the Ponds regular towelettes and found them to be hard on my skin.  I switched to the Age-Defying towelettes and happy that I did.  The age-defying removes my make-up very well and I can even take off my mascara without any problems. They leave my skin feeling soft.  I will be purchasing the Age-defying towelettes from now on.</li>
            <li> After receiving this product, I opened them that night to cleanse my face and they had such a sour smell!  I believe they must have been stored somewhere too hot, but I could not use them!</li>
            <li> When I called the company to find out why they discontinued this product, I was told there really wasn&#x27;t a need for it and sales were poor!!  Can you believe that.  This country is obsessed with age defying products and Ponds stops making one of the best.  I have used this product for years and my face truly does look younger than my sixty-four years.  I will be very sad when they run out of these wipes.&lt;br /&gt;CVS SELLS THEIR OWN BRAND OF THIS AND IT&#x27;S JUST AS WONDERFUL!!!!!! GET IT BEFORE THEY DISCONTINUE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Pond&#x27;s Clean Sweep, Age Defying towelettes for years and love them. I was sometimes lazy about washing my face before going to bed and started using them for such nights when I would fall asleep before the nightly toilette. They were easy, convenient and nearby in my nightstand. Despite other reviewers&#x27; comments, I find that they do remove makeup, including mascara, and leave skin feeling smooth and clean but never dry. Unfortunately, these towelettes have become hard to find in stores, so please keep providing them Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used these once or twice a week for years, and there is a noticeable difference in my skin.  Younger, tighter, smaller pores.  Enough that I paid the higher price when I couldn&#x27;t find them locally and they were on Amazon.  Yet I don&#x27;t know that I can pay $50+.</li>
            <li> Ponds clean sweep age defying wet cleansing towelettes really works, I bought it for my wife, but turn around and tried it for myself and it does exactly what it will do, smooth your skin.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these wipes for such a great price.  I was having trouble finding them in any store so I looked online and found them on Amazon.  They make it so easy to remove my make up at night.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about 4 months and I definitely notice a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these locally anymore, so was glad to find them on Amazon. I&#x27;m told Ponds has stopped making them.  I hope if enough people order them on Amazon they will continue to make them.  I have used them for a couple of years now and love them.  They do a good job removing makeup and leaving my face clean, soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Ponds Age Defying towelettes were my absolute must have for face and neck care.  They remove make-up, daily grim and work on the lines and spots while doing it!  I do not know what I will do without them since Ponds has decided to market the silly lemon towelettes, and the same old stuff everyone else has, very sad.</li>

            <li> All I can say is that I&#x27;ve been using ponds everyday for years and they are better than any other brand.  Occasionally I run out and try, really try, to give another brand a try, but they never as good! I&#x27;ve tried them all. I do however switch between the different ponds facial wipes: classing, age renewing, morning and evening, and they all are great!</li>
            <li> These are great for throwing in a briefcase or bag, and using mid-day to perk up your complexion and state of mind!  I&#x27;ve been using them about 2 years - started when I had a job involving a lot of time outside and would use them to wipe my face and neck during the day.  Now I use them at my desk job to freshen up mid-day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re hard to find, especially since they&#x27;re reportedly being discontinued.  May have to stock up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product every evening for some years and now I cannot find it on drug store shelves.  Amazon is providing a service as this product has been a great help for my skin..................</li>
            <li> I abosolutely loves the Ponds age defying towelettes!!! I have used them for years and noticed that they had stopped making them, so I started using other products. My face has been broken out since and doesn&#x27;t look near as smooth and fresh. Thank goodness I was able to find them on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I hate to wash my face in the evenings (you end up going to bed with wet hair). Therefore, I have been searching for towelettes which would be strong enough to remove foundation and waterproof mascara, but gentle enough for my sensitive skin. Even though Pond&#x27;s was my third towelette brand, my search continues. Ponds did an OK job removing oil from a make up free face, but did a poor job removing make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves face smooth and soft;&lt;br /&gt;- Smells pleasantly;&lt;br /&gt;- As promissed, did not interfere with my contact lenses;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Small size (six by seven inches); uncomfortable to handle in the palm of your hand; also, if you are trying to remove full make up (foundation, eyes, lipstick), one cloth is not enough, you need two, at least;&lt;br /&gt;- Despite the claim, it does NOT remove waterproof mascara; in fact, it is very difficult to remove make up using this product; after rubbing hard with two cloths, I ran a ball soaked in astringent over my face and the amount of make up left behind was unacceptable;&lt;br /&gt;- Though does not dry out face skin, it does dry out the delicate skin around the eyes;&lt;br /&gt;- Despite promisses of younger looking skin after a week&#x27;s use, I saw no visible change in the appearance of my skin;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I believe I could recommend these towelettes for those occasions when you need to clean a make-up free face. This would include a quick after work out clean up, when sweat needs to be eliminated (from any body part), but there is no time for a shower. Or, for those mornings when you have to join the company before there is time for a shower. However, if you need wet cloths that can clean AND effectively remove make up, alas, these are not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search continues...</li>
            <li> CVS has a knock off of this product which is still available and is great. Same name just CVS instead of Ponds!!</li>
            <li> Everybody can&#x27;t use Retinol. I ordered this product a year ago.  When I first put it on my face I could see the difference.  I really loved the way it made my skin look.  The second day I used it on my face, my skin became red and rough and sore.  I knew it was the Retinol.  I gave the rest of the package to a relative.  She has had no problems with it and likes it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it has kept my skin beautiful and soft.  Too bad that they no longer make it.</li>
