            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and</li>
            <li>The best flat iron out there.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and glides nicely.</li>
            <li>But the best part is that it was tested in Florida for zones with high humidity to ensure hair would STAY straight, so for those of us in Kentucky hair isn&#x27;t ruined in 2.5 minutes after 45 of preparation.</li>
            <li>It doesnt smooth over the hair easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>

            <li>This flat iron works great</li>
            <li>I have had this product for a year now at least and it has been great!</li>
            <li>Good working flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is a good flat irk, but it does truly alter the type of hair you have.  </li>
            <li>If you need a good flat iron this is a must buy.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and makes hair perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>So, for me, it was good, but I don&#x27;t really have really coarse and curly hair..</li>
            <li>but the money was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I used the 450 setting and it didn&#x27;t fry my hair but made it super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes getting ready in the morning fast and easy.</li>
            <li>it heats up super fast as well.  </li>
            <li>but i can definitely tell it does a lot better job than my CHI did .</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is nice that you don&#x27;t bump them while straightening, but if you want to change your temp, you are reaching very near the very hot plates), but that&#x27;s not too much of an issue if you are careful.</li>
            <li>I have many flat irons and very curly think hair.  </li>
            <li>This straightener is exactly as advertised, and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Okay so after going through Paul Mitchell, Chi, Conair, and basically every flat iron ever created I FINALLY found one that is true to it&#x27;s word.</li>
            <li>I have gotten rid of most of my other irons and pretty much use this one exclusively.  </li>
            <li>The hair turns out smooth and remains straight till the next day.  </li>
            <li>For an $85 price tag, I expected much more and will be returning it.</li>
            <li>I have used it with products protecting y hair, but others that have used it said it burned their hair straight and made it smell.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very shiney and straight after one stroke.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s straight</li>
            <li>This flat iron is fantastic.</li>
            <li>amazing for my incredibly thick hair.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the new One Stroke.  </li>
            <li>It stays clean and it does not ever snag my hair like other straighteners sometimes do.</li>
            <li>keeps it straight despite the weather (I live in South Florida so this used to be a constant issue) and which doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.  </li>
            <li>It appears that it actually burns the hair straight and leaves an odor of burned hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly with auto shut down.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair straight for up to 3days with minimal touch up.</li>
            <li>(and I think as low as 250 for those of you with sensitive hair).</li>
            <li>She threw her previous flat iron out to the curb after her first use of the Ion One Stroke.</li>
            <li>I frizzed just as much in humidity as I did with my previous $45 straightener and it DOES NOT heat to 450 degrees (which may be why it doesn&#x27;t straighten in one stroke).</li>

            <li> My wife loves the new One Stroke.  She threw her previous flat iron out to the curb after her first use of the Ion One Stroke.</li>
            <li> Good working flat iron. Does what is says. Keeps hair straight for up to 3days with minimal touch up. Heats quickly with auto shut down.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and a recommendation in Good Housekeeping magazine. It has an odd design (heat and power buttons are on the inside. It is nice that you don&#x27;t bump them while straightening, but if you want to change your temp, you are reaching very near the very hot plates), but that&#x27;s not too much of an issue if you are careful. The problem is it does not straighten my hair in one stroke or leave it sealed and shiny. I frizzed just as much in humidity as I did with my previous $45 straightener and it DOES NOT heat to 450 degrees (which may be why it doesn&#x27;t straighten in one stroke). I have a heat sensor gun and the hottest it ever gets is 403 degrees. For an $85 price tag, I expected much more and will be returning it.</li>
            <li> This is a good flat irk, but it does truly alter the type of hair you have.  It appears that it actually burns the hair straight and leaves an odor of burned hair.  I have used it with products protecting y hair, but others that have used it said it burned their hair straight and made it smell.  So, for me, it was good, but I don&#x27;t really have really coarse and curly hair..</li>
            <li> This flat iron is fantastic. It heats up in seconds, evenly and it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean. If you need a good flat iron this is a must buy.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a year now at least and it has been great! I really like it and it works great. It stays clean and it does not ever snag my hair like other straighteners sometimes do. I would recommend this. It does not take me as long to straighten my hair with this flat iron as compared to others I have used.</li>
            <li> Okay so after going through Paul Mitchell, Chi, Conair, and basically every flat iron ever created I FINALLY found one that is true to it&#x27;s word. I went out on a limb and bought it based on recent reviews and I LOVE it. Temperatures are button controlled and go up to 450 (and I think as low as 250 for those of you with sensitive hair). It takes less that 5 minutes to heat up and STAYS HEATED. I didn&#x27;t have to do 1 section, wait for it to reheat, and do another. It took 2 strokes to flat iron the waviest parts of my hair, and I finished all of my curly thick mane in 10 minutes. I used the 450 setting and it didn&#x27;t fry my hair but made it super soft and smooth. But the best part is that it was tested in Florida for zones with high humidity to ensure hair would STAY straight, so for those of us in Kentucky hair isn&#x27;t ruined in 2.5 minutes after 45 of preparation. I even steamed up my bathroom to test it and it didn&#x27;t make my hair a hot mess or mess it up at all. I will swear by this, and continue to inform my friends of the durability/endurance of this flat iron. It was sort of expensive but the money was well worth it. Life saver!</li>
            <li> Love,Love,Love It....</li>
            <li> The on/off button is inside the handle so it can&#x27;t snap off. It heats up quickly and glides nicely. The weight is also light. I bough tit because of the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.</li>
            <li> Worst flat iron.  It would appear to be smooth on the hair, but it burned my hair badly even when on a lower temp setting.  It doesnt smooth over the hair easily.  I just dont care for it and I feel I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Chi for years, this one is much better. Don&#x27;t need to go over the same sections anymore. Faster results!</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great and I have had a lot of flat irons.  I&#x27;ve tried CHI, revlon, babyliss, and others that I can&#x27;t even remember the names of.  This iron surpasses them all.  It leaves my hair smooth and shiny in one pass.  It makes getting ready in the morning fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in November 2013. Unfortunately it stopped working after about 5 months. I just couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on anymore. I was really disappointed as I LOVED this straightener. Was the only one that worked on my thick, wavy and frizzy hair. I have tried others since and none compare but I am nervous to purchase again in fear it will stop working. Wish I could give it five stars! I will keep looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once but i can definitely tell it does a lot better job than my CHI did . I have very thick wavy hair and this gets hotter than my CHI faster.</li>
            <li> This works SO well - I use it almost daily.  A little pricey but hopefully it&#x27;ll last for a few years.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It heats up very quickly and makes hair perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> Best straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Love the auto-shut off feature.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing to ever happen to curly hair.  The hair turns out smooth and remains straight till the next day.  This is the best styling tool I have purchased in years!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted. Cut my straightening time from 20 minutes to 5.  it heats up super fast as well.  The only complaint I had was with the seller, not the product. I ordered the 1 1/2 inch and they sent the 1 inch.</li>
            <li> I have many flat irons and very curly think hair.  This Iron Works!!  I have gotten rid of most of my other irons and pretty much use this one exclusively.  It is a great product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair straightener I have ever owned/used. I get salon quality hair with this thing many times over, for just $80.</li>
            <li> This straightener is exactly as advertised, and works very well.  Leaves my hair very shiney and straight after one stroke. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Just what I was hoping it was, and more!! Love it!  Cut my time in half, compared to my &#x27;other&#x27;brand iron.</li>
            <li> best straightener ive owned. amazing for my incredibly thick hair. Has 5 levels of heat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for 3 years and it still works great.  I have a thick curly Jewfro and this is the only iron I&#x27;ve used which gets it straight, keeps it straight despite the weather (I live in South Florida so this used to be a constant issue) and which doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.  Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used them all (Chi, FHI, etc.)  A tip of the hat!</li>
            <li> The best flat iron out there.  I know, I have tried all of them.  One stroke and it&#x27;s straight, it is AWESOME.  LOVE LOVE LOVE my iron.</li>
