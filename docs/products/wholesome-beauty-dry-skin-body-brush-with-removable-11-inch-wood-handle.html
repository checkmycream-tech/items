            <li>Dry skin brushing is very popular these days as a detox method, but I’m not too up on that.  </li>

            <li>This is a very high quality, sturdy brush, one that I’ve seen at a considerably higher price point elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I am new to dry brushing, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Natural bristles, the wood handle which converts from long to palm use, and quality that exceeded all expectations - I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the brush and the dry brushing process.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, but I found that after a few days I could use a bit more pressure and felt fine.  </li>
            <li>The reviews I read really helped.  </li>
            <li>We really like them.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The removable handle is very convenient.</li>
            <li>It is gently invigorating to my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>I have never had skin that felt so soft and good as it circulates the blood and gets rid of dead skin helps with celulite (sp) too!</li>
            <li>I appreciated that since this was a new product for me to try.</li>
            <li>High quality and removeable brush.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy dry brushing!</li>
            <li>This brush is gentle and easy to hold-since it has both the long handle and strap on the back of the brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any type of dry skin brush, and I really like it!  </li>
            <li>Body brushing is new to me</li>
            <li>The head of has perfect bristles as far as being not to stiff and stiff enough.</li>
            <li>Smaller head but nice, stiff bristles...</li>
            <li>The firmness of the bristles is just right for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>BUT WOW, externally you can certainly feel the difference almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Soft &#x3D;</li>
            <li>thing that is recommended is that one use a natural bristle brush,</li>
            <li>/&gt;►  Natural Bristle&lt;</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a quality product.  </li>
            <li>Arrived early and is everything it promises to be.</li>
            <li>The optional handle makes brushing hard to reach places very accessible.</li>
            <li>does the job, especially since mainstream retailers fear selling a stiff brush any more.</li>
            <li>It may be sufficient for a first time &amp;#34;dry brusher&amp;#34; but since I have been using a dry brush for years, it is not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily and it really does it&#x27;s job without the bristles falling out or becoming dull.</li>
            <li>I really like that the long handle detaches.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff, but not painful.  </li>
            <li>I had heard about dry brushing and thought it was just another gimmick, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>It really takes off the dry skin so when I moisturize it makes sense.</li>
            <li>Few bristles fell out at first use, but this is normal.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it for a short time, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing a detox and dry brushing is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right, not too stiff.</li>
            <li>The brush is a full 15-3/4” long, long enough to reach those hard to reach spots, particularly on your back.  </li>

            <li> High quality and removeable brush.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy dry brushing!</li>
            <li> This brush is gentle and easy to hold-since it has both the long handle and strap on the back of the brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any type of dry skin brush, and I really like it!  </li>
            <li> Body brushing is new to me</li>
            <li> The head of has perfect bristles as far as being not to stiff and stiff enough.</li>
            <li> Smaller head but nice, stiff bristles...</li>
            <li> The firmness of the bristles is just right for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> BUT WOW, externally you can certainly feel the difference almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Soft &#x3D;</li>
            <li> thing that is recommended is that one use a natural bristle brush,</li>
            <li> /&gt;►  Natural Bristle&lt;</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a quality product.  </li>
            <li> Arrived early and is everything it promises to be.</li>
            <li> The optional handle makes brushing hard to reach places very accessible.</li>
            <li> does the job, especially since mainstream retailers fear selling a stiff brush any more.</li>
            <li> It may be sufficient for a first time &amp;#34;dry brusher&amp;#34; but since I have been using a dry brush for years, it is not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I use this daily and it really does it&#x27;s job without the bristles falling out or becoming dull.</li>
            <li> I really like that the long handle detaches.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff, but not painful.  </li>
            <li> I had heard about dry brushing and thought it was just another gimmick, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> It really takes off the dry skin so when I moisturize it makes sense.</li>
            <li> Few bristles fell out at first use, but this is normal.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for a short time, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing a detox and dry brushing is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right, not too stiff.</li>
            <li> The brush is a full 15-3/4” long, long enough to reach those hard to reach spots, particularly on your back.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it has improved my circulation, but it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting it.  </li>
            <li> I had some rough spots from dry skin that have almost disappeared completely.  </li>
            <li> This brush is everything I could want in a Dry Skin Brush (excepting only the personal masseuse to do the work)!  </li>
            <li> I actually like the feel of dry brushing or buffing my skin and could get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am just starting dry brushing and have just been doing it for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am using less moisturizer because my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I typically use the brush without the handle because it&#x27;s easier to just hold it in my hand, but having the handle is useful for the hard to reach areas of my back.</li>
            <li> Stiff bristles but not harsh.</li>
            <li> Dry skin brushing was recommended to me by my doctor to help with lymphatic drainage for Lyme disease.</li>
            <li> This is not a shower brush, but rather one that will buff and exfoliate your dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a dry skin brush</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would be abrasive on my still dry from winter skin.</li>
            <li> I have thyroid dry skin problems-</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit short, and for me they are not quite firm enough.  </li>
            <li> I read about the importance of dry skin bushing and was curious as to whether it would truly benefit me.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are natural and not too hard.</li>
            <li> They were careful to put in the measurements of the handle</li>
            <li> I use it roughly every other day or so, per the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about what this brush is doing on the inside yet, only used for a couple of weeks...</li>
            <li> but I am hopeful that it is just one other way to promote longterm health.</li>
            <li> The bristles are 5/8” long, firm, but not stiff enough to be uncomfortable when I use the brush.  </li>
            <li> The 1/2” braided, knotted loop is thick and not likely to snap.  </li>
            <li> Just getting into dry brushing not really sure if it works as everyone claims, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harsh on my skin, but I guess I will get used to it.</li>
            <li> after a few weeks of use, my skin is noticeable smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not too stiff to where it irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> But this brush, if a little small, does what a brush is supposed to do, without fear or apologies!</li>
            <li> Not many bristles fell off.</li>
            <li> The brush is still a brush with very few bristles lost in the using of it.</li>
            <li> The use is supposed to be invigorating and that it is, depending on how hard you brush.  </li>
            <li> But the plastic is in the photo, I just failed to notice it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have only used it a couple times, but seems to be made of good quality.</li>
            <li> Feel great to dry brush before a shower. I had heard about dry brushing and thought it was just another gimmick, but I really like it. It really takes off the dry skin so when I moisturize it makes sense.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on other reviews, but it is not the best brush I have ever used.  The bristles are a bit short, and for me they are not quite firm enough.  It may be sufficient for a first time &amp;#34;dry brusher&amp;#34; but since I have been using a dry brush for years, it is not what I was expecting.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The reviews I read really helped.  This brush works well and I am glad I made the purchase. It is not too soft and does a great job exfoliating.  Few bristles fell out at first use, but this is normal.  None after that. Quite honestly I have never used one before but have been reading a lot about their benefits. I also like the fact that you can use it with our without the handle.  It was shipped quickly and on time.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I bought 2 of these brushes. One was for my sister and one for myself. We use them all the time like the directions say to. We really like them.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am new to dry brushing, but so far so good. The brush is good quality. The bristles are not too stiff to where it irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Just getting into dry brushing not really sure if it works as everyone claims, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the brush. It is a great brush and well built.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Good bristles with a nice handle.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Even received an email from the seller with instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my wife and she loves it. The firmness of the bristles is just right for dry brushing. It&#x27;s a good quality brush and my wife likes that it has a removable handle.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a short time, but I really like it. The removable handle is very convenient. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This product works great. The removable handle really comes in handy so multiple products don&#x27;t have to be used. I love it and the bristles feel great on my skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works like a charm (be sure to oil skin night before use). I am getting laser hair removal and this works wonderfully to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> This dry brush is excellent.  It does a wonderful job of getting rid of dry skin and is still gentle.</li>
            <li> Very good brush and bristles are not too rough nor too soft.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush! Perfect size for my hand and the handle easily attaches and detaches. Bristles are natural and not too hard. I&#x27;ve really seen an improvement in my skin! Company delivered really quickly, too! Would order from them again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, quality brush, very happy customer!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harsh on my skin, but I guess I will get used to it.</li>
            <li> after a few weeks of use, my skin is noticeable smoother and softer.  not sure if it has improved my circulation, but it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting it.  it also seems as though my cellulite has diminished, I still notice it, but I definitely think it is improving!</li>
            <li> Smaller head but nice, stiff bristles...does the job, especially since mainstream retailers fear selling a stiff brush any more. Soft &#x3D; no complaints for them. But this brush, if a little small, does what a brush is supposed to do, without fear or apologies!</li>
            <li> It looks good and seems to be good quality.  The detachable handle is a good feature.</li>
            <li> Received the product on time and it is working well as described.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my brush.  I use it several times a week.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Arrived as described. Comfortable for skin brushing, which I&#x27;m new at. I like that it included directions.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush. I like that you can take the handle off. You also get a hook to hang it on. I&#x27;ve been using mine everyday and it feels great!</li>
            <li> Dry skin brushing was recommended to me by my doctor to help with lymphatic drainage for Lyme disease. This brush is gentle and easy to hold-since it has both the long handle and strap on the back of the brush. It arrived quickly and the company is wonderful with tips and follow through, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I got into skin brushing after having had a treatment at a Canyon Ranch Spa.  I use it roughly every other day or so, per the instructions.  I have found a noticeable difference in the &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34; of my skin as well as softness.  I had some rough spots from dry skin that have almost disappeared completely.  I was NOT in any way compensated for this review, and really do love it.</li>
            <li> Great brush and I really enjoy dry brushing!</li>
            <li> I am loving it!!!!!  ...My skin feels much softer and fresh!!  I can&#x27;t stop brushing!!  You should give it a try as well!!! 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I read about the importance of dry skin bushing and was curious as to whether it would truly benefit me.  Well, I&#x27;m very glad I invested in this brush!  It&#x27;s wonderful. The bristles are stiff, but not painful.  The optional handle makes brushing hard to reach places very accessible. This brush makes dry skin brushing a very pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> They were careful to put in the measurements of the handle but it was smaller than I thought it would be. Plus the bristles are held in by a plastic insert that detracts for the natural appearance I expected. But the plastic is in the photo, I just failed to notice it. It arrived promptly and the handle stays on nicely, plus it came with instructions and a nice little bag for traveling. So all in all, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I love that you can take the handle off. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is not a shower brush, but rather one that will buff and exfoliate your dry skin.  The brush is a full 15-3/4” long, long enough to reach those hard to reach spots, particularly on your back.  Dry skin brushing is very popular these days as a detox method, but I’m not too up on that.  The claims range from stimulating the lymphatic system to reducing cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is recommended is that one use a natural bristle brush, one thing this brush does have.  The bristles are 5/8” long, firm, but not stiff enough to be uncomfortable when I use the brush.  The use is supposed to be invigorating and that it is, depending on how hard you brush.  I actually like the feel of dry brushing or buffing my skin and could get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Natural Bristle&lt;br /&gt;►  Polished Wooden Frame&lt;br /&gt;►  Cotton loop for hanging&lt;br /&gt;►  Travel Pouch and Hook Included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle is made of a nice polished wood as is the body brush itself.  There’s a loop on the end for hanging and a hook that can be attached to the wall.  The 1/2” braided, knotted loop is thick and not likely to snap.  My preference would be to simply store it in the carrying pouch and tuck it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting thing about this brush is the fact that I can pull and the handle and remove it.  If I wanted to simply do my face, I could use the brush solo.  It has a 1” cotton loop around it so I can have a nice steady grip while exfoliating.  This is a very high quality, sturdy brush, one that I’ve seen at a considerably higher price point elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results. My skin feels great; I think it&#x27;s softer than it&#x27;s ever been. The brush appears to be good quality and the bristles are staying intact. I really like that the long handle detaches. I typically use the brush without the handle because it&#x27;s easier to just hold it in my hand, but having the handle is useful for the hard to reach areas of my back.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Perfect for what I needed. Great transaction</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any type of dry skin brush, and I really like it!  I have pretty sensitive skin, but I found that after a few days I could use a bit more pressure and felt fine.  My skin feels smoother and it&#x27;s invigorating before a shower.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush, but after two weeks I saw no improvement of my KP. Stiff bristles but not harsh. Feels really good.</li>
            <li> love it. it&#x27;s super easy to use and I love how invigorated my skin feels after.</li>
            <li> This brush is everything I could want in a Dry Skin Brush (excepting only the personal masseuse to do the work)!  Natural bristles, the wood handle which converts from long to palm use, and quality that exceeded all expectations - I&#x27;m thrilled. Thanks for making such a quality product.  I wish you every poossible success!</li>
            <li> I Love this brush. I purchased it after I went on a cruise where they used this on me. I have never had skin that felt so soft and good as it circulates the blood and gets rid of dead skin helps with celulite (sp) too! I even purchased one for my daughter and she too loves it. I start at my feet using 5 strokes upwards working up to my heart. Then I brush downward on the neck, back and chest to my heart. I then circle my stomach area starting with the brush at the lover left working around clockwise in a circle around the belly button. I then use lotion. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this brush,  It is amazing how much better your skins feels after using it.</li>
            <li> Not sure about what this brush is doing on the inside yet, only used for a couple of weeks...BUT WOW, externally you can certainly feel the difference almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I had one sent to a friend. I&#x27;m doing a detox and dry brushing is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am just starting dry brushing and have just been doing it for about two weeks.  My skin is noticeably softer.  This brush is very easy to use and very good quality.  The handle comes off easily when needed but stays on good too.  The travel sack came in handy as I&#x27;m on vacation right now:)!!  Good purchase!</li>
            <li> I have never used a dry skin brush but it was recommended on the diet plan I have been following. I was worried that it would be abrasive on my still dry from winter skin. That is not the case. It is gently invigorating to my skin. I use it before I go to bed each night and I am so relaxed afterward. I recommend this product.I got an email from the seller giving me tips for using my product for the best results. I appreciated that since this was a new product for me to try.</li>
            <li> I love it, it wakes up your skin and give it a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> love my skin brush! i use it every morning! not only does it help wake me up and get my system moving, but it&#x27;s high quality and being able to remove the head of the brush makes it easy to travel with! thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for....no complaints</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The brush came before I left for work. I&#x27;m very pleased with the brush and the packaging was in good condition. I&#x27;ve used the brush and I&#x27;m happy with it. I recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ve used it every time I&#x27;ve showered. The brush is still a brush with very few bristles lost in the using of it. The removable handle still works well. The bristles are still holding up after many uses. My skin is softer from using it. I may buy another to use or as a gift. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great. Works like it should. Love being able to remove the handle.</li>
            <li> Great dry skin body brush, it has the right softness and stiffness to brush the skin in a healthy way.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll buy a second one so I can brush my legs with both hands .</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the brush and the dry brushing process.</li>
            <li> Good product- I have thyroid dry skin problems- This is a good , easy, skin friendly way to remove the  dead skin &amp; itch,Budget friendly- recommend-</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.High quality and removeable brush.</li>
            <li> nice brush, handle slides on and off well, very good quality</li>
            <li> I have never tried dry skin brushing before so, this being my first attempt, was great! While I have nothing to compare Wholesome Beauty&#x27;s product to, I absolutely love the feeling I get all over when I use the brush; it&#x27;s amazing and I feel very much like a rush of pixie dust is surging through my body. So, thank you Wholesome Beauty for giving me an experience akin to unicorns and rainbows.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this brush. I have been using it for two weeks and can already see a great difference in my skin&#x27;s health. The bristles are just right, not too stiff. I am using less moisturizer because my skin feels so soft. I used to have itchy skin and that has cleared up as circulation has improved. I can tell a visible difference in the appearance of cellulite as well.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Overall, very nicely made with high-quality materials. I use this daily and it really does it&#x27;s job without the bristles falling out or becoming dull.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this would not be very good because of the low price. But it is actually very nice and well worth the money and more! The head of has perfect bristles as far as being not to stiff and stiff enough.</li>
            <li> Love it! Feels wonderful. Not many bristles fell off. Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Just started using the body brush recently, but I like it. Body brushing is new to me but I am hopeful that it is just one other way to promote longterm health.</li>
            <li> This brush is great!  My skin feels better, and while it only adds a few minutes to my morning routine I feel more awake and connected to my body for the day!</li>
            <li> Arrived early and is everything it promises to be. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what this brush really was. It was recommended for skin conditions, whatever that means. A friend told me about it. It is a kind a  wooy idea, but it actually makes one feel better. I have no idea why this works, but it does. Brushing your body somehow makes you feel relaxed and tingly and your skin will feel awake.</li>
