    <ol>
            <li> awesome.  it lasted one year. then I ran out</li>
            <li> Not the product I previously purchased</li>
            <li> Product as advertised and very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have to style my hair up everyday and have been buying the cheap stuff. At the end of the day, I would be left with white flakes all over but this gel is so much better. Granted it is pricier than the cheap stuff but the quality and hold is phenomenal. A little goes a long way. Love the smell as well. I also appreciate the pump in that the bottle isn&#x27;t all sticky from being squeezed. While it maintains a awesome hold, it does not get like lacquer at the end of the day. I have found my forever gel.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and can only get it locally in salons, being expensive/Appreciated this find.Holds without being stiff nor sticky</li>
            <li> Only gel I found to have the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; amount of control. Apply when hair is wet or damp for the wet look. I usually apply when my hair is close to dry. Controls my hair style throughout the day. Hard to find this in stores and in this size.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price! Lasts a long time and the dispenser is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Personal preference here.  I happen to very much like this product.  All depends on the &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; you want.  Works for me since I like the wet plastered hair back look.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  It is definitely firm, but helps by straight hair hold some body.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place without looking like you&#x27;re wearing a helmet! Keeps your hair styles looking good all day long!</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day. It holds very nicely without making your hair feeling gross. After a few hours, your hair will stay in place and be soft. Many of the cheap gels are hard to touch until you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Not sticky.  Not flaky. You can use it on dry or wet hair.  Not too stiff and can give you a wet look.  Body feel is great and you can&#x27;t feel it when it is your hair.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Even though Joico changed their original &amp;#34;Ice&amp;#34; formula to this, it&#x27;s still very good.  It used to be &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; because less of this product did more for your hair.  This formula forces you to use more, to get the same effects as the older version. Thus, you spend more...  but it does the job and the scent is pleasant. NOTE:  Ordered this the second time around (2/2017) and it did NOT include the pump accessory as pictured in the 2nd image. I received item as pictured in the first image.  Luckily, my old pump cap does fit enough of the threading to seal and work effectively.</li>
            <li> A standard in my bathroom for many years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have short to medium length hair, and just a small amount of Joico gives me a very strong hold without feeling stiff or looking tacky, and there is no flaking.  The scent is very pleasant and dissipates over time.  I have put this on when my hair is wet and then did a blow dry and brush and it set great, and have also used it on dry hair to hold in place.  It does not work well for me as a &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;, and does not look all that great when I use it on wet hair and then let it naturally dry, but that could just be my hair.  A little goes a long way and I&#x27;ll be using this large bottle for quite some time, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how the product works.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> Good...just a bit pricey</li>
            <li> The product has a great price for the size.  Gives my husband&#x27;s hair the right texture for his hair style.  I will order again...and, again!</li>
            <li> Best gel that I always use.  The price is worth the money.  No complaints at all and holds really well.</li>
            <li> great gel always use it</li>
            <li> good product holds very well without greasy feeling, Id give it 5 starts except that it does make your scalp itch by the end of the day</li>
            <li> Holds great and doesn&#x27;t get flaky or overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is great however it left my hair feeling like it was straw.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have been using it for about 15 - 20 years. It was called Joico Ice gel in the old days. It looks good and holds hair motionless even in high wind forever. No movement on my hair even on 20 hour days.</li>
