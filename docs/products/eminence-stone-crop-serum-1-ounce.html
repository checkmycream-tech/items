            <li>I&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s true or not, but it seems like it to me.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed with good skin, but I made the change to Eminence when suddenly my face no longer enjoyed L&#x27;ancome and other products.  </li>

            <li> I hope the product inside was not a tester or a mixture of other products.</li>
            <li> Usually thr spot is red for a ling time.</li>
            <li> I bought this with other Eminence products.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed a reduction in visible dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am half way through the bottle</li>
            <li> I has helped with the hyperpigmentation as well as reviving my dry, dull previous appearance.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I realized how many chemicals are in skin products that have very nasty side affects with long term use and decided to go organic.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for 4 months and saw results within days.</li>
            <li> I use a few in the Eminence line.  </li>
            <li> With this product I use it a few times a day and the redness is GONE within two day!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not really loving it.</li>
            <li> I also use it on broken blood vessel areas on my cheek/nose and in weeks it was barley visable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic results that would entice or encourage a re-purchase.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately amazon does not ship this to me</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any decrease in my hyper-pigmentation, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have always hated waking up to my no make up-uneven-blotchy skin, and I no longer have to!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product before I purchased it from Amazon,  I use it morning and evening.  Would buy it again but unfortunately amazon does not ship this to me &amp; I had to send it to my sister in the states to send it to me.</li>
            <li> After using the whole bottle I can say that it worked just fine, my skin didn&#x27;t got any worst or better. Might make wonders for some others.</li>
            <li> Why serum bottle is open ?, no box? why ??????  how i know this is a true serum, .  Please amazon look this better.</li>
            <li> I brought this product abt a month ago and It does work on my acne scars which I suffered with for yrs from teen yrs to my adult yrs. The spots r lightening slowly but surely going away with consistent use n a facial regimen, also I use a sunscreen with it n it helps to fade the spots too., abt to buy another bottle. N I love the fact that it is organic for my sensitive skin. definitely would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used this product in combination with the eight greens mask and the herbal spot serum. I had experienced terrible acne and acne scars after having my third child. I used it everyday for 4 months and saw results within days. I simply love this product line. I attended a hair skin and nail show in chicago when i purchased the products. They had a booth set-up with all the masks and scrubs open for you to see. they were beautiful colors and looked so freshly made!</li>
            <li> maybe lightening my skin somehow but not very obvious. moderate price given such size. absorption is fine but just don&#x27;t use too much each time</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all of the rave reviews. After using it for over three weeks, I honestly can&#x27;t tell any difference in the look and/or feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I should blame the product since I am in the sun more than I should be, but I have noticed more hyperpigmentation since using a full bottle. That is after a series of Modified Jessner Peels too. I love Eminence&#x27;s Clearing Acne line though! it along with [[ASIN:B00JAYIHK2 Clear Skin Advanced Vitamin Pack for Acne - 60 Day Supply]] has completed cleared up my acne. i just wish i could make the hyperpigmentation disappear as easily!</li>
            <li> I am using this serum along with four other serums. And I can&#x27;t say which ones are working or if it&#x27;s the combination of all serums but I feel that my skin is looking so much better and starting to glow beautifully. I had so much acne and scars and slowing they are fading and my skin is smoothing out. I&#x27;m so glad that my skin didn&#x27;t get so damaged when I had acne. I plan to keep using eminence products because they are organic, chemical-free, gmo-free, and they just smell awesome! I Love Eminence!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum now for about 7 years. It takes care of the &amp;#34;shadows&amp;#34; on my face and works well as my primary moisturizer. I use a few in the Eminence line.  I&#x27;ve been blessed with good skin, but I made the change to Eminence when suddenly my face no longer enjoyed L&#x27;ancome and other products.  I still get compliments on my smooth, acne- and wrinkle-free skin.  I&#x27;m 55 and get mistaken for someone 10-15 years younger.  Thus, a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; rating!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time on vacation, and I loved it so I order more.  I have told a lot of friends.</li>
            <li> i liked this serum just started using it for dark spots will seee how it goes in a couple weeks</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Great product.</li>
            <li> It arrived without a box or seal of any sort. I&#x27;ve bought enough Eminence products to know they come in a box that is sealed. I hope the product inside was not a tester or a mixture of other products. There was no reason to unwrap it to mail it, there was plenty of room in the box.</li>
            <li> Helps soothe and heal skin, even helps out with mild acne.  I  prefer to use the serums, they seem to work best in this product line.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect. No complaints. Came when it said it was going to and in perfect condition. This product has no preservatives so it can actually spoil if it is exposed to heat or is aged. I was skeptical. But nope, just perfect. Will definitely order again from this site. I have used this product for a while so I know exactly what to expect from it. It is fabulous. Added so much moisture to my super dry skin</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I have had thr same bottle for years bc I only use it on spots after a rough pimple popping . Usually thr spot is red for a ling time. With this product I use it a few times a day and the redness is GONE within two day! I also use it on broken blood vessel areas on my cheek/nose and in weeks it was barley visable. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Been looking for a serum that is hydrating and pore refining - this one does the trick!</li>
            <li> I bought this with other Eminence products.  I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic results that would entice or encourage a re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look vibrant and balances the tone. It even makes my skin feel refreshef.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have malasma above my lip and it helps reduce is by about 70%. Nice product.</li>
            <li> I have used for about the past 5 years and love this serum better than creams.  Highly recommend this product.  I love the price too as this is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I cant say how good this produce is i think ever one should use it it last for every and its really good to the face.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin, no bad chemicals that can cause an allergic reaction. Great hydrating serum to use at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using the eminence line of products that deters hyper pigmentation and aiding with mature skin (moisturizing, fine lines, lifting). I have seen improvement to my skin color (pigmentation is getting lighter) and also the texture.  I have recommended the products to friends and gave some for my daughter to try so that her youthful skin stays youthful. It is pricey but try the kits to see what you like best and then invest in yourself and your skin.</li>
            <li> If you want to go organic on your skin, then the Eminence line is what you want. I used Lancome for  years and was completely satisfied with my skin using  their products. A few years ago I realized how many chemicals are in skin products that have very nasty side affects with long term use and decided to go organic. It took about a month for my skin to adjust to the new regime but I am more than satisfied with all of the Eminence products. Would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to stop polluting their bodies with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Stone Crop Serum each night for a couple of months. I just ran out and immediately reordered! I has helped with the hyperpigmentation as well as reviving my dry, dull previous appearance. I have always hated waking up to my no make up-uneven-blotchy skin, and I no longer have to! I will likely never have a flawless face with my skin type but feel like this has already gotten me closer than I thought possible. I do still have some dark spots, it&#x27;s not quite magic, but they have began to fade as well. It&#x27;s a fantastic product!&lt;br /&gt;*I use this with the Stone Crop Gel Wash and the combination is likely the contributing factor to my new healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff does really work- I have been using it on my melasma for 3 weeks now, and it&#x27;s definitely fading.</li>
            <li> Excellent personal skin product</li>
            <li> I was introduced by an esthetician to Eminence a couple of years ago and I especially like the stone crop collection.  The products are so concentrated that a little goes a long way.  The serum is wonderful and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product received in time.</li>
            <li> Love this as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice serum, dries quickly so apply and massage in right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I have not noticed a reduction in visible dark spots. The serum leaves my face feeling kind of sticky and tight before I moisturize. Not really loving it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s really clearing my dark spots and is nourishing my skin as well.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It smells great and is lightly moisturizing. I am half way through the bottle and I have not noticed any decrease in my hyper-pigmentation, unfortunately. Not sure if I would buy again.</li>

            <li> I like it that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or shiny. Since I started using this product, I see that the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks seem to be breaking off and disappearing. I&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s true or not, but it seems like it to me.</li>
