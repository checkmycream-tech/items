            <li>I discovered this perfect shade of pink at my nail salon and loved it so much I had to own it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for having a good selection on hand</li>

            <li>This is a fantastic color to wear year-round as well.</li>
            <li>Used this color at the nail salon and liked it so much</li>
            <li>I was looking for a color close to Hong Kong Sunrise and this fit.</li>
            <li>Very complimentary.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite color!  </li>
            <li>so I was so excited to find it!&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>

            <li>arrived quickly.</li>

            <li>I love this color for me; it is a good everyday, year-around color.</li>
            <li>very pretty color.</li>
            <li>True pink shades look awful on my nails because my skin tone goes best with warm shades of color and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Looks good on young hands, old hands.  </li>
            <li>The price was right as was the quality of  the product</li>
            <li>I like a polish that is pretty on the toes but doesn&#x27;t draw attention first thing!  </li>

            <li>This nail color is not too pale and not too \\&quot;hot\\&quot; shade of pink and goes perfectly with any color clothing from browns, blues and even yellows.  </li>
            <li>OPI is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li>After unsuccessfully finding it at local retail stores, I was pleasantly surprised (and grateful) to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I question if it was new because the top was hard to get off due to nail polish on the outside of the neck of the bottle.</li>

            <li> very pretty color. Loved my manicure for special occasion</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love OPI Nail Lacquer, right!?  I discovered this perfect shade of pink at my nail salon and loved it so much I had to own it.

            <li> Love this color. Glad I could find it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite color!  I use to wear &amp;#34;Paint my Mojitoes Red&amp;#34;, but they discontinued that one.  I really like this even better.  Seems to go well with whatever outfit I have on.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Have used this shade for years and am happy to be able to find it on line.</li>
            <li> OPI nail lacquer can not be beat!&lt;br /&gt;This color is versatile enough to wear with clothing from red to orange to pink.&lt;br /&gt;There is just enough of a shimmer-effect to give finished nails a glossy shine&lt;br /&gt;without emphasizing nail imperfections. Love it!</li>
            <li> Loved the color.Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It is the best. I have been using it for the last 3 years, Same one, I keep been complimented for my beautiful nails.&lt;br /&gt;Nail Lacquer last a long time</li>
            <li> I question if it was new because the top was hard to get off due to nail polish on the outside of the neck of the bottle. Very thick and gummy.</li>
            <li> GREAT polish that I have worn for years!</li>
            <li> Love, love this color goes with everything!  Sad they do not seem to be making it anymore so I was so excited to find it!&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice color, good quality</li>
            <li> Wears right off in fact it darn  right ugly.</li>
            <li> OPI is a very high quality product. The nail polish is durable and dries quickly. When a hard clear coat is added it is nearly indestructable. My use is on toe nails and the polish stands up to beach abrasion nicely.</li>
            <li> Used this color at the nail salon and liked it so much I had to order a bottle. The color seems to blend with everything. Could not chance not finding it at a nail place!</li>
            <li> I love this color for me; it is a good everyday, year-around color. Tried it at the salon and wanted to own it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  Jeaane</li>
            <li> I discovered this shade at our local nail salon and I&#x27;m glad Amazon (of course!) has it. True pink shades look awful on my nails because my skin tone goes best with warm shades of color and this is perfect. This is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; color because it looks great with everything in my wardrobe and can worn in every season.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great color. I was looking for a color close to Hong Kong Sunrise and this fit.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade nice coverage with only one coat</li>

            <li> not too orange, not to pink - doesn&#x27;t SHOUT at you.  Subtle but colorful - I wear the &#x27;darks&#x27; in fall/winter and the reds/pinks for summer.  This color may get me thru the entire summer season.  Looks good on young hands, old hands.  Very complimentary.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother because she couldn&#x27;t find this color anywhere else.  She loves this brand!</li>
            <li> Great color hope it is never discontinued</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d the product in the agreed upon time. The price was right as was the quality of  the product</li>
            <li> I had another OPI favorite but it was discontinued, so my pedicurist picked this one for me.  I like a polish that is pretty on the toes but doesn&#x27;t draw attention first thing!  I get compliments on this one.</li>
            <li> My favorite OPI Color..it&#x27;s the perfect neutral.....matches everything!</li>
            <li> Best nail polish out there, OPI !!  Stays on longer , great summer color this is, love it !  One of their many great colors.</li>
