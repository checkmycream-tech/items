            <li>I am especially pleased with the Thickening Conditioner because conditioners have always flattened my hair, and this conditioner seems to add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>The volume isn&#x27;t that impressive though.</li>

            <li>It does work, and I love the product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: this is a pretty good conditioner for fine/thin hair, but make sure you clarify with a silicone-free shampoo or else you&#x27;ll never get those awesome bouncy results again.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so this product is great for making my hair feel thicker&lt;</li>
            <li>Works well, smells nice.</li>
            <li>As it dries tho, the tangles seem to come out on their own.</li>
            <li>This does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>By far, this USED TO BE best.  </li>
            <li>Most of the conditioners I’ve tried have been good at detangling, almost like they leave a slippery coating on your hair that makes it easy to comb.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this condition works wonders!</li>
            <li>Hair feels nice, I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product and the price.  </li>
            <li>I love both the shampoo and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I Love all the JOHN FRIEDA products.....</li>
            <li>I love John Frieda products.  </li>
            <li>glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>It is deceiving to state that it thickens hair because it does not do anything to make it thicker or give more volume.</li>
            <li>Overall it is ok: it does make you hair thicker (and it works best with matching Volume In-Shower Treatment), and adds volume.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>the dozen I have tried, this Conditioner from John Frieda (used along with the Frieda Volumizing Shampoo counterpart, does a better job than anything else I have found.</li>
            <li>I was looking for more like the TV Ads.</li>
            <li>Nothing outstanding about it.  </li>
            <li>I feel nioxine works better.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent too.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t going to be a magic bullet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners that claim to make it thicker, but none have done so.</li>
            <li>It is what they say works better than others they&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shinier and fuller and I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so, so much better now</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may work for many people</li>
            <li>I am in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It really is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>different amounts to see what works best for your hair length.</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner I have found in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Their shampoo, conditioner and this product are all wonderful and my skin no longer looks dry and peels.  </li>
            <li>I get the best results by alternating the JF shampoo with a with a cheap &#x27;cone-free shampoo to clarify my hair, and using this conditioner after each shampoo but only on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>made it feel more fine than it already is.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair, so I need good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, good product.  </li>
            <li>I have to say with the first use I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair soft, smooth, and de-tangeled.</li>
            <li>Easy to work out tangles.</li>
            <li>I buy many John Freida products because they are consinstely true to thier advertisement.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, smells great and creates more body than conditioners I have tried for 3x the price!</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine gray hair and this product helps the volume.</li>
            <li>Made my fine hair dry....would not purchase again, but</li>
            <li>and I have baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have that problem, then this product is fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely fine</li>
            <li>I have always been cursed with fine, flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>For really fine hair any wax is a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>Totally important.</li>
            <li>Plus my hair looks great the next day too.</li>
            <li>Leaved my hair smooth, wavy and &#x27;appearing&#x27; thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was like the cheap conditioner you buy in the store for $2 (Suave, etc).</li>
            <li>great shampoo, I have used it some days back</li>
            <li>Before using this shampoo, I&#x27;d been using a cheap silicone-free shampoo (herbal essences volumizing), and didn&#x27;t like how crunchy it made</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo and it really does make my hair feel more voluminous and thickened.</li>
            <li>To be honest if you&#x27;re just using this on it&#x27;s own without really doing a voluminous style afterwards, you won&#x27;t get much volume.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the Brilliant Brunette line and then the Sheer Blonde after dying my hair.</li>
            <li>I actually used the Full Repair Conditioner for color treated hair before i used this one, but my hair still feels great</li>
            <li>Originally bought this product from Ulta but found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>my hair thins, I have become more interested in using &#x27;volumizing&#x27; products.</li>
            <li>being said, I did feel that the shampoo and conditioner gave my hair more body, and it smells good, but it&#x27;s not worth the dandruff issues.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner gives my hair tons of body and keeps it soft and nice to touch.  </li>
            <li>Going to be swimming and in the sun a lot soon,  so will be switching up to his full repair strengthen  and restore for awhile...</li>
            <li>USED ONE TIME IN CONJUNCTION WITH LUXURIOUS VOLUME FULL SPLENDOR SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using it in conjunction with the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Touchably Full Shampoo for over 2 weeks</li>
            <li>This product is OK, but I much prefer the Loreal EverPure volume shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>, then I wash it two or three times with [[ASIN:B001BAFQOS John Frieda Luxurious Volume Touchably Full Shampoo , 8.45 Ounce]] .  </li>
            <li>I read such good reviews on this John Frieda line</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner very much, it&#x27;s luxurious, smells fantastic, makes my very fine straight hair look shiny and healthy, and little thicker, This is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>Nobody thinks I have that much hair since it is so freaking fine.</li>
            <li>All of John Frieda&#x27;s products are fantastic - highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>This did nothing more than make my hair soft but not fuller.</li>
            <li>This is not as good as some other John Frieda products.</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>I have straight, oily hair and am not one who &amp;#34;primps&amp;#34; so I just used the shampoo and this to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>Works great for my fine, thin, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first use of this John Frieda conditioner, with the matching shampoo, left my hair soft, shiny, volumized, gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I have had baby fine hair my whole life, and now that I&#x27;m getting older it is thinning, as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using the shampoo with this for the full effect.</li>
            <li>Its soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive but works really well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this conditioner from CVS and the supermarket numerous times and love it.</li>
            <li>This is my  first time using John Frieda products.</li>
            <li>The regular John Frieda conditioner is better than this one.</li>
            <li>I just came out of the shower after my first use of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this out for the first time.</li>
            <li>I will start by saying I am a big an of many John Frieda products.</li>
            <li>After going lighter I noticed my hair seemed so much thinner than when brunette, so I decided to give this a try!</li>
            <li>I first found out about this John Frieda conditioner when I purchased one of his hair color products.  </li>
            <li>leaves my hair and soft and full.</li>
            <li>I have regular fine hair, and as soon as I first used this in the shower, you can AUTOMATICALLY feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair due to medicines and age.</li>
            <li>My hair is short, fine and straight.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I expected more from a brand name product.</li>
            <li>None of them really thicken the hair permanently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really save any money by getting this.</li>
            <li>I run my fingers thru it and the tangles gently fall away.</li>
            <li>Really does make your hair feel thicker.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>hair is soft and silky to the touch right after applying it to my hair</li>
            <li>i have long straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that maybe I&#x27;d finally found my HG.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a deal by getting it from Amazon, but instead of the creamy white conditioner that normally smooths my hair nicely, I got this soupy translucent stuff which I had to use double the conditioner than I normally use, thus the product was gone faster</li>
            <li>Because I have very long but fine hair</li>
            <li>Im still using it but its not giving much volume as I thought, so far it has been better than the other brands i have used becuase my hair feels ligther , but I cant seem to get volume in my problem areas like my bangs</li>
            <li>I have fine dark blonde hair and was hoping it would leave it weightless and light.</li>
            <li>More shine and less frizz.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I recommend ordering this product on its own without other items to avoid the same problem I had.</li>
            <li>, I just wish I got a little more for my money.</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes it soft and takes a lot of the frizz out.</li>
            <li>I have pretty much the same problem with every conditoner.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love it, but I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair a little too soft to maintain my style all day and I have to use more hair spray than I like....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it actually is any thicker, I don&#x27;t know if anything can do that, but it certainly feels like it, and that&#x27;s what counts!</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the back first to see that this is made with a lightweight wax.</li>
            <li>After using it the hair is lush and soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of conditioners from cheap to high end, western and Japanese, co-washing, going silicone free, etc, but no matter what my hair always falls into a flat helmet after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Both my wife and daughter made clear they can&#x27;t just have the shampoo, MUST also have the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>As far as volume goes, this product did not work as advertised - HOWEVER...</li>
            <li>It was also completely unruly and fly-away.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I am sensitive to the ingredients in these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The key is that it does not take much, otherwise, the product won&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>As someone with fine hair (curly) who is also dealing with hair loss due to a medical condition, I have tried just about every hair thickening shampoo/conditioner combo.  </li>
            <li>so when in the shower I always wet it and condition it first and using a brush</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shinny and feels fuller without being sticky or coarse.</li>
            <li>This combination of shampoo and conditioner brought life back to my hair, it feels soft and bouncy,</li>
            <li>but I believe there are better shampoos out there for thin hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo after trying way too many products for my thin and medium length hair.</li>
            <li>My wife is a regular user of this product and will not use to any other shampoo or conditioner despite the higher price</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, thin, super-straight Asian hair, and was on the hunt for a new volumizing shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>it my hair was full, yet manageable and looks and feels soft and natural, but alas, John Frieda &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; it and I can no longer recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like the thick and rich feel of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft but didn&#x27;t give it enough body.  </li>
            <li>My conditioner was packed so poorly that I have only been able to smell it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of conditioner, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make it look greasy either.</li>
            <li>I use this and let my hair dry natural.</li>
            <li>Not so much thickening, but it feels strengthened, moisturized, and less fried.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, my hair becomes limp and slick, and gets greasy much more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They make my thin fine hair feel thick and full of body, not to mention shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I was younger my hair was thick, full and curly.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and finely textured, so I&#x27;m always searching for volumizing shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t thin, but it is fine.</li>

            <li> I feel nioxine works better.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent too.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t going to be a magic bullet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners that claim to make it thicker, but none have done so.</li>
            <li> It is what they say works better than others they&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shinier and fuller and I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so, so much better now</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may work for many people</li>
            <li> I am in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It really is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> different amounts to see what works best for your hair length.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have found in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Their shampoo, conditioner and this product are all wonderful and my skin no longer looks dry and peels.  </li>
            <li> I get the best results by alternating the JF shampoo with a with a cheap &#x27;cone-free shampoo to clarify my hair, and using this conditioner after each shampoo but only on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> made it feel more fine than it already is.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair, so I need good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, good product.  </li>
            <li> I have to say with the first use I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair soft, smooth, and de-tangeled.</li>
            <li> Easy to work out tangles.</li>
            <li> I buy many John Freida products because they are consinstely true to thier advertisement.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, smells great and creates more body than conditioners I have tried for 3x the price!</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine gray hair and this product helps the volume.</li>
            <li> Made my fine hair dry....would not purchase again, but</li>
            <li> and I have baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have that problem, then this product is fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine</li>
            <li> I have always been cursed with fine, flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> For really fine hair any wax is a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> Totally important.</li>
            <li> Plus my hair looks great the next day too.</li>
            <li> Leaved my hair smooth, wavy and &#x27;appearing&#x27; thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was like the cheap conditioner you buy in the store for $2 (Suave, etc).</li>
            <li> great shampoo, I have used it some days back</li>
            <li> Before using this shampoo, I&#x27;d been using a cheap silicone-free shampoo (herbal essences volumizing), and didn&#x27;t like how crunchy it made</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and it really does make my hair feel more voluminous and thickened.</li>
            <li> To be honest if you&#x27;re just using this on it&#x27;s own without really doing a voluminous style afterwards, you won&#x27;t get much volume.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the Brilliant Brunette line and then the Sheer Blonde after dying my hair.</li>
            <li> I actually used the Full Repair Conditioner for color treated hair before i used this one, but my hair still feels great</li>
            <li> Originally bought this product from Ulta but found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> my hair thins, I have become more interested in using &#x27;volumizing&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> being said, I did feel that the shampoo and conditioner gave my hair more body, and it smells good, but it&#x27;s not worth the dandruff issues.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner gives my hair tons of body and keeps it soft and nice to touch.  </li>
            <li> Going to be swimming and in the sun a lot soon,  so will be switching up to his full repair strengthen  and restore for awhile...</li>
            <li> USED ONE TIME IN CONJUNCTION WITH LUXURIOUS VOLUME FULL SPLENDOR SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using it in conjunction with the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Touchably Full Shampoo for over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but I much prefer the Loreal EverPure volume shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> , then I wash it two or three times with [[ASIN:B001BAFQOS John Frieda Luxurious Volume Touchably Full Shampoo , 8.45 Ounce]] .  </li>
            <li> I read such good reviews on this John Frieda line</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner very much, it&#x27;s luxurious, smells fantastic, makes my very fine straight hair look shiny and healthy, and little thicker, This is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> Nobody thinks I have that much hair since it is so freaking fine.</li>
            <li> All of John Frieda&#x27;s products are fantastic - highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This did nothing more than make my hair soft but not fuller.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as some other John Frieda products.</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> I have straight, oily hair and am not one who &amp;#34;primps&amp;#34; so I just used the shampoo and this to clean my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for my fine, thin, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first use of this John Frieda conditioner, with the matching shampoo, left my hair soft, shiny, volumized, gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I have had baby fine hair my whole life, and now that I&#x27;m getting older it is thinning, as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using the shampoo with this for the full effect.</li>
            <li> Its soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive but works really well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this conditioner from CVS and the supermarket numerous times and love it.</li>
            <li> This is my  first time using John Frieda products.</li>
            <li> The regular John Frieda conditioner is better than this one.</li>
            <li> I just came out of the shower after my first use of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this out for the first time.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying I am a big an of many John Frieda products.</li>
            <li> After going lighter I noticed my hair seemed so much thinner than when brunette, so I decided to give this a try!</li>
            <li> I first found out about this John Frieda conditioner when I purchased one of his hair color products.  </li>
            <li> leaves my hair and soft and full.</li>
            <li> I have regular fine hair, and as soon as I first used this in the shower, you can AUTOMATICALLY feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair due to medicines and age.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, fine and straight.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I expected more from a brand name product.</li>
            <li> None of them really thicken the hair permanently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really save any money by getting this.</li>
            <li> I run my fingers thru it and the tangles gently fall away.</li>
            <li> Really does make your hair feel thicker.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> hair is soft and silky to the touch right after applying it to my hair</li>
            <li> i have long straight fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that maybe I&#x27;d finally found my HG.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a deal by getting it from Amazon, but instead of the creamy white conditioner that normally smooths my hair nicely, I got this soupy translucent stuff which I had to use double the conditioner than I normally use, thus the product was gone faster</li>
            <li> Because I have very long but fine hair</li>
            <li> Im still using it but its not giving much volume as I thought, so far it has been better than the other brands i have used becuase my hair feels ligther , but I cant seem to get volume in my problem areas like my bangs</li>
            <li> I have fine dark blonde hair and was hoping it would leave it weightless and light.</li>
            <li> More shine and less frizz.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended highly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> and I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I recommend ordering this product on its own without other items to avoid the same problem I had.</li>
            <li> , I just wish I got a little more for my money.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes it soft and takes a lot of the frizz out.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much the same problem with every conditoner.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it, but I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair a little too soft to maintain my style all day and I have to use more hair spray than I like....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually is any thicker, I don&#x27;t know if anything can do that, but it certainly feels like it, and that&#x27;s what counts!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the back first to see that this is made with a lightweight wax.</li>
            <li> After using it the hair is lush and soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of conditioners from cheap to high end, western and Japanese, co-washing, going silicone free, etc, but no matter what my hair always falls into a flat helmet after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and daughter made clear they can&#x27;t just have the shampoo, MUST also have the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> As far as volume goes, this product did not work as advertised - HOWEVER...</li>
            <li> It was also completely unruly and fly-away.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am sensitive to the ingredients in these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The key is that it does not take much, otherwise, the product won&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> As someone with fine hair (curly) who is also dealing with hair loss due to a medical condition, I have tried just about every hair thickening shampoo/conditioner combo.  </li>
            <li> so when in the shower I always wet it and condition it first and using a brush</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shinny and feels fuller without being sticky or coarse.</li>
            <li> This combination of shampoo and conditioner brought life back to my hair, it feels soft and bouncy,</li>
            <li> but I believe there are better shampoos out there for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo after trying way too many products for my thin and medium length hair.</li>
            <li> My wife is a regular user of this product and will not use to any other shampoo or conditioner despite the higher price</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin, super-straight Asian hair, and was on the hunt for a new volumizing shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> it my hair was full, yet manageable and looks and feels soft and natural, but alas, John Frieda &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; it and I can no longer recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the thick and rich feel of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft but didn&#x27;t give it enough body.  </li>
            <li> My conditioner was packed so poorly that I have only been able to smell it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of conditioner, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make it look greasy either.</li>
            <li> I use this and let my hair dry natural.</li>
            <li> Not so much thickening, but it feels strengthened, moisturized, and less fried.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, my hair becomes limp and slick, and gets greasy much more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They make my thin fine hair feel thick and full of body, not to mention shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I was younger my hair was thick, full and curly.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and finely textured, so I&#x27;m always searching for volumizing shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t thin, but it is fine.</li>
            <li> As usual products that say &amp;#34;will make even fine hair feel thicker&amp;#34; is never true.  </li>
            <li> At least it left my long blonde hair feeling super silky and not greasy as such conditioner&#x27;s often do.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my fine, thin, flat hair was not changed by this product.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that, when applied to roots or near roots (as they suggest in instructions), it leaves my hair greasy, and overall my hair after this conditioner has somewhat sticky feeling to it, and less shine than, for example, when using their Anti-Frizz line</li>
            <li> My hair fell flat as it always does.  </li>
            <li> John Frieda&#x27;s Luxurious Volume products are my hands-down favorite for thin, limp or lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> each subsequent time I used this conditioner and shampoo, it left my hair soft but slick and</li>
            <li> Lavish Lift Root Booster, 6.77 Oz (Pack of 6)]], let that dry (and sometimes blow dry again) and use a curling iron to style my hair before putting it back up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I enjoyed how the Sheer Blonde line made my hair look</li>
            <li> Maybe it works if you blow dry and use product to get volume but just as a stand alone it didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> I don’t try to comb it, or use a hair dryer until my hair is about 50% dry.</li>
            <li> Then I let it dry, blow dry and brush it out and use the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It will last a long time though, you only  need a small amoun to do the job.  </li>
            <li> (I normally shampoo/condition every other day, and can usually get two or three days out of a wash before my hair starts to look</li>
            <li> finally figured out that this shampoo is loaded with silicones that will build up and weigh down hair.</li>
            <li> But that coating is what weighs hair down and makes it flat.</li>
            <li> After using for several weeks, have detected little change in hair volume.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to spend 100$ to buy the expensive shampoo and conditioner I used to buy just to tame my frizzball of fine hair.</li>
            <li> I can’t get a comb thru my hair while its wet.</li>
            <li> But, by the next day, my hair looked limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair limp and gross by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with thin hair my whole life</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected and what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I use a silicone type serum afterwards (just a drop) then blow dry a little, then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I prefer to be pretty low maintenance with my hair though so it was a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Over the last 15 years, its become thin, flat, and only a little wavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Company sent coupons for other products but did NOT want to even try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use any other products again.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d rather find a larger container though because i have a lot of thick hair and blow through this bottle in a week or so.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner, it doesn’t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Does NOT weigh it down one bit.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I need to comb out my hair for fear of anyone seeing me looking like the Bride of Frankenstein after my shower, so I&#x27;ll use a small squirt of John Frieda Frizzeez Serum (a little goes a long way)</li>
            <li> LEFT MY HAIR COARSE AND DIFFICULT TO COMB.</li>
            <li> My hair length meets my shoulders, so I take less than a dime-size amount for my hair.</li>
            <li> Some work a little - others, not at all.</li>
            <li> All of the attention makes my hair very thick and the style last for about a week with tweeking in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Rinsing out immediately does nothing to build up any thickening of hair and leaving in for a few minutes over softens&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Am one of the few people that likes humidity.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the thickening part</li>
            <li> It was dried out, unhealthy and dull looking.</li>
            <li> I have found that I need to change up my products for my hair at least once a year.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair unmanigable and feels thick as well which is not comortable at all.</li>
            <li> it’s not good at detangling.</li>
            <li> This was no good either.</li>
            <li> Does it make thin hair look thicker?  </li>
            <li> Detangles well but doesn&#x27;t seem to add any volume to my thin hair</li>
            <li> was not impressed and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one, and I&#x27;m sorry I ever purchased it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not how it worked--</li>
            <li> My long, ever growing hair doesn&#x27;t get any knots when I use it, and I get horrible knots when I don&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll keep buying it for now.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with this one.</li>
            <li> The conditioner must be a bad product that the company turned out and then sold to Amazon for cheaper.</li>
            <li> bad container volume.</li>
            <li> and I was sick of the flatness</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try it with the John Frieda shampoo and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and the price.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love both the shampoo and the conditioner.  They make my thin fine hair feel thick and full of body, not to mention shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair a little too soft to maintain my style all day and I have to use more hair spray than I like....</li>
            <li> My hair is short, fine and straight.  This conditioner gives my hair tons of body and keeps it soft and nice to touch.  Also, love how it smells!  Totally important. Right?</li>
            <li> As someone with fine hair (curly) who is also dealing with hair loss due to a medical condition, I have tried just about every hair thickening shampoo/conditioner combo.  By far, this USED TO BE best.  When I useD it my hair was full, yet manageable and looks and feels soft and natural, but alas, John Frieda &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; it and I can no longer recommend it.</li>
            <li> I Love all the JOHN FRIEDA products..... My hair is baby fine hair and I have alot of problems getting a product that gives it volume but this brand is the best I have used....Thank-You</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through the shelves in the stores and salons. Picked this up on a whim at wally world and its the best. i have long straight fine hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now. My hair is soft and shinny and feels fuller without being sticky or coarse. I use this and let my hair dry natural. Its soft and tangle free. Plus my hair looks great the next day too.</li>
            <li> The bottle is what it says, the ounces are there. I really like it, I just wish I got a little more for my money. That being said, I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the thickening part but the smell is great and it leaves my hair feeling great. Will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> As far as volume goes, this product did not work as advertised - HOWEVER...&lt;br /&gt;It does work as a detangling conditioner. My long, ever growing hair doesn&#x27;t get any knots when I use it, and I get horrible knots when I don&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll keep buying it for now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change to the way my hair looked or felt.  I have straight, oily hair and am not one who &amp;#34;primps&amp;#34; so I just used the shampoo and this to clean my hair. Maybe it works if you blow dry and use product to get volume but just as a stand alone it didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> I love John Frieda products.  I have fine gray hair and this product helps the volume.</li>
            <li> After using for several weeks, have detected little change in hair volume.  I buy many John Freida products because they are consinstely true to thier advertisement.  However, this product is a disapointment.  Rinsing out immediately does nothing to build up any thickening of hair and leaving in for a few minutes over softens&lt;br /&gt;I was not impressed and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This left a residue in my hair that I didn&#x27;t like. I have fine dark blonde hair and was hoping it would leave it weightless and light.</li>
            <li> no noticeable difference with volume when I tried this product.  I purchased this because it was a $5 &#x27;add on item&#x27; from Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Made my fine hair dry....would not purchase again, but glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive but works really well!</li>
            <li> I expected more from a brand name product.This did nothing more than make my hair soft but not fuller.It is deceiving to state that it thickens hair because it does not do anything to make it thicker or give more volume.It does not do that at all.</li>
            <li> Overall it is ok: it does make you hair thicker (and it works best with matching Volume In-Shower Treatment), and adds volume. The problem is that, when applied to roots or near roots (as they suggest in instructions), it leaves my hair greasy, and overall my hair after this conditioner has somewhat sticky feeling to it, and less shine than, for example, when using their Anti-Frizz line</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Am one of the few people that likes humidity.  My German English hair can look like straw, but w/ this it has a curl to it.  Get lots of compliments at work when I use it.</li>
            <li> My conditioner was packed so poorly that I have only been able to smell it. I recommend ordering this product on its own without other items to avoid the same problem I had.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells nice.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this product from Ulta but found it on Amazon. I love the smell of this shampoo and it really does make my hair feel more voluminous and thickened. It lasts for quite a while and really good for the price point.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever. Stripped color from hair even though just colored Hair felt like straw&lt;br /&gt;Company sent coupons for other products but did NOT want to even try</li>
            <li> I have had baby fine hair my whole life, and now that I&#x27;m getting older it is thinning, as well. I think John Frieda Luxurious Volume product line was made for me! I am especially pleased with the Thickening Conditioner because conditioners have always flattened my hair, and this conditioner seems to add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works!&lt;br /&gt;As my hair thins, I have become more interested in using &#x27;volumizing&#x27; products. Some work a little - others, not at all. None of them really thicken the hair permanently.&lt;br /&gt;Of the dozen I have tried, this Conditioner from John Frieda (used along with the Frieda Volumizing Shampoo counterpart, does a better job than anything else I have found. Leaved my hair smooth, wavy and &#x27;appearing&#x27; thicker.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft but didn&#x27;t give it enough body.  I was looking for more like the TV Ads.</li>
            <li> Im still using it but its not giving much volume as I thought, so far it has been better than the other brands i have used becuase my hair feels ligther , but I cant seem to get volume in my problem areas like my bangs</li>
            <li> I just discovered John Frieda hair products and I have baby fine hair.  Their shampoo, conditioner and this product are all wonderful and my skin no longer looks dry and peels.  What a difference.</li>
            <li> The conditioner must be a bad product that the company turned out and then sold to Amazon for cheaper. I&#x27;ve bought this conditioner from CVS and the supermarket numerous times and love it. I thought I was getting a deal by getting it from Amazon, but instead of the creamy white conditioner that normally smooths my hair nicely, I got this soupy translucent stuff which I had to use double the conditioner than I normally use, thus the product was gone faster so I didn&#x27;t really save any money by getting this. It was like the cheap conditioner you buy in the store for $2 (Suave, etc). I have really curly hair, so I need good conditioner. If you don&#x27;t have that problem, then this product is fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and finely textured, so I&#x27;m always searching for volumizing shampoos. I decided to try this one, and I&#x27;m sorry I ever purchased it. My hair felt like straw! It was dried out, unhealthy and dull looking. It was also completely unruly and fly-away. I was expecting something much different. Terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for volume, do not order this product.  It flattened my hair and if possible made it feel more fine than it already is.</li>
            <li> Leaves a smooth hair without looking thin and oily, which is the problem with using regular conditioner with my hair. The volume isn&#x27;t that impressive though.</li>
            <li> Even though this is suppose to help with volume, this is also great for my coarse,dry,frizzy hair. This does a descent job at taming frizz and makes my hair look fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li> Hair feels nice, I have really fine hair and I have been keeping a hairdo using the shampoo and conditioner. NO Hairspray. Going to be swimming and in the sun a lot soon,  so will be switching up to his full repair strengthen  and restore for awhile... We Will See.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, does good to my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife is a regular user of this product and will not use to any other shampoo or conditioner despite the higher price</li>
            <li> USED ONE TIME IN CONJUNCTION WITH LUXURIOUS VOLUME FULL SPLENDOR SHAMPOO. LEFT MY HAIR COARSE AND DIFFICULT TO COMB. HAVE CONTACTED COMPANY ABOUT RETURNING FOR REFUND OR EXHANGE.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine so I don&#x27;t think any product will make miraculous changes in it but the conditioner is good</li>
            <li> A great product! After using it the hair is lush and soft! And do not require styling!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this condition works wonders! All of John Frieda&#x27;s products are fantastic - highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Nothing outstanding about it.  I feel nioxine works better.  It will last a long time though, you only  need a small amoun to do the job.  Probably will not order again.</li>
            <li> John Frieda&#x27;s Luxurious Volume products are my hands-down favorite for thin, limp or lifeless hair. And I think I have tried them all at this point. Love the scent too. JF is peerless in providing salon-quality hair at a great price.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I have ever used. I have regular fine hair, and as soon as I first used this in the shower, you can AUTOMATICALLY feel a difference. Its amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner, it doesn’t weigh your hair down. I’ve been using it in conjunction with the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Touchably Full Shampoo for over 2 weeks and there’s a noticeable difference in how my hair looks and feels. When I was younger my hair was thick, full and curly. Over the last 15 years, its become thin, flat, and only a little wavy. This combination of shampoo and conditioner brought life back to my hair, it feels soft and bouncy, it’s fuller and feels lighter. My curls haven’t come back to what they were in my 20s and 30s but there’s a definite revival going on! I would have given 5 stars, were it not for just one thing...  it’s not good at detangling. I can’t get a comb thru my hair while its wet. As it dries tho, the tangles seem to come out on their own. While this may be a deal breaker for some, it isn’t for me. Most of the conditioners I’ve tried have been good at detangling, almost like they leave a slippery coating on your hair that makes it easy to comb. But that coating is what weighs hair down and makes it flat. I don’t try to comb it, or use a hair dryer until my hair is about 50% dry. I run my fingers thru it and the tangles gently fall away. Sometimes I need to comb out my hair for fear of anyone seeing me looking like the Bride of Frankenstein after my shower, so I&#x27;ll use a small squirt of John Frieda Frizzeez Serum (a little goes a long way) and that is a big help at detangling.</li>
            <li> This is my  first time using John Frieda products. I like both the Shampoo and the Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase if the results stay the same.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as some other John Frieda products. I will not order again. I was unhappy with this one.</li>
            <li> great shampoo, I have used it some days back and still its not making my hair oily yet. I am in love with this shampoo. I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair soft, smooth, and de-tangeled.</li>
            <li> The regular John Frieda conditioner is better than this one.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEE!! I purchase the shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; i absalutely loved it! will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the thick and rich feel of this conditioner. It did a good job of adding volume for my hair. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I just came out of the shower after my first use of this conditioner. I have lost a clump of hair just now after applying this conditioner. I have pretty much the same problem with every conditoner. This was no good either. It smells good though. But causes hair loss.</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but I much prefer the Loreal EverPure volume shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so this product is great for making my hair feel thicker&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft and silky to the touch right after applying it to my hair&lt;br /&gt;No tangles at all after applying the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone&lt;br /&gt; the best I ever used, ever!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and silky. Easy to work out tangles. This isn&#x27;t going to be a magic bullet but this is a good conditioner at a middle-of-the-road price.</li>
            <li> Does not work well at all. Makes hair unmanigable and feels thick as well which is not comortable at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have found in a long time.  Really does make your hair feel thicker.  Try it with the John Frieda shampoo and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin, super-straight Asian hair, and was on the hunt for a new volumizing shampoo/conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of conditioners from cheap to high end, western and Japanese, co-washing, going silicone free, etc, but no matter what my hair always falls into a flat helmet after a few hours. Before using this shampoo, I&#x27;d been using a cheap silicone-free shampoo (herbal essences volumizing), and didn&#x27;t like how crunchy it made my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first use of this John Frieda conditioner, with the matching shampoo, left my hair soft, shiny, volumized, gorgeous. I was so excited that maybe I&#x27;d finally found my HG. But, by the next day, my hair looked limp and greasy. (I normally shampoo/condition every other day, and can usually get two or three days out of a wash before my hair starts to look oily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, no problem, I&#x27;ll just shampoo and condition every day if it means I get those results. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not how it worked-- each subsequent time I used this conditioner and shampoo, it left my hair soft but slick and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally figured out that this shampoo is loaded with silicones that will build up and weigh down hair. I get the best results by alternating the JF shampoo with a with a cheap &#x27;cone-free shampoo to clarify my hair, and using this conditioner after each shampoo but only on the ends of my hair. Otherwise, my hair becomes limp and slick, and gets greasy much more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: this is a pretty good conditioner for fine/thin hair, but make sure you clarify with a silicone-free shampoo or else you&#x27;ll never get those awesome bouncy results again.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the back first to see that this is made with a lightweight wax. For really fine hair any wax is a huge mistake. It makes my hair limp and gross by the end of the day. This happens even when I use only a tiny amount. I would skip it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  It has made a difference in my finished style.  More shine and less frizz.</li>
            <li> I have always been cursed with fine, flyaway hair. I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners that claim to make it thicker, but none have done so. I&#x27;ve always heard the best things about John Frieda products so I thought I&#x27;d try this one. I don&#x27;t know if it actually is any thicker, I don&#x27;t know if anything can do that, but it certainly feels like it, and that&#x27;s what counts! My husband can actually dig his hands into my hair instead of just raking through it. It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot of conditioner, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and make it look greasy either. It just looks fuller and healthier. I&#x27;ll be trying them again!</li>
            <li> Works great for my fine, thin, lifeless hair.  Does NOT weigh it down one bit.  Smells pleasant and not overly perfumy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner based on the reviews, but for me, I noticed no difference. My hair isn&#x27;t thin, but it is fine. After just using these two products and blow drying, it was no different than $.97 shampoo and conditioner. Wanted to love it, but I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Because I have very long but fine hair so when in the shower I always wet it and condition it first and using a brush get all of the tangles out, then I wash it two or three times with [[ASIN:B001BAFQOS John Frieda Luxurious Volume Touchably Full Shampoo , 8.45 Ounce]] .  Then I let it dry, blow dry and brush it out and use the [[ASIN:B005IVZPT2 John Frieda Luxurious Volume Lavish Lift Root Booster, 6.77 Oz (Pack of 6)]], let that dry (and sometimes blow dry again) and use a curling iron to style my hair before putting it back up.  All of the attention makes my hair very thick and the style last for about a week with tweeking in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and daughter made clear they can&#x27;t just have the shampoo, MUST also have the conditioner.  It is what they say works better than others they&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair due to medicines and age. This product works wonders for me , I also use the shampoo , the styling spray and the hair spray. I&#x27;ll never use any other products again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with thin hair my whole life and I was sick of the flatness so I decided to try this out for the first time. I have to say with the first use I LOVE it! I highly recommend using the shampoo with this for the full effect. It makes my hair shinier and fuller and I love it. I will be buying these products again and again and again!</li>
            <li> Does it work miracles?  No.  Does it make thin hair look thicker?  Absolutely.  Reasonable price, good product.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend conditioner.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, smells great and creates more body than conditioners I have tried for 3x the price!</li>
            <li> I needed to change products and decided to try this.  It has worked well and I have not tried another.</li>
            <li> Product works wonderful. Came with the entire end opened up and product leaking all over box. Shame on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine hair but a lot of it. Nobody thinks I have that much hair since it is so freaking fine. This stuff really makes it soft and takes a lot of the frizz out. I use a silicone type serum afterwards (just a drop) then blow dry a little, then let it air dry. My hair looks so, so much better now and I don&#x27;t have to spend 100$ to buy the expensive shampoo and conditioner I used to buy just to tame my frizzball of fine hair. I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I used a variety of John Frieda products with the Luxurious Volume line being the last. I never before had dandruff and suddenly I had greasy flakes building up on my scalp!  Every time I scratched my head I had flakes under my nails!  It was embarrassing. I never put two and two together; I simply thought the stress of school was causing scalp problems.  However, I switched to a biotin shampoo (nature&#x27;s gate) and I realized I haven&#x27;t had the gross scalp issues since. Perhaps I am sensitive to the ingredients in these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I did feel that the shampoo and conditioner gave my hair more body, and it smells good, but it&#x27;s not worth the dandruff issues.  It&#x27;s too bad because I enjoyed how the Sheer Blonde line made my hair look but I simply can&#x27;t use John Frieda products anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may work for many people but I believe there are better shampoos out there for thin hair.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner! smells and works great and cheaper online here than in stores!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner to use with my John Frieda shampoo which I&#x27;ve been using for years. I love this conditioner very much, it&#x27;s luxurious, smells fantastic, makes my very fine straight hair look shiny and healthy, and little thicker, This is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo after trying way too many products for my thin and medium length hair. I have used it 3 days back and still its not making my hair oily yet. I am in love with this shampoo. I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying I am a big an of many John Frieda products. I was very pleased with the Brilliant Brunette line and then the Sheer Blonde after dying my hair. After going lighter I noticed my hair seemed so much thinner than when brunette, so I decided to give this a try! To be honest if you&#x27;re just using this on it&#x27;s own without really doing a voluminous style afterwards, you won&#x27;t get much volume. It does help enhance the volume if you are styling it afterwards, especially with some mousse or what have you. I prefer to be pretty low maintenance with my hair though so it was a bit of a disappointment. At least it left my long blonde hair feeling super silky and not greasy as such conditioner&#x27;s often do.</li>
            <li> Detangles well but doesn&#x27;t seem to add any volume to my thin hair</li>
            <li> good hair volume. bad container volume. will maybe buy again...i&#x27;d rather find a larger container though because i have a lot of thick hair and blow through this bottle in a week or so. that&#x27;s not really worth the price.</li>
            <li> my hair feels a lot healthier after using john friedas conditioners. I actually used the Full Repair Conditioner for color treated hair before i used this one, but my hair still feels great so its a &#x27;buy again&#x27; for me! Not so much thickening, but it feels strengthened, moisturized, and less fried. im happy with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected and what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I read such good reviews on this John Frieda line and I had high hopes.  Unfortunately my fine, thin, flat hair was not changed by this product.  I used it each time I shampooed for a matter of weeks and I saw no change.  Additionally, I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I first found out about this John Frieda conditioner when I purchased one of his hair color products.  It really is fantastic!  The key is that it does not take much, otherwise, the product won&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to do. My hair length meets my shoulders, so I take less than a dime-size amount for my hair. Then, I spread it on both hands and work it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try different amounts to see what works best for your hair length. It does work, and I love the product!</li>
            <li> leaves my hair and soft and full.</li>
            <li> I got a sample in the mail that I tried; like it and went on to purchase it for my hair.  I have found that I need to change up my products for my hair at least once a year.  This does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> As usual products that say &amp;#34;will make even fine hair feel thicker&amp;#34; is never true.  My hair fell flat as it always does.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
