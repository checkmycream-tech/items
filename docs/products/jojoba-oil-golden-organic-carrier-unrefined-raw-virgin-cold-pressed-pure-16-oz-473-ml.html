            <li>This is my favorite carrier oil!</li>
            <li>and I will surely be buying from this company again!</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this oil and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful golden color!</li>
            <li>Large affordable bottle with a wonderful oil</li>
            <li>This stuff is just amazing.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had it for a couple of days and the result is amazing</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfectly moist the whole day.</li>
            <li>It has no smell which is good, but I have not noticed it leaves my skin any more moisturized than baby oil.</li>
            <li>Great oil, exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Its a light oil and smells good.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best jojoba oil I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>cost  is high but product is very good</li>
            <li>Excellent oil and SUPER FAST shipping!</li>
            <li>but I  was turned off by the top.</li>
            <li>This product could have gotten 5 stars but that top hurt it.</li>
            <li>Love this oil and will buy again.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp love jojoba oil, and my pocket book loves the price I can get it for here.</li>
            <li>it makes it much more manageable too.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is probably my favorite oil to use.</li>
            <li>and I love it .</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my hair/scalp to correct dryness.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil  </li>
            <li>but I love the oil.</li>
            <li>I love Jojoba oil smell however this one has no smell</li>
            <li>Love this jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>Nice light oil.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>I NEED MORE</li>
            <li>Also there is no smell which I love.</li>
            <li>well, maybe it felt that way when I used my favorite Estee Lauder creams.</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>Excited!</li>
            <li>but I pour this in my hand and the bottle do not contain a top that is hand friendly if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li>I have bought organic jojoba oil before and quite frankly this one smells really strong and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>It really helped to keep my exceptionally dry/cracked hands smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even added a blend of organic lavender and sweet orange essential oil for even greater benefits (smells great too).</li>
            <li>I made several infusions and added them to my recipes for lotions and potions and they were all improved greatly.  </li>
            <li>Great carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I use this oil in my hair, and the price and overall quality is great, and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>This oil shipped same day as ordered so that was great.</li>
            <li>This makes a fantastic carrier oil.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil works well on skin prone to psoriasis as it&#x27;s closest to the oil our bodies produce naturally, and this is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I like it,  good moisturizer for natural hair.</li>
            <li>Well, it works good, although if you use too much, then it does leave your hair a bit oily, but just a few drops seems to work great for the drones in my scalp</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin moisturized and happy all day long.</li>
            <li>The price of this high quality oil is great and it always delivered super fast.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>A drop will clean out ur ears too.</li>
            <li>I use this on my arms and legs at night and leaves them super smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This also reduces splotches and such because both neem and jojoba are good at that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just arrived today with a full year on the expiration date.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh sent.</li>
            <li>i use this on my face daily and in sugar scrubs daily, perfect!</li>
            <li>It came quick but didn&#x27;t have a seal under the lid.</li>
            <li>It is silky and mild.</li>
            <li>Obsorbs quickly and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>price was right, the shipping was fine, the packaging was all right, too.</li>
            <li>love it for my face mixed with essential oils its great.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality oil that works great as a daily face &amp; body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile!!</li>
            <li>, my hair feels is super soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I was kind of leary as to why if it is pure and unrefined oil, it is so clear.</li>
            <li>This oil is so reasonably priced and so readily available that I would recommend this seller and product to all my family.</li>
            <li>good product, did what i expected it to do.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>it seems to fade scars away and significantly reduced my acne and protects me from it so much so that i can look in the mirror</li>
            <li>My second purchase I loved everything so much about my first order I decided to order from this seller every time I want Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li>The price for this organic jojoba oil at 16 whole oz.is pretty good, given that it costs the same as an 8 oz bottle of organic jojoba oil elsewhere.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like it fell right out of heaven.</li>
            <li>I normally use Cetaphil moisturing cream (which is good) but wanted something less aqueous more oily for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this oil for years (especially in the winter months) combined with  a bit of coconut oil and my favorite scented oils to put on my body after a shower...</li>
            <li>This was the first product I purchased as a massage oil</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried jojoba oil</li>
            <li>I use this oil daily, love it</li>
            <li>but overall it has defenitly inproved the look and healthy look in my skin.</li>
            <li>Actually, it is not an oil but a wax with sebum similar to the sebaceous glands secretion that makes it perfect for the human body.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Will be back for more..</li>
            <li>First review amazon wouldn&#x27;t allow me to post for some reason.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted&lt;</li>
            <li>, then I rinse with warm water, towel dry gently, and use about 5-6 drops of oil all over my face.  </li>
            <li>Will last a good long time!</li>
            <li>Pour it straight from a large spout?</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face, I break out and get the dry red checks and forehead, put this on my face and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li>I would be very cautious using this product as one does not know the source from where it comes in Mexico.</li>
            <li>before i got this, my hair wasn&#x27;t very shiny.</li>
            <li>I simply enjoy and plan to make this a daily requirement for my health needs.</li>
            <li>What I do is use Blum tea tree oil wipes at night to gently wipe any grime from my face</li>
            <li>The results are very desirable.</li>
            <li>Very one should have this in stock</li>
            <li>It is also effective as an occasional deep hair/scalp conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems to love it just as much as other jojoba oils</li>
            <li>It is also much better than other jojoba oils that I tried.</li>
            <li>I mostly use this to remove my makeup, it&#x27;s the only oil that gets all of my makeup off entirely</li>
            <li>and it is a decent product that I would repurchase.</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>
            <li>High quality oil.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product and I&#x27;ve bought this from them twice now.</li>
            <li>Product as described and of high quality.</li>
            <li>This organic golden jojoba oil is great because it cleanses and moisturizes my 4 year old little boy and 7 year old little girls&#x27; hair and scalp in between shampoos.</li>
            <li>I know my natural hair absolutely loves this.</li>
            <li>But I do not want any harsh chemicals on my face any more.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase if God lets me live when I run out</li>
            <li>Next time, I will shop more carefully.</li>
            <li>i made a hot oil treatment with it and it instantly made my hair as shiny as a new penney and softer than a pillow.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this oil, I have seen my complexion completely change, I am no longer needing to wear make-up after eight years of never leaving the house without it!</li>
            <li>mix 10 parts jojoba to 1 part neem oil for my face, and scrub the oil into my face gently with a hot wet washcloth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the closest thing to our natural sebum.  </li>
            <li>It took about a month to get rid of all my acne completely.  </li>
            <li>I love that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I shower and rinse my face with warm water, towel dry gently and use about 3-4 drops of oil all over my face, a little less than at night</li>
            <li>It is not yellow in color, it is very clear.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty extreme eczema</li>
            <li>It soaks in pretty quickly, so no oily aftermath.</li>
            <li>It tends to stick to the skin pretty well -  after you apply it you will need to wash your hands a few times to get it off.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product could have gotten 5 stars but that top hurt it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and will buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp love jojoba oil, and my pocket book loves the price I can get it for here.</li>
            <li> it makes it much more manageable too.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is probably my favorite oil to use.</li>
            <li> and I love it .</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for my hair/scalp to correct dryness.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil  </li>
            <li> but I love the oil.</li>
            <li> I love Jojoba oil smell however this one has no smell</li>
            <li> Love this jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Nice light oil.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> I NEED MORE</li>
            <li> Also there is no smell which I love.</li>
            <li> well, maybe it felt that way when I used my favorite Estee Lauder creams.</li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> Excited!</li>
            <li> but I pour this in my hand and the bottle do not contain a top that is hand friendly if you catch my drift.</li>
            <li> I have bought organic jojoba oil before and quite frankly this one smells really strong and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> It really helped to keep my exceptionally dry/cracked hands smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even added a blend of organic lavender and sweet orange essential oil for even greater benefits (smells great too).</li>
            <li> I made several infusions and added them to my recipes for lotions and potions and they were all improved greatly.  </li>
            <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my hair, and the price and overall quality is great, and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This oil shipped same day as ordered so that was great.</li>
            <li> This makes a fantastic carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil works well on skin prone to psoriasis as it&#x27;s closest to the oil our bodies produce naturally, and this is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I like it,  good moisturizer for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Well, it works good, although if you use too much, then it does leave your hair a bit oily, but just a few drops seems to work great for the drones in my scalp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin moisturized and happy all day long.</li>
            <li> The price of this high quality oil is great and it always delivered super fast.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> A drop will clean out ur ears too.</li>
            <li> I use this on my arms and legs at night and leaves them super smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This also reduces splotches and such because both neem and jojoba are good at that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just arrived today with a full year on the expiration date.</li>
            <li> Light, fresh sent.</li>
            <li> i use this on my face daily and in sugar scrubs daily, perfect!</li>
            <li> It came quick but didn&#x27;t have a seal under the lid.</li>
            <li> It is silky and mild.</li>
            <li> Obsorbs quickly and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> price was right, the shipping was fine, the packaging was all right, too.</li>
            <li> love it for my face mixed with essential oils its great.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality oil that works great as a daily face &amp; body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very versatile!!</li>
            <li> , my hair feels is super soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was kind of leary as to why if it is pure and unrefined oil, it is so clear.</li>
            <li> This oil is so reasonably priced and so readily available that I would recommend this seller and product to all my family.</li>
            <li> good product, did what i expected it to do.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it seems to fade scars away and significantly reduced my acne and protects me from it so much so that i can look in the mirror</li>
            <li> My second purchase I loved everything so much about my first order I decided to order from this seller every time I want Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> The price for this organic jojoba oil at 16 whole oz.is pretty good, given that it costs the same as an 8 oz bottle of organic jojoba oil elsewhere.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like it fell right out of heaven.</li>
            <li> I normally use Cetaphil moisturing cream (which is good) but wanted something less aqueous more oily for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for years (especially in the winter months) combined with  a bit of coconut oil and my favorite scented oils to put on my body after a shower...</li>
            <li> This was the first product I purchased as a massage oil</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried jojoba oil</li>
            <li> I use this oil daily, love it</li>
            <li> but overall it has defenitly inproved the look and healthy look in my skin.</li>
            <li> Actually, it is not an oil but a wax with sebum similar to the sebaceous glands secretion that makes it perfect for the human body.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Will be back for more..</li>
            <li> First review amazon wouldn&#x27;t allow me to post for some reason.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted&lt;</li>
            <li> , then I rinse with warm water, towel dry gently, and use about 5-6 drops of oil all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Will last a good long time!</li>
            <li> Pour it straight from a large spout?</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face, I break out and get the dry red checks and forehead, put this on my face and it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I would be very cautious using this product as one does not know the source from where it comes in Mexico.</li>
            <li> before i got this, my hair wasn&#x27;t very shiny.</li>
            <li> I simply enjoy and plan to make this a daily requirement for my health needs.</li>
            <li> What I do is use Blum tea tree oil wipes at night to gently wipe any grime from my face</li>
            <li> The results are very desirable.</li>
            <li> Very one should have this in stock</li>
            <li> It is also effective as an occasional deep hair/scalp conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems to love it just as much as other jojoba oils</li>
            <li> It is also much better than other jojoba oils that I tried.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this to remove my makeup, it&#x27;s the only oil that gets all of my makeup off entirely</li>
            <li> and it is a decent product that I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Very soft!</li>
            <li> High quality oil.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality product and I&#x27;ve bought this from them twice now.</li>
            <li> Product as described and of high quality.</li>
            <li> This organic golden jojoba oil is great because it cleanses and moisturizes my 4 year old little boy and 7 year old little girls&#x27; hair and scalp in between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I know my natural hair absolutely loves this.</li>
            <li> But I do not want any harsh chemicals on my face any more.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase if God lets me live when I run out</li>
            <li> Next time, I will shop more carefully.</li>
            <li> i made a hot oil treatment with it and it instantly made my hair as shiny as a new penney and softer than a pillow.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this oil, I have seen my complexion completely change, I am no longer needing to wear make-up after eight years of never leaving the house without it!</li>
            <li> mix 10 parts jojoba to 1 part neem oil for my face, and scrub the oil into my face gently with a hot wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the closest thing to our natural sebum.  </li>
            <li> It took about a month to get rid of all my acne completely.  </li>
            <li> I love that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I shower and rinse my face with warm water, towel dry gently and use about 3-4 drops of oil all over my face, a little less than at night</li>
            <li> It is not yellow in color, it is very clear.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty extreme eczema</li>
            <li> It soaks in pretty quickly, so no oily aftermath.</li>
            <li> It tends to stick to the skin pretty well -  after you apply it you will need to wash your hands a few times to get it off.  </li>
            <li> using my personal info online for any reason, so when I only received part of the order the 1st pkg, I was very concerned, but the other part came a few days later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure this is really jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> This Jojoba oil has a somewhat different color and smell than other jojoba oil&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so if you have really dry skin, I would give this a go.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate adult acne ever since having my daughter eight years ago, and I have tried everything, and I mean everything, I have spent thousands on facials and junk beauty products.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for quantity, with the quick service you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of jojoba, one drop each of these essential oils, lavender, frankincense, lemon, elemi-tissue repair and cracked skin, patchouli - tones the skin and prevents wrinkles and rosemary.</li>
            <li> - it is not the quality of jojoba oil that I expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this is a 16 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so crazy how we waste so much money on man made products that never work , when God already gave us a natural solution that won&#x27;t harm you!</li>
            <li> it actually tricks the sebiscus glands into thinking they already did their job, so they produce very little sebum.</li>
            <li> You can use alone or mix with other oils.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any cleansers at all and have absolutely no pimples!  </li>
            <li> Works good smells awful.</li>
            <li> I use this on my arms and legs and think it makes the wrinkling much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Oil is less</li>
            <li> It has little or no smell.  </li>
            <li> leaves my skin a little oily....</li>
            <li> The label is a little suspicious to me because it seems as if it was printed off of a printer rather than from a legit company specializing in oil distribution.</li>
            <li> I use it from head to toe everyday.</li>
            <li> Recommend putting small amounts in a pump dispenser bottle to make it convenient</li>
            <li> all you need is 2 small drops to spread on your face</li>
            <li> I will never go back to complicated beauty routines and overly drying, chemical laden products.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why people give this product a 5 start.  </li>
            <li> The color is very, very pale, it does not look like or smell like jojoba oil to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so far I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction from it.</li>
            <li> I will use it, however seems thick.</li>
            <li> Not a very happy customer at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the authenticity of this oil being raw and cold press, even being 100% jojoba oil</li>
            <li> A thin oil with a subtle aroma.</li>
            <li> The oil is very thick</li>
            <li> I no longer get big breakouts, very few breakouts at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was used to make a chaparral infusion and unfortunately spilled in the process</li>
            <li> Apologies if I am wrong, but the bottle arrived without a seal under the cap, AND it has no odor to it at all.</li>
            <li> am very insecure re:</li>
            <li> that what it says it is :(  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just received this oil &amp; it is NOT verified organic. Anyone can put &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; on a label! This company sells everywhere... from Etsy to eBay. I would be very cautious using this product as one does not know the source from where it comes in Mexico. Looks like the label was made on someone&#x27;s computer.</li>
            <li> High quality oil.  I use it to make lotion.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase! Will last a good long time! I&#x27;ll buy this again in the future!</li>
            <li> Oil is good but I  was turned off by the top. If I  was going to refill another bottle with this product than it would not matter but I pour this in my hand and the bottle do not contain a top that is hand friendly if you catch my drift. This product could have gotten 5 stars but that top hurt it.</li>
            <li> Use it fory acne it was and is great I will repurchase if God lets me live when I run out</li>
            <li> Great just what I wanted</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something close to &amp;#34;natural skin oil&amp;#34; I suggest that you give this a try.  I normally use Cetaphil moisturing cream (which is good) but wanted something less aqueous more oily for my sensitive skin.  I use this on my arms and legs and think it makes the wrinkling much less noticeable.  It has little or no smell.  It tends to stick to the skin pretty well -  after you apply it you will need to wash your hands a few times to get it off.  A little goes a long way and this is a 16 oz bottle.  Recommend putting small amounts in a pump dispenser bottle to make it convenient</li>
            <li> Excellent skincare oil!! Very versatile!!</li>
            <li> received in a prompt manner. Good pricing.</li>
            <li> Jojoba Oil is the all around awesome oil for body and hair.  I know my natural hair absolutely loves this. It&#x27;s the closest thing to our natural sebum.  You can use alone or mix with other oils. Well, I do. Love It!</li>
            <li> cost  is high but product is very good</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. I use it after a shower and it keeps me from drying out for days.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality oil that works great as a daily face &amp; body moisturizer.  It is also effective as an occasional deep hair/scalp conditioner.  When I leave it in my hair overnight, then wash and condition the next morning, my hair feels is super soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Read about this oil, stating it was good for the hair.  Well, it works good, although if you use too much, then it does leave your hair a bit oily, but just a few drops seems to work great for the drones in my scalp</li>
            <li> Love this oil and will buy again. Its a light oil and smells good. I use it for skin and hair</li>
            <li> I will use it, however seems thick.</li>
            <li> excellent product, will buy again</li>
            <li> love it for my face mixed with essential oils its great.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp love jojoba oil, and my pocket book loves the price I can get it for here.</li>
            <li> Only jojoba oil I&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
            <li> This stuff is just amazing. it&#x27;s like it fell right out of heaven. it&#x27;s great for hair. before i got this, my hair wasn&#x27;t very shiny. i made a hot oil treatment with it and it instantly made my hair as shiny as a new penney and softer than a pillow. it makes it much more manageable too. it&#x27;s great on skin too. all you need is 2 small drops to spread on your face and it&#x27;s perfectly moist the whole day. no excess oil because the jojoba oil is almost identical to human sebum. it actually tricks the sebiscus glands into thinking they already did their job, so they produce very little sebum. it seems to fade scars away and significantly reduced my acne and protects me from it so much so that i can look in the mirror and i don&#x27;t notice it. i&#x27;ve had it for a couple of days and the result is amazing it also reduces all sorts of acne by getting under the skin and breaking up the sebum build up. now if you plan to use this for acne, i suggest you keep a 5-10 % benzoil peroxide wash to clense your face 2 times a day because this isn&#x27;t a cleanser. but reguardless, like a gift from above, everyone should have a bottle!!!</li>
            <li> i use this on my face daily and in sugar scrubs daily, perfect!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS OIL!  I use it on my hair and face.  It really helped to keep my exceptionally dry/cracked hands smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It came quick but didn&#x27;t have a seal under the lid. Makes me Leary of what is or could be in the bottle when I paid for jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> A thin oil with a subtle aroma. Great for using as a massage - when you don&#x27;t want to feel all &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; after.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin. I&#x27;ve used this oil for years (especially in the winter months) combined with  a bit of coconut oil and my favorite scented oils to put on my body after a shower...before I leave the shower. A drop will clean out ur ears too. Best deal for what you get!</li>
            <li> I have already reordered this. I made several infusions and added them to my recipes for lotions and potions and they were all improved greatly.  Excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> This was the first product I purchased as a massage oil and I like it.  It is not too oily and has no smell.</li>

            <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great oil, exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Best affordable jojoba oil ever! Keep up the good work because you are for the people. Amen!</li>
            <li> Works good smells awful.</li>
            <li> I chose this product for its price and it is organic and processed for what I was looking for , unrefined for skin use. It is a beautiful golden color! I would recommend this and I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful oil I have used. I just love it. I use it from head to toe everyday. It is silky and mild. It does not leave me feeling oily. It keeps my skin like silk. It has cleared up my dandruff problem and help my shedding problem. I will always have it on hand from now on.</li>
            <li> good product, did what i expected it to do.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my hair, and the price and overall quality is great, and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this oil and the smell is pleasant. I will be using this one a lot.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is probably my favorite oil to use. I mostly use this to remove my makeup, it&#x27;s the only oil that gets all of my makeup off entirely and I also use it as a body moisturizer. It&#x27;s the closest oil you can buy to human sebum so if you have really dry skin, I would give this a go. Great oil for a great price!</li>
            <li> It is not USDA certified organic.  I&#x27;m not really sure this is really jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I just bought this oil! Fast shipping! This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried jojoba oil and I love it . It absorbs in the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy ! I have very sensitive skin on my face, I break out and get the dry red checks and forehead, put this on my face and it feels amazing! Very soft! A little goes a long way! Nice big bottle and I will surely be buying from this company again! It&#x27;s so crazy how we waste so much money on man made products that never work , when God already gave us a natural solution that won&#x27;t harm you! Try it ! It&#x27;s totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I use this oil daily, love it</li>
            <li> No spout for a bottle top?!? Pour it straight from a large spout? Ugh?</li>
            <li> leaves my skin a little oily....but overall it has defenitly inproved the look and healthy look in my skin. i will continue to use</li>
            <li> I read up on jojoba oil before looking to purchase so i knew what to look for in a quality oil This is it. Remarkable difference in my skin! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I mix Jojoba, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, and Coconut Oil together for a wonderful body and face Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this Jojoba Oil for my hair and skin.  Actually, it is not an oil but a wax with sebum similar to the sebaceous glands secretion that makes it perfect for the human body. I had problems with it being manufactured in Mexico and not the United States.  Next time, I will shop more carefully.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for several weeks now.  It is by far the best jojoba oil I have ever used.  I use it mostly for my hair/scalp to correct dryness.  It helped immediately.  I use it every day and will only buy this brand from now on!</li>
            <li> Large affordable bottle with a wonderful oil I love this oil  I use it on my entire skin and my hair</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great quality product, and great price!</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil works well on skin prone to psoriasis as it&#x27;s closest to the oil our bodies produce naturally, and this is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> just what I needed price great will shop here as need be.</li>
            <li> This Jojoba oil has a somewhat different color and smell than other jojoba oil&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. Perhaps because it is unrefined. My skin seems to love it just as much as other jojoba oils I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix 10 parts jojoba to 1 part neem oil for my face, and scrub the oil into my face gently with a hot wet washcloth. This keeps my skin moisturized and happy all day long. This also reduces splotches and such because both neem and jojoba are good at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Raederle Phoenix&lt;br /&gt;Nutritionist</li>
            <li> If your looking for quantity, with the quick service you can&#x27;t go wrong. I will definitely reorder. Once my order was sumitted, a day or two later it arrived. Talk about response time, As for the product, it helps with skin and hair needs. I simply enjoy and plan to make this a daily requirement for my health needs. So if your looking for bang for you buck this is it!!!</li>
            <li> It was delivered in a timely manner and got to my place without any issues after opening. It was used to make a chaparral infusion and unfortunately spilled in the process but what we could salvage worked really nice! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have bought organic jojoba oil before and quite frankly this one smells really strong and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Only downside not glass bottle.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!!! I have had moderate adult acne ever since having my daughter eight years ago, and I have tried everything, and I mean everything, I have spent thousands on facials and junk beauty products.  Since I started using this oil, I have seen my complexion completely change, I am no longer needing to wear make-up after eight years of never leaving the house without it! It took about a month to get rid of all my acne completely.  What I do is use Blum tea tree oil wipes at night to gently wipe any grime from my face, then I rinse with warm water, towel dry gently, and use about 5-6 drops of oil all over my face.  In the morning, I shower and rinse my face with warm water, towel dry gently and use about 3-4 drops of oil all over my face, a little less than at night so I am not too oily for the day.  I will never go back to complicated beauty routines and overly drying, chemical laden products.  I don&#x27;t use any cleansers at all and have absolutely no pimples!  I am so happy, I will buy this forever!!!</li>
            <li> Face, Hair, Feet, Legs - where does one not need some extra smoothing help during the winter. I use this everywhere, and it&#x27;s my miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Excellent oil and SUPER FAST shipping!</li>
            <li> I was happy with how quickly this arrived and with how it was packaged and the quality of the oil itself is great.  I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Customer service support great!  Oil is less that what it says it is :(  but I love the oil.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Perfect for blending oils, almost no scent, which I prefer.  Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair, nails, &amp; skin. The results are very desirable.</li>
            <li> I love Jojoba oil smell however this one has no smell what so ever. It still got  the job done.</li>
            <li> My second purchase I loved everything so much about my first order I decided to order from this seller every time I want Jojoba Oil. The service was fast,product and was well packed,this Jojoba Oil is probably the best on the market. Will be back for more..</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase I love this oil andl my hair does as well is this is the oil you&#x27;re looking for you can buy with confidence</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this oil! It does not have a scent and foes not make my face feel oily at all. I use it as a moisturizer and I have found that I can use this in the morning before I apply make-up because it is not greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Packaging sufficient . I will be using it in my homemade soaps. Excited!</li>
            <li> Not sure why people give this product a 5 start.  I bought it trusting that it was as good as the rating stated it to be. I also bought it because  it said on the label 100% organic, unrefined, virgin &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; Jojoba oil.  This product does not look like  jojoba oil at all.  It is not yellow in color, it is very clear.  I was kind of leary as to why if it is pure and unrefined oil, it is so clear. I tried contacting  H&amp;B over the phone to ask the question but the company&#x27;s number is nowhere to be found neither on Amazon or the Internet.  Not a very happy customer at this point.</li>
            <li> Love this jojoba oil. It works great for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I use this as a carrier oil for my whipped butter lotions.  It comes out perfectly!  No clogging of pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the authenticity of this oil being raw and cold press, even being 100% jojoba oil BUT it works for me. I have pretty extreme eczema and so far I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction from it.</li>
            <li> Best Jojoba Oil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil--love it for eye make up removal.also use it to dilute my essential oils--.wonderful for the skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Truly unscented. Nice light oil. I use this on my arms and legs at night and leaves them super smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS I NEED MORE</li>
            <li> Really great as DIY lotion. Obsorbs quickly and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I have DISCONTINUED toxic lotions! I use a few drops of jojoba, one drop each of these essential oils, lavender, frankincense, lemon, elemi-tissue repair and cracked skin, patchouli - tones the skin and prevents wrinkles and rosemary. All the essential oils are incredible for repairing the skin and the jojoba is an awesome carrier oil that helps to moisturize the skin. I use this formula all over my body!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternative Health  - Debbie Gordon  facebook</li>
            <li> Very one should have this in stock</li>
            <li> I like the product. It was package to where it would not spill and it is a decent product that I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> First review amazon wouldn&#x27;t allow me to post for some reason. This oil shipped same day as ordered so that was great. just arrived today with a full year on the expiration date. got this oil for my wooden body jewelry. keeps skin from drying out while wearing. may also use with shea butter lotions. to be decided at a later date,</li>
            <li> The oil is very thick and I cannot put it into a spray bottle like I can with baby oil or sesame oil. It has no smell which is good, but I have not noticed it leaves my skin any more moisturized than baby oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is so reasonably priced and so readily available that I would recommend this seller and product to all my family.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Apologies if I am wrong, but the bottle arrived without a seal under the cap, AND it has no odor to it at all. The color is very, very pale, it does not look like or smell like jojoba oil to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was right, the shipping was fine, the packaging was all right, too. It simply does not appear to be jojoba oil - OR - it is not the quality of jojoba oil that I expected.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensative skin, I also use it as an all over moisturizer. I love that a little goes a long way. Also there is no smell which I love. Will be reordering soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this oil once a day on my face and neck, after shower. The skin feel so good like it never felt before... well, maybe it felt that way when I used my favorite Estee Lauder creams. But I do not want any harsh chemicals on my face any more. I am very happy with this oil. It is also much better than other jojoba oils that I tried.</li>
            <li> I use this for everything. Cuticle oil, in my conditioner, face mask, homemade sugar scrubs. I LOVE IT!!!! Perfect Buy.</li>
            <li> very good price with good quality</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;I am very insecure re: using my personal info online for any reason, so when I only received part of the order the 1st pkg, I was very concerned, but the other part came a few days later.</li>
            <li> I mix the oil with my body lotion.  Item delivered on time.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This organic golden jojoba oil is great because it cleanses and moisturizes my 4 year old little boy and 7 year old little girls&#x27; hair and scalp in between shampoos. It is great for shaving, and I use it on my kids&#x27; skin after bath as well as my hands. I&#x27;ve even added a blend of organic lavender and sweet orange essential oil for even greater benefits (smells great too). The price for this organic jojoba oil at 16 whole oz.is pretty good, given that it costs the same as an 8 oz bottle of organic jojoba oil elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Jojoba is great for the skin. It soaks in pretty quickly, so no oily aftermath. This is a high quality product and I&#x27;ve bought this from them twice now. I use it in my OCM routine and it&#x27;s great. I also have an oil mixture next to the bedside to use before I go to sleep. Its 48% jojoba oil, 48% coconut oil, 1 % avocado oil, and 1 % argan oil.  It&#x27;s heavenly!</li>
            <li> This oil is now a permanent part of my beauty regimen!  Also works great for heat infusion!</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m a repeat customer and always order my jojoba oil from H&amp;B. The price of this high quality oil is great and it always delivered super fast.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time by the seller. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this bottle but my skin loves it. The label is a little suspicious to me because it seems as if it was printed off of a printer rather than from a legit company specializing in oil distribution. Whatever the case my face LOVES THIS OIL. I use it as a moisturizer and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil to wash my face and as a leave on moisturizer for over a year now. I love it, I no longer get big breakouts, very few breakouts at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like it,  good moisturizer for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. Light, fresh sent. Good, non greasy feel.</li>
            <li> product arrived well packaged and in good time. Product as described and of high quality. This makes a fantastic carrier oil.</li>
