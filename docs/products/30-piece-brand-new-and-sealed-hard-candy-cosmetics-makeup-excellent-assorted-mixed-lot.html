            <li>the lip glosses are good quality nice assortment of colors and very silky not sticky at all</li>
            <li>Everything was new, sealed, and in good shape, and there was a nice variety of products.</li>
            <li>I found this was pretty much good for me</li>
            <li>Great makeup great price wish shipping was free other</li>
            <li>All makeup is new and sealed, great colors and fab price.</li>
            <li>well it is still an amazing thing to get so worth the 30 dollars.</li>
            <li>Really cool way to buy makeup!</li>
            <li>Amazing thank you very helpful!</li>
            <li>Enjoy the makeup will buy again</li>
            <li>Makes for great stocking stuffers for sisters or female coworkers!!</li>
            <li>I actually got 31 products not counting those that came with a sample or the 2 nail polishes packaged together, which is great because I got 4 mascara</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic deal.  </li>
            <li>I must say cheap isn&#x27;t always everthing.</li>
            <li>love it completely worth the like 26 dollars for it</li>
            <li>BUT CHEAP</li>
            <li>Everything was in original packaging and sealed, nothing expired.</li>
            <li>I am planning to buy another set soon because it was so exciting!</li>
            <li>, this stuff is awesome for little girl make overs as well- its all glittery and fun colors.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, good things but mostly lipgloss.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I are both very happy with our Hard Candy makeup.</li>
            <li>This is the best hard candy products.</li>
            <li>I like receiving a mystery box full of makeup</li>
            <li>If you are older or a professional it may not be the perfect or best makeup for you, but if you are younger like in middle school or high school</li>
            <li>Probably more fit for young girls who are just playing around with makeup</li>
            <li>it was so much fun opening all the items and seeing all the cool makeup that I can use.</li>
            <li>I already love Hard Candy makeup, so when I recieved my makeup it was like christmas, loved it.</li>
            <li>And the colors of my eyeshadow are more for a five year old.</li>
            <li>So fun opening it</li>
            <li>It was so much fun opening it.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll have fun experimenting with everything.</li>
            <li>They were prompt and courteous I would definitely suggest buying this!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The day I got this in the mail was such a fun day!!!  </li>
            <li>I had also received multiple metallic cream eye shadow&#x27;s (5 to be exact), which i didn&#x27;t mind because they were all colors i liked.</li>
            <li>So excited, all was high quality.</li>
            <li>Shipping time was super fast</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very very picky about my makeup</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It came on time but that is the only ok thing about it.</li>
            <li>Only some was useable and mostly duplicated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll more than likely buy another assortment closer to summer.</li>
            <li>A lot of pretty makeup</li>
            <li>First it came in a bubble envelope and in the picture you can see that it looks like it comes in a box.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>The package arrived much earlier than what was expected, which is great.</li>
            <li>First off, the shipping was insanely fast....</li>
            <li>(it should be 3.5) is because there was about 10 items that I wasn&#x27;t happy with and out of the other 20, only like 10 of them</li>
            <li>Y&#x27;all should come up with packages  that have certain colors in it.</li>
            <li>, i just wished that i had gotten some more lip glosses and less mascara and the right skin</li>
            <li>but they came with really tacky rings for five year olds.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Threw the whole box out.</li>
            <li>and I now have so much makeup.</li>
            <li>What am I do with so much lip ware?</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>then real makup</li>
            <li>it ssssoooooo much  </li>
            <li>and i would defiantly buy again thank you soo much</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>but I was overall thrilled with all the product I recieved only two-three of the items</li>
            <li>There were even some unexpected items, like temp tattoos and lash growth treatment, which my teen daughter will love.</li>
            <li>and it had cool teen glamour.</li>
            <li>I got a full variety from mascara, eyeshadow, glitter, lash tinsel, bronzer, blush and a bunch of other fun things.</li>
            <li>Go to the store and buy some new makeup!</li>
            <li>and I am really looking forward to wear all my new cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Could use more founation and less sparkles eye make up</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>was so exicted to get it just wish it had a little more varity....75% was lipgloss....</li>
            <li>Most of the stuff was dried up.</li>
            <li>it had a sticker on it that said new</li>
            <li>all brand new.</li>
            <li>Everything was new and packaged also.</li>
            <li>All new makeup in sealed packaging.</li>
            <li>Overall, I know from buying hard candy makeup in stores, that this was a good deal on the amount and price.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and was missing 5 products, but I emailed them and they happily sent the missing 5 products.  </li>
            <li>Everything I got was cheap and half opened</li>
            <li>Only thing is I really wanted some of the things on there that I didn&#x27;t get</li>
            <li>The shipment came in early</li>
            <li>Some of the products did appear a bit old.</li>
            <li>I suggest this for someone around 15 years old.</li>
            <li>It was worth what I spent on it.</li>
            <li>A few of my favorite items are the undercover undelete concealer and brighter, split personally eyeshadow, button your lip lip gloss, all glossed up lip gloss, flavored body powder and glow away bronzer and highlighter.</li>
            <li>Lastly, i have fair skin, so the tinted moisturizer  was a little too dark for me.</li>
            <li>I did receive one duplicated item (exact same item/exact same color).</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to get this, and definitely wasn&#x27;t let down</li>
            <li>I love hard candy makeup and this saved me about a hundred dollars buying individually.</li>
            <li>I order 2 of these and only in the whole 60 pieces has 3 items that were the same.</li>
            <li>I got a very orange dark shade and for most white, Asian  or black people that color would not work....</li>
            <li>It was all new (none old like other reviews complained), all factory sealed, and most were in the boxes.</li>
            <li>They were all in the packaging and might be fun for little girls playing dress up.</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail much quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>It has good cosmetics, but, when I opened mine, I had only 25 pieces and a nail polish that was broken open, dry, and had no polish brush.</li>
            <li>yellow, green, and red but very pretty).</li>
            <li>I expected numerous duplicates seeing I ordered so much big in all reality on about 5 things total was exactly the same I received numerous same things</li>
            <li>Just got my 30 piece hard candy makeup today, it was so exciting to open it without knowing what would be inside!</li>

            <li> Everything was in original packaging and sealed, nothing expired.</li>
            <li> I am planning to buy another set soon because it was so exciting!</li>
            <li> , this stuff is awesome for little girl make overs as well- its all glittery and fun colors.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, good things but mostly lipgloss.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are both very happy with our Hard Candy makeup.</li>
            <li> This is the best hard candy products.</li>
            <li> I like receiving a mystery box full of makeup</li>
            <li> If you are older or a professional it may not be the perfect or best makeup for you, but if you are younger like in middle school or high school</li>
            <li> Probably more fit for young girls who are just playing around with makeup</li>
            <li> it was so much fun opening all the items and seeing all the cool makeup that I can use.</li>
            <li> I already love Hard Candy makeup, so when I recieved my makeup it was like christmas, loved it.</li>
            <li> And the colors of my eyeshadow are more for a five year old.</li>
            <li> So fun opening it</li>
            <li> It was so much fun opening it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll have fun experimenting with everything.</li>
            <li> They were prompt and courteous I would definitely suggest buying this!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The day I got this in the mail was such a fun day!!!  </li>
            <li> I had also received multiple metallic cream eye shadow&#x27;s (5 to be exact), which i didn&#x27;t mind because they were all colors i liked.</li>
            <li> So excited, all was high quality.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was super fast</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very very picky about my makeup</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It came on time but that is the only ok thing about it.</li>
            <li> Only some was useable and mostly duplicated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll more than likely buy another assortment closer to summer.</li>
            <li> A lot of pretty makeup</li>
            <li> First it came in a bubble envelope and in the picture you can see that it looks like it comes in a box.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The package arrived much earlier than what was expected, which is great.</li>
            <li> First off, the shipping was insanely fast....</li>
            <li> (it should be 3.5) is because there was about 10 items that I wasn&#x27;t happy with and out of the other 20, only like 10 of them</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all should come up with packages  that have certain colors in it.</li>
            <li> , i just wished that i had gotten some more lip glosses and less mascara and the right skin</li>
            <li> but they came with really tacky rings for five year olds.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Threw the whole box out.</li>
            <li> and I now have so much makeup.</li>
            <li> What am I do with so much lip ware?</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> then real makup</li>
            <li> it ssssoooooo much  </li>
            <li> and i would defiantly buy again thank you soo much</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> but I was overall thrilled with all the product I recieved only two-three of the items</li>
            <li> There were even some unexpected items, like temp tattoos and lash growth treatment, which my teen daughter will love.</li>
            <li> and it had cool teen glamour.</li>
            <li> I got a full variety from mascara, eyeshadow, glitter, lash tinsel, bronzer, blush and a bunch of other fun things.</li>
            <li> Go to the store and buy some new makeup!</li>
            <li> and I am really looking forward to wear all my new cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Could use more founation and less sparkles eye make up</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> was so exicted to get it just wish it had a little more varity....75% was lipgloss....</li>
            <li> Most of the stuff was dried up.</li>
            <li> it had a sticker on it that said new</li>
            <li> all brand new.</li>
            <li> Everything was new and packaged also.</li>
            <li> All new makeup in sealed packaging.</li>
            <li> Overall, I know from buying hard candy makeup in stores, that this was a good deal on the amount and price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was missing 5 products, but I emailed them and they happily sent the missing 5 products.  </li>
            <li> Everything I got was cheap and half opened</li>
            <li> Only thing is I really wanted some of the things on there that I didn&#x27;t get</li>
            <li> The shipment came in early</li>
            <li> Some of the products did appear a bit old.</li>
            <li> I suggest this for someone around 15 years old.</li>
            <li> It was worth what I spent on it.</li>
            <li> A few of my favorite items are the undercover undelete concealer and brighter, split personally eyeshadow, button your lip lip gloss, all glossed up lip gloss, flavored body powder and glow away bronzer and highlighter.</li>
            <li> Lastly, i have fair skin, so the tinted moisturizer  was a little too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I did receive one duplicated item (exact same item/exact same color).</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to get this, and definitely wasn&#x27;t let down</li>
            <li> I love hard candy makeup and this saved me about a hundred dollars buying individually.</li>
            <li> I order 2 of these and only in the whole 60 pieces has 3 items that were the same.</li>
            <li> I got a very orange dark shade and for most white, Asian  or black people that color would not work....</li>
            <li> It was all new (none old like other reviews complained), all factory sealed, and most were in the boxes.</li>
            <li> They were all in the packaging and might be fun for little girls playing dress up.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail much quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> It has good cosmetics, but, when I opened mine, I had only 25 pieces and a nail polish that was broken open, dry, and had no polish brush.</li>
            <li> yellow, green, and red but very pretty).</li>
            <li> I expected numerous duplicates seeing I ordered so much big in all reality on about 5 things total was exactly the same I received numerous same things</li>
            <li> Just got my 30 piece hard candy makeup today, it was so exciting to open it without knowing what would be inside!</li>
            <li> At least 30% of the make-up is really strange colors that most people would not wear like pink or green mascara.</li>
            <li> It was all different items, a few the same but different colors.</li>
            <li> It came much earlier than expected</li>
            <li> I received my package earlier than expected and there were 2 bonus items in mine.</li>
            <li> Nothing old or dried out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, they don&#x27;t send duplicates just the same product in 5 other colors.</li>
            <li> It also came in a week earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, got 33 items, only one item was broken, and one fell out</li>
            <li> I also got several types of eyeshadow, lip stick/gloss, mascara, eyeshadow tattoo (these were odd colors</li>
            <li> but the bottle was 1/2 empty.</li>
            <li> Mascaras were dried to the point where when my daughter tried to open it the lid broke.</li>
            <li> there were a lot of duplicates no much eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I would say this was money well spent.</li>
            <li> You do get a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Two of my products had defects and I received two other foundations that aren&#x27;t my color, very watery and poor quality.</li>
            <li> I recieved this a lot faster than it was expected!</li>
            <li> But when you look at the price (No really, look at it!)</li>
            <li> I think the items were a bit old but only one thing was bad enough to throw out.</li>
            <li> that is a shade to dark for me</li>
            <li> You get nothing in this picture half the stuff on got</li>
            <li> This was not worth it at all!</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got black eye shadow that was already mixed with ugly white eye shadow.</li>
            <li> About the product well lots of it taste so old its crazy.</li>
            <li> Its just a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> not sure what skin color is orange but not many.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was an accident or a gift on the shipper&#x27;s part, but we received 31 items instead of 30.</li>
            <li> Justo hard CANDy brand.</li>
            <li> but I got hardly anything I would use.</li>
            <li> if i were to by every thing off of a website like for hard candy or walmart i would spend 94 dalliers or</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves hard candy</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture obviously, really ugly old makeup.</li>
            <li> It came with so much hideos things, I will never use any of this crap.</li>
            <li> of the make up was broken or expired, nor dried out.</li>
            <li> They gave me eye tattoos, seriously EYE TATOOS.</li>
            <li> I was kinda weary of all the bad reviews I got a few other things I haven&#x27;t tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed but the only reason why I&#x27;m giving this four stars</li>
            <li> had all the same lip liner I&#x27;m so disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> One box of body art was opened and stuffed with sheets that didn&#x27;t match the box and the broken box was covered in glittery gue.</li>
            <li> I asked the seller to rectify broken goods and was ignored.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of lip gloss no duplicates though I did get a broken eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Would buy again if nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> ill def b ordering again</li>
            <li> The blushes are useless because it&#x27;s not my for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Useless and ugly is what it is.</li>
            <li> The set did not come as pictured which was a disappointment</li>
            <li> The colors are to crazy for me.</li>
            <li> it cause bad taste in my mouth.</li>

            <li> Absolutley hated it. It came on time but that is the only ok thing about it. I got a concealer it had a sticker on it that said new but the bottle was 1/2 empty. I got some nail polishes but they came with really tacky rings for five year olds. I tried a lip pencil and the top came off. They gave me eye tattoos, seriously EYE TATOOS. I got black eye shadow that was already mixed with ugly white eye shadow. It came with so much hideos things, I will never use any of this crap. Useless and ugly is what it is.</li>
            <li> Very nice assortment great color selection. Will purchace again !</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Very pleased! No duplicates!</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I love it,I&#x27;m trying to get into more makeup for a cheeper price and this was the jackpot!thankyou</li>
            <li> Oh my God!!! I recieved this a lot faster than it was expected! IT IS COMPLETELY WORTH THE PRICE!!!!</li>
            <li> AWFUL quality!  Had over 6 duplicates, one I got 4 of. Mascaras were dried to the point where when my daughter tried to open it the lid broke. There were maybe 15 pieces total that were usable. Had to throw a bunch away. One box of body art was opened and stuffed with sheets that didn&#x27;t match the box and the broken box was covered in glittery gue. I asked the seller to rectify broken goods and was ignored. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I was not at all happy with this purchase. Waste of money. Everything I got was cheap and half opened I threw everything out</li>
            <li> Good collection. Has alot of different items.&lt;br /&gt;worth it if you are looking for variety.</li>
            <li> Wow this is the best deal I ever had. I already love Hard Candy makeup, so when I recieved my makeup it was like christmas, loved it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even 30 items</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed....there were a lot of duplicates no much eyeshadow at all mostly lip gloss I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again</li>
            <li> Enjoy the makeup will buy again</li>
            <li> Garbage. Some of the make up was already opened. Threw the whole box out. Don&#x27;t buy! You&#x27;re better off buying make up from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this. Most of the stuff was dried up. Only some was useable and mostly duplicated.</li>
            <li> About the product well lots of it taste so old its crazy. I can&#x27;t use some it cause bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Don&#x27;t be fooled, they don&#x27;t send duplicates just the same product in 5 other colors. Will only use probably 3 out of the 30 products. Probably more fit for young girls who are just playing around with makeup</li>
            <li> Love it! Everything in it is great!</li>
            <li> Great makeup great price wish shipping was free other then that great buy</li>
            <li> The set did not come as pictured which was a disappointment but I was overall thrilled with all the product I recieved only two-three of the items are something I wont be using but I have friends I can give those too.&lt;br /&gt;None of the make up was broken or expired, nor dried out.</li>
            <li> The package arrived much earlier than what was expected, which is great. The only problems i had were the fact that i had gotten 7 mascaras and 5 nail polishes. In those mascaras, i had received some of the same colors.(pink). I had also received multiple metallic cream eye shadow&#x27;s (5 to be exact), which i didn&#x27;t mind because they were all colors i liked. Lastly, i have fair skin, so the tinted moisturizer  was a little too dark for me. Overall, I know from buying hard candy makeup in stores, that this was a good deal on the amount and price. I like receiving a mystery box full of makeup , i just wished that i had gotten some more lip glosses and less mascara and the right skin tone colored moisturizer. I still appreciate what I have gotten and will work with it.</li>
            <li> Loved all of the products</li>
            <li> Could use more founation and less sparkles eye make up</li>
            <li> It has good cosmetics, but, when I opened mine, I had only 25 pieces and a nail polish that was broken open, dry, and had no polish brush.</li>
            <li> I love the colors that comes in this bundle they are so bright and wonderful.</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of lip gloss no duplicates though I did get a broken eyeshadow the lip glosses are good quality nice assortment of colors and very silky not sticky at all I was kinda weary of all the bad reviews I got a few other things I haven&#x27;t tried will review in about a week also my cc cream was all watery it just smelled like baby lotion</li>
            <li> i love it love love love</li>
            <li> They sent me a box for a mascara but there was nothing in it so disapointed when I sent them an email they said well we sent something extra</li>
            <li> I really liked this product all the items I got were nice and I now have so much makeup. I used to always use dollar store makeup and now that I have this stuff I don&#x27;t need to worry about makeup,  just makeup brushes. If you are older or a professional it may not be the perfect or best makeup for you, but if you are younger like in middle school or high school I found this was pretty much good for me so It could work for you.</li>
            <li> This was not worth it at all! 5 pieces of it were already open. I got 5 different lipsticks, and like 3 lip glosses. What am I do with so much lip ware? No pouder no foundation no eye liner no nail polish. And the colors of my eyeshadow are more for a five year old. I will never again</li>
            <li> First off, the shipping was insanely fast....kudos to the seller. Mixed reviews on here but I ordered anyway. I am beyond happy with the assortment of items! There are a cpl things I won&#x27;t use but my best friend would love. I am a makeup junkie and this was a great deal. All makeup is new and sealed, great colors and fab price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved all the makeup. I do makeovers with my grandchildren and it had cool teen glamour. Love it would bye  product again . . Thanks so much. Wonderful So excited, all was high quality.</li>
            <li> i ordered it on thurs and i got it today 12/8 and i opened it up and i loved everything that was in there. nothing was damaged, everything was sealed. no repeats. ill def b ordering again</li>
            <li> Received item today and I was overall impressed with the quality of the makeup included. Everything was in original packaging and sealed, nothing expired. A good mix of good makeup for a great price. There were even some unexpected items, like temp tattoos and lash growth treatment, which my teen daughter will love. I did receive one duplicated item (exact same item/exact same color). But when you look at the price (No really, look at it!) I would say this was money well spent. This was easily over $80 worth of cosmetics for a great price. Shipping was fast. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome assortment!! I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these and got different things both times. Makes for great stocking stuffers for sisters or female coworkers!! I&#x27;ll more than likely buy another assortment closer to summer. I&#x27;ve got plenty of make-up to last me til then.</li>
            <li> lot more nail polish then real makup</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter. She loved going through and trying everything</li>
            <li> Couple items were opened (not factory sealed).  Emailed seller to see if they can be replace.  If so, I will give more stars.</li>
            <li> Would buy again if nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> Only hafe of the iteme are wearable. Gate the ither 15 ...</li>
            <li> Love every piece So fun opening it Makes a great gift 2 Very satisfied customer Will order more 4 sure♡♡</li>
            <li> Great deal! I actually got 31 products not counting those that came with a sample or the 2 nail polishes packaged together, which is great because I got 4 mascara so can&#x27;t use. Great mix of products and colors! All were wrapped or in their boxes and none were expired. Thank you sooooo muc!</li>
            <li> It was worth what I spent on it. A lot of pretty makeup but some were in wierd colors and eye shadows and lip glosses that will never be worn. Y&#x27;all should come up with packages  that have certain colors in it.</li>
            <li> Just got my 30 piece hard candy makeup today, it was so exciting to open it without knowing what would be inside! It was all new (none old like other reviews complained), all factory sealed, and most were in the boxes. It was all different items, a few the same but different colors. A few of my favorite items are the undercover undelete concealer and brighter, split personally eyeshadow, button your lip lip gloss, all glossed up lip gloss, flavored body powder and glow away bronzer and highlighter. I also got several types of eyeshadow, lip stick/gloss, mascara, eyeshadow tattoo (these were odd colors yellow, green, and red but very pretty). And eyeliner. I love hard candy makeup and this saved me about a hundred dollars buying individually. I am planning to buy another set soon because it was so exciting! It also came in a week earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li> Abad productos. Justo hard CANDy brand. Colours no one uses.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was!!!!</li>
            <li> Was kinda disappointed with my order. Shipping time was super fast but I got hardly anything I would use. The mascara is garbage.</li>
            <li> iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii  love it ssssoooooo much  if i were to by every thing off of a website like for hard candy or walmart i would spend 94 dalliers or more ssooooo i love it</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic deal.  30 different items, all brand new. it was so much fun opening all the items and seeing all the cool makeup that I can use. if u go to the store to buy all of this, it would cost u way over 100.00. my daughter got one too and hers was all different than mine. as soon as I used all this up, I will buy another.</li>
            <li> Really cool way to buy makeup! I got mostly lip products, but it made me also discover a lot of new colours and wonderful styles you can do with these, so I am not disappointed . It came much earlier than expected and I am really looking forward to wear all my new cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, good things but mostly lipgloss.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It was so much fun opening it. Only thing is I really wanted some of the things on there that I didn&#x27;t get but oh well it is still an amazing thing to get so worth the 30 dollars.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture obviously, really ugly old makeup. I was expecting really good things but it was like repeated 3-4 time items. I got 30 pieces, and only used one! The rest i threw out. Its just a waste of money!  Go to the store and buy some new makeup!</li>
            <li> was so exicted to get it just wish it had a little more varity....75% was lipgloss.... but  now i have a lip gloss for every mood or outfit...lol</li>
            <li> Two of my products had defects and I received two other foundations that aren&#x27;t my color, very watery and poor quality. Looks like something that could break your face out. The blushes are useless because it&#x27;s not my for my skin tone. I&#x27;m quite disappointed but the only reason why I&#x27;m giving this four stars (it should be 3.5) is because there was about 10 items that I wasn&#x27;t happy with and out of the other 20, only like 10 of them I&#x27;m happy with. Let&#x27;s just say I prefer the lip glosses better. I must say cheap isn&#x27;t always everthing. Lesson well learned.</li>
            <li> I got the most lovely items in my package it was full of all colors I loved</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail much quicker than expected. Products are great, will be awesome stocking stuffers this year!!</li>
            <li> Amazing thank you very helpful! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee (Rivki) Silverberg&lt;br /&gt;Author of Understanding Children and Families with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Children-Families-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/1622127269/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;books&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418769206&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;understanding+children+and+families+with+autism+spectrum+disorders</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, got 33 items, only one item was broken, and one fell out but I stuck it back in and it works, I&#x27;m very very picky about my makeup and I was so excited to get this, and definitely wasn&#x27;t let down, I will be buying this again in the future :) very happy with my purchase. Everything was new and packaged also.</li>
            <li> I love every piece I received!! I ordered the 30 piece and the 50 piece. Why? Because I&#x27;m a makeup junky lol. The shipment came in early I expected numerous duplicates seeing I ordered so much big in all reality on about 5 things total was exactly the same I received numerous same things but they were different shades or colors. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Nothing was expired all was still sealed.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece and it was perfect selection of items for her.</li>
            <li> love it completely worth the like 26 dollars for it and i would defiantly buy again thank you soo much</li>
            <li> At least 30% of the make-up is really strange colors that most people would not wear like pink or green mascara. 25-30% of the product was lipgloss. It was just okay...some of the products I did not think should be in there was foundation. I got a very orange dark shade and for most white, Asian  or black people that color would not work....not sure what skin color is orange but not many. Some of the products did appear a bit old. They were all in the packaging and might be fun for little girls playing dress up.</li>
            <li> The day I got this in the mail was such a fun day!!!  These products are so expensive and my favorite brand, so this is a screaming deal.  I got a full variety from mascara, eyeshadow, glitter, lash tinsel, bronzer, blush and a bunch of other fun things. They were even fall colors - I feel like the person who packed my box was doing it in a way that the makeup could be used to together very thoughtful.  I am ordering a smaller version for my daughter for her birthday, this stuff is awesome for little girl make overs as well- its all glittery and fun colors.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are both very happy with our Hard Candy makeup. Everything was new, sealed, and in good shape, and there was a nice variety of products. I&#x27;m not sure if this was an accident or a gift on the shipper&#x27;s part, but we received 31 items instead of 30. We&#x27;ll have fun experimenting with everything. Thank you, Anne&#x27;s Makeup and More. I will order from you again!</li>
            <li> Loved it. As promised. Would do business again with you. Ty Robynn Othouse</li>
            <li> You get nothing in this picture half the stuff on got like duplicates even thought it says no duplicates all the lip gloss I got had all the same lip liner I&#x27;m so disappointed in this. I&#x27;m nerd getting it again</li>
            <li> Wonderful product exactly as described. It was packed well, everything was sealed and they took into account my skin tone to tailor my order for me. I think the items were a bit old but only one thing was bad enough to throw out. I was given more than 30 items so I didn&#x27;t mind just one thing being bad. They were prompt and courteous I would definitely suggest buying this!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I got this a month ago and I haven&#x27;t used any of the makeup. I don&#x27;t like the quality of it. The colors are to crazy for me. I suggest this for someone around 15 years old. I am 23 and I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> I got like 7 mascara... and duplicates on everything else. The picture showed eye shadows.. I didn&#x27;t get but one! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with this product and seller. I received my package earlier than expected and there were 2 bonus items in mine. I did get a cc cream and concealer  that is a shade to dark for me but I have family who can use it so not that big of a deal. All new makeup in sealed packaging. Nothing old or dried out. Great variety in product types and colors.</li>
            <li> We were very disappointed. First it came in a bubble envelope and in the picture you can see that it looks like it comes in a box. Secondly it had Walmart stickers on it as if it had been returns from the stores. It also was a lot of the same item. Just different colors. I bought this for my daughter and she loves hard candy but even she was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best hard candy products. The seller is amazing and provided the best service. My order was made perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Love, Love this stuff. Everything boxed up, sealed, some had stickers and censors on them. Everything looked new and awesome. Something provided for every need in make up, nail polish, tattoo&#x27;s and so much more. Love my set and happy with everything that came inside. You do get a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> What a great company. Well worth the money. will continue buying from them</li>
            <li> DAUGHTER WAS EXCITED BUT SEEMS LIKE A GREAT DEAL BUT CHEAP</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, awesome pieces! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was missing 5 products, but I emailed them and they happily sent the missing 5 products.  I loved all the makeup that was included. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I loved the surprise of not knowing what I will receive. When I received this item it arrived quickly and I am so happy with the colors and product I received! deinfately referring my friends to this!</li>
            <li> Even though it had two duplicates of product and was mostly lip gloss and lip liner, I feel the mix was very good. I LOVE the mascara. It makes me appear to have lashes.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. I LOVE everything I got. It felt like Christmas. I order 2 of these and only in the whole 60 pieces has 3 items that were the same. Can&#x27;t wait to start trying it all out! Awesome jib seller!!!!</li>
