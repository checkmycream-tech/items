            <li>My son&#x27;s girlfriend and her friends love the colors</li>
            <li>Takes forever to apply to make it look smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>Sure there are stickers with the name of the polish on the bottom, but they still don&#x27;t indicate the color.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get appropriately.</li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>these are ok.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend bought this set for me as he knows how much I love gel</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love everything about this brand of gel polish.</li>
            <li>Great polishes, I really liked them and they look great on my nails, not too thick.</li>
            <li>The quality of the polish is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>Works great and looks professional.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to use if you know what</li>
            <li>The smell of this polish is quite strong.</li>
            <li>Bought the set and the colors are really light pastel.</li>
            <li>Cheap dinner nail polish</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy this brand of the gel polish.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite like the yellow, but all the rest are just amazing!</li>
            <li>was a lot better than my first application with &amp;#34;Cotton Tail&amp;#34; (</li>
            <li>It was super quick and easy to cure with no problems.</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty also, great spring/summer colors, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Colors are to light for me, kind of reminds me of white out with a hint of color</li>
            <li>Arrived really quick</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors - generous amount of polish.</li>
            <li>very pretty pastel colors, the nude color has shimmer to it</li>
            <li>Pretty pastel colors!</li>
            <li>Colors are a lot of fun - with in a week the polish does pop off.</li>
            <li>Amazon made online ordering the easiest ever, the product arrived exactly as promised with tracking available the whole way, and the product as just as advertized.  </li>
            <li>, I did my mani at home with a tiny 7 watt LED light (SensatioNAIL light).</li>
            <li>Great quality and big bottles for the low price!</li>
            <li>Really pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Overall it is okay</li>
            <li>and I would order the product again, but in much brighter/vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The purple looks more on the pink than as pictured.</li>
            <li>and I really like the colors,</li>
            <li>I have no idea how much I lost</li>
            <li>If the polish really sucked, I&#x27;m sure my tiny little light wouldn&#x27;t have done the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty sheer too, it took 3 coats of some of the colors to make it look right.</li>
            <li>The polish came quickly but there was a different color in the box.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Also not as easy to take off as other gel polishes</li>
            <li>The product is not thick at all like some reviews said.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors,  the polish is a bit on the thick side.so you need to be careful applying.</li>
            <li>, the price is reasonable, colors are pretty after several coats, but I probably won&#x27;t order this brand again...</li>
            <li>This gel polish doesn&#x27;t really go on smoothly like other gel polishes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>(I guess I am just too old for these colors).  </li>
            <li>No where near the quality of Sally Hansen gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li>they all seemed old.</li>
            <li>and it was a mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li>I mean they are so similar they really just look the same in most lighting.</li>
            <li>It looks a lot like the shade of pink that also comes with this kit, not making it very versatile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And gels don&#x27;t dry normal so you can&#x27;t even put a dab of polish on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but it last long</li>
            <li> A lot of polish can drip down during application if you don&#x27;t wipe the brush off first and pay attention, making it look gloppy and messy.</li>
            <li> And I really like that this gel polish is thick.</li>
            <li> It looks like a pink and not purple.</li>
            <li> I am attempting to use another color (I used the pink before) and if it doesn&#x27;t work how I expected I will be returning the product.</li>
            <li> the other 3 were duplicates</li>
            <li> Really not worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Colors seemed a bit flat &amp; thick.</li>
            <li> They peeled after a day and a half.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> BMC polishes are thick, but that&#x27;s in relation to other gel polishes.</li>
            <li> I like some of these colors, but I&#x27;m disappointed at how similar the pink and purple are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier for me to apply the thick ones rather than the watery ones</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to spread on nail.  </li>
            <li> Not a good quality.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not applied a really thin layer it wrinkles.</li>
            <li> So far, horrible!</li>
            <li> the polish was chunky and weird.</li>
            <li> It will be thicker on some parts of the nail and thinner on others and evening it out was quite difficult.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and too thick, consistency is almost like glue.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this order though</li>
            <li> Bloody AWEFUL</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The polish came quickly but there was a different color in the box. The pastel orange was not pastel orange it was an orange glitter</li>
            <li> Great polishes, I really liked them and they look great on my nails, not too thick. The colors are pretty also, great spring/summer colors, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Colors are a lot of fun - with in a week the polish does pop off. Make sure that you prime your nails before you apply the gel color.</li>
            <li> Colors are to light for me, kind of reminds me of white out with a hint of color (I guess I am just too old for these colors).  My son&#x27;s girlfriend and her friends love the colors so I gave the bundle to her, with that said, the color does last for ever and I would order the product again, but in much brighter/vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> Amazon made online ordering the easiest ever, the product arrived exactly as promised with tracking available the whole way, and the product as just as advertized.  I&#x27;d do it again in a minute !!!</li>
            <li> Pretty pastel colors!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product as described. Colors seemed a bit flat &amp; thick. Otherwise, work well, will use.</li>
            <li> Bought the set and the colors are really light pastel. The purple looks more on the pink than as pictured.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors - generous amount of polish. Great buy</li>
            <li> Not a good quality. Takes forever to apply to make it look smooth and nice. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After trying quite a bit of gels and going to the salon a lot, I&#x27;d say this polish is really great quality and the colors are beautiful! And the bottles are huge for the price! The product is not thick at all like some reviews said. A lot of polish can drip down during application if you don&#x27;t wipe the brush off first and pay attention, making it look gloppy and messy. But it&#x27;s easy to use if you know what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes 3 coats for these colors to be totally opaque, just like every gel polish which is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, I did my mani at home with a tiny 7 watt LED light (SensatioNAIL light). It was super quick and easy to cure with no problems. If the polish really sucked, I&#x27;m sure my tiny little light wouldn&#x27;t have done the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only 2 things I will say that didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars:&lt;br /&gt; The bottles don&#x27;t come with any indication of what the color polish is inside! Sure there are stickers with the name of the polish on the bottom, but they still don&#x27;t indicate the color. I had to open bottles constantly to see what color I was gonna put on. And gels don&#x27;t dry normal so you can&#x27;t even put a dab of polish on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the pastel purple color looked more like purple! It doesn&#x27;t look like the photo on the listing! It looks like a pink and not purple. It looks a lot like the shade of pink that also comes with this kit, not making it very versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will buy this polish again! Great quality and big bottles for the low price!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the quality.  If it&#x27;s not applied a really thin layer it wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Really not worth the money you spend. They don&#x27;t get appropriately. They don&#x27;t stay on for two weeks. They&#x27;re not worth the money. I&#x27;ve tried 3 times AND have used the manufactures instructions. Bloody AWEFUL</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to spread on nail.  Also not as easy to take off as other gel polishes</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors,  the polish is a bit on the thick side.so you need to be careful applying. One draw back , I think  some of the polish makes my fingers itch.  :(  I will still use ,but for decorating .</li>
            <li> Great colors and have great staying power</li>
            <li> No where near the quality of Sally Hansen gel nail polish.  It was ok and I really like the colors, but I think I will stick to Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> Cheap dinner nail polish</li>
            <li> I was so excited about these beautiful colors! As soon as I received them I used them. So far, horrible! The purpose of gel polish is the long lasting wear. They peeled after a day and a half. I am attempting to use another color (I used the pink before) and if it doesn&#x27;t work how I expected I will be returning the product.</li>
            <li> THE. BEST. COLORS. EVER!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just amazing how creamy these colors are. I don&#x27;t quite like the yellow, but all the rest are just amazing! And I really like that this gel polish is thick. It&#x27;s easier for me to apply the thick ones rather than the watery ones</li>
            <li> very pretty pastel colors, the nude color has shimmer to it, the rest are opaque and solid</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this brand of the gel polish.  It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t chip or wear easily.  I was disappointed by this order though because when I opened the box the purple polish had opened at some point in packing or shipping and I have purple polish all over everything.  I have no idea how much I lost and it was a mess to clean up.  I will try a different brand on my next purchase.</li>
            <li> As a professional cosmetologist I would recommend these all the way for beginners or experts the gel self levels has a great color, perfect viscosity overall a great product. I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Works great and looks professional.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the color and everyone has complemented her... not only the  but it last long</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors. Arrived really quick</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and too thick, consistency is almost like glue.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Lasts quite a while.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> these are ok. nothing special. they all seemed old. the polish was chunky and weird. it says 6 different colors but i actually only got 3 different colors. the other 3 were duplicates</li>
            <li> I like some of these colors, but I&#x27;m disappointed at how similar the pink and purple are. I mean they are so similar they really just look the same in most lighting. This gel polish doesn&#x27;t really go on smoothly like other gel polishes I&#x27;ve used. It will be thicker on some parts of the nail and thinner on others and evening it out was quite difficult. The colors are pretty sheer too, it took 3 coats of some of the colors to make it look right. The smell of this polish is quite strong. Overall it is okay, the price is reasonable, colors are pretty after several coats, but I probably won&#x27;t order this brand again...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this set for me as he knows how much I love gel polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BMC polishes are thick, but that&#x27;s in relation to other gel polishes. The consistency of BMC Polish is similar to the consistency of regular nail polish. So if you&#x27;re used to Gelish, IBD, Couture, etc. polishes, applying BMC polish will probably take some trial and error. My second application using &amp;#34;Cherish Me&amp;#34; (gorgeous, sparkle-filled peach color!) was a lot better than my first application with &amp;#34;Cotton Tail&amp;#34; (Robin egg blue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love everything about this brand of gel polish. They offer a variety of colors and are sold at a great value. The quality of the polish is pretty good as well.</li>
