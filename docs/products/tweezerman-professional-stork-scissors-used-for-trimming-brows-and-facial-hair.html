            <li>I needed some really sharp, precise scissors and these are perfect in that regard.  </li>
            <li>These things are sharp and precise and awesome.</li>
            <li>Also--I am pretty sure these came to us in ONE business day.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing special.</li>
            <li>My wife has a pair that she replaced her crappy cuticle scissors with, and another just to cut ribbon because it is tight and makes a perfect seamless cut.</li>

            <li>A classic pair of scissors!</li>
            <li>They are positioned so you can use them from the left or right.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t live without these, unless I want my eyebrows to become a bush.</li>
            <li>These scissors are sharp and good for small projects, like sewing.  </li>
            <li>These are way better than just little regular nail scissors bc of the curve in them</li>
            <li>Not recommend for professional salon.</li>
            <li>These are by far the easiest to use that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Finger openings are a bit small, but overall I love the quirky design and the precision these scissors offer.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>

            <li> but it just gives you a better angle while cutting.</li>
            <li> They are quite small though so for anyone (like myself) with normal to large sized hands they can be tough to work with.</li>
            <li> These little Stork Scissors are such a necessity...</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I spent $20 for this</li>
            <li> Scissors are very tight and hard to open and close.</li>
            <li> Sharp, pointy and small.</li>
            <li> The one I bought I keep for my herbs, and it make quite the fluffy powder of product.</li>
            <li> You should already know these are small scissors, 3.5&amp;#34; long total--about a 3/4&amp;#34; cutting surface.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> When I was working with difficult nuggets my friend said &amp;#34;Get</li>
            <li> Or maybe I&#x27;m angling them wrong?</li>

            <li> Good quality and very sharp. I loved the shape.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girl and she loves them. Says they work great. Especially loves the stork on the scissors</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and good for small projects, like sewing.  Nice fit with my fingers. A classic pair of scissors!</li>
            <li> Scissors are very tight and hard to open and close.</li>

            <li> I have no idea why I spent $20 for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing special. I should have bought jus $5 scissors at wal mart.</li>
            <li> These little Stork Scissors are such a necessity...I have a pair in my medicine cabinet...a pair in my car &amp; a pair in my purse...the 4th pair I bought for a friend...:)</li>
            <li> You should already know these are small scissors, 3.5&amp;#34; long total--about a 3/4&amp;#34; cutting surface. of course, that&#x27;s what these are made for. My wife has a pair that she replaced her crappy cuticle scissors with, and another just to cut ribbon because it is tight and makes a perfect seamless cut. The one I bought I keep for my herbs, and it make quite the fluffy powder of product. When I was working with difficult nuggets my friend said &amp;#34;Get a pair of Stork scissors&amp;#34; and he was 100% correct. By the way--the scissors come with a lifetime sharpening guarantee. Also--I am pretty sure these came to us in ONE business day. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I love these. They are wonderful. Every bit as top quality as you might hope.</li>
            <li> These are so useful in maintaining my eyebrows. I honestly can&#x27;t live without these, unless I want my eyebrows to become a bush. The only thing is that sometimes it doesn&#x27;t get the hairs I want to reach. Or maybe I&#x27;m angling them wrong? Still a great purchase and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I needed some really sharp, precise scissors and these are perfect in that regard.  They are quite small though so for anyone (like myself) with normal to large sized hands they can be tough to work with.</li>
            <li> These things are sharp and precise and awesome.</li>
            <li> I am really really happy about this purchase. These scissors are basically a necessity when your doing silk wraps on your nails.  I&#x27;ve tried to do them with regular scissors and I was a total nightmare.  So i was really happy when I found these.  These are way better than just little regular nail scissors bc of the curve in them I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but it just gives you a better angle while cutting. And allows you to get up under the silk so you can cut closer an straighter.  And the quality of these is awesome they are VERY well made and cut very nicely.  I recommend to anyone. These are very nice.</li>
            <li> These are by far the easiest to use that I have tried. They are positioned so you can use them from the left or right.</li>
