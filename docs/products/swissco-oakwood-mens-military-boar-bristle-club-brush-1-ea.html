            <li>/&gt;Never had a brush like this but is perfect for those of us with buzzed hair.</li>
            <li>Quality is very good to excellent.  </li>
            <li>We were both pleasantly suprised!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>

            <li>While this is an absolutely beautiful brush and the description was what I was looking for</li>
            <li>That said, brush is great.</li>
            <li>It works great for getting groomed in the morning wherever I may be.</li>
            <li>Maybe she smells the boar? :-P</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush that does a good job!</li>
            <li>everyone with a beard should have a good boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>Brush is good, but it seemed like it was a used item.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise: not so good.  </li>
            <li>good value.</li>
            <li>Good brush for the money.  </li>
            <li>Superior price and product</li>
            <li>He was very pleased with the quality of this brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush has been great for releasing oils and making a better quality beard.</li>
            <li>The brush fits into the palm of hands easily and has stayed in great shape.</li>
            <li>this thing (along with Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Care Balm) has my beard looking amazing.  </li>
            <li>Fits the hand nicely.  </li>
            <li>Excellent brush for travel and general use.  </li>
            <li>Description states it&#x27;s made of boar hair, but it felt more like nylon or some sort of polymer.  </li>
            <li>That may also make the stiffness of the bristles more noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Top Quality.</li>
            <li>This is a classic hair brush that is comfortable to hold in the hand as well as feeling great on the scalp.</li>
            <li>The brush is still doing fine.  </li>
            <li>Still doing fine</li>
            <li>The grip is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The last boar bristle brush I bought was too soft, so I am still searching for the perfect brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent, but for a single problem: most mornings, multiple bristles fall out.</li>
            <li>No one in my family quite understands why I would need a brush at all with hair as short as me, but I do appreciate having a good quality bristle brush like this around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s invigorating to give my head a quick massage in the morning, almost like splashing water in my face.</li>
            <li>Even so, the finish on the back is wearing off just from contact with the smooth sink top.</li>
            <li>For some reason my dog is strangely interested by the smell of this brush.</li>
            <li>It turns out that bristles have fallen out of only 2 holes leaving many holes with all the bristles.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I agree with prior posts.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s &#x27;bout perfect in that regard, because you can adjust it from painful stab thru smooth glide by changing the angle of attack of your stroke.  </li>
            <li>(I, also, have large hands).  </li>
            <li>The bristle most certainly do not fall out, the brush is good construction, but the bristles are very stiff.</li>
            <li>I wanted some stiffness in the brush, but didn&#x27;t know how much.</li>
            <li>I read many complaints about the bristles being too rough.</li>
            <li>The stiff bristles provide a nice head scratch while using it too.</li>
            <li>I have fairly short hair and this brush gets it all right in line, most of the time without needing to get it wet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the bristle tuft spacing is close to my years old generic brush, there are noticeably fewer bristles per tuft so it does not feel as smooth in use.</li>
            <li>I figure it&#x27;s a command from On High.  </li>
            <li>Durable and high</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t if that&#x27;s a concern or normal, but I&#x27;ll let y&#x27;all know if it becomes a problem.  </li>
            <li>The brush fits my hand and is perfect for the job, being stiff enough but not too stiff.</li>
            <li>but I have my doubts as it is very soft.</li>
            <li>ive been using this brush several times a day for the last few years, an it&#x27;s till as good as the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have spent a little more and gotten a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li>I bought a replacement and it was too soft, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, though 2 years old, it has not seen a lot of use in that time.</li>
            <li>i tried it and found it to be much too coarse for my thinning hair and scalp</li>
            <li>I guess it is worth the price as I could not find another woden military style brush.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, all natural, unblemished, and quite comfortable even for thin hair.</li>
            <li>The brush looked a little clumsy to me, but grip and control are good</li>
            <li>The brush has short bristles set to far apart on the brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are rather stiff, which is necessary if you don&#x27;t have a super short haircut.</li>
            <li>My olst brush after 61 years was still as stiff as when it was first given to me.</li>

            <li> The bristle most certainly do not fall out, the brush is good construction, but the bristles are very stiff. Too stiff for me, I have short hair and a short beard, the bottom line is it is just too stiff. It is rough on the skin and after a few minutes of brushing it starts to feel like you&#x27;re dragging nails across your skin. I bought a replacement and it was too soft, so I guess it is just a matter of finding one that works for you. Beware, when they say reinforced stiff bristle, they really mean it.</li>
            <li> The brush has short bristles set to far apart on the brush.It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job. I wish I would have spent a little more and gotten a higher quality brush.</li>
            <li> The brush fits my hand and is perfect for the job, being stiff enough but not too stiff.</li>
            <li> This was to replace a brush I lost in  a Howard Johnson motel. This brush (made in China) claimed to be boar brestle but I have my doubts as it is very soft. My olst brush after 61 years was still as stiff as when it was first given to me. I guess it is worth the price as I could not find another woden military style brush.</li>
            <li> this thing (along with Professor Fuzzworthy&#x27;s Beard Care Balm) has my beard looking amazing.  ive been using this brush several times a day for the last few years, an it&#x27;s till as good as the day I bought it.  I&#x27;m not sure any of the bristles have come it, so you know its quality.  everyone with a beard should have a good boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> This brush was just what I wanted and just as advertised. The bristles are rather stiff, which is necessary if you don&#x27;t have a super short haircut. It&#x27;s a nice brush that does a good job!</li>
            <li> This is a classic hair brush that is comfortable to hold in the hand as well as feeling great on the scalp. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a well made brush.  My only complaint is that it is very stiff and can be very hard on the scalp. The last boar bristle brush I bought was too soft, so I am still searching for the perfect brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for travel and general use.  Fits the hand nicely.  Quality is very good to excellent.  Purchased two so that I can keep one in the travel kit.</li>
            <li> No one in my family quite understands why I would need a brush at all with hair as short as me, but I do appreciate having a good quality bristle brush like this around. It seems well made and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with bristles falling out at all. For some reason my dog is strangely interested by the smell of this brush. Since the moment I took it out of the package she has been obsessed with trying to sniff it when she can. Maybe she smells the boar? :-P</li>
            <li> Brush is good, but it seemed like it was a used item.  The print on  the back of the brush (the logo) was smudged and almost rubbed off, so it appeared like they repackaged a used item and sent it to me.  That said, brush is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush maybe December of 2010 and use it every morning. It&#x27;s excellent, but for a single problem: most mornings, multiple bristles fall out. So, if my hair falls out faster than the bristles, then no problem.  Otherwise: not so good.  Updated Review November of 2012.  It turns out that bristles have fallen out of only 2 holes leaving many holes with all the bristles. I am raising my rating from 2 to 4 stars. This has been a very good brush and I now recommend it.</li>
            <li> The brush seems well made.  The grip is comfortable.  The bristles are stiff enough to brush my short hair.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Requested by my Uncle and received well.  Appreciate the reviews and value.  He asked for handle less Boar Bristle brush.  I should be having him respond to this.</li>
            <li> Bristles were extremely hard and it will hurt your head.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush were too hard and painful to use.  Description states it&#x27;s made of boar hair, but it felt more like nylon or some sort of polymer.  Using this brush felt like using a standard nylon brush, but without the rounded plastic tip on the ends.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the pun, but when they&#x27;re that easy I figure it&#x27;s a command from On High.  I&#x27;ve had this thing about a month. Mostly, I agree with prior posts. I like it for hair, beard, and scalp. It&#x27;s invigorating to give my head a quick massage in the morning, almost like splashing water in my face. The brush looked a little clumsy to me, but grip and control are good (I, also, have large hands).  I wanted some stiffness in the brush, but didn&#x27;t know how much. I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s &#x27;bout perfect in that regard, because you can adjust it from painful stab thru smooth glide by changing the angle of attack of your stroke.  I have noticed a few bristles on my t-shirt. I don&#x27;t if that&#x27;s a concern or normal, but I&#x27;ll let y&#x27;all know if it becomes a problem.  ---edit 11 Jan 2014--- The brush is still doing fine.  ---EDIT 16 Jan 2016--- Still doing fine</li>
            <li> Please note: My biggest problem with this brush has to do with personal taste - the bristles are uncomfortably stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the bristle tuft spacing is close to my years old generic brush, there are noticeably fewer bristles per tuft so it does not feel as smooth in use. That may also make the stiffness of the bristles more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, though 2 years old, it has not seen a lot of use in that time. Even so, the finish on the back is wearing off just from contact with the smooth sink top.</li>
            <li> I was looking for small brush without a handle for traveling and this is just what I was looking for.  My hair is thinning with age and this brush is firm enough lay it back in place.  It works great for getting groomed in the morning wherever I may be.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my father.  He was very pleased with the quality of this brush.  It&#x27;s always questionable when purchasing site unseen.  We were both pleasantly suprised!</li>
            <li> I read many complaints about the bristles being too rough. This brush has been great for releasing oils and making a better quality beard. The brush fits into the palm of hands easily and has stayed in great shape.</li>
            <li> Top Quality. Exactly as described, all natural, unblemished, and quite comfortable even for thin hair. Would buy again; good value.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the money.  It is 100% boar bristles, so it is stiff.  Others use a boar bristles and softer bristles for a softer fee.</li>
            <li> I remember growing up and my dad always had a brush with very stiff hard bristles like this one, which was exactly what I was looking for. I have fairly short hair and this brush gets it all right in line, most of the time without needing to get it wet. The stiff bristles provide a nice head scratch while using it too.</li>
            <li> While this is an absolutely beautiful brush and the description was what I was looking for it did not meet my needs.  The bristle were so hard it was actually painful for my father to use the brush.  He has been working on softening the bristle via some tricks on the internet but I would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush were too hard for my delicate little head! I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just sat there in it&#x27;s box for a few years.</li>
            <li> i tried it and found it to be much too coarse for my thinning hair and scalp &amp; i&#x27;m in the process of returning it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Durable and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had a brush like this but is perfect for those of us with buzzed hair.</li>
            <li> Superior price and product</li>
