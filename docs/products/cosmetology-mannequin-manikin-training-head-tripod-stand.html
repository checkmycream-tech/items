            <li>It is light weight</li>
            <li>To light .</li>
            <li>And the stand was super light if kept moving around, so I ended up having to tape it to the floor in order to keep it still..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seven months pregnant</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and I&#x27;m excited about using it when I make my next wig or style one of my own.  </li>

            <li> You cant even practice a blow dry on doll head because is not firm!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really compact in a black case!</li>
            <li> Totally not what i expected</li>
            <li> Hair\\&quot; and saw they used single legged stands for their wigs and decided to look them up.</li>
            <li> I was surprised the packaging was so small, I opened it and it was in a neat case.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing I gotta say is that not heavy enough to withstand brushing or hefty work on mannequin head, really really lightweight</li>
            <li> Not sturdy enough after a few uses.</li>
            <li> its not strong enough</li>
            <li> This stand is to short, not sure who would benefit from this stand</li>
            <li> On the other stand, the adjustable part that holds the head up, falls off!</li>
            <li> Does not fit a mannequin head, so the head swirls around, therefore cannot even be used.</li>
            <li> missing parts and so weak.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the leg holding the Manikin is not strong</li>
            <li> There was a broken piece, which I ended up just glueing.</li>
            <li> This is a flimsy piece of crap and it broke less than one month of owning it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to bend and stretch in weird positions to style and cut my maniquin.</li>
            <li> Horrible. ..waist of money!!</li>
            <li> Bad product !!</li>

            <li> This tripod doesn&#x27;t work good. when I practice blowout it moves and jumps too much. I returned it and I paid 25$ for shipping!</li>
            <li> I use this but broke it.  its not strong enough</li>
            <li> I found I was constantly adjusting to hold the manniquin in it&#x27;s place.  Good for the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> So happy I purchased this tripod stand. Was watching \\&quot;L.A. Hair\\&quot; and saw they used single legged stands for their wigs and decided to look them up. This stand is tripod, comes with a carrying case and is sturdy. Love how the legs adjust and lock. I absolutely love it. Before this, I was unsuccessfully balancing my wigs on a cane. Yes. A cane.</li>
            <li> the leg holding the Manikin is not strong</li>
            <li> Love how lightweight it is.&lt;br /&gt;Love the adjustment levers and range of adjustment. All mannequins have fit snug and dont wiggle. Only downside is there is no bottom support legs to put foot on while blow drying to keep it from moving</li>
            <li> Very user friendly, lightweight, compact, sturdy, great price. I absolutely recommend this for amatures or the seasoned veteran cosmetologist. The price is great &amp; it actually does the job !!!</li>
            <li> It got here on time. I was surprised the packaging was so small, I opened it and it was in a neat case. What I like about it it has adjustable height, adjustable tension on the head stand and it&#x27;s really compact in a black case! the only bad thing I gotta say is that not heavy enough to withstand brushing or hefty work on mannequin head, really really lightweight so it moves a bit when you are working on the head. Bt over all a good price for product.</li>
            <li> it needs some piece of anchoring  bit,, in some normal positions it moves all over the place. it jumps around</li>
            <li> The leg broke after one week</li>
            <li> This is a flimsy piece of crap and it broke less than one month of owning it.</li>
            <li> Tripod would not stay when trying to raise it. Latches would not hold the bottom legs.</li>
            <li> The bottom legs move without u adjusting them. Flimpsy as well. Totally not what i expected ugh👎👎👎 dont purchase this</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet but I didn&#x27;t look at it and test it out.  It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and I&#x27;m excited about using it when I make my next wig or style one of my own.  I would like to also complement the seller.  My stand was delivered but I didn&#x27;t receive it and the seller communicated with me and work well with me to get the problem resolved.  This is a great company and a great product.</li>
            <li> There was a broken piece, which I ended up just glueing. And the stand was super light if kept moving around, so I ended up having to tape it to the floor in order to keep it still..</li>
            <li> Horrible. ..waist of money!! Does not fit a mannequin head, so the head swirls around, therefore cannot even be used. I needed one to test out assistants and do classes.</li>
            <li> its okay.... the legs keep tilting to one side in other words it tilts on it own when you use it or move it.</li>
            <li> I really dont like it I thought it wieght more than what it did</li>
            <li> missing parts and so weak.&lt;br /&gt;i was very embrassed when this item arrived.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 tri pod stands. The legs on two of the stands collapse &amp; dont stand up. On the other stand, the adjustable part that holds the head up, falls off!</li>
            <li> Definitely not good is to light! You cant even practice a blow dry on doll head because is not firm!! Bad product !!</li>
            <li> it was all good for the most part but i wish it allowed me to tilt the mannequin head all the wat back</li>
            <li> Love it! Real simple to set up.</li>
            <li> my mistake, I thought it would be the same height as my instructors. This stand is to short, not sure who would benefit from this stand</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, I have super glued and rigged this thing to death. If you&#x27;re going to be using this on a regular basis I recommend going for a metal tripod.</li>
            <li> This is a great investment. It is light weight so it&#x27;s easy to carry around.I&#x27;m very glad I decided to purchase this item. The height is perfect for me. I&#x27;m seven months pregnant and I don&#x27;t have to bend and stretch in weird positions to style and cut my maniquin. Perfect choice for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife who does a lot of work on her wigs. I looked at some of these tripods that cost $80-100. This tripod is sturdy and holds her mannequin head very well. My wife has recently suffered a back injury and having the ability to move the stand up and down is fantastic for her. She can stand for a bit and then sit and have the mannequin be able to accomdate either postion. Good product.</li>
            <li> To light . Won&#x27;t stay still</li>
            <li> this tripod top flips and flops right and left no matter what you do to secure ,and it is very  rickity. i would invest in a better quality one next time.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stand so it was worth the money i spent on it. I would recommend this stand to anyone.</li>
            <li> I make wigs, and this Tripod Stand is great for that too. The height is adjustable, and the head mount is adjustable too. It pays for it&#x27;s self after the first wig I made.</li>
            <li> Not sturdy enough after a few uses. Wish I would have saw the one by The Color Club before ordering.</li>
            <li> This item arrived when expected lightweight good quality nice height excellent for my Halloween purposes</li>
