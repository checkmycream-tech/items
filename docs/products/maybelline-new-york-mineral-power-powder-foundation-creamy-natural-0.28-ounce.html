            <li>I have bought MANY foundations before, and none of them go on as well as</li>

            <li>For sure I will buy this producy again and again</li>
            <li>Does not feel like you have any on and goes on so smooth!</li>
            <li>I consider &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as more transparent, not adding color.  </li>
            <li>I will be able to use the product in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage when applied.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the mineral powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>and it covers much better than you&#x27;d think.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Just get yourself a better kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty good on its own, so I rarely feel the need to \\&quot;cover up.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>SMOOTH, LIGHT WEIGHT, GREAT NATURAL COLOR</li>

            <li>It is easy to apply and the coverage is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fairly Light .3</li>
            <li>my skin is can get rather tan, so I went with no.4 light.  </li>
            <li>If anything I would have thought this would be too light.  </li>
            <li>So light</li>
            <li>Our skin absorbs things into our bodies more than you think, and you need to be aware of this fact before buying.</li>
            <li>Perhaps product better suits younger clients :-)</li>
            <li>Ilve used Maybellin New York Mineral Powder for some time and am pleased with the consistency and effect of the product itself.  </li>
            <li>Nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>this one, it&#x27;s not cakey, and is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to get it right.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Bare Minerals!  </li>
            <li>Like better than Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>and I prefer to use a larger kabuki brush with better bristles/hairs.</li>
            <li>I visited my nearby cosmetic counter at a retailer to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too light or too dark before I placed my order.</li>
            <li>It worked better for her than for me only because of the shade (not as tan as I used to be).</li>
            <li>It provides good coverage without being heavy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to evenly apply, feels undetectable once it has a few minutes to set in your skin, and my face seems to have a more even tone even when I&#x27;m not wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I thought those claims were absolute phooey, but now I have to admit that they&#x27;re true.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i dont really recomend you to use this...</li>
            <li>Be careful to make sure you are selecting the correct color for you before you order, though.</li>
            <li>It blends really well</li>
            <li>The process to apply is very easy, and takes less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>is also the first product I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intended to wear this only occasionally, but I&#x27;m loving it so much that I&#x27;ll probably wear it nearly every</li>
            <li>Since then, I have done a little research, and it seems that micro powders can be absorbed into your bloodstream very very quickly,</li>
            <li>It even comes with its own little kabuki brush made with natural hairs!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and last nearly all day when I don&#x27;t sweat.  </li>
            <li>The kabuki brush is a nice touch, although its handle is too small to tap off excess product</li>
            <li>As I reached 30, though, I&#x27;ve noticed that my many freckles have darkened, and my skin tone has become less even in some areas.  </li>
            <li>Like it better than Bare Minerals which I used for a long time.</li>
            <li>Too bad they no longer make it since mineral powder is the best to use on your skin.</li>
            <li>It might just be that I am sensitive or even allergic to this product, and you will more than likely not experience the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve considered mineral make-up before, but I am infinitely cheap and balked at the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>I normally wear Medium Beige and the Creamy Natural color in this product</li>
            <li>beige&amp;#34;/ light 5 but creamy natural was wayyy too dark for me.</li>
            <li>I tried a slightly different color this time to see the effect and mix it with the Pure Beige which I&#x27;ve always used.  </li>
            <li>I was always skeptical of buying the mineral foundation outside of a department store but this is really a great product.  </li>
            <li>I had used liquid, powder, and \\&quot;whipped mousse\\&quot; foundation for years and nothing ever made my skin look natural, or gave me all over coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Tested on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I ordered it when I was just about to run out of my old foundation</li>
            <li>However, the color was listed as &amp;#34;creamy natural&amp;#34; but in my opinion is considerably darker than that.  </li>
            <li>but after a few more tries this product has become an essential part of my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>The mineral powder is very similar in texture and ingredients to Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Maybelline Mineral Powder because the ingredients were strikingly similar to Bare Minerals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hate not being able to try out cheaper brands in the store, but at least I know the product is good, so</li>
            <li>My mind starting racing, my stomach felt like it had turned upside down, and I got this headache at the very tip of my head.  </li>

            <li> I hate not being able to try out cheaper brands in the store, but at least I know the product is good, so</li>
            <li> My mind starting racing, my stomach felt like it had turned upside down, and I got this headache at the very tip of my head.  </li>
            <li> Next day, I applied the powder again, thinking a face powder could not possibly penetrate your skin that quickly and make you sick that quickly.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I was surprised to find that the powder itself is a bit darker than what is shown on the cap, and it&#x27;s still a little too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the mess, the neck lines you can inevitably see, the way my skin looks oily after a few hours of use, etc.  </li>
            <li> and I only use just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years, it is getting harder to find!  </li>
            <li> A little darker than I expected, but it will do.</li>
            <li> This was too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I washed my face, laid down for 1 hour, and forgot about it, thinking it must have been a coincidence.  </li>
            <li> YES, I applied it and IMMEDIATELY got sicker than the day before, and was down for the day.  </li>
            <li> these hard times I have found myself cutting back on spending $$$$ for makeup and started looking for adequate substitutes for the brands I usually buy.</li>
            <li> But after taking a break and trying something different, I went back to this powder, and suddenly, I got very very ill.  </li>
            <li> a little trial and error with the shade isn&#x27;t going to kill me.</li>
            <li> It is winter now and when I tried the color it is a little darker than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> THIS IS VERY DARK.</li>
            <li> It isnt heavy at all</li>
            <li> it makes my face look really shiny and makes my face break out really badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a &amp;#34;nude</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past for myself but this purchase was for a gift to a friend.</li>
            <li> Not many stores sell it anymore.  </li>
            <li> But I wanted to post it in the event that you find yourself ill in the morning for no particular reason, and then you can put two and two together, and know that the cause may be your makeup.  </li>
            <li> I recommend everyone at least give it a try!</li>
            <li> I think it covers just as well as the expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> It makes me sad that I can no longer find this product in stores.</li>
            <li> that is crazy.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The mineral powder is very similar in texture and ingredients to Bare Minerals. The coverage is good, it feels light on my skin, and it helped with the shine on my forehead. The process to apply is very easy, and takes less than 5 minutes. You should definitely &#x27;set&#x27; any foundation you put on with a veil powder to make it last longer and appear even throughout the day, although this is not specified in the application instructions. The kabuki brush is a nice touch, although its handle is too small to tap off excess product and I prefer to use a larger kabuki brush with better bristles/hairs.</li>
            <li> Nice, especially for the price. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have used  [[ASIN:B000V990SS bareMinerals - Foundations - Fairly Light .3 oz/9g]] for awhile now, it was a miracle to me and my skin. I had used liquid, powder, and \\&quot;whipped mousse\\&quot; foundation for years and nothing ever made my skin look natural, or gave me all over coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In these hard times I have found myself cutting back on spending $$$$ for makeup and started looking for adequate substitutes for the brands I usually buy. I decided to try Maybelline Mineral Powder because the ingredients were strikingly similar to Bare Minerals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Results clinically proven after 8 weeks*: 52% improvement in skin smoothness; 49% improvement in skin luminosity; 43% reduction in redness&lt;br /&gt;*Buildable, even coverage&lt;br /&gt;*Tested on sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;*Won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;*Contains 0% oil, 0% talc, 0% preservatives and 0% fragrance SPF 18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 3 weeks now and CANNOT tell the difference between the pricier one and Maybelline, and that blows my mind!!! It even comes with its own little kabuki brush made with natural hairs!</li>
            <li> Colors seem A LOT darker than they do in stores. Very unhappy with this purchase. Biught two and cant even use them.</li>
            <li> I gave up on foundations years ago.  I don&#x27;t like the mess, the neck lines you can inevitably see, the way my skin looks oily after a few hours of use, etc.  My skin is pretty good on its own, so I rarely feel the need to \\&quot;cover up.\\&quot;  As I reached 30, though, I&#x27;ve noticed that my many freckles have darkened, and my skin tone has become less even in some areas.  I&#x27;ve considered mineral make-up before, but I am infinitely cheap and balked at the more expensive brands.  Some online searching brought me to this product.&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  I am impressed!!!  It&#x27;s so easy to evenly apply, feels undetectable once it has a few minutes to set in your skin, and my face seems to have a more even tone even when I&#x27;m not wearing it.  Can that be possible?  I thought those claims were absolute phooey, but now I have to admit that they&#x27;re true.&lt;br /&gt;This is also the first product I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out or clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intended to wear this only occasionally, but I&#x27;m loving it so much that I&#x27;ll probably wear it nearly every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning- my skin is can get rather tan, so I went with no.4 light.  If anything I would have thought this would be too light.  Instead, I was surprised to find that the powder itself is a bit darker than what is shown on the cap, and it&#x27;s still a little too dark for my skin. I think a shade down will be perfect, and I plan on picking that up this week.  I hate not being able to try out cheaper brands in the store, but at least I know the product is good, so a little trial and error with the shade isn&#x27;t going to kill me.</li>
            <li> I have bought MANY foundations before, and none of them go on as well as this one, it&#x27;s not cakey, and is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> this product its good but i dont think iil be buing this again......if you have acne problems and oily skin like me i dont really recomend you to use this...it makes my face look really shiny and makes my face break out really badly.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I just wish Maybelline didn&#x27;t make their tones different on every product. THIS IS VERY DARK. I&#x27;m usually a &amp;#34;nude beige&amp;#34;/ light 5 but creamy natural was wayyy too dark for me. So if in doubt, go lighter.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. It is easy to apply and the coverage is fantastic. Be careful to make sure you are selecting the correct color for you before you order, though. I visited my nearby cosmetic counter at a retailer to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too light or too dark before I placed my order. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting great coverage that wears for hours and hours at a great price.</li>
            <li> did what it said, love the texture. use it to set my makeup. hides flaws. since when do we have to have a minumim of words to decribe a product. that is crazy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. For sure I will buy this producy again and again</li>
            <li> I have used Maybelline Mineral Powder for years.  I think it covers just as well as the expensive brands.  A good value for the price!</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical of buying the mineral foundation outside of a department store but this is really a great product.  It blends really well and I only use just a small amount.  I have fair skin with a bit of a hue/glow so this works great for my skin.  It isnt heavy at all and it just last well all day into the evening</li>
            <li> This is my favorite make-up! Does not feel like you have any on and goes on so smooth!</li>
            <li> Works great with my color and easy to usr</li>
            <li> I really love this foundation it works and blends perfectly into my skin! The shipping was awesome! I ordered it when I was just about to run out of my old foundation and it got here earlier than expect! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Ilve used Maybellin New York Mineral Powder for some time and am pleased with the consistency and effect of the product itself.  However, the color was listed as &amp;#34;creamy natural&amp;#34; but in my opinion is considerably darker than that.  I consider &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; as more transparent, not adding color.  This was too dark for me.</li>
            <li> It is winter now and when I tried the color it is a little darker than I was expecting. I will be able to use the product in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage when applied.</li>
            <li> Too bad they no longer make it since mineral powder is the best to use on your skin. I guess I will no longer need the Maybelline Brand.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past for myself but this purchase was for a gift to a friend. It worked better for her than for me only because of the shade (not as tan as I used to be). Easy to apply, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Always buying this online, I can not find in the stores any longer. I just think it&#x27;s the perfect cover for my face, beside, look like I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup!!</li>
            <li> SMOOTH, LIGHT WEIGHT, GREAT NATURAL COLOR</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, it is getting harder to find!  Not many stores sell it anymore.  I like this color and the beige ones as well.  It provides good coverage without being heavy.  Goes on easily.  I hope I can continue to find it, I have not found another I like as well!</li>
            <li> This is my fourth purchase of Maybelline&#x27;s mineral powder.  Like it better than Bare Minerals which I used for a long time. I tried a slightly different color this time to see the effect and mix it with the Pure Beige which I&#x27;ve always used.  Can&#x27;t say enough about Maybelline&#x27;s mineral powder.  Even have my sister using it now.</li>
            <li> Great powder.  Like better than Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It blends so nicely. I wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Love the mineral powder foundation.  So light and it covers much better than you&#x27;d think.  I also use the finishing powder.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The first time I tried it I wasn&#x27;t to impressed but after a few more tries this product has become an essential part of my makeup bag. It makes my face look flawless and does a good job covering up my acne when I put it on concealer first. I recommend everyone at least give it a try! You&#x27;ll be impressed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to post this warning so others will take notice.  I used this makeup, and I thought it was heaven sent.  It covered perfectly without a need for liquid foundation.  It smoothed my skin and made me look younger.  But after taking a break and trying something different, I went back to this powder, and suddenly, I got very very ill.  My mind starting racing, my stomach felt like it had turned upside down, and I got this headache at the very tip of my head.  I washed my face, laid down for 1 hour, and forgot about it, thinking it must have been a coincidence.  Next day, I applied the powder again, thinking a face powder could not possibly penetrate your skin that quickly and make you sick that quickly.  YES, I applied it and IMMEDIATELY got sicker than the day before, and was down for the day.  Since then, I have done a little research, and it seems that micro powders can be absorbed into your bloodstream very very quickly, and of course, it is toxic.  It might just be that I am sensitive or even allergic to this product, and you will more than likely not experience the same.  But I wanted to post it in the event that you find yourself ill in the morning for no particular reason, and then you can put two and two together, and know that the cause may be your makeup.  Our skin absorbs things into our bodies more than you think, and you need to be aware of this fact before buying.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know whether these &amp;#34;mineral&amp;#34; products have changed their formula over time but did not like color or &amp;#34; finish&amp;#34;.  Perhaps product better suits younger clients :-)</li>
            <li> It makes me sad that I can no longer find this product in stores. I&#x27;m so happy to have found it on Amazon.  It is the best &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever worn. It stays on all day but it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup. So happy!</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and last nearly all day when I don&#x27;t sweat.  A little darker than I expected, but it will do.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Bare Minerals!  Just get yourself a better kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. Looks darker in the container, but matched my skin perfectly. You also dont have to put on a ton to cover and it doesn&#x27;t take forever to get it right. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Bare Escentuals user and found this product on Amazon - so thought I would give it a try.  I normally wear Medium Beige and the Creamy Natural color in this product is a good match for me.  The application and coverage are the same.  The price difference is REMARKABLE.  I am a convert!</li>
