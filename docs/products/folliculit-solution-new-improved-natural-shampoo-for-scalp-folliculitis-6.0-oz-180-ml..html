            <li>It is a very good medicine for folliculitis .</li>
            <li>This stuff works great if you use as directed.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Worked great at clearing up my folliculitis-BUT broke out in a rash on neck and arms and had to discontinue.&lt;br /&gt;Third</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for my hair</li>
            <li>Good shampoo, helped my condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering many people see great results from this product, I believe it to help people with scalp folluculitis</li>
            <li>(I bought the kind of tea tree oil that comes in a glass bottle and has a glass dropper.</li>
            <li>Per another customer, the tea tree oil should be the kind with melaleuca alternifolia, which is contained in the Ovante products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While it may work for someone with very light folliculitis, it did nothing for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been fighting it for years and nothing works better than doxycycline, prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>it looks healthy</li>
            <li>I have bald spots the size of coins from infections that lasted so many months.</li>
            <li>have since washed my hair two more times with all three Ovante products.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels better, but I am going to continue to use the products to make sure this condition doesn&#x27;t come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The weave was glued on top of two hair caps, and the outer perimeter of the first cap was glued to my head.</li>
            <li>Recently, it became more and more severely.</li>
            <li>super healthy is critical.</li>
            <li>I have folliculitis and when I break out it can get pretty severe.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions on it to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>It really did not help my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I use it every night as directed and has really helped manage the problem.</li>
            <li>but for me I did not notice much of an impact of 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>This seems like a gimmick to me but to the few who reported success with this, you&#x27;re lucky!</li>
            <li>For me, this stuff is controlling the problem my dermatologist said that I would just have to live with.</li>
            <li>I read previous reviews and was excited to order this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Ive had folliculitis for 20 years, tried EVERYTHING from docs and natural docs.  </li>
            <li>A few short weeks ago, I had my first and last quick weave put in.</li>
            <li>No other medicine can give relief than this medicine.</li>
            <li>Scent isnt as terrible as most explain it to be, just rinse well, and followup with a nice smelling coniditioner</li>

            <li> /&gt;After doing some research online and reading other customers&#x27; reviews, I bought this Ovante Folliculit shampoo on March 23, 2015, along with two other Ovante products--the conditioner and the leave-in lotion--to treat what I believe was folliculitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked, but this is not a cheap regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and it really smells bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this shampoo actually made my folliculitis so much worse.  </li>
            <li> When it is at its worst, soak a towel in dissolved epsom salt, microwave it, put it on your head with a stocking cap to retain the heat and wear it till cool.  </li>
            <li> Very thin and runny.  </li>
            <li> product that worked well but caused a bad rash.</li>

            <li> I have folliculitis and when I break out it can get pretty severe. Bald spots that hurt, itch, and eventually pop with puss and blood. Not the absolute wort case but worse than average. This product did nothing to help me whatsoever. I followed the instructions on it to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and used the whole bottle. It did not stop the itching or reduce the folliculitis at all. On top of everything, it smells bad. While it may work for someone with very light folliculitis, it did nothing for me so that&#x27;s why I gave it a low rating. I&#x27;ve been fighting it for years and nothing works better than doxycycline, prescribed by my dermatologist. This seems like a gimmick to me but to the few who reported success with this, you&#x27;re lucky!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great if you use as directed. You need to let it stay on your head for five minutes. This is the only prescription or non prescription product that has helped. I&#x27;ve had Oracea, plain old doxycycline, every medicated shampoo made. For me, this stuff is controlling the problem my dermatologist said that I would just have to live with.</li>
            <li> Very thin and runny.  It really did not help my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I have to say it again it&#x27;s good for my hair it looks healthy but I still have sores on my scalp  and loss of hair</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews and was excited to order this shampoo. Unfortunately, this shampoo actually made my folliculitis so much worse.  I had to discontinue after 4-5 uses due to the pain on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Did not solve the problem and oh the smell. You smell like sulphur after your shower. No more for me thanks.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, helped my condition.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and it really smells bad.</li>
            <li> Ive had folliculitis for 20 years, tried EVERYTHING from docs and natural docs.  I have bald spots the size of coins from infections that lasted so many months. This shampoo helps a lot.  It comforts, it dries out and reduces inflammation in the infected sores.  Even the deep ones.&lt;br /&gt;Other big tips.  Absolutely NO REFINED SUGARS.  ONLY USE Stevia for sweetener.  When it is at its worst, soak a towel in dissolved epsom salt, microwave it, put it on your head with a stocking cap to retain the heat and wear it till cool.  It cleanses and draws out the infections.  It will then heal and go away till the next flare up, usually due to sugar treats when I think I can cheat.&lt;br /&gt;Eating super healthy is critical.</li>
            <li> I have lots of folliculitis on my scalp since 2012. Recently, it became more and more severely. I bought it and after using it for 2 times, there are no heads on my scalp anymore! Thank you, folliculitis shampoo!</li>
            <li> My Folliculitis is gone!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I use it every night as directed and has really helped manage the problem.</li>
            <li> Scent isnt as terrible as most explain it to be, just rinse well, and followup with a nice smelling coniditioner and you wont notice the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering many people see great results from this product, I believe it to help people with scalp folluculitis but for me I did not notice much of an impact of 2 weeks of use. However i may not have follucultis, but some other scalp problem. If you know for sure and are desperate give this product  a shot.</li>
            <li> It is a very good medicine for folliculitis . No other medicine can give relief than this medicine. Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> A few short weeks ago, I had my first and last quick weave put in. The weave was glued on top of two hair caps, and the outer perimeter of the first cap was glued to my head. After the middle of my scalp became itchy and sore, I immediately took that stuff out and washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But about two days or so later, my husband discovered that I had white pustules around some of my hair follicles, and my scalp was still red and irritated in several places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using some Softsoap antibacterial shampoo and castor oil for a while. My scalp seemed to improve, but then the condition worsened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research online and reading other customers&#x27; reviews, I bought this Ovante Folliculit shampoo on March 23, 2015, along with two other Ovante products--the conditioner and the leave-in lotion--to treat what I believe was folliculitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to get the conditioner so I went ahead and used the shampoo and lotion, and I could already feel the difference after about 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I also purchased some 100 percent tea tree oil the same day that I purchased the Ovante products, and I let some of that oil sit on my scalp for about three hours before I washed it with the Ovante products. (I bought the kind of tea tree oil that comes in a glass bottle and has a glass dropper. Per another customer, the tea tree oil should be the kind with melaleuca alternifolia, which is contained in the Ovante products.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair again the next day with the Ovante shampoo and put the leave-in lotion in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since washed my hair two more times with all three Ovante products. I had my husband check my scalp last night, and he didn&#x27;t find any pustules this time. My scalp feels better, but I am going to continue to use the products to make sure this condition doesn&#x27;t come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked, but this is not a cheap regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Another customer also suggested apple cider vinegar.  I bought some, but I have not used that yet.</li>
            <li> Worked great at clearing up my folliculitis-BUT broke out in a rash on neck and arms and had to discontinue.&lt;br /&gt;Third product that worked well but caused a bad rash.</li>
            <li> Worked withIn 10 days!</li>
