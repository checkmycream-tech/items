            <li>so I believe the price I paid was a great price</li>

            <li>I think I got it for a good deal too</li>
            <li>very good is a strong and very good, inexpensive and comfortable product that can meet the expectations of the buyer</li>
            <li>It comes in perfect condition and the package new.</li>
            <li>The product description is accurate, good quality and image.</li>
            <li>This is a great scent, not too strong and not too light.  </li>
            <li>Good product, good price, fast ship.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is  more of a very light summer cologne.</li>
            <li>Very nice smelling cologne, tried it in Macies, The bottle is awesome, the red tone changes with heat, not noticeable in summer since its too hot.</li>
            <li>Hugo Red by Hugo Boss is perfect!</li>
            <li>I prefer a more of an attention getter that would bring the gals to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you will have better luck</li>
            <li>And if you liked it, you are unique.</li>
            <li>I think the original HUGO is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Amazing scent, very daytime-ish and have received lots of compliments on it. :)</li>
            <li>If you want to make sure your getting full potency just buy from a licensed retailer like macys or Bloomingdales.</li>
            <li>The packing was wonderful but this spray in itself is way less than satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for someone who really want his ladies to get real close up on him to smell him.</li>
            <li>Wow nice try by Hugo Boss.</li>
            <li>But still a sweet smell factor for the women.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good cologne</li>
            <li>smell- a sweet, fresh and musky smell.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT IS GREAT AND LONG LASTING SCENT,THE GIRLS LOVE IT</li>
            <li>but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>He loves this cologne and that should say it right there.  </li>
            <li>Scent is not as strong as cool water, it wears off about half a day, wish it last longer though, have to use more to smell good all day long</li>
            <li>first one she likes as others give her headaches when I wear it</li>
            <li>perfume smell is good but not lasting enough.</li>
            <li>The  fragrance smell really good and last a long time</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really had hugo boss til now</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne hoping that all the hype on the RED bottle would be worth it.</li>
            <li>I waited for ever for this new Cologne to it the market, once it arrived at my door</li>
            <li>he got the mail and found out early.  </li>
            <li>reason I gave this 1 stars is that the first few seconds this smells</li>

            <li> reason I gave this 1 stars is that the first few seconds this smells</li>
            <li> Most other colognes if you spray your clothes the smell will last for at the very least a day.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this as I am a fan of certain Hugo Boss colognes and now disappointed that they released such a water down cologne.</li>
            <li> Every once in while in the heat you can get a faint whiff of it but, not enough to say that this is worth the cash.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is my skin as I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Made a mental note to try it in USA.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fake, I was a bit skeptical because it wasn&#x27;t being fulfilled by amazon, sure enough I get it and the scent wears off in 15 mins.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite the same product I had used in the past.</li>
            <li> even if i m using double quantity than average its hardly noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> , it is a little pricey  </li>
            <li> The smells fades in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The smell is cheesy, even in middle school one wouldn&#x27;t want to smell so &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a minute, the smell is unbearable at least to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s weak and does not stand out.</li>
            <li> but, as for me this is a fail for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> maybe its a fake</li>
            <li> I got this for my youngest son and unfortunately it came by USPS which he got and opened; it&#x27;s for Xmas.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money on useless junk!</li>
            <li> I must say that this cologne is very weak!</li>

            <li> Hugo Red by Hugo Boss is perfect! I love that smell, suits perfect for my style. I recommend it for all!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne hoping that all the hype on the RED bottle would be worth it. I must say that this cologne is very weak! The smells fades in a few minutes. Every once in while in the heat you can get a faint whiff of it but, not enough to say that this is worth the cash. I was excited to get this as I am a fan of certain Hugo Boss colognes and now disappointed that they released such a water down cologne. I have worn it for two days now and keep having to re-apply in hopes that maybe I would change my  mind about it. Most other colognes if you spray your clothes the smell will last for at the very least a day. This did not even last on my shirt. Perhaps it is my skin as I have very dry skin but one would think that the cologne would last on a cotton shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell- a sweet, fresh and musky smell. (does smell good when you can smell it)&lt;br /&gt;Longevity  - poor&lt;br /&gt;Silage - poor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I gave this 1 stars is that the first few seconds this smells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is  more of a very light summer cologne. Maybe good for someone who really want his ladies to get real close up on him to smell him. I prefer a more of an attention getter that would bring the gals to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe you will have better luck but, as for me this is a fail for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit, just noticed that my bottle does not change color when you touch it like its supposed to do.....maybe its a fake but I got from the mall parfume store.....</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling cologne, tried it in Macies, The bottle is awesome, the red tone changes with heat, not noticeable in summer since its too hot. Scent is not as strong as cool water, it wears off about half a day, wish it last longer though, have to use more to smell good all day long</li>
            <li> I think the original HUGO is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;I wont be getting this again, it&#x27;s weak and does not stand out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fake, I was a bit skeptical because it wasn&#x27;t being fulfilled by amazon, sure enough I get it and the scent wears off in 15 mins. Some may say that it&#x27;s my body&#x27;s chemistry but even cheaper store brand colognes last longer, my guess is the company is buying diluted bottles from a 3rd party. If you want to make sure your getting full potency just buy from a licensed retailer like macys or Bloomingdales.</li>
            <li> Wow nice try by Hugo Boss. Smells like dollar store fragrance. Very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money on useless junk!</li>
            <li> Perfect.. It comes in perfect condition and the package new. I bought 150 ml. It was to a friend gift</li>
            <li> The product description is accurate, good quality and image. Fulfilled with my expectations. You can trust and purchase it without any inconvenience.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent, not too strong and not too light.  Got compliments at a Korean BBQ restaurant so this just shows how well it stands out from scent of BBQ cooked meats, lol.  This is a great collection for those looking for an all day and any day cologne</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite the same product I had used in the past. But still a sweet smell factor for the women.</li>
            <li> I got this is as a gift along with the shower gel and the after shave set. The packing was wonderful but this spray in itself is way less than satisfactory. The smell is cheesy, even in middle school one wouldn&#x27;t want to smell so &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a minute, the smell is unbearable at least to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this to everyone. And if you liked it, you are unique.</li>
            <li> very good is a strong and very good, inexpensive and comfortable product that can meet the expectations of the buyer</li>

            <li> I got this for my youngest son and unfortunately it came by USPS which he got and opened; it&#x27;s for Xmas.  He has been nagging me or negotiating ever since.  He loves this cologne and that should say it right there.  He keeps telling me he can&#x27;t wait for Xmas, he needs it now!!!  It&#x27;s such a good cologne it&#x27;s killing him to have to wait for Xmas to get it.  I told him it wasn&#x27;t my fault he got the mail and found out early.  I think I got it for a good deal too so I believe the price I paid was a great price and my son loves the cologne.</li>
            <li> It was on time!!!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> PRODUCT IS GREAT AND LONG LASTING SCENT,THE GIRLS LOVE IT,I GET COMPLIMENTS ALWAYS!A MUST BUY!!I I WILL BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> I waited for ever for this new Cologne to it the market, once it arrived at my door I tried it out that evening while I was at a dinner 2 out three ladies complimented me. Haven&#x27;t really had hugo boss til now but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my son. The  fragrance smell really good and last a long time , it is a little pricey  but it made a great birthday gift.</li>
