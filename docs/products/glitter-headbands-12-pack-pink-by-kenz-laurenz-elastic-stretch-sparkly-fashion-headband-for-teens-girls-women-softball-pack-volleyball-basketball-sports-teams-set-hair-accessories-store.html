            <li>I find that the type of material wasn&#x27;t very good</li>
            <li>They fit perfect on my head!</li>
            <li>and I loved the way I looked in it.</li>
            <li>They offer tons of Colors to fit your teams Color on your uniform or could be the perfect accessory to any outfit.</li>
            <li>so i didnt expect it to be that good.</li>
            <li>Love this headband!</li>
            <li>So far the best headbands I have ever had...</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, but</li>
            <li>Love this headband.</li>
            <li>you can make something better quality...</li>
            <li>If you need a bunch for a team or something it would be ok.</li>
            <li>my daughter owns it now! :)</li>
            <li>This fit well on me</li>
            <li>I know they&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li>Very pretty color though.</li>
            <li>This Headband Is made pretty cheap, looks like a piece of paper with glitter sprinkled on it.</li>
            <li>The headband is very pretty</li>
            <li>Pretty, but so cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected it to be and very happy my daughter loves all the sparkle also not a big problem with sparkles coming off yet</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>Look so pretty.</li>
            <li>It is really cute but the band gets stretched out and doesn&#x27;t retain its shape/rigidity well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but won&#x27;t hold up for very long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little large on her, but stays in place for the most part and she will grow into it!</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it is that the glitter comes off easily and gets into her hair.</li>
            <li>Comfy not to tight where you get a headache... comes in a lot of colors and worth it for sure...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item looks just like picture, sturdy, holds up well to my 3 year old tugging it on and off!  </li>
            <li>and I know it won&#x27;t hold up to normal wear.</li>
            <li>pretty in pretty in pink</li>
            <li>Love these little glitter head bands!</li>
            <li>but they actually look cheap and mine broke not to long after I put it on</li>

            <li>not what i expected but it was still pretty</li>
            <li>Love the pink sparkles but a little small when trying to put it on over your whole head.</li>
            <li>I like to think I don&#x27;t have a big head, but this was pretty tight on my head.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just basically a paper band. It&#x27;s ok but won&#x27;t hold up for very long. If you need a bunch for a team or something it would be ok.</li>
