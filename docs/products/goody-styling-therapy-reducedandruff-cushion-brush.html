            <li>We&#x27;re are both happy.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the scalp and makes you feel good about your hair!</li>
            <li>Still, while the copper is there, they do a good job and make my wife happy, which is the goal by the way.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these copper-infused brushes are doing the work it&#x27;s supposed to be doing, but the prongs feel good against my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Feels good against my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush and I will defiantly buy another one when mine wears out.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>So good</li>
            <li>The bristle do feel good when going against your scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was all good for a year or two.</li>
            <li>The reviews were good</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a good way yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do like to use it if my scalp is itchy because it feels good, like it&#x27;s maybe pulling up some of the flakes.</li>
            <li>I give it a good brushing with a goody copper brush</li>
            <li>I trusted the good reviews, but this brush pulls out my hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise feels good to use it if you can handle the smell.</li>
            <li>It feels SO good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>The brush feels great in my hair, but the way a product smells is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>Is perfect to calm an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>So pleased I thought to look for it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;she will fall in love with it !</li>

            <li>Love the copper bristles!</li>
            <li>My favorite brush of all time!</li>
            <li>So glad i found it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>love this hairbrush.... BUY IT!</li>
            <li>Amazing brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suffer from scalp conditions but this is a really nice brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice brush for being a brush.</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t use this as a substitute for a dandruff shampoo because honestly it hasn&#x27;t changed my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li>I liked it so well</li>
            <li>feel relax and effective when using this comb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I have one of my own</li>
            <li>but the copper wore off from the bristles and stopped being effective.  </li>
            <li>brush itself is nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of this brush...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually more compact and better than what I had before!</li>
            <li>And most importantly it just feels really good when you brush your hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s very important while bent over.</li>
            <li>The bristles were very comfortable on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Eh, I&#x27;m not so sure about this...</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say the brush is compltely stripped of the copper, most of th bristles are gone--</li>
            <li>People need to sell more metal bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li>I use this brush to rid my hair of static electricity.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it unless I can get the smell out.</li>
            <li>I had seen this product many years before in the store and paid no attention to its claims that the copper infused bristles could manage dandruff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant as more of a scalp massaging brush.  </li>
            <li>the stores stopped selling it we were lost and kept pulling this brush out of the closet trying to get one more grooming out of it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>She remarked it was better than \\&quot;those drug store brands.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love this hair brush.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Way better then</li>
            <li>I am so pleased to see that Amazon carried the hairbrush.</li>
            <li>I love that this does not cause static hair and my hair is always shiny.</li>
            <li>Love the comfort and style of the brush.</li>
            <li>Love this brush wish I had it years ago.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Glad this brush exists.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair from frizzing and getting static.</li>
            <li>These are the best brushes for my coarse, frizzy and curly hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I really love the way this brush makes my scalp feel.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a great brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li>So make sure you clean the brush periodically!</li>
            <li>Three girls in the house with long hair, this brush is awesome for tangles and massaging the scalp to stimulate hair growth.</li>
            <li>This brush is awesome for detangling wet hair and it just is a wonderful head massaging brush, especially for those with eczema or psoriasis!  </li>
            <li>I nearly cried with joy upon opening the box.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, they&#x27;re available here!</li>
            <li>but my hair gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>but as soon as you&#x27;ve worked it in it&#x27;s just fantastic.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t get too tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, comfortable to hold and came quickly.</li>
            <li>Either way, no complaints from her and her hair looks pretty :)</li>
            <li>I originally saw it in the All You magazine.  </li>
            <li>My hair and scalp really feel so much better after use and its easy to clean</li>
            <li>I like that the copper will help keep the brush clean too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not feel so self conscious when you go out.  </li>
            <li>Best brushes out there for thick hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for good dandruff control (in addition to my regular routine of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and conditioner).</li>
            <li>Full disclosure:</li>
            <li>Never having too much of a dandruff problem BEFORE having my son, the brush was just a good way of keeping my hair soft.   </li>
            <li>Luckily I found it, and kept a lookout for a replacement.</li>
            <li>High quality, helps reduce static electricity during the winter months.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as described and on time delivery!</li>
            <li>I found out that the larger sizes keep their bristles versus this one where they begin to fall out more easily.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon, for making it available.  </li>
            <li>calm scratch that doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re hurting yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles were so shiny that I pulled each one of them out and put them in a sealed container in an effort to preserve them so that future generations can see what good really was in 2012 and 2013.</li>
            <li>This product was great - UNTIL it started to smell very strange and strong and left an odor on my hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I like the brush as it feels good on scalp.</li>
            <li>all right....</li>
            <li>loved the brush at first but after about a month the brush started to smell because i was brushing my hair when it was wet.i would get the brush if i didn&#x27;t brush my hair when its wet.</li>
            <li>This copper-bristled brush is excellent for those with dry itchy scalp due to skin sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>but since it attracts more dead skin it needs to be cleaned more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if its not helping my dandruff because I&#x27;m not able to pull it through my hair/scalp easily or because it just isn&#x27;t that effective.</li>
            <li>do love the way the bristles actually reach my head.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I figured it&#x27;s worth a shot, although I didn&#x27;t think it would really work.  </li>
            <li>First I purchased one for myself.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to worry about flakes on my clothes or putting up my hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is great, especially for long hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on other reviews, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It does not style as much as you might expect, but it does reduce itchiness a lot Worth of buying.</li>
            <li>No amount of blue shampoo or tar nonsense or snake oils or magic potions has done JACK to my dandruff.  </li>
            <li>This brush was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It also seems to tangle my long hair more.</li>
            <li>We have not been able to find those particular brushed anymore, but these work just as well.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine told me the copper kills a certain bacteria that overgrows on the scalp.</li>
            <li>This brush is the perfect size, it is a little stiff for the first week --</li>
            <li>The bristles feel nice on my scalp, but since I have thick, wavy hair, I make sure that I use a regular brush to get out any knots first.</li>
            <li>Now the dandruff is not on your scalp as much.</li>
            <li>I advised them to use it gently.  </li>
            <li>It also works very well for me for styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush has really helped with dandruff.</li>
            <li>This brush relieves the severe excema I&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li>the cushion is so much nicer than the ones that came with the couch.  </li>
            <li>I also like an intense brushing of my scalp.</li>
            <li>and things have improved more rapidly than expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing on the scalp and really gets well with getting stubborn hair under control</li>
            <li>and maybe I just have really stubborn dandruff, but I have not noticed a reduction in the amount of dandruff I have.</li>
            <li>a massage and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;planing to buy another one for  </li>
            <li>So you have to first brush with your normal, and then with this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;am beginning to really like it.  </li>
            <li>The copper seems to soothe the skin and make hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a dandruff problem, but my scalp has itched for years.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair really shiny when blow drying with it.</li>
            <li>Dunno about the copper or scalp benefits, but the bristles feel good, and are well spaced out for those of us with too thick hair</li>
            <li>It glides easily thru my long hair.</li>
            <li>This brush has help immensely with my scalp issues and killed the flaking plus gives a pretty good massage on my scalp</li>
            <li>arrived early, feels good on the scalp with excessive dandruff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shampoo, so my hair is more oily can your average persons.</li>
            <li>Well, it did work, and it worked far better than I ever expected it to.  </li>
            <li>Instead it has been made into smaller bits and brushed into your stylish hairdo.</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t mind the size, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li>As with any new brush it is a bit stiff but it does reduce static.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on the scalp and helps a little but have to have another brush for wet hair.</li>
            <li>I have dandruff and now a new brush to brush my dadruffy and hairy scalp in hopes to brush my condition away.</li>
            <li>With about a year of wear and tear, it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>So many new brushes have plastic bristles and cause crazy static.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get this brush-- through T-gel and various other products, this brush has helpd the most with my problems.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, not sure why they stopped selling it in stores.</li>
            <li>It does feel nice on an itchy scalp, but seeing as my regular brush (that DOES detangle) is already a metal bristle brush, I&#x27;m not sure this is serving any purpose for me.</li>
            <li>Many years later, I began dealing with some minor dandruff and read in Allure magazine that this brush actually works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d about given up finding one in a store to replace my old, worn brush like this.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old made this picture.</li>
            <li>It has completely eradicated the dandruff I&#x27;ve battled since childhood.</li>
            <li>Now I use an all natural organic shampoo from Bubble and Bee and rinse my hair with vinegar for a conditioner which doesn&#x27;t give dandruff a chance.</li>
            <li>The one hesitation I have is that these smaller size brushes have the bristles popping out rather fast.  </li>
            <li>I believe the larger size doesn&#x27;t put as much pressure on the bristles so they don&#x27;t fall out as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well at helping with a sensitive itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful that this would work, and at first I thought it was, but after using it for a month and a half, I don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li>It is my third because my sister took my last one and my first one that I had eventually just needed replaced.</li>
            <li>This was the first, most expensive brush that I ever bought.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a copper-infused brush at my local pharmacy stores, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers them.  </li>
            <li>My hair is getting greasy faster using this brush, it&#x27;s frustrating because it massages nicely the sculp and relieves itchy irritated skin, but I can use it only the day before washing my hair(</li>
            <li>I first bought this brush several years ago, and when mine finally seemed to be on its last legs, found the discontinued brush on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Even the cheap 99cent store brushes last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very upset and disappointed that this brush is not lasting longer as it should and</li>
            <li>I had purchased it for my son, who has thick fine hair and he often has dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I am buying these and replacing the old ones as the copper wears off for the supposed health benefits which may or may not be present.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That was the most ridiculous thing I&#x27;ve heard!</li>
            <li>It really cleans well, but due to that reason there would be gunks stuck on the brush.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s kinda hard to clean</li>
            <li>I just wish it was a bit smaller as the current size takes up considerable amount of luggage space.</li>
            <li>I still get a few tiny flakes occasionally, but not the big sore patches with large flakes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have bad dandruff, but enough that I thought I would try it, plus my roommate had one and it felt good to brush your hair, so I would borrow hers.</li>

            <li> /&gt;However, I do like to use it if my scalp is itchy because it feels good, like it&#x27;s maybe pulling up some of the flakes.</li>
            <li> I give it a good brushing with a goody copper brush</li>
            <li> I trusted the good reviews, but this brush pulls out my hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise feels good to use it if you can handle the smell.</li>
            <li> It feels SO good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> The brush feels great in my hair, but the way a product smells is very important to me.  </li>
            <li> Is perfect to calm an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> So pleased I thought to look for it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;she will fall in love with it !</li>
            <li> LOVE them!</li>
            <li> Love the copper bristles!</li>
            <li> My favorite brush of all time!</li>
            <li> So glad i found it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> love this hairbrush.... BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from scalp conditions but this is a really nice brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice brush for being a brush.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t use this as a substitute for a dandruff shampoo because honestly it hasn&#x27;t changed my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I liked it so well</li>
            <li> feel relax and effective when using this comb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I have one of my own</li>
            <li> but the copper wore off from the bristles and stopped being effective.  </li>
            <li> brush itself is nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of this brush...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually more compact and better than what I had before!</li>
            <li> And most importantly it just feels really good when you brush your hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very important while bent over.</li>
            <li> The bristles were very comfortable on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Eh, I&#x27;m not so sure about this...</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say the brush is compltely stripped of the copper, most of th bristles are gone--</li>
            <li> People need to sell more metal bristle brushes.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush to rid my hair of static electricity.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it unless I can get the smell out.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product many years before in the store and paid no attention to its claims that the copper infused bristles could manage dandruff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant as more of a scalp massaging brush.  </li>
            <li> the stores stopped selling it we were lost and kept pulling this brush out of the closet trying to get one more grooming out of it.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> She remarked it was better than \\&quot;those drug store brands.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this hair brush.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Way better then</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to see that Amazon carried the hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I love that this does not cause static hair and my hair is always shiny.</li>
            <li> Love the comfort and style of the brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush wish I had it years ago.  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Glad this brush exists.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from frizzing and getting static.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes for my coarse, frizzy and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I really love the way this brush makes my scalp feel.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a great brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li> So make sure you clean the brush periodically!</li>
            <li> Three girls in the house with long hair, this brush is awesome for tangles and massaging the scalp to stimulate hair growth.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome for detangling wet hair and it just is a wonderful head massaging brush, especially for those with eczema or psoriasis!  </li>
            <li> I nearly cried with joy upon opening the box.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, they&#x27;re available here!</li>
            <li> but my hair gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> but as soon as you&#x27;ve worked it in it&#x27;s just fantastic.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t get too tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, comfortable to hold and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Either way, no complaints from her and her hair looks pretty :)</li>
            <li> I originally saw it in the All You magazine.  </li>
            <li> My hair and scalp really feel so much better after use and its easy to clean</li>
            <li> I like that the copper will help keep the brush clean too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not feel so self conscious when you go out.  </li>
            <li> Best brushes out there for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for good dandruff control (in addition to my regular routine of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and conditioner).</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:</li>
            <li> Never having too much of a dandruff problem BEFORE having my son, the brush was just a good way of keeping my hair soft.   </li>
            <li> Luckily I found it, and kept a lookout for a replacement.</li>
            <li> High quality, helps reduce static electricity during the winter months.</li>
            <li> It came exactly as described and on time delivery!</li>
            <li> I found out that the larger sizes keep their bristles versus this one where they begin to fall out more easily.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon, for making it available.  </li>
            <li> calm scratch that doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re hurting yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles were so shiny that I pulled each one of them out and put them in a sealed container in an effort to preserve them so that future generations can see what good really was in 2012 and 2013.</li>
            <li> This product was great - UNTIL it started to smell very strange and strong and left an odor on my hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like the brush as it feels good on scalp.</li>
            <li> all right....</li>
            <li> loved the brush at first but after about a month the brush started to smell because i was brushing my hair when it was wet.i would get the brush if i didn&#x27;t brush my hair when its wet.</li>
            <li> This copper-bristled brush is excellent for those with dry itchy scalp due to skin sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> but since it attracts more dead skin it needs to be cleaned more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if its not helping my dandruff because I&#x27;m not able to pull it through my hair/scalp easily or because it just isn&#x27;t that effective.</li>
            <li> do love the way the bristles actually reach my head.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;s worth a shot, although I didn&#x27;t think it would really work.  </li>
            <li> First I purchased one for myself.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to worry about flakes on my clothes or putting up my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is great, especially for long hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on other reviews, and I love it!</li>
            <li> It does not style as much as you might expect, but it does reduce itchiness a lot Worth of buying.</li>
            <li> No amount of blue shampoo or tar nonsense or snake oils or magic potions has done JACK to my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It also seems to tangle my long hair more.</li>
            <li> We have not been able to find those particular brushed anymore, but these work just as well.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me the copper kills a certain bacteria that overgrows on the scalp.</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect size, it is a little stiff for the first week --</li>
            <li> The bristles feel nice on my scalp, but since I have thick, wavy hair, I make sure that I use a regular brush to get out any knots first.</li>
            <li> Now the dandruff is not on your scalp as much.</li>
            <li> I advised them to use it gently.  </li>
            <li> It also works very well for me for styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush has really helped with dandruff.</li>
            <li> This brush relieves the severe excema I&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li> the cushion is so much nicer than the ones that came with the couch.  </li>
            <li> I also like an intense brushing of my scalp.</li>
            <li> and things have improved more rapidly than expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing on the scalp and really gets well with getting stubborn hair under control</li>
            <li> and maybe I just have really stubborn dandruff, but I have not noticed a reduction in the amount of dandruff I have.</li>
            <li> a massage and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;planing to buy another one for  </li>
            <li> So you have to first brush with your normal, and then with this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;am beginning to really like it.  </li>
            <li> The copper seems to soothe the skin and make hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a dandruff problem, but my scalp has itched for years.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair really shiny when blow drying with it.</li>
            <li> Dunno about the copper or scalp benefits, but the bristles feel good, and are well spaced out for those of us with too thick hair</li>
            <li> It glides easily thru my long hair.</li>
            <li> This brush has help immensely with my scalp issues and killed the flaking plus gives a pretty good massage on my scalp</li>
            <li> arrived early, feels good on the scalp with excessive dandruff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo, so my hair is more oily can your average persons.</li>
            <li> Well, it did work, and it worked far better than I ever expected it to.  </li>
            <li> Instead it has been made into smaller bits and brushed into your stylish hairdo.</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t mind the size, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush compared to my old one.  </li>
            <li> As with any new brush it is a bit stiff but it does reduce static.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on the scalp and helps a little but have to have another brush for wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have dandruff and now a new brush to brush my dadruffy and hairy scalp in hopes to brush my condition away.</li>
            <li> With about a year of wear and tear, it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> So many new brushes have plastic bristles and cause crazy static.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get this brush-- through T-gel and various other products, this brush has helpd the most with my problems.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, not sure why they stopped selling it in stores.</li>
            <li> It does feel nice on an itchy scalp, but seeing as my regular brush (that DOES detangle) is already a metal bristle brush, I&#x27;m not sure this is serving any purpose for me.</li>
            <li> Many years later, I began dealing with some minor dandruff and read in Allure magazine that this brush actually works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d about given up finding one in a store to replace my old, worn brush like this.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old made this picture.</li>
            <li> It has completely eradicated the dandruff I&#x27;ve battled since childhood.</li>
            <li> Now I use an all natural organic shampoo from Bubble and Bee and rinse my hair with vinegar for a conditioner which doesn&#x27;t give dandruff a chance.</li>
            <li> The one hesitation I have is that these smaller size brushes have the bristles popping out rather fast.  </li>
            <li> I believe the larger size doesn&#x27;t put as much pressure on the bristles so they don&#x27;t fall out as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well at helping with a sensitive itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful that this would work, and at first I thought it was, but after using it for a month and a half, I don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> It is my third because my sister took my last one and my first one that I had eventually just needed replaced.</li>
            <li> This was the first, most expensive brush that I ever bought.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a copper-infused brush at my local pharmacy stores, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers them.  </li>
            <li> My hair is getting greasy faster using this brush, it&#x27;s frustrating because it massages nicely the sculp and relieves itchy irritated skin, but I can use it only the day before washing my hair(</li>
            <li> I first bought this brush several years ago, and when mine finally seemed to be on its last legs, found the discontinued brush on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Even the cheap 99cent store brushes last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very upset and disappointed that this brush is not lasting longer as it should and</li>
            <li> I had purchased it for my son, who has thick fine hair and he often has dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I am buying these and replacing the old ones as the copper wears off for the supposed health benefits which may or may not be present.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That was the most ridiculous thing I&#x27;ve heard!</li>
            <li> It really cleans well, but due to that reason there would be gunks stuck on the brush.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s kinda hard to clean</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a bit smaller as the current size takes up considerable amount of luggage space.</li>
            <li> I still get a few tiny flakes occasionally, but not the big sore patches with large flakes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad dandruff, but enough that I thought I would try it, plus my roommate had one and it felt good to brush your hair, so I would borrow hers.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with the first one was that it started losing bristles and there was a big patch of 5-7 bristles missing from the center.  </li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last as long as I would like them to.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long in our household.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a new one because it looks like it&#x27;s been discontinued since I had some trouble finding it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to get hair out of it, and some funky stuff builds up on the bristles which can&#x27;t be easily removed because of the knob on the end of each bristle.</li>
            <li> The moment I took my brush out of the package, I noticed the strange smell.  </li>
            <li> I only brushed my hair a few times with it, and the smell instantly was in my hair.</li>
            <li> I think the plastic bristles are too harsh and damaging to detangle hair as compared to a natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Will buy again and again as long as these brushes are around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sturdy brush and can manage my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> After looking various places for 2 months, I finally broke down and purchasd one here @</li>
            <li> This brush took me a little while to get used to, as I&#x27;d been using a much smaller one and for some reason pictured it being smaller.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my dog to help get rid of dry flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps your scalp from having dry flakes.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp and have tried everything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super skeptical when I bought one in 2008, but it is the one thing that has helped me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously had issues with my hair pulling out the plastic bristles in other brushes but this brush not a single bristle has been pulled out.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to brush the roots several times a day, however, whenever I did this it agitated the dandruff and I ended up looking like a mess.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it away after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> It can be used on wet hair, and gets the tangles out without pulling out hair.  </li>
            <li> Also comes in few different sizes.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not at all practical as a brush, since it shouldn&#x27;t be used on wet hair or for detangling.</li>
            <li> The bristles turned a tarnished-looking green after only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few metal-bristle brushes left</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice a lot of differences from my other brush in regards to my scalp.</li>
            <li> When this brush broke down and we found out</li>
            <li> Shake your hair, run your fingers or the brush throughout while your head is down and watch it snow.</li>
            <li> I have much less dandruff now.    </li>
            <li> and it seems I am loosing less hair at washings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too expensive to last only for 12months!</li>
            <li> I received a couple of days ago and it already appears to be less.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy and well constructed</li>
            <li> One of the bristles was missing by the time I received the hair brush.  </li>
            <li> The missing bristle was nowhere to be found, not even in the packaging.  </li>
            <li> No more snow on his black shirts.</li>
            <li> It has made no difference and the brush is very firm and has little give</li>
            <li> I found this brush difficult to drag through my curls - the bristles are not very strong and several have fallen out or broken off.</li>
            <li> It really helps, and he doesn&#x27;t seem to itch as badly as he did before.</li>
            <li> The oh thing I have really noticed is a really bad smell in my hair after using this.</li>
            <li> Had this product a few years ago when they carried it at the drugstores and Walmart, but Goody discontinued it for some reason!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if that claim works.  </li>
            <li> No static flying hair.  </li>
            <li> Wasted money for me!</li>
            <li> so it feels hard and scratchy when using it.</li>
            <li> Had ordered 2, both came with a missing bristle !!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an issue, just seems a little weird to be brushing my hair with it.</li>
            <li> but it still brushs, at least!  </li>
            <li> Then use this brush to brush down the crazy look.</li>
            <li> As directions indicate, this brush is NOT for detangling - does a rather poor job of that.  </li>
            <li> Goody&#x27;s poor customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This started to smell bad after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This brush fails to do so.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can no longer find these brushes in stores.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when buying this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that didn&#x27;t seem to be the case for</li>
            <li> Smells very bad - like dead fish.</li>
            <li> and I would buy it as a brush, but unfortunately it has not made a dent in my dandruff:(</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a copper-infused brush at my local pharmacy stores, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers them.  I don&#x27;t know if these copper-infused brushes are doing the work it&#x27;s supposed to be doing, but the prongs feel good against my scalp.  I am buying these and replacing the old ones as the copper wears off for the supposed health benefits which may or may not be present.  I just like the brush itself.  Feels good against my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Great item.  I&#x27;d about given up finding one in a store to replace my old, worn brush like this.  Thanks, Amazon, for making it available.  It&#x27;s actually more compact and better than what I had before!</li>
            <li> Does it reduce dandruff? Eh, I&#x27;m not so sure about this... I think just the fact your dragging something on your head is what helps that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the way the bristles actually reach my head.&lt;br /&gt;A calm scratch that doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re hurting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a great brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Did not help dandruff, or scalp.  I had purchased it for my son, who has thick fine hair and he often has dandruff.  Tried everything, so when I seen this, I took a chance hoping it would work.  It didn&#x27;t.  My son, however, likes it as a brush.  I am noticing that the bristles are turning greenish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from scalp conditions but this is a really nice brush.  I think you&#x27;re getting what you&#x27;re paying for.  It&#x27;s bigger than I like but I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I had one of these brushes for the longest time while they were still selling them in the stores.  Never having too much of a dandruff problem BEFORE having my son, the brush was just a good way of keeping my hair soft.   After my son, I started having severe dandruff problems and couldn&#x27;t find the brush. I was devastated. Luckily I found it, and kept a lookout for a replacement. Let&#x27;s just say the brush is compltely stripped of the copper, most of th bristles are gone-- but it still brushs, at least!  After looking various places for 2 months, I finally broke down and purchasd one here @ Amazon. I can&#x27;t wait to get this brush-- through T-gel and various other products, this brush has helpd the most with my problems.</li>
            <li> So many new brushes have plastic bristles and cause crazy static. This brush is the perfect size, it is a little stiff for the first week -- but as soon as you&#x27;ve worked it in it&#x27;s just fantastic. When I realised that I could no longer find them in stores, I purchased not one -- but 3 online!  Trust me -- it&#x27;s the best brush you&#x27;ll ever have!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush compared to my old one.  It is heavy and well constructed and I would buy it as a brush, but unfortunately it has not made a dent in my dandruff:(</li>
            <li> People need to sell more metal bristle brushes.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff - I use this brush to rid my hair of static electricity.  This is my 2nd one.  The only problem I had with the first one was that it started losing bristles and there was a big patch of 5-7 bristles missing from the center.  I wanted to get a new one because it looks like it&#x27;s been discontinued since I had some trouble finding it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The moment I took my brush out of the package, I noticed the strange smell.  I only brushed my hair a few times with it, and the smell instantly was in my hair. The brush feels great in my hair, but the way a product smells is very important to me.  I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it unless I can get the smell out.</li>
            <li> Very good product! It came exactly as described and on time delivery! It works well too! Feels good on the scalp and makes you feel good about your hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is getting greasy faster using this brush, it&#x27;s frustrating because it massages nicely the sculp and relieves itchy irritated skin, but I can use it only the day before washing my hair(</li>
            <li> This product was great - UNTIL it started to smell very strange and strong and left an odor on my hair. I had to throw it away after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product many years before in the store and paid no attention to its claims that the copper infused bristles could manage dandruff.  Many years later, I began dealing with some minor dandruff and read in Allure magazine that this brush actually works.  Of course, they no longer sold this brush in stores, so I ordered it off of Amazon.  I figured it&#x27;s worth a shot, although I didn&#x27;t think it would really work.  Well, it did work, and it worked far better than I ever expected it to.  I have much less dandruff now.    As per the instructions, I only use this to brush my roots as this brush is not meant for detangling.  It&#x27;s meant as more of a scalp massaging brush.  I think the plastic bristles are too harsh and damaging to detangle hair as compared to a natural bristle brush.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old made this picture. When this brush broke down and we found out the stores stopped selling it we were lost and kept pulling this brush out of the closet trying to get one more grooming out of it. Three girls in the house with long hair, this brush is awesome for tangles and massaging the scalp to stimulate hair growth. I have psoriasis on my scalp and it relieved the itching but I have no clue what it does for dandruff. So pleased I thought to look for it on Amazon! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> She kept forgetting her hairbrush when she stayed over so I found this one for her. The copper tips (or whatever they&#x27;re made of) were a selling point. Either way, no complaints from her and her hair looks pretty :) She remarked it was better than \\&quot;those drug store brands.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I buy these for my dog to help get rid of dry flakey skin. It really helps, and he doesn&#x27;t seem to itch as badly as he did before. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Had ordered 2, both came with a missing bristle !! maybe it is a manufacturing defect. Other than that, I like the brush as it feels good on scalp. Cannot comment about its claim to remove dandruff-- as I did not notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush for being a brush. It will not reduce having dandruff if your person who has dandruff. I have dandruff and now a new brush to brush my dadruffy and hairy scalp in hopes to brush my condition away. Here is the reality of it. It will brush your hair while the metal brush tips loosen the dandruff and reduces its skin contact. Now the dandruff is not on your scalp as much. Instead it has been made into smaller bits and brushed into your stylish hairdo. The next step is to remove the dandruff from your body. This brush fails to do so. If you have the time, I suggest going outdoors or in the shower  and bend over. Shake your hair, run your fingers or the brush throughout while your head is down and watch it snow. Don&#x27;t forget to breath. That&#x27;s very important while bent over. Continue rubbing yourself until your scalp stops snowing.  Then use this brush to brush down the crazy look. Or not?</li>
            <li> This is a good brush and I will defiantly buy another one when mine wears out. However, don&#x27;t use this as a substitute for a dandruff shampoo because honestly it hasn&#x27;t changed my dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> I love this hair brush.  First I purchased one for myself.  I liked it so well, I ordered one for each of my daughters and my grandaughters. I advised them to use it gently.  It also works very well for me for styling my hair.  I originally saw it in the All You magazine.  A great hair brush!</li>
            <li> This brush has really helped with dandruff. I ordered a second one</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to worry about flakes on my clothes or putting up my hair. Goody also has excellent customer service. This brush relieves the severe excema I&#x27;ve had my whole life. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I have yet to see results.  I use the brush two to three times a day like the directions state.  The oh thing I have really noticed is a really bad smell in my hair after using this.</li>
            <li> I first bought this brush several years ago, and when mine finally seemed to be on its last legs, found the discontinued brush on Amazon.com.  This brush is awesome for detangling wet hair and it just is a wonderful head massaging brush, especially for those with eczema or psoriasis!  I bought TWO from Amazon so that I would never be without...that&#x27;s how much I love this brush.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the brush, I use it in the morning and night. It feels good on my scalp. It hasn&#x27;t changed the flakiness but it&#x27;s like a bit of a therapeutic massage.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago. With about a year of wear and tear, it was time for a new one. Walgreens didn&#x27;t carry it anymore. So a year later I find it on amazon! The copper does a great job of clearing up my scalp. Way better then my shampoo. I use both. Def recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last as long as I would like them to. If I could buy a solid copper bristle brush, even at $100 I would do it. These will last my wife about 3 months max before the copper coating is gone from the bristles. Still, while the copper is there, they do a good job and make my wife happy, which is the goal by the way.</li>
            <li> the cushion is so much nicer than the ones that came with the couch.  I nearly cried with joy upon opening the box.  The bristles were so shiny that I pulled each one of them out and put them in a sealed container in an effort to preserve them so that future generations can see what good really was in 2012 and 2013.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Had this product a few years ago when they carried it at the drugstores and Walmart, but Goody discontinued it for some reason!  Well, I looked everywhere and finally found it!  This copper-bristled brush is excellent for those with dry itchy scalp due to skin sensitivity.  This is a miracle product because it prevents dandruff and hair loss.  Great for massaging the scalp without pulling hair out.  The copper keeps microbes/fungus under control.  Will buy again and again as long as these brushes are around.</li>
            <li> Have dandruff? Get this NOW! Changed my life.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush. It truly works as advertised</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every anti-dandruff shampoo there is...I&#x27;ve tried using acne face wash (someone told me that works...if it does, it doesn&#x27;t for me). Nothing works like these brushes. It has completely eradicated the dandruff I&#x27;ve battled since childhood. Yay! Unfortunately, I can no longer find these brushes in stores. Fortunately, they&#x27;re available here! My brush arrived in a timely manner and is working wonderfully. When this one bites the dust (as all brushes eventually do), I&#x27;ll order another!</li>
            <li> I owned a similar hairbrush for years so I had to find the same hairbrush.  I am so pleased to see that Amazon carried the hairbrush. I love that this does not cause static hair and my hair is always shiny.</li>
            <li> This brush took me a little while to get used to, as I&#x27;d been using a much smaller one and for some reason pictured it being smaller. However, if you don&#x27;t mind the size, I would highly recommend it. It feels like a massage every time you brush!</li>
            <li> I have looked for solutions for flaky scalp for years, waisting  money on product after product.  But this $15 purchase has improved my scalp condition immensely. I also like an intense brushing of my scalp. This is perfect, I lean over and brush with the pressure that suits me.  I have only had it a few weeks and things have improved more rapidly than expected.  It&#x27;s not an overnight cure so keep brushing.  I still get a few tiny flakes occasionally, but not the big sore patches with large flakes.  I also think my hair looks shinier and it seems I am loosing less hair at washings. A friend of mine told me the copper kills a certain bacteria that overgrows on the scalp. Thus using the copper brush makes a healthier scalp and healthier hair. I did not research that all I know is it works for me. It&#x27;s nice to not feel so self conscious when you go out.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This brush has help immensely with my scalp issues and killed the flaking plus gives a pretty good massage on my scalp</li>
            <li> Love the comfort and style of the brush.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when buying this but now I must admit it&#x27;s one of the best brushes i&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s soothing on the scalp and really gets well with getting stubborn hair under control</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush, along with a dandruff shampoo for about 2 weeks now and maybe I just have really stubborn dandruff, but I have not noticed a reduction in the amount of dandruff I have.</li>
            <li> As with any new brush it is a bit stiff but it does reduce static.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with dandruff so I&#x27;m not sure if that claim works.  It is light weight, comfortable to hold and came quickly. The bristles were very comfortable on my scalp.  I would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is great, especially for long hair.  It can be used on wet hair, and gets the tangles out without pulling out hair.  My daughters and I use nothing else.</li>
            <li> I found this brush difficult to drag through my curls - the bristles are not very strong and several have fallen out or broken off. I can&#x27;t tell if its not helping my dandruff because I&#x27;m not able to pull it through my hair/scalp easily or because it just isn&#x27;t that effective.</li>
            <li> One of the bristles was missing by the time I received the hair brush.  The missing bristle was nowhere to be found, not even in the packaging.  The vendor could have conducted a quality control (QC) before shipping the hair brush.</li>
            <li> feel relax and effective when using this comb.&lt;br /&gt;like a massage and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;planing to buy another one for  my mom,&lt;br /&gt;she will fall in love with it !</li>
            <li> the best hair brush ever</li>
            <li> Gimmick for therapeutic purposes. Great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush I have ever used.  Keeps your scalp from having dry flakes.  Almost like a scalp massage when brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this brush wish I had it years ago.  My hair and scalp really feel so much better after use and its easy to clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush all right....I don&#x27;t not feel like it has worked for it&#x27;s intended purposes.</li>
            <li> THis feels so good going through your hair! I don&#x27;t have bad dandruff, but enough that I thought I would try it, plus my roommate had one and it felt good to brush your hair, so I would borrow hers. Now I have one of my own and I love it!!!</li>
            <li> It really cleans well, but due to that reason there would be gunks stuck on the brush. So make sure you clean the brush periodically!</li>
            <li> As directions indicate, this brush is NOT for detangling - does a rather poor job of that.  So you have to first brush with your normal, and then with this.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any beneficial effect from the copper, however.  It does feel nice on an itchy scalp, but seeing as my regular brush (that DOES detangle) is already a metal bristle brush, I&#x27;m not sure this is serving any purpose for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is different then any brush I have ever bought.  I&#x27;am beginning to really like it.  I will order again Thank You</li>
            <li> Does lift and massage the scalp. Didn&#x27;t last long in our household.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on other reviews, and I love it! It&#x27;s a very sturdy brush and can manage my thick hair.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It does not style as much as you might expect, but it does reduce itchiness a lot Worth of buying. Quality brush</li>
            <li> I have used this in conjunction with a great anti dandruff shampoo. It has made no difference and the brush is very firm and has little give so it feels hard and scratchy when using it. It also seems to tangle my long hair more.</li>
            <li> This is my third of this brush. It is my favorite. The handle is comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t get too tangled in my hair. It is my third because my sister took my last one and my first one that I had eventually just needed replaced.</li>
            <li> High quality, helps reduce static electricity during the winter months. And most importantly it just feels really good when you brush your hair. I just wish it was a bit smaller as the current size takes up considerable amount of luggage space.</li>
            <li> Best brushes out there for thick hair. I only buy these &amp; have for years. LOVE them!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for brush like this forever and of course Amazon has it all. Great quality and does the job great. Also comes in few different sizes.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, not sure why they stopped selling it in stores. Helps reduce flakes and feels great against your scalp.</li>
            <li> Great product - stimulates the scalp.  Hair looks great.  No static flying hair.  So good I got one for our dog too!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just about it.  Worked great for getting rid of dandruff while I detoxed my hair but the copper wore off from the bristles and stopped being effective.  Now I use an all natural organic shampoo from Bubble and Bee and rinse my hair with vinegar for a conditioner which doesn&#x27;t give dandruff a chance.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I ordered two of them.  The copper seems to soothe the skin and make hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I thought it would help with my dandruff. I don&#x27;t recall which sites, but I found several sites that suggested that these brushes could help with dandruff control. Unfortunately, that didn&#x27;t seem to be the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is nice. The bristle do feel good when going against your scalp. The downside is that it&#x27;s made of cooper so I could potentially make your hair smell like a penny.</li>
            <li> This was the first, most expensive brush that I ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;It was all good for a year or two. But the rubber that holds the pins started to weaken and fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve called the Goody customer service about this and the rep said these brushes are only made to last 6-12months?!!&lt;br /&gt;That was the most ridiculous thing I&#x27;ve heard! Even the cheap 99cent store brushes last more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very upset and disappointed that this brush is not lasting longer as it should and Goody&#x27;s poor customer service.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too expensive to last only for 12months!</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp and have tried everything. The reviews were good so I decided to try this brush. It feels good on the scalp and helps a little but have to have another brush for wet hair. And it&#x27;s kinda hard to clean I haven&#x27;t found a good way yet but since it attracts more dead skin it needs to be cleaned more.</li>
            <li> No amount of blue shampoo or tar nonsense or snake oils or magic potions has done JACK to my dandruff.  This actually works for me. I received a couple of days ago and it already appears to be less.  After a couple of weeks I hope it will be gone (that&#x27;s what happened last time I used this brand / model of hairbrush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super skeptical when I bought one in 2008, but it is the one thing that has helped me.  I lost the brush about a year ago and the issue came back.  Glad this brush exists.</li>
            <li> Love the copper bristles! Keeps my hair from frizzing and getting static. Definately going to buy again!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great product.</li>
            <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t know if it reduces dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have always had a dandruff problem and I have tried numerous shampoos and &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34;. I was really hopeful that this would work, and at first I thought it was, but after using it for a month and a half, I don&#x27;t notice a difference. It&#x27;s just like a regular brush to me now.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like to use it if my scalp is itchy because it feels good, like it&#x27;s maybe pulling up some of the flakes.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of this brush... I&#x27;m always looking for good dandruff control (in addition to my regular routine of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and conditioner). I thought this would replace my regular daily brush. However, it&#x27;s not at all practical as a brush, since it shouldn&#x27;t be used on wet hair or for detangling. Also, it needs to be used to brush your roots, so it doesn&#x27;t matter at all for the rest of your hair. You&#x27;re supposed to brush the roots several times a day, however, whenever I did this it agitated the dandruff and I ended up looking like a mess. Lesson learned, so I ended up using this only when I wasn&#x27;t leaving the house (i.e. bedtime). And the final strike against this brush was that even when brushing the roots when I could (once a day before bed), I noticed ZERO improvement. Wasted money for me!</li>
            <li> The bristles feel nice on my scalp, but since I have thick, wavy hair, I make sure that I use a regular brush to get out any knots first. The bristles turned a tarnished-looking green after only 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an issue, just seems a little weird to be brushing my hair with it. I like the way it feels on my scalp, so I&#x27;ll keep using it and I definitely recommend it if you are itching from the winter weather.</li>
            <li> I adore the Goody copper infused bristle brushes.  The one hesitation I have is that these smaller size brushes have the bristles popping out rather fast.  It is an item you have to buy every three months or so anyway because the copper wears off.  I found out that the larger sizes keep their bristles versus this one where they begin to fall out more easily.  I believe the larger size doesn&#x27;t put as much pressure on the bristles so they don&#x27;t fall out as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever my hair begins to itch I give it a good brushing with a goody copper brush and it goes away.  I am amazed at how will it works.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush of all time! So glad i found it!</li>
            <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for. I do not have dandruff but my hair gets tangled easily. This brush holds up well when used in my hair. I&#x27;ve previously had issues with my hair pulling out the plastic bristles in other brushes but this brush not a single bristle has been pulled out. Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this because I have flakes on my shirts.  Read about this, I still have flakes, I have tried everything</li>
            <li> I trusted the good reviews, but this brush pulls out my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells very bad - like dead fish. Otherwise feels good to use it if you can handle the smell. After using it for like 6 months the smell went away. Don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a dandruff problem, but my scalp has itched for years. Is perfect to calm an itchy scalp.  It glides easily thru my long hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second one and this time I bought extras because I had to search for them this time.</li>
            <li> Dunno about the copper or scalp benefits, but the bristles feel good, and are well spaced out for those of us with too thick hair</li>
            <li> arrived early, feels good on the scalp with excessive dandruff.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I do not know how well they control dandruff but we used to buy brushes with full-metal bristles, ones that do not have the plastic caps attached to each bristle that later break off and scrap your scalp. We have not been able to find those particular brushed anymore, but these work just as well. The copper does rust, but this does not impair their function. All of the bristles still have their rounded ends and do not scrap your scalp, which is all that mattered for us.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes for my coarse, frizzy and curly hair. Can use anything else, so I had to order it online.</li>
            <li> Found this brush when I did some research on the health benefits of copper.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I really love the way this brush makes my scalp feel.  It&#x27;s like a massage in the morning when I&#x27;m brushing.  I like that the copper will help keep the brush clean too.</li>
            <li> Works well at helping with a sensitive itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush.  It feels SO good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This started to smell bad after a few weeks of use. It didn&#x27;t seem to affect dandruff. It is extremely difficult to get hair out of it, and some funky stuff builds up on the bristles which can&#x27;t be easily removed because of the knob on the end of each bristle. You can get rid of the smell, though, by soaking it in Peroxide. Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t shampoo, so my hair is more oily can your average persons.</li>
            <li> loved the brush at first but after about a month the brush started to smell because i was brushing my hair when it was wet.i would get the brush if i didn&#x27;t brush my hair when its wet.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair really shiny when blow drying with it. Don&#x27;t notice a lot of differences from my other brush in regards to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I always use metal-bristled brushes because plastic ones make my hair staticy.  This is one of the few metal-bristle brushes left and I love it!</li>
            <li> My husband uses it and it works great.  No more snow on his black shirts. We&#x27;re are both happy. Yup!</li>
            <li> love this hairbrush.... BUY IT!</li>
