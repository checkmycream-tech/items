            <li> this is a good product</li>
            <li> Seem to be using it quickly. Works well but goes too fast for the money.</li>
            <li> I actually just noticed last evening when my skin continued to tingle when I used it that I did not receive the product I ordered.  I received Volu-firm DAY, not night.  What options do I have?  I do not want to pay to return this item.</li>
            <li> Came without a seal.  I like the product but expect to get a product sealed to indicate new and not tampered with</li>
            <li> I recommend this product !!ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> What a nice product for night use, along with the moisturizer!  I appreciate the opportunity to buy it independent of the whole set.  This has retinol, I believe.  It makes a big difference in the long run!</li>
            <li> Works better than other products I tried and I tried many.  Showed visible results in a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay products for many years. I really like the new time wise volu-firm products. Really makes your face feel smooth and soft.</li>
