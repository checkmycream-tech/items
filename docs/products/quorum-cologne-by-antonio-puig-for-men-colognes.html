            <li>I love the smell on him and the great price.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Love you Amazon!</li>
            <li>It is now one of my favorite colognes!</li>
            <li>This is a very good quality economical perfume.</li>
            <li>To my husband and I , nothing else smells as amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the best way to obtain it and the most economical.  </li>
            <li>Was glad that I found it and got a good deal on it.</li>
            <li>No...there&#x27;s no cinnamon or sweetness of any kind.</li>
            <li>nice aroma can be presented to anyone</li>
            <li>My husband asked for this because he thought he liked it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cologne thinking it was an earthy &amp; warm kinda smell.</li>
            <li>, this fragrance is very manly, as a woman I find excellent fragrance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for more good deals like this</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing in a unique way that must be experienced to fully understand.</li>
            <li>an older scent but still smells great to me and its a great price for this size bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>Amazon ALWAYS has the best prices on almost everything, so I came here first, and ended up purchasing from Amazon because, not only did they have the best price on the Quorum</li>
            <li>luxury so nice :)</li>
            <li>It is the perfect scent for mature men who don&#x27;t want their.fragance to arrive ahead of them.</li>
            <li>The perfect fragrance for 70 year old men.</li>
            <li>It beats most trendy colognes at one fifth of their price.</li>
            <li>Light, good for both work and being out on the town.</li>
            <li>and I honestly have to say that three years ago i would have never been able to rock this cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a funky, strong fragrance that screams I AM A MAN!</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>For a cheap cologne, the scent is very sophisticated.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit isn&#x27;t metallic as it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice strong scent, stays with you.</li>
            <li>I have used Quorum for years and have received so many compliments when wearing it.  </li>
            <li>It smells more like alcohol than anything.  </li>
            <li>as well I will not be making any more cologne or perfume purchases online</li>
            <li>We both love it and do not want to change</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it for many, many years</li>
            <li>Many ask &amp;#34;Whats</li>
            <li>So I got the hub for FREE!</li>
            <li>(with FREE SHIPPING also!)  </li>
            <li>Bought this and it has been my favorite ever since.</li>
            <li>AND WOMEN LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>been useing quorum for over 25 years i do love it</li>
            <li>I get more compliments from females from this cologne than anything i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I used to wear this cologne at work about twenty years ago and received many &amp;#34;you smell great&amp;#34; comments.  </li>
            <li>This is the cologne I absolutely love for my husband, and to our dismay they no longer carried it in our area.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more a woodsy patchouli vetiver type scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Quorum for many years and can verify the product as sold and shipped by Amazon is authentic and not a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and could not count how many women have complimented me on the cologne over the years.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this fragranace.</li>
            <li>This is my version of &amp;#34;stink good.&amp;#34;  I love it - my girlfriend prefers Curve.</li>
            <li>Sure to please the most discerning.</li>
            <li>If you find this one too manly for your tastes, they also have one called Quorum Silver that is lighter and has even more cedar notes.</li>
            <li>It is great too as an all-around daily-wear cologne (in fact I think it is better for more formal events too).    </li>
            <li>I got for my father and he love it.</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that it smells slightly different on every man.</li>
            <li>You can smell it on o\someones else and think its something else until they tell you for sure that it is indeed Quorum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this item for many years and my kids know</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with everything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Quorum has been my favorite cologne for 30 years.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells on my husband.</li>
            <li>It does not get more manly than this.</li>
            <li>My husbands favorite cologne</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>Great Price - Fast delivery</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get more ladies.</li>
            <li>And your girl, too ! :)</li>
            <li>pleased with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;The aroma of this fragrance I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to carry it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>sure when ordering ,is Quorum by Puig.</li>
            <li>My husband has been wearing Quorum for many years.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a bang for the buck, and I think I got much more.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased I can continue using this product.</li>
            <li>They all recall it from years ago and note they love the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s My favorite Quorum By Puig For Men.</li>
            <li>Used this fragrance many years ago and never forgot it.</li>
            <li>2nd time I purchased this, excellent</li>
            <li>My husband and I love Quorum.</li>
            <li>This is more of your personality.  </li>
            <li>This is my husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Expect staying power; I don&#x27;t like overwhelming people around me</li>
            <li>My dad gave me this Cologne as a gift many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Now, however, it is my favorite (I&#x27;m also fond of Hugo Boss and 4711).</li>
            <li>I have been using if for more than 20 years and what I received was mostly alcohol and had the incorrect spray nozzle.  </li>
            <li>and i will buy more once i run out.</li>
            <li>Great product, a classic fragrance from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of musky yet clean.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and this a sweet deal!</li>
            <li>To me, I find Quorum to have a strong powder scent that seemed to be better suited for the winter months.  </li>
            <li>The current formulation is still very good.</li>
            <li>It was wrapped as if it came directly from a store and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>It is not overpowering - unless you don&#x27;t know the meaning subdued and douse yourself as you would in a shower with it - and best of all - it is not sickly sweet as too many of today&#x27;s mens&#x27; eau de toilettes are.</li>
            <li>Easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li>I have been using Quorum for men for years and love the clean smell of it</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of: a strong, musky, pine, mix.  </li>
            <li>Excellent ( This is the Real Thing )....  Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I like strong fragrances or aroma</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too strong.</li>
            <li>Packaging was fine, I opened it and sprayed two sprays yesterday and wanted to give it some time before rating.  </li>
            <li>&amp; NO they don&#x27;t need to be either gay or metrosexual to do that.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers commented on the scent of their bottles not seeming accurate.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the cologne is not made cheaply and it will stay on clothing for a day.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for years and still enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This is one that brings back great memories and still wears well today.    </li>
            <li>Great cologne, it last all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed girls enjoy the cedar / vanilla smell of Quorum Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 to get Free Delivery.  </li>
            <li>Amazing wihen you can find something of real value online and Quorum is one of those values.</li>
            <li>really enjoy the smell of Quorum</li>
            <li>Totally Shipping was fast and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved the old and original smell but not this.</li>
            <li>Rarely heard of scent that really lingers and is very pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to be able to get it at such a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>seems this is a whole new industry out there of tinkering with what was a great scent,</li>
            <li>Happy to find this fragance that I thought ws long iscontinued</li>
            <li>exelente 100% original</li>
            <li>Quorum is a rich, musky smelling cologne that reminds me of cedar, bergamont, and musk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you like a serious/mature smell like Skin Bracer Original or Polo Original by Ralph Lauren...</li>
            <li>I never bought another bottle of Polo Original.</li>
            <li>that is not the original quorum smell.  </li>
            <li>You have to be familiar with the cologne to appreciate it.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is simply the best by far.</li>
            <li>Whenever I am shopping for something, Amazon has always &#x27;done me right&#x27;, so I will continue to use Amazon as my &#x27;retailer of choice&#x27;!  </li>
            <li>, if I purchased another item, a USB Hub that I needed also, (the price on the hub was excellent also)...  by purchasing all three items at the same time, at Amazon, I qualified for FREE SHIPPING on the total purchase.  </li>
            <li>And the name holds it&#x27;s true value, because without this fragrance being a member in the world of colognes/fragrances there  is no committee.    </li>
            <li>It is warm, masculine and evokes strength and confidence and that is how you will smell.    </li>
            <li>Just a good solid manly fragrance!</li>
            <li>I used to love this fragrance on my husband now not so much.</li>
            <li>This has a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>, I am satisfied with this purchase, I recommend it for the one who seeks a classic scent.</li>
            <li>ONE OF MY FAVORITE FROM BACK IN THE 80&#x27;S STILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Mine mellows out to what most people describe as a cig tobacco, pine, powerful mesh of smells that have a very evocative power.</li>
            <li>The item came quick and was  well packaged...</li>
            <li>I have had this same product before and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>, I also enjoy the fact I&#x27;m supporting Puig.</li>
            <li>only reservation in posting this - I don&#x27;t want too many guys wearing it!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a beard, smoke cigars, and can talk to beautiful women about a wide range of topics (like that handsome chap from those Mexican beer commercials), go for it.</li>
            <li>It will also impress the charming woman in the black cocktail dress whom you&#x27;ve just helped out of your convertible as she takes a whiff of what a confident man wears to a power meeting or an intimate night on the town.  </li>
            <li>If you want a great cologne that is a throwback to when men&#x27;s colognes smelled like they were made for a man and not a 21 year old female, this is for you!</li>
            <li>The scent was spot on and all the ladies love my 18 year old son&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>I constantly get compliments from the ladies about smelling nice and questions from men on where I got it.</li>
            <li>This is an old fashion  men&#x27;s Eau de Toilette, but it&#x27;s better than ever.  </li>
            <li>Moss is present but it kind of hides between the pine and suede.</li>
            <li>It is good, the only thing is that the top of the spray I prefer the yellow one.</li>
            <li>the more you put it on, giving a natural aroma vibe to it.</li>
            <li>Rarely will I use it in the summer.</li>
            <li>Well Worth it as I Truly Believe in value at [...]</li>
            <li>He was pleasantly surprised that I was able to order it for him for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Very positive experience.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a man&#x27;s cologne, and recommended for strong alpha&#x27;s or others wanting to radiate a manliness or strong confidence.  </li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s the right one for me now that i have passed 50.</li>
            <li>To start off this review right I think one should try this cologne before buying.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on this and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size.</li>
            <li>It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>The good news is that the price has gone down but the quality remains.</li>
            <li>Strong masculine cologne.  </li>
            <li>I intend to give my son a bottle of Quorum when he gets older as my father did; it&#x27;s that special to me and what it conveys to others.</li>
            <li>I have used this scent for years and like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have liked this since Jr. High School and still like it the corporate world.</li>
            <li>I bought this based off of the stellar reviews and the price point.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is OK, but it is definitely an acquired taste.</li>
            <li>I have worn this for several years and you can&#x27;t find it in most stores, but I found it here.</li>
            <li>It is simply a matter of overwhelming  attraction.</li>
            <li>So I found this distributor and this was my first time on Amazon</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and I can smell it first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>, I tried to wash it off the first time.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband several years ago and it has been his favorite ever since.  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>and this was one of my first colognes.</li>
            <li>I have used Quorum for many years and it has become more and more difficult to find this item now.  </li>
            <li>;) the product came today and my husband and I were super excited to open the boxes and to our amazement they were packaged amazinely.</li>
            <li>A girlfriend first gave me this cologne as a birthday present in the mid 80&#x27;s because she loved it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t (at least in my opinion), its more like a fresh-out-the-shower, shaving cream scent and most of my friends agree.</li>
            <li>I always get positive comments about it.</li>
            <li>It has been my colongne pretty much since.</li>
            <li>Quorum has been around for a long time and has been one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wore this since right after high scool</li>
            <li>Despite the slight reformulation I still get an amazing 8-10 hours from Quorum on just 2 sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If there is anything to be aware of with this  cologne is that, if you are married or in a serious relationship, you cannot, i repeat cannot, let you husband/boyfriend go out with this  cologne sprayed on him because when the woman catches a whiff of this scent she will be compelled to approach him  with good intentions that may lead to something of a possessed encounter.</li>
            <li>Almost pure water Pump didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would not buy this online again.</li>
            <li>Quorom by Puig really know scents and have been making this product for Spaniards and now thanks to the internet, worldwide.</li>
            <li>Gentlemen get ready for a wake up call and get ready to fight them away with this scent.</li>
            <li>To those submerged in the feminized and fresh aquatic scents of today this scent is sharp,astrigent,loud, and old man.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s what I get for going cheap instead of going to an actual cologne retailer.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>This is a cologne for a man who wants to smell like a man.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very rendidor</li>
            <li>I can honestly say the formula used in this bottle I purchased is NOT the same as the product I have purchased from local stores.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a little to sweet smelling and was way too strong.</li>
            <li>The first hour or two after application is nearly unbearable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more manly than the typical aquatics.</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived on time, this fragrance is a classic</li>
            <li>This is a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Recommend this perfume for people 35 and older.</li>
            <li>For years I have had the hardest time finding this particular cologne.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend to older people</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for causual wear.</li>
            <li>so I am going to send it to my father who I think can appreciate it a little better.</li>
            <li>I thought it would smell a little better than a 70s disco scene.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s smells real masculine .</li>
            <li>Though it has the same undertones, it is essentially  as distinct as you  DNA when worn.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long, which means it&#x27;s more alcohol than scent.</li>
            <li>where I know they have new stock</li>
            <li>My new girlfriend loves it also.</li>
            <li>To me Quorum is the epic masterpiece of what a green scent should be and highly sophisticated.</li>
            <li>I still like it very much and will use it it is just not the same as before</li>
            <li>As a frugal shopper,  I always shop the &#x27;net first of all.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cologne for your husband or significant other, I would recommend that you try this one.</li>
            <li>On that topic after I bought my first bottle of Quorum back in 1991-1994(one of those years)</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cologne for your husband or significant other, I would recommend that you try this one.</li>
            <li>I actually stepped out on a limb and purchased this based on a friendly recommendation without actually smelling it.  </li>
            <li>This goes well with a well tailored single breasted charcoal suit, a pressed white shirt, dark silk tie, vodka martini, and a medium rare Filet Mignon at your favorite steak house.  </li>
            <li>It is a &#x27;mature man&#x27; smell, exudes confidence and a certain friendly warmth.&lt;br /&gt;Technically speaking, you get an initial blast of really sharp pine resin and what some people have described as a catty aroma...</li>
            <li>I would agree with other reviewers that you dont need much - usually one spray and you&#x27;re good for the day.</li>
            <li>Puig Quorum is very reasonable price and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find it, and excited that it cost less</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the cheapest in price that I&#x27;ve came across.</li>
            <li>I remember paying  $50 plus for this Cologne in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Old Guy who never wears a scent.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a musk-based masculine scent that made the statement I wanted to make:  \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Cologne has a masculine scent of tobacco and spice, almost like Kuros</li>
            <li>This is a non-sweet,clean and green,very mature men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>May be old stock.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>This is what masculine smell is, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li>After trying several perfumes such as Nautica and Davidoff, finally I found a good smell that I can wear everyday.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that Amazon carried this spray, I live in a small Texas town and always had to get the store to special order for me.</li>
            <li>the smell of this men&#x27;s cologne it takes me back to my High School days.</li>
            <li>Initially after spraying there was an immediate strong alcohol scent that dissipated in a few moments.  </li>
            <li>The general compliments include it being masculine and not flowery or those along the lines of &amp;#34;it&#x27;s hot&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Sexy&amp;#34; &amp;#34;a turn-on&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looked totally brand new.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the same smell as a real bottle of Quorum, put my soon to be out bottle next to this one and this bottle has a reddish tint to the gold lettering.</li>
            <li>This time, after all the figuring was said and done, with FREE SHIPPING, the total price ended up less than the Quorum + shipping!  </li>
            <li>The smell is very good,i have been using for years,compares to many very expensive mens fragrances,but much cheaper.for the price.</li>
            <li>Does not fade after a few hours like many other brands.  </li>
            <li>It never sticks sweet or buttery and after the dry down is complete astringency</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lightly woody fragrance, and a little goes quite a long way -- and yes, there&#x27;s a cedar component,</li>
            <li>The smell it did have barely lasted for any time</li>
            <li>My order actually arrived a day early.</li>
            <li>Apparently this is a way cheaper version than what I rec&#x27;d as a gift a decade ago.</li>
            <li>Affordable, with a distinctive masculine aroma, and moderate persistence.  </li>
            <li>My order actually arrived a day early.  </li>
            <li>You feel old at the same time manly.</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled kind of stale.</li>
            <li>Long lasting decent smell.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend for office wear as the tobacco smell is little on the higher side.</li>
            <li>I can generally still smell it on me after a shower the next day.</li>
            <li>Apparently this scent convinces people that I&#x27;m the solid, reliable sort who&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
            <li>A unique aroma for the man who is self-confident and not interested in making a brash announcement.</li>
            <li>Brings back memories, nice scent and lasts all day, the pump is a little weak</li>
    </ol>

            <li> an older scent but still smells great to me and its a great price for this size bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> Amazon ALWAYS has the best prices on almost everything, so I came here first, and ended up purchasing from Amazon because, not only did they have the best price on the Quorum</li>
            <li> luxury so nice :)</li>
            <li> It is the perfect scent for mature men who don&#x27;t want their.fragance to arrive ahead of them.</li>
            <li> The perfect fragrance for 70 year old men.</li>
            <li> It beats most trendy colognes at one fifth of their price.</li>
            <li> Light, good for both work and being out on the town.</li>
            <li> and I honestly have to say that three years ago i would have never been able to rock this cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a funky, strong fragrance that screams I AM A MAN!</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> For a cheap cologne, the scent is very sophisticated.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit isn&#x27;t metallic as it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice strong scent, stays with you.</li>
            <li> I have used Quorum for years and have received so many compliments when wearing it.  </li>
            <li> It smells more like alcohol than anything.  </li>
            <li> as well I will not be making any more cologne or perfume purchases online</li>
            <li> We both love it and do not want to change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it for many, many years</li>
            <li> Many ask &amp;#34;Whats</li>

            <li> I used to wear this cologne at work about twenty years ago and received many &amp;#34;you smell great&amp;#34; comments.  </li>
            <li> This is the cologne I absolutely love for my husband, and to our dismay they no longer carried it in our area.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more a woodsy patchouli vetiver type scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Quorum for many years and can verify the product as sold and shipped by Amazon is authentic and not a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Sure to please the most discerning.</li>
            <li> If you find this one too manly for your tastes, they also have one called Quorum Silver that is lighter and has even more cedar notes.</li>
            <li> It is great too as an all-around daily-wear cologne (in fact I think it is better for more formal events too).    </li>
            <li> I got for my father and he love it.</li>
            <li> The best thing about it is that it smells slightly different on every man.</li>
            <li> You can smell it on o\someones else and think its something else until they tell you for sure that it is indeed Quorum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for many years and my kids know</li>

            <li> Now, however, it is my favorite (I&#x27;m also fond of Hugo Boss and 4711).</li>
            <li> I have been using if for more than 20 years and what I received was mostly alcohol and had the incorrect spray nozzle.  </li>
            <li> and i will buy more once i run out.</li>
            <li> Great product, a classic fragrance from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of musky yet clean.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and this a sweet deal!</li>
            <li> To me, I find Quorum to have a strong powder scent that seemed to be better suited for the winter months.  </li>
            <li> The current formulation is still very good.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped as if it came directly from a store and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> It is not overpowering - unless you don&#x27;t know the meaning subdued and douse yourself as you would in a shower with it - and best of all - it is not sickly sweet as too many of today&#x27;s mens&#x27; eau de toilettes are.</li>
            <li> Easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li> I have been using Quorum for men for years and love the clean smell of it</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of: a strong, musky, pine, mix.  </li>
            <li> Excellent ( This is the Real Thing )....  Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I like strong fragrances or aroma</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too strong.</li>
            <li> Packaging was fine, I opened it and sprayed two sprays yesterday and wanted to give it some time before rating.  </li>
            <li> &amp; NO they don&#x27;t need to be either gay or metrosexual to do that.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers commented on the scent of their bottles not seeming accurate.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the cologne is not made cheaply and it will stay on clothing for a day.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for years and still enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This is one that brings back great memories and still wears well today.    </li>
            <li> Great cologne, it last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed girls enjoy the cedar / vanilla smell of Quorum Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 to get Free Delivery.  </li>
            <li> Amazing wihen you can find something of real value online and Quorum is one of those values.</li>
            <li> really enjoy the smell of Quorum</li>
            <li> Totally Shipping was fast and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved the old and original smell but not this.</li>
            <li> Rarely heard of scent that really lingers and is very pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li> and I am happy to be able to get it at such a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li> seems this is a whole new industry out there of tinkering with what was a great scent,</li>
            <li> Happy to find this fragance that I thought ws long iscontinued</li>
            <li> exelente 100% original</li>
            <li> Quorum is a rich, musky smelling cologne that reminds me of cedar, bergamont, and musk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you like a serious/mature smell like Skin Bracer Original or Polo Original by Ralph Lauren...</li>
            <li> I never bought another bottle of Polo Original.</li>
            <li> that is not the original quorum smell.  </li>
            <li> You have to be familiar with the cologne to appreciate it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is simply the best by far.</li>
            <li> Whenever I am shopping for something, Amazon has always &#x27;done me right&#x27;, so I will continue to use Amazon as my &#x27;retailer of choice&#x27;!  </li>
            <li> , if I purchased another item, a USB Hub that I needed also, (the price on the hub was excellent also)...  by purchasing all three items at the same time, at Amazon, I qualified for FREE SHIPPING on the total purchase.  </li>
            <li> And the name holds it&#x27;s true value, because without this fragrance being a member in the world of colognes/fragrances there  is no committee.    </li>
            <li> It is warm, masculine and evokes strength and confidence and that is how you will smell.    </li>
            <li> Just a good solid manly fragrance!</li>
            <li> I used to love this fragrance on my husband now not so much.</li>
            <li> This has a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> , I am satisfied with this purchase, I recommend it for the one who seeks a classic scent.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY FAVORITE FROM BACK IN THE 80&#x27;S STILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Mine mellows out to what most people describe as a cig tobacco, pine, powerful mesh of smells that have a very evocative power.</li>
            <li> The item came quick and was  well packaged...</li>
            <li> I have had this same product before and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> , I also enjoy the fact I&#x27;m supporting Puig.</li>
            <li> only reservation in posting this - I don&#x27;t want too many guys wearing it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a beard, smoke cigars, and can talk to beautiful women about a wide range of topics (like that handsome chap from those Mexican beer commercials), go for it.</li>
            <li> It will also impress the charming woman in the black cocktail dress whom you&#x27;ve just helped out of your convertible as she takes a whiff of what a confident man wears to a power meeting or an intimate night on the town.  </li>
            <li> If you want a great cologne that is a throwback to when men&#x27;s colognes smelled like they were made for a man and not a 21 year old female, this is for you!</li>
            <li> The scent was spot on and all the ladies love my 18 year old son&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I constantly get compliments from the ladies about smelling nice and questions from men on where I got it.</li>
            <li> This is an old fashion  men&#x27;s Eau de Toilette, but it&#x27;s better than ever.  </li>
            <li> Moss is present but it kind of hides between the pine and suede.</li>
            <li> It is good, the only thing is that the top of the spray I prefer the yellow one.</li>
            <li> the more you put it on, giving a natural aroma vibe to it.</li>
            <li> Rarely will I use it in the summer.</li>
            <li> Well Worth it as I Truly Believe in value at [...]</li>
            <li> He was pleasantly surprised that I was able to order it for him for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Very positive experience.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a man&#x27;s cologne, and recommended for strong alpha&#x27;s or others wanting to radiate a manliness or strong confidence.  </li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s the right one for me now that i have passed 50.</li>
            <li> To start off this review right I think one should try this cologne before buying.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size.</li>
            <li> It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li> The good news is that the price has gone down but the quality remains.</li>
            <li> Strong masculine cologne.  </li>
            <li> I intend to give my son a bottle of Quorum when he gets older as my father did; it&#x27;s that special to me and what it conveys to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this scent for years and like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have liked this since Jr. High School and still like it the corporate world.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off of the stellar reviews and the price point.  </li>
            <li> This perfume is OK, but it is definitely an acquired taste.</li>
            <li> I have worn this for several years and you can&#x27;t find it in most stores, but I found it here.</li>
            <li> It is simply a matter of overwhelming  attraction.</li>
            <li> So I found this distributor and this was my first time on Amazon</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> and I can smell it first.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> , I tried to wash it off the first time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband several years ago and it has been his favorite ever since.  </li>
            <li> Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> and this was one of my first colognes.</li>
            <li> I have used Quorum for many years and it has become more and more difficult to find this item now.  </li>
            <li> ;) the product came today and my husband and I were super excited to open the boxes and to our amazement they were packaged amazinely.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend first gave me this cologne as a birthday present in the mid 80&#x27;s because she loved it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t (at least in my opinion), its more like a fresh-out-the-shower, shaving cream scent and most of my friends agree.</li>
            <li> I always get positive comments about it.</li>
            <li> It has been my colongne pretty much since.</li>
            <li> Quorum has been around for a long time and has been one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wore this since right after high scool</li>
            <li> Despite the slight reformulation I still get an amazing 8-10 hours from Quorum on just 2 sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there is anything to be aware of with this  cologne is that, if you are married or in a serious relationship, you cannot, i repeat cannot, let you husband/boyfriend go out with this  cologne sprayed on him because when the woman catches a whiff of this scent she will be compelled to approach him  with good intentions that may lead to something of a possessed encounter.</li>
            <li> Almost pure water Pump didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I absolutely would not buy this online again.</li>
            <li> Quorom by Puig really know scents and have been making this product for Spaniards and now thanks to the internet, worldwide.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen get ready for a wake up call and get ready to fight them away with this scent.</li>
            <li> To those submerged in the feminized and fresh aquatic scents of today this scent is sharp,astrigent,loud, and old man.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s what I get for going cheap instead of going to an actual cologne retailer.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a cologne for a man who wants to smell like a man.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very rendidor</li>
            <li> I can honestly say the formula used in this bottle I purchased is NOT the same as the product I have purchased from local stores.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little to sweet smelling and was way too strong.</li>
            <li> The first hour or two after application is nearly unbearable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more manly than the typical aquatics.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived on time, this fragrance is a classic</li>
            <li> This is a classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Recommend this perfume for people 35 and older.</li>
            <li> For years I have had the hardest time finding this particular cologne.</li>
            <li> but I would recommend to older people</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for causual wear.</li>
            <li> so I am going to send it to my father who I think can appreciate it a little better.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell a little better than a 70s disco scene.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s smells real masculine .</li>
            <li> Though it has the same undertones, it is essentially  as distinct as you  DNA when worn.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long, which means it&#x27;s more alcohol than scent.</li>
            <li> where I know they have new stock</li>
            <li> My new girlfriend loves it also.</li>
            <li> To me Quorum is the epic masterpiece of what a green scent should be and highly sophisticated.</li>
            <li> I still like it very much and will use it it is just not the same as before</li>
            <li> As a frugal shopper,  I always shop the &#x27;net first of all.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cologne for your husband or significant other, I would recommend that you try this one.</li>
            <li> On that topic after I bought my first bottle of Quorum back in 1991-1994(one of those years)</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cologne for your husband or significant other, I would recommend that you try this one.</li>
            <li> I actually stepped out on a limb and purchased this based on a friendly recommendation without actually smelling it.  </li>
            <li> This goes well with a well tailored single breasted charcoal suit, a pressed white shirt, dark silk tie, vodka martini, and a medium rare Filet Mignon at your favorite steak house.  </li>
            <li> It is a &#x27;mature man&#x27; smell, exudes confidence and a certain friendly warmth.&lt;br /&gt;Technically speaking, you get an initial blast of really sharp pine resin and what some people have described as a catty aroma...</li>
            <li> I would agree with other reviewers that you dont need much - usually one spray and you&#x27;re good for the day.</li>
            <li> Puig Quorum is very reasonable price and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find it, and excited that it cost less</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the cheapest in price that I&#x27;ve came across.</li>
            <li> I remember paying  $50 plus for this Cologne in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Old Guy who never wears a scent.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a musk-based masculine scent that made the statement I wanted to make:  \\&quot;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Cologne has a masculine scent of tobacco and spice, almost like Kuros</li>
            <li> This is a non-sweet,clean and green,very mature men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> May be old stock.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> This is what masculine smell is, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> After trying several perfumes such as Nautica and Davidoff, finally I found a good smell that I can wear everyday.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that Amazon carried this spray, I live in a small Texas town and always had to get the store to special order for me.</li>
            <li> the smell of this men&#x27;s cologne it takes me back to my High School days.</li>
            <li> Initially after spraying there was an immediate strong alcohol scent that dissipated in a few moments.  </li>
            <li> The general compliments include it being masculine and not flowery or those along the lines of &amp;#34;it&#x27;s hot&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Sexy&amp;#34; &amp;#34;a turn-on&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looked totally brand new.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same smell as a real bottle of Quorum, put my soon to be out bottle next to this one and this bottle has a reddish tint to the gold lettering.</li>
            <li> This time, after all the figuring was said and done, with FREE SHIPPING, the total price ended up less than the Quorum + shipping!  </li>
            <li> The smell is very good,i have been using for years,compares to many very expensive mens fragrances,but much cheaper.for the price.</li>
            <li> Does not fade after a few hours like many other brands.  </li>
            <li> It never sticks sweet or buttery and after the dry down is complete astringency</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightly woody fragrance, and a little goes quite a long way -- and yes, there&#x27;s a cedar component,</li>
            <li> The smell it did have barely lasted for any time</li>
            <li> My order actually arrived a day early.</li>
            <li> Apparently this is a way cheaper version than what I rec&#x27;d as a gift a decade ago.</li>
            <li> Affordable, with a distinctive masculine aroma, and moderate persistence.  </li>
            <li> My order actually arrived a day early.  </li>
            <li> You feel old at the same time manly.</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled kind of stale.</li>
            <li> Long lasting decent smell.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend for office wear as the tobacco smell is little on the higher side.</li>
            <li> I can generally still smell it on me after a shower the next day.</li>
            <li> Apparently this scent convinces people that I&#x27;m the solid, reliable sort who&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
            <li> A unique aroma for the man who is self-confident and not interested in making a brash announcement.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories, nice scent and lasts all day, the pump is a little weak</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, some stuff I have, the whole bottle lasts till lunch, maybe.  </li>
            <li> The only scent I like to wear, seems to be the same as she gave me last long time</li>
            <li> This is not the bottle.the real container is long and green in color.make</li>
            <li> IT LAST LONG</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been around for a long time, and is still a sensual scent that I must have; it&#x27;s one of my essential scents.  </li>
            <li> If your skin works with it, it last for a long time and everyone will ask you what are you wearing?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Been wearing several other types the last 6 month&#x27;s trying to find a substitute</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it kind of varies in tone</li>
            <li> I had ordered this a few times directly from Amazon before then, and they smelled just like they should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was younger then and never really appreciated.  </li>
            <li> Compared to all of the other colognes  such as PL, CK, NAUT...</li>
            <li> But I do recall the older formulation having a little less soap,and the tobacco note outweighing the suede</li>
            <li> Someone had obviously refilled it with some other concoction for resale.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if company is still making this product, but to me it doesn&#x27;t come close to the Quorum that was made in the 80s,90s and early 2000s.</li>
            <li> And the tobacco note smells like latakia, the black pungent stuff they put in Dunhill pipe tobaccos; how else could something made in Spain smell so tweedy and British?</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> It has become harder to find over the years.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have noticed a slight change in the quality of the cologne, how long it lasts on the skin, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past twenty years and cannot say enough about it.  </li>
            <li> i guess till the bitter end!</li>
            <li> But you&#x27;ll catch it being brought out for some clarity through sharp notes like the pine and soap.</li>
            <li> Usually just one spray is enough.</li>
            <li> To me this last order (the bottle I have opened) is not very good.</li>
            <li> It has gotten hard to find at the drug stores and various other places</li>
            <li> Hints of cigars, booze, rat glands, and expensive large pistol primer</li>
            <li> perfume is much dark, recommended for night use,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> Love it or hate it, it is a well balanced powerhouse from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It seems they are watered down quite often.</li>
            <li> Only issue,sometimes it&#x27;s a little hard to find</li>
            <li> Not to mention I paid less than half of the supposedly sale price they had at the store</li>
            <li> Now I get to buy it for half the price</li>
            <li> Less than three days to my door.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Additionally, I personally think this cologne for men is a great smell, rather an expensive smell with OUT the overly expensive and pricey prices that a lot of designer colognes have on theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> The product was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap and the packaging was intact.</li>
            <li> The product was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap and the packaging was intact.  </li>
            <li> so it came off as a little darker/earthy.</li>
            <li> I use to wear this when I was younger---but now I wear it for little outings---still like it.</li>
            <li> A dark, peaty-soapy, bitter-sweet orgy of wood, leather and tobacco, with raw power and aristocratic grace.</li>
            <li> Lately it has been harder to find.</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been around a long time, I think the bottle i received was old stock, smelled really bad like the alcohol has turned.</li>
            <li> but they are not easy to come by.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologn for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> ( i&#x27;m not sure if I mention them, so I won&#x27;t )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past, so when I saw this product at the sale price I knew that I was getting for my money</li>
            <li> I usually buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> They both smelled like old, dirty water.</li>
            <li> , I usually do 1-2 sprays, the stuff clings on your clothes well into the night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how prevalent it is, but what I received was NOT Quorum.  </li>
            <li> Old, Tired, Bad Tempered and Heavily Armed\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the last two bottles I ordered directly from Amazon smelled like horrible knockoffs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It remined me of the late 80s...</li>
            <li> The scent seems slightly different from what it used to be, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at describing scents</li>
            <li> but it is now very hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I should have requested a refund, but I was just past the return period each time I discovered it was bad, so I just threw them both in the trash.</li>
            <li> You will never be wrong buying it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> is shocking as he passed other fibula.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very disappointed and a waste of money....</li>
            <li> One of my complaints of newer colognes for men is that they tend to be either unisex, feminine smelling, or cold and metallic smelling.</li>
            <li> Men should wear perfume before going into the gym so they don&#x27;t smell like dirty socks.</li>
            <li> ~ Besides.. I have found things on Amazon that I was unable to find anywhere else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that, if you can wait it out, the remaining fragrance isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, its not that bad</li>
            <li> The two bad ones were ordered on April 2, 2014 and January 18, 2014.</li>
            <li> This is not quorum, it is a bad immitation.</li>
            <li> .You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> the worst bottle I ever had very difficult to spray</li>
            <li> It is so overwhelmingly awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought two, vaporizer spray didn&#x27;t work on one.</li>
            <li> In 2 words:  SEX. PANTHER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Womens panties literally fall off..enough said</li>
            <li> I have used Quorum for years and have received so many compliments when wearing it.  The store I was buying it from quit carrying it so I tried Amazon.  The bottle I purchased had none of the fragrance it should have.  It smells more like alcohol than anything.  As if if had been on the shelf for along time and lost it&#x27;s fragrance.  I absolutely would not buy this online again.</li>
            <li> Replaced a gift a woman gave years ago... The only scent I like to wear, seems to be the same as she gave me last long time</li>
            <li> This product smelled nothing like a purchase of the same product from a department store. The smell it did have barely lasted for any time as well I will not be making any more cologne or perfume purchases online</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this for years.  We both love it and do not want to change but it is now very hard to find in stores.  This price was great and we are so happy to find it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> To me, this is the best cologne, ever.  I&#x27;ve worn it for many, many years and it always leaves a lasting impression.  I always get positive comments about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off of the stellar reviews and the price point.  Prior to purchasing, I never had the privilege of smelling Quorum.  Packaging was fine, I opened it and sprayed two sprays yesterday and wanted to give it some time before rating.  Initially after spraying there was an immediate strong alcohol scent that dissipated in a few moments.  The scent reminds me of: a strong, musky, pine, mix.  This is definitely a man&#x27;s cologne, and recommended for strong alpha&#x27;s or others wanting to radiate a manliness or strong confidence.  In addition, the cologne is not made cheaply and it will stay on clothing for a day.  Today the scent is weaker, but still exists on the cloths I sprayed (which in my opinion, is a very good thing).  In my opinion, this seems to be a mix of Drakkar and Polo combined.  If you like neither and prefer softer, or sportier scents, this might not be for you.  BUT, if you prefer to have a cologne that represents manliness, that you are here in this world and you want to keep your man card, buy this cologne.  Recommended not for boys, but for MEN.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years,  Many ask &amp;#34;Whats that on you?</li>
            <li> an older scent but still smells great to me and its a great price for this size bottle</li>
            <li> I have always used Quorum myself because I like it&#x27;s smell (So do the ladies!! -{8-D)  I always give a bottle to my son for Christmas or his Birthday also because he likes it also.  So it was his Birthday this time and I bought two bottles, one for each of us.  As a frugal shopper,  I always shop the &#x27;net first of all.  Amazon ALWAYS has the best prices on almost everything, so I came here first, and ended up purchasing from Amazon because, not only did they have the best price on the Quorum, if I purchased another item, a USB Hub that I needed also, (the price on the hub was excellent also)...  by purchasing all three items at the same time, at Amazon, I qualified for FREE SHIPPING on the total purchase.  That clinched the deal for me!  As any intelligent shopper knows, the added cost of shipping can make...  OR BREAK a deal!  This time, after all the figuring was said and done, with FREE SHIPPING, the total price ended up less than the Quorum + shipping!  So I got the hub for FREE! (with FREE SHIPPING also!)  Whenever I am shopping for something, Amazon has always &#x27;done me right&#x27;, so I will continue to use Amazon as my &#x27;retailer of choice&#x27;!  ~ Besides.. I have found things on Amazon that I was unable to find anywhere else! (Gillette &#x27;injector&#x27; Razor blades)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merlin</li>
            <li> good product, recommended !!</li>
            <li> This is a good knock around cologne to wear if you&#x27;re not doing anything. It&#x27;s a nice strong scent, stays with you.</li>
            <li> Happy to find this fragance that I thought ws long iscontinued</li>
            <li> Bought this and it has been my favorite ever since. In fact, Quorum, is the only cologne he will wear. The product was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap and the packaging was intact. My order actually arrived a day early. If you are looking for a cologne for your husband or significant other, I would recommend that you try this one. This is the best!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is OK, but it is definitely an acquired taste. Has a \\&quot;macho\\&quot; smell. Very suitable for formal wear (think tuxedo or business suit).</li>
            <li> For a cheap cologne, the scent is very sophisticated. I will keep using it and have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> I dont know it I bought it because of the price but I didnt like the smell</li>
            <li> I have worn this for several years and you can&#x27;t find it in most stores, but I found it here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past twenty years and cannot say enough about it.  Amazon is the best way to obtain it and the most economical.  Quorom by Puig really know scents and have been making this product for Spaniards and now thanks to the internet, worldwide.</li>
            <li> At 44, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m \\&quot;old\\&quot; yet, and besides, I&#x27;ve been wearing this since I was 17 when a girlfriend picked it out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say there have been a LEGION of girlfriends (and ex wives)since. This stuff will get it DONE. (I actually had a bottle of Quorum stolen by the maid from my hotel room in Havana, Cuba one time, LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it sparingly, ONE SPRAY is all you need, believe me.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived on time, this fragrance is a classic and I&#x27;ve used it before, and smells just as I remember it, I am satisfied with this purchase, I recommend it for the one who seeks a classic scent.</li>
            <li> QUORUM FOR MEN IS A GREAT SMELL. IT LAST LONG AND WOMEN LOVE IT. THAT&#x27;S WHY I KEEP ORDERING WHEN I AM ABOUT TO RUN  OUT</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have like it and I don&#x27;t recommend to anyone. You wear this for a date with a non-smoker female you will regret it.</li>
            <li> exelente 100% original</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightly woody fragrance, and a little goes quite a long way -- and yes, there&#x27;s a cedar component, but it&#x27;s well managed.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price.  I am very happy with the product, it arrived on time as promised, easy no hassle deal.</li>
            <li> been useing quorum for over 25 years i do love it lots of my friends tell me they like it</li>
            <li> This is a classic fragrance. Been using it for years and still enjoy it. Lasts through the day. Was glad that I found it and got a good deal on it. And it reached way before the anticipated shipping time. Very positive experience. And to spray it on was the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend first gave me this cologne as a birthday present in the mid 80&#x27;s because she loved it. It has been my colongne pretty much since. I get more compliments from females from this cologne than anything i&#x27;ve ever tried. One fellow said it made him smell like a 50 y/o man. I guess that&#x27;s the right one for me now that i have passed 50. It has gotten hard to find at the drug stores and various other places i used to buy it. Been wearing several other types the last 6 month&#x27;s trying to find a substitute but they don&#x27;t stack up. It&#x27;s Quorum for me i guess till the bitter end!</li>
            <li> Listen, this cologne is Bombastic! This fragrance is simply the best by far. Compared to all of the other colognes  such as PL, CK, NAUT... it has gotten me inundated compliments. If there is anything to be aware of with this  cologne is that, if you are married or in a serious relationship, you cannot, i repeat cannot, let you husband/boyfriend go out with this  cologne sprayed on him because when the woman catches a whiff of this scent she will be compelled to approach him  with good intentions that may lead to something of a possessed encounter. It is simply a matter of overwhelming  attraction. I hope to meet the maker of this fragrance one day, he&#x27;s a genius and a wizard of chemistry.  And the name holds it&#x27;s true value, because without this fragrance being a member in the world of colognes/fragrances there  is no committee.    Great job Puig!</li>
            <li> I have used this cologn for the past 2 years. It is great and continues to be a preferred choice for me.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories, nice scent and lasts all day, the pump is a little weak</li>
            <li> perfume is much dark, recommended for night use,&lt;br /&gt;so luxury so nice :)</li>
            <li> This fragrance has been around for a long time, and is still a sensual scent that I must have; it&#x27;s one of my essential scents.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a very reasonable price. It&#x27;s by far the cheapest in price that I&#x27;ve came across. And the quality isn&#x27;t compromised. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The cologne is great but the spray did not work and leaks.</li>
            <li> I was at a well known Discount retail store.  ( i&#x27;m not sure if I mention them, so I won&#x27;t ) Anyway they wanted $24.00 . I remember paying  $50 plus for this Cologne in the early 90&#x27;s. It smelled good and I remembered getting compliments. So now he&#x27;s getting compliments. Not to mention I paid less than half of the supposedly sale price they had at the store .You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The last time I bought Quorum By Puig For Men was over 10 years ago at Nordstroms. Back then the same bottle cost me over $40.00. I&#x27;m very pleased with your product. Thank you. Don L. Wagner Jr.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Old Guy who never wears a scent.  I was looking for a musk-based masculine scent that made the statement I wanted to make:  \\&quot;I&#x27;m Old, Tired, Bad Tempered and Heavily Armed\\&quot;.  I love this stuff.  Hints of cigars, booze, rat glands, and expensive large pistol primer smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone over 50.  Wear it daily.</li>
            <li> I received the product from the seller promptly and a safe/secure shipment.  Additionally, I personally think this cologne for men is a great smell, rather an expensive smell with OUT the overly expensive and pricey prices that a lot of designer colognes have on theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> . . .likes this stuff.  I like the price compared to  department stores when it was &amp;#34;popular.&amp;#34;  Looked totally brand new.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and this a sweet deal!</li>
            <li> Quorum has been around for a long time and has been one of my favorite. It is the perfect scent for mature men who don&#x27;t want their.fragance to arrive ahead of them.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this cologne at work about twenty years ago and received many &amp;#34;you smell great&amp;#34; comments.  To me, I find Quorum to have a strong powder scent that seemed to be better suited for the winter months.  I would agree with other reviewers that you dont need much - usually one spray and you&#x27;re good for the day.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY FAVORITE FROM BACK IN THE 80&#x27;S STILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive way to smell good every day.  You just never know when you might need it!!</li>
            <li> This is the cologne I absolutely love for my husband, and to our dismay they no longer carried it in our area. So I found this distributor and this was my first time on Amazon ;) the product came today and my husband and I were super excited to open the boxes and to our amazement they were packaged amazinely. We will be definately ordering from this supplier from now on.</li>
            <li> Cologne has a masculine scent of tobacco and spice, almost like Kuros</li>
            <li> My dad wore this cologne ad it will always be one of my favorites. I got this for a friend and he loves it and so do I. He gets tons of compliments when he wears it. I&#x27;m not good at describing scents but I love it. If you are looking for citrus scents, this is not for you. It&#x27;s more a woodsy patchouli vetiver type scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Quorum for many years and can verify the product as sold and shipped by Amazon is authentic and not a knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and could not count how many women have complimented me on the cologne over the years. The general compliments include it being masculine and not flowery or those along the lines of &amp;#34;it&#x27;s hot&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Sexy&amp;#34; &amp;#34;a turn-on&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reservation in posting this - I don&#x27;t want too many guys wearing it! I&#x27;m often asked what it is, but only once has a woman suggested she could identify it. Let&#x27;s call it a &amp;#34;secret formula&amp;#34; and let the wearer beware of it&#x27;s power.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in excellent condition. The product seems to be the same as I have purchased over the years from different sources.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this fragranace. He has been using it for quite awhile and always gets compliments. Also, we found it here on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li> Recommend this perfume for people 35 and older. I have no complaints about this product is good for me and I use it for 20 years. Para los de habla hispana es un buen perfume para personas serias y maduras recomendable para uso diario, lo uso desde hace 20 años.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loved the scent of it. Good thing because I do too. Hihihi</li>
            <li> I have used Quorum since I was a teen.  Now, much later in life people I meet still ask me what fragrance I am wearing and offer compliments.  Rarely heard of scent that really lingers and is very pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance for my husband/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past, so when I saw this product at the sale price I knew that I was getting for my money</li>
            <li> The Quorum is the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This is my version of &amp;#34;stink good.&amp;#34;  I love it - my girlfriend prefers Curve.</li>
            <li> Great product, fair price. never used before but i am very happy wiyh this item. I will buy again when i reorder.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that Amazon carried this spray, I live in a small Texas town and always had to get the store to special order for me. I got the larger bottle, in fact I ordered two and gave the second one to a friend that like it also.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like. Gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> A unique aroma for the man who is self-confident and not interested in making a brash announcement. Sure to please the most discerning.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest recently to collect colognes that I used to like (several from the 80s). This is one that brings back great memories and still wears well today.    One of my complaints of newer colognes for men is that they tend to be either unisex, feminine smelling, or cold and metallic smelling. I have no qualms with any of those fragrance notes (and have several of those in my cologne collection for various occasions), but that is not how I always want to smell on a day to day basis.     Quorum is a rich, musky smelling cologne that reminds me of cedar, bergamont, and musk. It is warm, masculine and evokes strength and confidence and that is how you will smell.    If you find this one too manly for your tastes, they also have one called Quorum Silver that is lighter and has even more cedar notes. It is great too as an all-around daily-wear cologne (in fact I think it is better for more formal events too).    If you want a great cologne that is a throwback to when men&#x27;s colognes smelled like they were made for a man and not a 21 year old female, this is for you!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Some reviewers commented on the scent of their bottles not seeming accurate.  We did not have this problem. The scent was spot on and all the ladies love my 18 year old son&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> Great cologne it&#x27;s been around a long time, I think the bottle i received was old stock, smelled really bad like the alcohol has turned. I will buy from Dillard&#x27;s where I know they have new stock and I can smell it first.</li>
            <li> The perfect fragrance for 70 year old men. I got for my father and he love it.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered within 2 days. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the this great smelling inexpensive cologne. I constantly get compliments from the ladies about smelling nice and questions from men on where I got it. Definitely 5 stars in my book and it should be in yours too.</li>
            <li> This is an old fashion  men&#x27;s Eau de Toilette, but it&#x27;s better than ever.  If your skin works with it, it last for a long time and everyone will ask you what are you wearing? because it smells great on you.  You will never be wrong buying it.</li>
            <li> The smell is very good and stays for all day. I&#x27;m very satisfied. I will buy this parfum again. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my signature cologne. For years I have had the hardest time finding this particular cologne. Now that I have found it, I will be ordering one a month until I have all they have to buy, lol. This smells great and you will get noticed by wearing it. Gentlemen get ready for a wake up call and get ready to fight them away with this scent. The best thing about it is that it smells slightly different on every man. Though it has the same undertones, it is essentially  as distinct as you  DNA when worn. You can smell it on o\someones else and think its something else until they tell you for sure that it is indeed Quorum. Great scent at a wonderful price.......Love you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for many years and my kids know it&#x27;s me by it&#x27;s scent when I&#x27;m around. My new girlfriend loves it also.</li>
            <li> I;ve selected Quorum as my cologne of choice for years.  And I will continue to do so.  The good news is that the price has gone down but the quality remains.</li>
            <li> This has a clean fresh scent. Get a lot of compliments from girls at work.</li>
            <li> To start off this review right I think one should try this cologne before buying.No...Quorum is not musky.No....Quorum is not a citrus-laden fragrance.No...there&#x27;s no cinnamon or sweetness of any kind.This is a non-sweet,clean and green,very mature men&#x27;s fragrance.To me Quorum is the epic masterpiece of what a green scent should be and highly sophisticated.To those submerged in the feminized and fresh aquatic scents of today this scent is sharp,astrigent,loud, and old man.Let&#x27;s talk about the scent shall we?...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three biggest notes you&#x27;ll get from Quorum are pine needles,suede,and white soap.Moss is present but it kind of hides between the pine and suede.Tobacco you&#x27;ll get in this along with just a tad of grapefruit.The grapefruit isn&#x27;t metallic as it&#x27;s very light.But you&#x27;ll catch it being brought out for some clarity through sharp notes like the pine and soap.The current formulation is still very good.But I do recall the older formulation having a little less soap,and the tobacco note outweighing the suede so it came off as a little darker/earthy.Despite the slight reformulation I still get an amazing 8-10 hours from Quorum on just 2 sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to sales pitch Quorum cologne to someone I&#x27;d say if you like a serious/mature smell like Skin Bracer Original or Polo Original by Ralph Lauren...you&#x27;ll definitely be drawn in by Quorum.On that topic after I bought my first bottle of Quorum back in 1991-1994(one of those years)...I never bought another bottle of Polo Original.Quorum may have been influenced by Polo Original,but it&#x27;s finer crafted in any formulation,much cheaper,and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Great product, a classic fragrance from the 80&#x27;s. I have used it all this time...A fragrance that has people asking you what you&#x27;re wearing....</li>
            <li> nice aroma can be presented to anyone</li>
            <li> the worst bottle I ever had very difficult to spray</li>
            <li> My guy did not like it so I am going to send it to my father who I think can appreciate it a little better.</li>
            <li> Almost pure water Pump didn&#x27;t work. Box was not sealed. Ebay did refund my money.Will not but from them again.</li>
            <li> Apparently this is a way cheaper version than what I rec&#x27;d as a gift a decade ago. The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long, which means it&#x27;s more alcohol than scent. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for going cheap instead of going to an actual cologne retailer.</li>
            <li> May be old stock. Not sure if company is still making this product, but to me it doesn&#x27;t come close to the Quorum that was made in the 80s,90s and early 2000s. Loved the old and original smell but not this. No, I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> My cousin ordered this for her husband because he loves the scent. I&#x27;m pleased with everything. It&#x27;s also my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> My son loves this product!!! I sent it to Germany to him.</li>
            <li> I have used Quorum for over 20 years.  I can honestly say the formula used in this bottle I purchased is NOT the same as the product I have purchased from local stores.  The scent is not quite the same when it is sprayed on, and the scent does not last.  After it is sprayed on you can tell it is not the same product after about twenty minutes.  All traces of the smell are gone in about an hour.  When I have purchased it from local stores, my clothes always smelled like the scent at the end of the day,  Not with this stuff.  I would venture to say it is bogus.</li>
            <li> Have used this cologne for years.  Affordable, with a distinctive masculine aroma, and moderate persistence.  It beats most trendy colognes at one fifth of their price.</li>
            <li> Quorum has been my favorite cologne for 30 years. Lately it has been harder to find. When I checked Amazon.com I was surprised to find it, and excited that it cost less then I used to pay</li>
            <li> Exactly what it is supposed to be. Ordered at Christmas. Took a few weeks to arrive. I am on West coast.. It shipped from the East.</li>
            <li> Sean Connery might have sprayed this on to go with the country-squire 3-piece suit he wore in \\&quot;Goldfinger\\&quot; --and in fact it smells like an even punchier version of Lentheric, the now-defunct stuff that gets mentioned in the ancient Fleming pulps. A dark, peaty-soapy, bitter-sweet orgy of wood, leather and tobacco, with raw power and aristocratic grace. And the tobacco note smells like latakia, the black pungent stuff they put in Dunhill pipe tobaccos; how else could something made in Spain smell so tweedy and British? One spray will convince you you&#x27;re sitting in M&#x27;s office, reading through a dossier. Now that you know all this -- can you pass this up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;No, Mister Bond, I expect you to buy!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great scent for the workplace -- I&#x27;ve worn it for years, on and off, and gotten a lot of compliments. Apparently this scent convinces people that I&#x27;m the solid, reliable sort who&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
            <li> Strong masculine cologne.  Was recommended by a female friend.  Good cologne for an evening out.  Does not fade after a few hours like many other brands.  Good price as well.</li>
            <li> that is not the original quorum smell.  wont order it again.</li>
            <li> The first hour or two after application is nearly unbearable. It is so overwhelmingly awful, I tried to wash it off the first time. Since I&#x27;m Scottish, I had to try it again and again. I&#x27;ve learned that, if you can wait it out, the remaining fragrance isn&#x27;t too bad. When I wear it,  I put a spray or two on, sit in my bedroom alone for 2 hours, then go to work. Not really. It is sitting in a drawer waiting to be a white elephant gift.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells on my husband.</li>
            <li> It is good, the only thing is that the top of the spray I prefer the yellow one.</li>
            <li> Excellent price,,, my favorite</li>
            <li> Smells great. Easy on the wallet. I use this one during the day at work and Quorum Silver when going out at night.  Lots of compliments. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use to wear this when I was younger---but now I wear it for little outings---still like it.</li>
            <li> My husband asked for this because he thought he liked it.  I think it&#x27;s a little to sweet smelling and was way too strong.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne and price is great.</li>
            <li> Not for everyone.  A little goes a long way, some stuff I have, the whole bottle lasts till lunch, maybe.  It does not get more manly than this.</li>
            <li> Exelent and very good item. Exelent transaction</li>
            <li> An awesome fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been using Quorum as my cologne since 1972. Over the years I have noticed a slight change in the quality of the cologne, how long it lasts on the skin, etc. To me this last order (the bottle I have opened) is not very good. The perfumed aroma of Quorum is not there. I am going to do some skin and paper tests, and give them a smell. It seems to me, that if a cologne or perfume company changes their recipe on a product they should let the public know. Don&#x27;t you think so?</li>
            <li> I have always used Quorum and like it. Now I get to buy it for half the price and it comes to my door.</li>
            <li> This is how a man should smell -- like an enchanted forest!&lt;br /&gt;Quorum, with oakmoss / pine / leather, is the ultimate scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband several years ago and it has been his favorite ever since.  In fact, Quorum, is the only cologne he will wear.  The product was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap and the packaging was intact.  My order actually arrived a day early.  If you are looking for a cologne for your husband or significant other, I would recommend that you try this one.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite cologne and I can get it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, it last all day.</li>
            <li> Just a good solid manly fragrance!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologen for years and this is the only place where I can find it. And the price is awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product. To my husband and I , nothing else smells as amazing. We love it. Only issue,sometimes it&#x27;s a little hard to find so we stock up on it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell a little better than a 70s disco scene. Nonetheless, its not that bad but I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Great Perfume Great Price - Fast delivery I usually buy them in bulk. It&#x27;s my gym perfume. Yes. Men should wear perfume before going into the gym so they don&#x27;t smell like dirty socks. &amp; NO they don&#x27;t need to be either gay or metrosexual to do that. Get a perfume boys. Use it at the gym. You&#x27;ll get more ladies.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this and the price is right. Light, good for both work and being out on the town.</li>
            <li> Excellent ( This is the Real Thing )....  Super fast shipping.  Less than three days to my door.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell of this men&#x27;s cologne it takes me back to my High School days.</li>
            <li> This scent is a head turner every where I go ... the women of course can&#x27;t hlp but ask what it is I am wearing ... but even thr guys are asking ... what is that and where do you get it ... at this price ... you can&#x27;t beat it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for years and I am happy to be able to get it at such a reasonable price!  Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> Man, for this price ? you gotta try it - and then chances are you&#x27;ll like it. And your girl, too ! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Quorum for men for years and love the clean smell of it (I have not found a lady who has made a face yet to the scent of this cologne). It is not sold at retail stores anymore, but Amazon has it at a great price as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this just by reading the reviews. My husband loves cologne. He wears it morning, noon, and night. He doesn&#x27;t know how to be conservative. He has to spray 3/4 times. I hope he likes it. Would I recommend? Yes</li>
            <li> BEST  MEN&#x27;S COLOGNE 0N THE MARKET</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li> My last order of this was actually back in April 2014, but I&#x27;m just now getting around to this review. I had ordered this a few times directly from Amazon before then, and they smelled just like they should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the last two bottles I ordered directly from Amazon smelled like horrible knockoffs. No Quorum scent at all! They both smelled like old, dirty water. The two bad ones were ordered on April 2, 2014 and January 18, 2014. I&#x27;ve been using Quorum for 22 years, and I know what it should smell like. I should have requested a refund, but I was just past the return period each time I discovered it was bad, so I just threw them both in the trash.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne thinking it was an earthy &amp; warm kinda smell. It isn&#x27;t (at least in my opinion), its more like a fresh-out-the-shower, shaving cream scent and most of my friends agree. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and it kind of varies in tone the more you put it on, giving a natural aroma vibe to it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the same smell as a real bottle of Quorum, put my soon to be out bottle next to this one and this bottle has a reddish tint to the gold lettering. very disappointed and a waste of money....</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and value.&lt;br /&gt;Totally was received as described.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The Totally Shipping was fast and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this fragrance I love. Lasts longer than 8 hours and is always imbued with your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like strong fragrances or aroma is shocking as he passed other fibula.&lt;br /&gt;There will always be someone asking for that fraganacia ..&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Purchase</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is so happy, it has been his favorite Eau the Toilette for twenty some years.  I&#x27;m so glad to carry it. thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wore this since right after high scool and it&#x27;s still my favorite cologne. Chic&#x27;s dig it. They should call it &amp;#34;it gets girls&amp;#34;. That is all.</li>
            <li> It seem like it was watered down,,,is there a difference in Toilette Spray and Cologne? I have had this same product before and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is not the bottle.the real container is long and green in color.make sure when ordering ,is Quorum by Puig.</li>
            <li> Smells like fire ants.  Or is it soldier ants?</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing Quorum for many years.  I love the smell on him and the great price.  I use to purchase Quorum at the big department stores and paid over double for it.  This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and this was one of my first colognes. I wanted a bang for the buck, and I think I got much more. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now. It&#x27;s very strong. I can generally still smell it on me after a shower the next day. Usually just one spray is enough. Once I wore 3 sprays and witnessed my friend&#x27;s girlfriend literally hold her nose. Rarely will I use it in the summer. It&#x27;s just too strong. I also would not recommend this to attract girls in their 20&#x27;s, but I have received compliments from women in their 50&#x27;s+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For warmer weather or attracting girls in their 20&#x27;s, try Aqua Quorum. It&#x27;s a bit more manly than the typical aquatics. I&#x27;ve also noticed girls enjoy the cedar / vanilla smell of Quorum Silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a sailor, I also enjoy the fact I&#x27;m supporting Puig.</li>
            <li> This is a cologne for a man who wants to smell like a man. Depending on your skin Ph it may or may not work on you. Smells kind of musky yet clean.</li>
            <li> I have used Quorum for many years and it has become more and more difficult to find this item now.  Happy to learn you had the item and I am pleased I can continue using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality economical perfume. I highly recommend this for causual wear. The smell remains throughout the day even with just 6-8 sprays.    I do not recommend for office wear as the tobacco smell is little on the higher side.</li>
            <li> I have been using quorum for several years. This is not quorum, it is a bad immitation. The box is correct The bottle is similar but the cologne is not even close.</li>
            <li> Great service on a great product</li>
            <li> I love this perfume...!!!</li>
            <li> After trying several perfumes such as Nautica and Davidoff, finally I found a good smell that I can wear everyday. Don&#x27;t buy it I want it to be mine.</li>
            <li> Several women ask me about this scent.  They all recall it from years ago and note they love the smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is very good,i have been using for years,compares to many very expensive mens fragrances,but much cheaper.for the price. Puig Quorum is very reasonable price and the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s My favorite Quorum By Puig For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray..I been using it for years &amp; years .It&#x27;s smells real masculine .</li>
            <li> It seems like duplicate. Doesn&#x27;t smell right. I buy it all the time from Amazon</li>
            <li> was a gift for my husband and he is delighted with this perfume, I tell them it&#x27;s very rendidor he just puts a gothic and through which leaves a trail of scent, this fragrance is very manly, as a woman I find excellent fragrance</li>
            <li> Used this fragrance many years ago and never forgot it. Now its mine again. Im actually wearing it now. And guess what, it still smells damn good.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to a family member, so I can&#x27;t comment.</li>
            <li> Long lasting decent smell.</li>
            <li> Great smell, nice bottle and price.</li>
            <li> The product is Ok, the spray nozzles are not the best but they work. The Stuff that was bought in Miami was longer lasting sent. But all and all this product is Ok.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long. Buying from Amazon is sketchy when it comes to colognes. It seems they are watered down quite often.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I purchased this, excellent</li>
            <li> Great price.  My husband and I love Quorum.</li>
            <li> Smells like tobacco. You feel old at the same time manly. This is more of your personality.  To me personally I don&#x27;t like the smell of tobacco but I would recommend to older people</li>
            <li> I have used this scent for years and like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne. Must say it is a great smell!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I actually stepped out on a limb and purchased this based on a friendly recommendation without actually smelling it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was wrapped as if it came directly from a store and it smells great.  It is now one of my favorite colognes!</li>
            <li> I used to love this fragrance on my husband now not so much. I thought it smelled kind of stale. I don&#x27;t know not a fan anymore</li>
            <li> Well, what can I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and I honestly have to say that three years ago i would have never been able to rock this cologne. This is not cologne that you wear, this scent wears you. That&#x27;s the gist of it. It is a &#x27;mature man&#x27; smell, exudes confidence and a certain friendly warmth.&lt;br /&gt;Technically speaking, you get an initial blast of really sharp pine resin and what some people have described as a catty aroma... maybe skin types react differently. Mine mellows out to what most people describe as a cig tobacco, pine, powerful mesh of smells that have a very evocative power. It never sticks sweet or buttery and after the dry down is complete astringency is not an issue. This is what masculine smell is, no doubt about it. Love it or hate it, it is a well balanced powerhouse from the 80&#x27;s. Expect staying power; I don&#x27;t like overwhelming people around me, I usually do 1-2 sprays, the stuff clings on your clothes well into the night.</li>
            <li> Great scent....classic!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing in a unique way that must be experienced to fully understand. It&#x27;s a funky, strong fragrance that screams I AM A MAN! Unless you can pull this off don&#x27;t wear it. I would not recommend this for younger guys. If you&#x27;re in your mid 30&#x27;s and above and have your s**t together you can probably pull off wearing Quorum. If you&#x27;ve got a beard, smoke cigars, and can talk to beautiful women about a wide range of topics (like that handsome chap from those Mexican beer commercials), go for it.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this fragrance, I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> My dad gave me this Cologne as a gift many years ago.  I was younger then and never really appreciated.  Now, however, it is my favorite (I&#x27;m also fond of Hugo Boss and 4711). It is an exceptional &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; cologne; somewhat smokey and hints of sandalwood permeate.  It is not overpowering - unless you don&#x27;t know the meaning subdued and douse yourself as you would in a shower with it - and best of all - it is not sickly sweet as too many of today&#x27;s mens&#x27; eau de toilettes are. This goes well with a well tailored single breasted charcoal suit, a pressed white shirt, dark silk tie, vodka martini, and a medium rare Filet Mignon at your favorite steak house.  It will also impress the charming woman in the black cocktail dress whom you&#x27;ve just helped out of your convertible as she takes a whiff of what a confident man wears to a power meeting or an intimate night on the town.  I intend to give my son a bottle of Quorum when he gets older as my father did; it&#x27;s that special to me and what it conveys to others.</li>
            <li> seems this is a whole new industry out there of tinkering with what was a great scent, don&#x27;t get me wrong I still like it very much and will use it it is just not the same as before</li>
            <li> 3.4 oz is a good size, and it smells good at a great price.  I purchased 2 to get Free Delivery.  Great for gifts, for teenagers (mine bathes in this stuff), to keep and use, etc...  I&#x27;m looking for more good deals like this but they are not easy to come by.</li>
            <li> Amazing wihen you can find something of real value online and Quorum is one of those values. Well Worth it as I Truly Believe in value at [...]</li>
            <li> My husband has used this cologne for years and loves it. It has become harder to find over the years. He was pleasantly surprised that I was able to order it for him for Christmas.</li>
            <li> really enjoy the smell of Quorum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how prevalent it is, but what I received was NOT Quorum.  I have been using if for more than 20 years and what I received was mostly alcohol and had the incorrect spray nozzle.  Someone had obviously refilled it with some other concoction for resale.  Amazon did refund me.  If you notice, anywhere else except eBay, it is a $30 plus product.  I&#x27;m not going to order it from here or eBay!</li>
            <li> I have liked this since Jr. High School and still like it the corporate world. Very pleased.  The last bottle I bought was about eight years ago, I just ran out.  The scent seems slightly different from what it used to be, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I cant beleive they still have these in stock. It remined me of the late 80s... Great scent and i will buy more once i run out. But will keep one in the box just in case they stop making them... The item came quick and was  well packaged... Very Nice..........</li>
            <li> You have to be familiar with the cologne to appreciate it. I am often complimented when I wear Quorum. best price on Amazon</li>
