            <li> I love this color enough to buy it for this outrageous price and take it with me for a pedicure.</li>
            <li> I now notice it chips less than what the pedicurist has on hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that you can&#x27;t find it anymore except at ultra high prices.</li>
            <li> her majesty&#x27;s secret service&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But the price is ridiculous!!!</li>

            <li> I love this color enough to buy it for this outrageous price and take it with me for a pedicure. I now notice it chips less than what the pedicurist has on hand.</li>
            <li> oh so beautiful of a color!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really great red, I&#x27;m not one to wear much bright red nail color, but this one&lt;br /&gt;is such a lovely shade, and sparkly!</li>
            <li> Great color.  I get more compliments when I wear this shade.  I hope they continue to carry this color.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> You only live twice is an amazing color. I found it at my favorite nail shop and ordered some before it gets discontinued. It&#x27;s a fiery, deep, hot pink, verging on red, but not quite. It&#x27;s very sparkly, especially in sunlight. If you like deep, bold colors this will probably be pretty satisfying. It&#x27;s currently \\&quot;my color\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love the color deep dark red really sparkles without being gaudy!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! I have two bottles of these so that I can have it forever...I was proposed to while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I had a pedicure and chose this color. By the time I got home, the Polish had chipped, so I ordered it on amazon to fix the chip. The only thing this product has going for itself, is the pretty color. The color on the bottle is 100% accurate. I don&#x27;t know if reds chip easily, but I found with this color,  the pedicure didn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> This color is fantastic!  However I may have gotten a used color, there appeared to be some dry nail polish on the inside ring of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The red is rich and has a shimmer.  Love it.  My favorite red OPI of all time.  Product arrived on schedule and as described.</li>
            <li> My favorite OPI polish.  It&#x27;s a shimmery red with microscopic gold glitter.  It is not difficult to remove because the glitter is ground.  It&#x27;s too bad that you can&#x27;t find it anymore except at ultra high prices.</li>
            <li> I love this shade, it compliments light skin tones perfectly!</li>
            <li> I LOVE The color!!!! I hope you keep getting it in! It even sparkles!! I would recommend this color to&lt;br /&gt;anyone who likes Red</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite red nail polish</li>
            <li> Love this color. Sparkly and sophisticated. One of my favorites in any brand!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a pic they posted on OPI&#x27;s facebook page, and it was the most gorgeous pink color! When I saw the picture on here I had to double check it was the right one because it looked so much darker and more of a berry/wine shade than the iridescent pink they showed. Bought it anyway, and its definitely the shade shown here. That&#x27;s why it only got 3 stars. It goes on well and is a pretty color...just not the color I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  It is a beautiful shimmery magenta.  Wears well and looks great on the nail.  OPI makes a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this color and hope OPI keeps it.  I used two coats however to get the true color to shine through.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this color when I received it. I was expecting a pink and it is very red. It looks to be a Christmas red to me. I have not tried it on my nails yet.</li>
            <li> I love this polish!  It is beautiful even on sausage fingers!  There is something pretty special about they skyfall collection!  I also love &amp;#34;On her majesty&#x27;s secret service&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you like Red polish you would probably like this .this color Red is so pretty great for the Holidays and has such a nice shine by far this is one of my favorite reds from Opi along with a top coat to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> My favorite color of polish. So flattering and sexy.</li>
            <li> this is and ok color,,,,,Im more a purple person</li>
            <li> i HAD GOTTEN ONE BOTTLE BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND LOVED IT. aFTER i FINISHED THE BOTTLE  i WENT ONLINE TO SEE IF i COULD FIND MORE.  i ORDERED 3 MORE.  i LOVE THIS COLOR..</li>
            <li> A friend and I found &amp;#34;You Only Live Twice&amp;#34; OPI nail polish manicure appointment and loved it! Not only is it a wonderful color, OPI makes a darn good nail polish.  Unfortunately special OPI collections are only available for a limited time, so when we went to purchase locally, this color was no longer available so I looked on Amazon, and lo and behold - I could buy it  for less than I could at my local store and it was delivered to my doorstep promptly.  Great bargain!</li>
            <li> This beautiful color was part of the Skyfall collection, and was available for only a short time.  I was happy to find it here!</li>
            <li> I had picked this color at a nail salon, so after that I just had to buy it the next day...</li>
            <li> This is not only a perfect holiday color, it&#x27;s a bright cheery hue every day. You Only Live Twice was not available at my local salon any more, but Amazon, the amazing had it. It came to me quickly and packed perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice deep red.  I really like the color and especially I love OPI.  Get it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I had a mani/pedi at a local shop and found this color. It&#x27;s beautiful,shimmers nicely without looking like glitter. So i came home and order a bottle for home.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to fall color for several years.  Not sure if this color is available any longer, but I bought several on Amazon.  I always gets compliments when I wear this rich color.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this color. But the price is ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> This is a deep, vibrant rich red color. Perfect for the holidays.  Now if they could only make it chip proof.  May be my fault for not putting a clear top coat on.</li>
            <li> but it does chip easier than others I&#x27;ve used.  other than that, we are enjoying the nail polish.  thats it.</li>
            <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s sparkly and a darker pink which is nice because its not extremely bright. I bought tons of other Skyfall OPI colors on amazon and I was not disappointed.</li>
