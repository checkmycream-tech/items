            <li>This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for we guys who like no hair you know where!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and is the best I have used.</li>
            <li>it is great an delivery time was excellent</li>
            <li>As I said, I LOVED it!</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of practice and  their customers&#x27; service was great in providing assistance when I had some</li>
            <li>Love this shaver !!</li>
            <li>It does a fair job.  </li>
            <li>I use under arms and it works fairly well.</li>
            <li>its a must have just plug it in and your good to go whenever you need it</li>
            <li>Very happy with the results, as each time I shave I get a close and smooth finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE, love,  loved it!!!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job .......  very easy to shave all areas....</li>
            <li>I have nothing more to say!</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!!</li>
            <li>Takes a lot of patience; Works OK but never as good as a blade.</li>
            <li>honestly the thing yanked and pulled more then cut</li>
            <li>It has retractable plug which is great for travelling and is light and ergonomically easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I bought the Bare It All shaver and was totally impressed.</li>
            <li>It gives a closer shave, and the operation is very smooth, without pulling or nicking</li>
            <li>More convenient to handle.</li>
            <li>Customer service wrote me and explained how to use it better, which seemed to work as I got a closer shave.</li>
            <li>love this item it works better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li>You have to spend a lot more time to see any results if any at all.</li>
            <li>After battling it for years, trying electrolysis on the coarser hairs, hair removal cream that did such an excellent job of removing my skin that I called it &amp;#34;face remover,&amp;#34; and one of those stick-like shavers that gives maybe an inch of shaving surface and slips to the side with no effort, with no removal at all.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and shaves very clean.... would recommend it to all</li>
            <li>When I opened the packaging, I literally had to move the pouch away from me because the odor was so strong and unfamiliar.</li>
            <li>Another feature that I like is a vent feature around its head; I assume it&#x27;s to keep the motor cool and extend the life of the shaver, but it also creates cool air on my face, which is going to be a nice plus in the summer.</li>
            <li>Then I met my new girlfriend and got her into a tidy bush which we both love.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, comfortable, and a really smooth finish.</li>
            <li>smooth as silk in all the right places :)  Easy to use</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully, although it does take more daily time, he result is very smooth (everywhere, from the face to full privates parts), never a single cut.  </li>
            <li>It is a cheaply constructed trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The motor seems to be more powerful, too.</li>
            <li>A light dusting with baby powder or the likes, and shave away.  </li>
            <li>I am not the original buyer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this new one.</li>
            <li>The body shaver leaves a clean shave, yet you have to take your time exercising a bit of patience.</li>
            <li>This product falls short, it does not do a good job.</li>
            <li>Cuts really close and safe to use</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m so happy with this improved shaver that I might buy another to keep as a spare.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m so happy with this improved shaver that I might buy another to keep as a spare.</li>
            <li>Not something to use quickly before a shower.  </li>
            <li>The information provided on website was very accurate and complete.  </li>
            <li>I realize she was doing her best to stand behind the company</li>
            <li>Or even if the red light just went out, it would be better than guessing.</li>
            <li>Or even if the red light just went out, it would be better than guessing.</li>
            <li>The newer one doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to the old one in getting close, but the trimmer is better because it is built in.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works great ,the shaver only seems to cut hair that is already quite short.</li>
            <li>very gentle ,your skin may not accommodate to it at the beginning</li>
            <li>(Or front, lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could use the round head only, if you shave again VERY soon (1 day), otherwise,  any longer and you must double-cut again for the BEST results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>havent had it long enough for a lot of usage but wjat I have its works great</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>Being a male, some of those folds and wrinkles can be challenging, often left unshaved for too long, then out with razor and cream for a good seeing to.</li>
            <li>Bare It All will nick your skin and does not provide the smooth shave of the Cleancut.</li>
            <li>Much superior to other body groomers I have used, so far.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase it again.</li>
            <li>The body is improved, too, in that it has a dull matte finish that eliminates unsightly fingerprints; I think it also gives a more substantial, high-quality appearance that makes it look like a fine implement and not a toy.</li>
            <li>, too, in that it has a dull matte finish that eliminates unsightly fingerprints; I think it also gives a more substantial, high-quality appearance that makes it look like a fine implement and not a toy.</li>
            <li>( Once you start using it, the regrowth is different than with a razor and it becomes easier and easier to get a very close shave and baby smooth skin.)</li>
            <li>I have found that the trimmer tends to nick the skin while trying to trim my intimate areas.  </li>
            <li>And I am not confused about what product I am using.  </li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the instructions carefully, use plenty of baby powder and you will love the result..just be patient though as it takes a couple of weeks to get the results after having used razor blades.</li>
            <li>is much, much better than wet shaving.</li>
            <li>Very close shave, no nicks or bumps, and so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>so I was very reserved about the All in One.</li>
            <li>but then it has a pefect result, smooth on private areas</li>
            <li>A bit of personal history: I bought my original  shaver to use on my face.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to have a spare when I needed more shaving time than the previous model provided.</li>
            <li>I have an older shaver from this company.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and for those that question</li>
            <li>It is a bit slower than expected but works superior than more expensive models I have tried.</li>
            <li>Then, use the round head for your &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; and you will be quite pleased with the results, as I was.  </li>
            <li>A new car?</li>
            <li>I have had new cars, and this odor was nothing like that.</li>
            <li>First, use the pop-up trimming blade to get every hair REAL SHORT!  </li>
            <li>I think my hair is soft therefore, it doesn&#x27;t get all of it.</li>
            <li>Still have to use a razor to complete the job.</li>
            <li>(the old one didn&#x27;t, either); it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m using a shaver as it glides across my skin.</li>
            <li>Then my old one can be the backup for the backup.</li>
            <li>Then my old one can be the backup for the backup.</li>
            <li>It was not like I had thought, cause I can&#x27;t use it for intimate parts without problems, in adittion instructions manuel is very  brief.</li>
            <li>I thought this bare all in one device cuts private hair, but it&#x27;s got to be trimmed first than use this device.</li>
            <li>Even after it&#x27;s used correctly,Still didn&#x27;t give me a close shave and didn&#x27;t last that long so stubble came quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have a light complexion, so the hair wasn&#x27;t as obvious as it would have been on someone with dark hair, but there it was.</li>
            <li>Charge light works, but it is Dead!  </li>
            <li>For a baby smooth dry shave in public and private areas make it a daily routine.  </li>
            <li>My only wish is that it had a green light when the shaver is fully charged.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that it had a green light when the shaver is fully charged.</li>
            <li>Purchased the Bare it All shaver in June 2013.</li>
            <li>It did the trick, but it took 16 hours to charge and barely got me through one shave, so I wanted a backup.</li>
            <li>Located just below the shaver head, It turns on and off with a simple click, unlike the old one that had a slide on the side that I had to look for to turn it on and off.</li>
            <li>I bought the Bare it All after trying out the battery powered CleanCut.</li>
            <li>The rep I dealt with told me that it didn&#x27;t have such an odor, but was made of the same materials found in a new car.</li>
            <li>Have been using the Cleancut personal shaver for several years and wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this as an alternative to shaving burn 3 years ago, as it turns out it very handy for air-travel too, cutting down on limited space and carry-on liquids options.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve maintained a bare pubic area for the last 20-odd years.</li>
            <li>I expected that the new one would be the same, but surprise!</li>

            <li> Takes a lot of patience; Works OK but never as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> Even after it&#x27;s used correctly,Still didn&#x27;t give me a close shave and didn&#x27;t last that long so stubble came quickly.  Didn&#x27;t cut much and after I trimmed I  had to go over the same spot at least 5 times. Could have went without this. It&#x27;s not all bad but just not for me.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for ladys private areas, just doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> It does a fair job.  I would think a larger sgaving head would be beneficial.  The Gillette M3 power razer is still ol reliable.</li>
            <li> Much superior to other body groomers I have used, so far.  More convenient to handle. I have nothing more to say!</li>
            <li> I use under arms and it works fairly well. I think my hair is soft therefore, it doesn&#x27;t get all of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product and wanted to return it because it didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations. Customer service wrote me and explained how to use it better, which seemed to work as I got a closer shave. However, I also expressed my concerns over the horrible &amp;#34;chemical type&amp;#34; smell the carrying pouch emitted. When I opened the packaging, I literally had to move the pouch away from me because the odor was so strong and unfamiliar. The rep I dealt with told me that it didn&#x27;t have such an odor, but was made of the same materials found in a new car. A new car? I have had new cars, and this odor was nothing like that. I realize she was doing her best to stand behind the company and it&#x27;s products but she/company would not acknowledge my concern or offer to change it. I&#x27;m just a concerned person trying to protect consumers who may have respiratory problems. If you do and you purchase this product, use caution when opening the packaging. I&#x27;m not saying there are any chemicals in the fabric that could cause harm to anyone, all I know, is that it bothered me to the point where I felt I needed to express my concerns and they didn&#x27;t want to hear it.</li>
            <li> LOVE, love,  loved it!!!  That is, until it just stopped working.  Charge light works, but it is Dead!  It is still on warranty, but what a hassle to have to return, so I bought something else in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick to this product is to double cut. First, use the pop-up trimming blade to get every hair REAL SHORT!  Then, use the round head for your &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; and you will be quite pleased with the results, as I was.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!! (Or front, lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could use the round head only, if you shave again VERY soon (1 day), otherwise,  any longer and you must double-cut again for the BEST results.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD definitely buy this product again!!! As I said, I LOVED it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and I find that I just cannot like this shave.  For the price, I am disappointed in the product.  I have found that the trimmer tends to nick the skin while trying to trim my intimate areas.  It is a cheaply constructed trimmer.  Also, the shaver is very slow and tedious.  Not something to use quickly before a shower.  The shaver is smaller than it appears in the picture (which for me is a plus) but even with smaller head, I find it very difficult to shave in and around the bikini area.  I would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Information: Response to Anthony&lt;br /&gt;Anthony is correct.  I am not the original buyer.  This was purchased for me as a gift by my husband from this site. And I am not confused about what product I am using.  This seller&#x27;s bulling tactics are unnecessary; as I see this is his usual behavior from reading his other comments on every other person that did not rate his product well.  Not only do I not recommend this product; I don&#x27;t recommend using this seller.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  The information provided on website was very accurate and complete.  It works very well and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve maintained a bare pubic area for the last 20-odd years. Being a male, some of those folds and wrinkles can be challenging, often left unshaved for too long, then out with razor and cream for a good seeing to. Then I met my new girlfriend and got her into a tidy bush which we both love. She mentioned in one phone call maybe using an electric shaver, so my fingers hit the keyboard and I bought the Bare It All shaver and was totally impressed. Easy to use, comfortable, and a really smooth finish. I didn&#x27;t want her to pinch it off me, so I bought one for her and am waiting for delivery as I write, hopefully it will arrive before I visit again in two weeks.(long distance affaires suck) You have two very happy customers.&lt;br /&gt;Terry&lt;br /&gt;Ceduna South Australia</li>
            <li> Love this shaver !! It does take a bit of practice and  their customers&#x27; service was great in providing assistance when I had some questions.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions carefully, use plenty of baby powder and you will love the result..just be patient though as it takes a couple of weeks to get the results after having used razor blades.( Once you start using it, the regrowth is different than with a razor and it becomes easier and easier to get a very close shave and baby smooth skin.)</li>
            <li> Still have to use a razor to complete the job. Have used for a month and still not as well as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> love this item it works better than anything else on the market. its a must have just plug it in and your good to go whenever you need it</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is the best I have used. It is lightweight with matt rubber finish so will not scratch. It has retractable plug which is great for travelling and is light and ergonomically easy to use. It ticks all the boxes if used as per the instructions, this is a trimmer &amp; shaver, not a lawn mower.</li>
            <li> Does a good job .......  very easy to shave all areas.... Easy to use and shaves very clean.... would recommend it to all</li>
            <li> This product falls short, it does not do a good job. You have to spend a lot more time to see any results if any at all. I have to look for another shaver.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Bare it All shaver in June 2013. Best thing I could have done. Very happy with the results, as each time I shave I get a close and smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;This is much, much better than wet shaving.</li>
            <li> it is great an delivery time was excellent havent had it long enough for a lot of usage but wjat I have its works great</li>
            <li> honestly I have now considered having very sensitive regions waxed instead of ever enduring the pain of this horrible contraption again. its spinning razors covered by the thinnest screen.... honestly the thing yanked and pulled more then cut</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to have a spare when I needed more shaving time than the previous model provided. I&#x27;m thrilled with this new one. A bit of personal history: I bought my original  shaver to use on my face. Yes, my face. I started developing noticeable hair growth on it after menopause. I have a light complexion, so the hair wasn&#x27;t as obvious as it would have been on someone with dark hair, but there it was. After battling it for years, trying electrolysis on the coarser hairs, hair removal cream that did such an excellent job of removing my skin that I called it &amp;#34;face remover,&amp;#34; and one of those stick-like shavers that gives maybe an inch of shaving surface and slips to the side with no effort, with no removal at all. The results? Frustration, wasted time, and hair on my face. I was wary of trying an ordinary shaver, so when I stumbled upon the earlier model of this one, I jumped at it. It did the trick, but it took 16 hours to charge and barely got me through one shave, so I wanted a backup. I expected that the new one would be the same, but surprise! Instead of taking 16 hours to charge, it took only 6 to 8 hours and the charge lasted at least twice as long. I always charge it after I&#x27;ve shaved my face twice at a leisurely pace, but it hasn&#x27;t even started to slow down at that point. The motor seems to be more powerful, too. It gives a closer shave, and the operation is very smooth, without pulling or nicking (the old one didn&#x27;t, either); it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m using a shaver as it glides across my skin. The On/Off switch is also improved. Located just below the shaver head, It turns on and off with a simple click, unlike the old one that had a slide on the side that I had to look for to turn it on and off. Another feature that I like is a vent feature around its head; I assume it&#x27;s to keep the motor cool and extend the life of the shaver, but it also creates cool air on my face, which is going to be a nice plus in the summer. The body is improved, too, in that it has a dull matte finish that eliminates unsightly fingerprints; I think it also gives a more substantial, high-quality appearance that makes it look like a fine implement and not a toy. My only wish is that it had a green light when the shaver is fully charged. Or even if the red light just went out, it would be better than guessing. Other than that, I&#x27;m so happy with this improved shaver that I might buy another to keep as a spare. Then my old one can be the backup for the backup., too, in that it has a dull matte finish that eliminates unsightly fingerprints; I think it also gives a more substantial, high-quality appearance that makes it look like a fine implement and not a toy. My only wish is that it had a green light when the shaver is fully charged. Or even if the red light just went out, it would be better than guessing. Other than that, I&#x27;m so happy with this improved shaver that I might buy another to keep as a spare. Then my old one can be the backup for the backup.</li>
            <li> The perfect shaver. Cuts really close and safe to use</li>
            <li> I bought the Bare it All after trying out the battery powered CleanCut. This shaver is an upgrade from the Cleancut and is slightly larger, but lighter. The results of the All in One are wonderful! Very close shave, no nicks or bumps, and so much easier to use.The savings in razor blades alone pays for it in less than 2 months (my girlfriend and I both use it). I shaved with a regular razor for over 17 yrs. so I was very reserved about the All in One. What a fool! A light dusting with baby powder or the likes, and shave away.  I highly recommend this product and for those that question it&#x27;s results and buying it? DON&#x27;T! You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  Love this product.  It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Cleancut personal shaver for several years and wanted to try something new.  I am going back to the Cleancut.  This Bare It All will nick your skin and does not provide the smooth shave of the Cleancut.</li>
            <li> very gentle ,your skin may not accommodate to it at the beginning but then it has a pefect result, smooth on private areas</li>
            <li> This shaver actually works like stated. It is a bit slower than expected but works superior than more expensive models I have tried.</li>
            <li> I thought this bare all in one device cuts private hair, but it&#x27;s got to be trimmed first than use this device. I though this does it all apparently it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> unsafe, injured me.  I read all the literature and still injured myself twice.  The shaver is tedious and I couldn&#x27;t tell if the shaving head actually did anything at all.  There is a no return policy so I recommend you keep shopping.</li>
            <li> I first bought this as an alternative to shaving burn 3 years ago, as it turns out it very handy for air-travel too, cutting down on limited space and carry-on liquids options.  It works wonderfully, although it does take more daily time, he result is very smooth (everywhere, from the face to full privates parts), never a single cut.  I would certainly purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great ,the shaver only seems to cut hair that is already quite short. I am disappointed with this shavers design. Maybe I got a bad one.</li>
            <li> The body shaver leaves a clean shave, yet you have to take your time exercising a bit of patience. For a baby smooth dry shave in public and private areas make it a daily routine.  Follow instructions, though.</li>
            <li> It was not like I had thought, cause I can&#x27;t use it for intimate parts without problems, in adittion instructions manuel is very  brief.</li>
            <li> smooth as silk in all the right places :)  Easy to use and the results are just as advertised.  It&#x27;s perfect for we guys who like no hair you know where!</li>
            <li> I have an older shaver from this company.  I thought it was time to replace it with a newer one.  The newer one doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to the old one in getting close, but the trimmer is better because it is built in.  So, maybe it is a &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; -- I like the product.--</li>
