            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite of their products.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more shine.</li>
            <li>Do love their shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li>I recommend this to anyone with hair :)</li>
            <li>I do prefer a more oily serum</li>
            <li>THE BEST OIL EVER!!!I have blonde damaged dyed hair</li>
            <li>gooood love love love</li>
            <li>This oil smells great and nourishes my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>My favorite way to use it is on damp hair</li>
            <li>Gives that brighter, healthy look after styling/blowdrying and even when she isn&#x27;t fixing it.</li>
            <li>, did i remind you it was also healthy for your hair.</li>
            <li>The smell could be better though.</li>
            <li>and my hair has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li>I love this and will continue buying it.</li>
            <li>I love this hair oil.  </li>
            <li>I have used countless serums and elixirs, and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>The shipping was also lighting fast and packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li>apologize I can&#x27;t write an honest review of the product, as I was excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>It works wonderful on long hair.</li>
            <li>smell is kind of sweet, but</li>
            <li>If you have dry damaged and frizzy hair, this would be the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li>I do not care for the strong smell though which I personally do not find very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy, and shinny, and semi freeze free.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and easy to brush, without making them greasy.</li>
            <li>This oil is super light and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Great Product that was delivered in a earlier amount of time than predicted.</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>and this keeps my hair smooth and non greasy.  </li>
            <li>My ends damaged by heat and highlights, etc are smooth and healing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many argan oil treatments, but the Naissant is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>in a good way- natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but This Elixir especially because of the Texture which is Super Silky, the Smell which is Pleasant &amp; Most of All because of How My Hair Feels &amp; Looks.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is super moisturizing and also super light weight.</li>
            <li>Smoothes out frizzy hair quickly and easily</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s so much product it still looks full!!</li>
            <li>but it works great on dry hair as well.</li>
            <li>In fact, I have been more impressed with this hair elixir than pretty much any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s previous amazing reviews and is definitely one of the best conditioning oils I have ever used!</li>
            <li>She was so right!</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s the good stuff, she feels special and actually uses it.</li>
            <li>But, if you use this product in conjunction with say a good masque you will be the overall health of your hair begin to restore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps it much quite healthy</li>
            <li>It is light, no greasy and it adds good shine to my dry hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my daily routine a lot more easy</li>
            <li>an my hair already looks so much more healthier and alive.. doesn&#x27;t have an oily feel while applying it to the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave hair weighed down or oily.. great product</li>
            <li>I have heard amazing reviews about this product on a several Youtube videos, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I have extensions as well, so this works as an amazing daily soothing treatment for them</li>
            <li>Great oil for everyday use on your hair.</li>
            <li>this stuff made my hair so soft no oily deposit ,love it Buy it</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, a little sweet, not too strong.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve purchased this, I leave it in my hair right after I shower and leave it there for 30min to an hr,</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product for my fine, dry, wavy color-treated hair...</li>
            <li>It is fine and most oils weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, I&#x27;ve noticed that in using it over time, the overall condition of my hair has improved, and it seems healthier and a bit longer.</li>
            <li>Used this oil yesterday for the first time</li>
            <li>overall, I really really love this product.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>someone else said mine smelled pretty awful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my wavy hair shiny, manageable, smooth, and touchably soft.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my ends soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous oils and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li>Naissant Argan Oil Elixir is not only my favorite hair oil</li>
            <li>4 stars because it is pretty pricey, but her hair looks 10x better now that she&#x27;s using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Oh boy did I over do this oil the first use</li>
            <li>My hair feels so smooth and healthy after using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using on my kids natural curly hair and it makes their curls look so soft and shiny, and I love how it smells.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a dry light weight oil that smells good, like coconuty and luxe, with argan oil without the grease, weighting your hair down and the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this for my dry overworked hair!</li>
            <li>(Although I&#x27;ve heard you don&#x27;t necessarily have to be blonde to use this, it&#x27;s that amazing).</li>
            <li>I received it to my door in reasonable time.</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>It really does what the packaging says.</li>
            <li>This oil is fabulous for providing deep conditioning benefits for my hair.</li>
            <li>I just want to warn others to read their bottle carefully and make sure you get what you ordered.</li>
            <li>I do not have too much hair</li>
            <li>I have very wavy hair that I straighten</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to smooth and condition the hair.</li>
            <li>Really reccomend this product if you want to try argan oil</li>
            <li>I heard about this product via Youtube and they were telling the absolute truth:</li>
            <li>sometimes spits out too much oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s really helping.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make it limp or weighed down, so is good for fine hair as well as medium-thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product, my stands lie flat</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this seller as the shipping was fast and it was really well packaged.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely fruity scent, and a nice consistency (not too thick or oily), and it works wonders for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about hair products since my hair is quite fine, dry and damaged from over processing.</li>
            <li>But, its not bad enough to stop anyone from purchasing this.</li>
            <li>and I love how it moisturies my hair without weighting down.</li>
            <li>Love this oil, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>Less is more, bottle lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>I have used it on damp hair before drying, and also to smooth on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Have only used once and my hair feels softer After reading all the reviews about the wonderful smell I&#x27;m starting to wonder if I got a different batch, although the smell is not bad, but definitely it is not good.</li>
            <li>I have many oils and some are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I have tried .so many different products, and none of them have worked for me, but with this product i can actually feel, and see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use just a little bit after I wash my hair and it makes it feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I got this oil to replace my Kerastase Elixir, and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>and then I do my normal styling.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I do find myself reapplying it throughout the day because my hair just eats this stuff right up especially after a blowout.</li>
            <li>This is a product I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>I like trying new products.</li>
            <li>It makes my long, often snarley hair look so shiney and feel super soft!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, and it makes my hair, and especially my dry ends, so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I actually LOVE how it smells, and I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells- hate most perfumes and</li>
            <li>Also the pump puts too much product out even if you try to barely squeeze it.</li>
            <li>Start small and add more if you need it.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say they do exactly the same job</li>
            <li>this is the only product I found that I can wear my hair curly without frizz and have beauitful curl without weighing my hair down I have to say I love this product and can&#x27;t live without it,</li>
            <li>I ordered this after seeing all the positive reviews and I am definitely not blown away.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my fine hair limp or greasy.....</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this oil works well to maintain my frizz.</li>
            <li>Keeps my straightened hair wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is heavily highlighted and it makes it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Yet, they do not even get near to comparing to what this product has done for my hair.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to decrease my frizzy blonde hair without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I know friends that use it and love it for their thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and you only need to use a small amount on your hair since it&#x27;s pretty rich.</li>
            <li>It works very well when used with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>The bottle says it&#x27;s for blonde hair particularly, but it hasn&#x27;t been bleaching my hair or doing anything it shouldn&#x27;t be doing.</li>
            <li>I naturally have very curly dry hair</li>
            <li>My hair is long, fine, blond and tends to get dry and frizzy especially in the Summer.</li>
            <li>This is a light weight oil that does heavy duty things!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll more than likely go a 2nd round.</li>
            <li>Very recommended for dry damaged color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It also helps calm my very dry hair, and tame it on the very humid temperatures of the Caribbean!</li>
            <li>a different note, do not expect this product to completely nourish over-processed hair.</li>
            <li>I am careful to not put too much on.  </li>
            <li>I recently used bleach to lighten my hair from dark brown to light blonde mixed with low-lights.</li>
            <li>I was very excited on trying this product, because I&#x27;m addicted to Josie Maran argan oil serum</li>
            <li>Most importantly it didn’t leave my hair looking oily or dirty like other oils I have used.</li>
            <li>Every time I use this it improves the texture and manageability of my hair, and seems to be shinier and tangle free, yet not weighed down or oily (like some other Argan oil products make it).</li>
            <li>Using this product makes it a lot easier to style and flat iron my hair, and the results far exceed my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Like it, smells good oily a bit, but not as bad as other hair oils, asorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li>My hairs gone from dry and damaged to soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I have thick, dry, course hair, and Naissant Argan Oil Elixir makes it smooth and  </li>
            <li>...makes my hair soft and shiny even after a blow dry and after sleeping on it!  </li>
            <li>I put a little bit on after washing and before I blow it out and then a little bit afterwards to smooth it out</li>
            <li>It does everything good that you want in an oil and none of the bad things.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I Love All 3 Products</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used for my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite of their products.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more shine.</li>
            <li> Do love their shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is ok but not what I need after using it</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and love it.  </li>
            <li> You will not regret buying it! :)</li>
            <li> LOVE IT:)</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feel when I use Naissant Argan Oil Elixir.</li>
            <li> Love love love this</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone with hair :)</li>
            <li> I do prefer a more oily serum</li>
            <li> THE BEST OIL EVER!!!I have blonde damaged dyed hair</li>
            <li> gooood love love love</li>
            <li> This oil smells great and nourishes my hair really well.  </li>
            <li> My favorite way to use it is on damp hair</li>
            <li> Gives that brighter, healthy look after styling/blowdrying and even when she isn&#x27;t fixing it.</li>
            <li> , did i remind you it was also healthy for your hair.</li>
            <li> The smell could be better though.</li>
            <li> and my hair has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li> I love this and will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> I love this hair oil.  </li>
            <li> I have used countless serums and elixirs, and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> The shipping was also lighting fast and packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li> apologize I can&#x27;t write an honest review of the product, as I was excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> It works wonderful on long hair.</li>
            <li> smell is kind of sweet, but</li>
            <li> If you have dry damaged and frizzy hair, this would be the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li> I do not care for the strong smell though which I personally do not find very pleasant.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair healthy, and shinny, and semi freeze free.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and easy to brush, without making them greasy.</li>
            <li> This oil is super light and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great Product that was delivered in a earlier amount of time than predicted.</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> and this keeps my hair smooth and non greasy.  </li>
            <li> My ends damaged by heat and highlights, etc are smooth and healing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many argan oil treatments, but the Naissant is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> in a good way- natural and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> but This Elixir especially because of the Texture which is Super Silky, the Smell which is Pleasant &amp; Most of All because of How My Hair Feels &amp; Looks.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is super moisturizing and also super light weight.</li>
            <li> Smoothes out frizzy hair quickly and easily</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s so much product it still looks full!!</li>
            <li> but it works great on dry hair as well.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have been more impressed with this hair elixir than pretty much any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s previous amazing reviews and is definitely one of the best conditioning oils I have ever used!</li>
            <li> She was so right!</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s the good stuff, she feels special and actually uses it.</li>
            <li> But, if you use this product in conjunction with say a good masque you will be the overall health of your hair begin to restore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps it much quite healthy</li>
            <li> It is light, no greasy and it adds good shine to my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my daily routine a lot more easy</li>
            <li> an my hair already looks so much more healthier and alive.. doesn&#x27;t have an oily feel while applying it to the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave hair weighed down or oily.. great product</li>
            <li> I have heard amazing reviews about this product on a several Youtube videos, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have extensions as well, so this works as an amazing daily soothing treatment for them</li>
            <li> Great oil for everyday use on your hair.</li>
            <li> this stuff made my hair so soft no oily deposit ,love it Buy it</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, a little sweet, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve purchased this, I leave it in my hair right after I shower and leave it there for 30min to an hr,</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product for my fine, dry, wavy color-treated hair...</li>
            <li> It is fine and most oils weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> Better yet, I&#x27;ve noticed that in using it over time, the overall condition of my hair has improved, and it seems healthier and a bit longer.</li>
            <li> Used this oil yesterday for the first time</li>
            <li> overall, I really really love this product.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> someone else said mine smelled pretty awful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my wavy hair shiny, manageable, smooth, and touchably soft.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my ends soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous oils and this one is a favorite.</li>
            <li> Naissant Argan Oil Elixir is not only my favorite hair oil</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it is pretty pricey, but her hair looks 10x better now that she&#x27;s using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Oh boy did I over do this oil the first use</li>
            <li> My hair feels so smooth and healthy after using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using on my kids natural curly hair and it makes their curls look so soft and shiny, and I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a dry light weight oil that smells good, like coconuty and luxe, with argan oil without the grease, weighting your hair down and the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this for my dry overworked hair!</li>
            <li> (Although I&#x27;ve heard you don&#x27;t necessarily have to be blonde to use this, it&#x27;s that amazing).</li>
            <li> I received it to my door in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> It really does what the packaging says.</li>
            <li> This oil is fabulous for providing deep conditioning benefits for my hair.</li>
            <li> I just want to warn others to read their bottle carefully and make sure you get what you ordered.</li>
            <li> I do not have too much hair</li>
            <li> I have very wavy hair that I straighten</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to smooth and condition the hair.</li>
            <li> Really reccomend this product if you want to try argan oil</li>
            <li> I heard about this product via Youtube and they were telling the absolute truth:</li>
            <li> sometimes spits out too much oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s really helping.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make it limp or weighed down, so is good for fine hair as well as medium-thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product, my stands lie flat</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this seller as the shipping was fast and it was really well packaged.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely fruity scent, and a nice consistency (not too thick or oily), and it works wonders for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about hair products since my hair is quite fine, dry and damaged from over processing.</li>
            <li> But, its not bad enough to stop anyone from purchasing this.</li>
            <li> and I love how it moisturies my hair without weighting down.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Less is more, bottle lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> I have used it on damp hair before drying, and also to smooth on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Have only used once and my hair feels softer After reading all the reviews about the wonderful smell I&#x27;m starting to wonder if I got a different batch, although the smell is not bad, but definitely it is not good.</li>
            <li> I have many oils and some are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have tried .so many different products, and none of them have worked for me, but with this product i can actually feel, and see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use just a little bit after I wash my hair and it makes it feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I got this oil to replace my Kerastase Elixir, and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> and then I do my normal styling.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do find myself reapplying it throughout the day because my hair just eats this stuff right up especially after a blowout.</li>
            <li> This is a product I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> I like trying new products.</li>
            <li> It makes my long, often snarley hair look so shiney and feel super soft!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, and it makes my hair, and especially my dry ends, so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I actually LOVE how it smells, and I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells- hate most perfumes and</li>
            <li> Also the pump puts too much product out even if you try to barely squeeze it.</li>
            <li> Start small and add more if you need it.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say they do exactly the same job</li>
            <li> this is the only product I found that I can wear my hair curly without frizz and have beauitful curl without weighing my hair down I have to say I love this product and can&#x27;t live without it,</li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing all the positive reviews and I am definitely not blown away.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my fine hair limp or greasy.....</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this oil works well to maintain my frizz.</li>
            <li> Keeps my straightened hair wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is heavily highlighted and it makes it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Yet, they do not even get near to comparing to what this product has done for my hair.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to decrease my frizzy blonde hair without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I know friends that use it and love it for their thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and you only need to use a small amount on your hair since it&#x27;s pretty rich.</li>
            <li> It works very well when used with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The bottle says it&#x27;s for blonde hair particularly, but it hasn&#x27;t been bleaching my hair or doing anything it shouldn&#x27;t be doing.</li>
            <li> I naturally have very curly dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair is long, fine, blond and tends to get dry and frizzy especially in the Summer.</li>
            <li> This is a light weight oil that does heavy duty things!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll more than likely go a 2nd round.</li>
            <li> Very recommended for dry damaged color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It also helps calm my very dry hair, and tame it on the very humid temperatures of the Caribbean!</li>
            <li> a different note, do not expect this product to completely nourish over-processed hair.</li>
            <li> I am careful to not put too much on.  </li>
            <li> I recently used bleach to lighten my hair from dark brown to light blonde mixed with low-lights.</li>
            <li> I was very excited on trying this product, because I&#x27;m addicted to Josie Maran argan oil serum</li>
            <li> Most importantly it didn’t leave my hair looking oily or dirty like other oils I have used.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this it improves the texture and manageability of my hair, and seems to be shinier and tangle free, yet not weighed down or oily (like some other Argan oil products make it).</li>
            <li> Using this product makes it a lot easier to style and flat iron my hair, and the results far exceed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Like it, smells good oily a bit, but not as bad as other hair oils, asorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li> My hairs gone from dry and damaged to soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, course hair, and Naissant Argan Oil Elixir makes it smooth and  </li>
            <li> ...makes my hair soft and shiny even after a blow dry and after sleeping on it!  </li>
            <li> I put a little bit on after washing and before I blow it out and then a little bit afterwards to smooth it out</li>
            <li> It does everything good that you want in an oil and none of the bad things.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the pump isn&#x27;t completely reliable and at times I end up getting more product in one pump than i would like, but those are the only down sides.</li>
            <li> I hesitated at first to purchase this because I was afraid the oil would weigh down my fine hair, but it doesn&#x27;t do that at all.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or weigh hair down..</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted blonde hair that’s very prone to breakage and gets VERY dry, however I tend to steer clear of elixirs and serums because they usually weigh my hair down or make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> It seems to help my dry over-processed ends but seems to wash out next shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy again and recommend this to anyone with dry hair looking for shine.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll figure out the right angle to prevent it from being a messy application after a few tries.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> Sometimes, especially this winter when it&#x27;s been cold and dry, I add more after drying it.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair are soft and appear less dry.</li>
            <li> Its strange because it always gets stuck and splatters the oil everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have long colored hair.</li>
            <li> This elixir works very well on my medium thick long frizzy wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Works on damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Have also used on dry hair too when restyling.  </li>
            <li> But it also works well on dry hair-</li>
            <li> I use it pre-blow dry and also after blow-drying...</li>
            <li> This is one product that I would prefer to never live without.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way so this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a Product that I will continue to use even when I go back to dark hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from dark brown to blonde which of course comes with tons of damage.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on wet as well as dry hair and works well either way.</li>
            <li> I used it on my toweled dry hair, just on the length from my ears down and then dry it.  </li>
            <li> Look my hair is thin and was really damaged so</li>

            <li> This oil is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it clump together like other argan oils.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair but bleached it for a Balayage Ombre</li>

            <li> so I feel like I am wasting half of the amount which is being dispensed.</li>
            <li> This argan oil cost less than the one of Josie Maran and it brings twice the amount</li>

            <li> My long hair does get frizzy and tends to look dull and damaged, but this oil has helped with the frizziness and it adds a lot of shine to my hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Naissant Argan Oil was recommended to me... I did research, read the reviews... bought the product... Love it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair but bleached it for a Balayage Ombre Look my hair is thin and was really damaged so, I bought 3 Naissant Products(Pearl Shampoo, Treatment &amp; This Oil)! I Love All 3 Products but This Elixir especially because of the Texture which is Super Silky, the Smell which is Pleasant &amp; Most of All because of How My Hair Feels &amp; Looks.  This is a Product that I will continue to use even when I go back to dark hair.  I highly reccomend this seller as the shipping was fast and it was really well packaged.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love the product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The only Argan oil I have found that penetrates the hair &amp; softens without leaving it greasy. Works on damp or dry hair. Love Naissant!  (I have color treated &amp; bleached blonde hair)</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Hair feels healthier and stronger....PROTECTED!!&lt;br /&gt;For the distant travelled...I received it to my door in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful elixir, and has been remarkably good for my hair. In fact, I have been more impressed with this hair elixir than pretty much any other product I have tried. It has a lovely fruity scent, and a nice consistency (not too thick or oily), and it works wonders for dry damaged hair. I saw a great review of this from a stylist I love and decided to try it out. I&#x27;m picky about hair products since my hair is quite fine, dry and damaged from over processing. Every time I use this it improves the texture and manageability of my hair, and seems to be shinier and tangle free, yet not weighed down or oily (like some other Argan oil products make it). Better yet, I&#x27;ve noticed that in using it over time, the overall condition of my hair has improved, and it seems healthier and a bit longer. I&#x27;ll come back to this again and again -- love it!!!</li>
            <li> Used this oil yesterday for the first time and I really like it..smells amazing to</li>
            <li> Great Product that was delivered in a earlier amount of time than predicted. It works very well when used with a flat iron. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Amazing love this product</li>
            <li> This product is RIDICULOUSLY good !!  I have been using this product for about three weeks.  I am 60 with have long thick dyed brown hair and it was immediately obvious to me that my hair was &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34;.  It felt like somebody elses hair.  I have used alot of it on different occasions and there is no oily residue at all.  It just absorbs into your hair.  LOVE IT !!</li>
            <li> I have heard amazing reviews about this product on a several Youtube videos, so I decided to give it a try. As a licensed cosmetologist, I can honestly say that this product 100% lives up to it&#x27;s previous amazing reviews and is definitely one of the best conditioning oils I have ever used! I have extensions as well, so this works as an amazing daily soothing treatment for them and I even find myself taking it with me on-the-go to reapply on my bed head curls!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this oil works well to maintain my frizz. This product leaves my hair shiny, and smelling great…. A little goes a long ways!  Overall great product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It really does what the packaging says. I naturally have very curly dry hair so my ends absorb this product within minutes. So, one pump should be sufficient for very thick hair. Sometimes I do find myself reapplying it throughout the day because my hair just eats this stuff right up especially after a blowout. I however don&#x27;t mind because the smell is absolutely AMAZING. Seriously, the reviews don&#x27;t do the smell justice.&lt;br /&gt;On a different note, do not expect this product to completely nourish over-processed hair. There are no products alone on the market that can do this. But, if you use this product in conjunction with say a good masque you will be the overall health of your hair begin to restore.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of the product is the pump itself which is why I downgraded this product from 5 to 4 stars. Its strange because it always gets stuck and splatters the oil everywhere. I&#x27;m not sure if its just my bottle or just a problem with the overall design of it. But, its not bad enough to stop anyone from purchasing this. You&#x27;ll figure out the right angle to prevent it from being a messy application after a few tries.&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I really really love this product. Its good for split ends and taming frizzes. The smell is out of this world. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used for my blonde hair. (Although I&#x27;ve heard you don&#x27;t necessarily have to be blonde to use this, it&#x27;s that amazing). Every time I use it my hair gets softer and softer. Any damage I&#x27;ve done through bleaching is being repaired nicely with this amazing product. I will continue to buy again and again. In fact, I&#x27;m stocking up. The shipping was also lighting fast and packaged very nicely. I&#x27;m so happy. ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or weigh hair down.. This isn&#x27;t my favorite of their products. I was hoping for more shine. Do love their shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> LOVE the product! This is an update a couple of months later and after using it almost daily in damp hair, the results are noticeable.  My hair always gets tangled, frizzy and puffy after I shower. Since I&#x27;ve purchased this, I leave it in my hair right after I shower and leave it there for 30min to an hr, when i brush it, there are no tangles and no frizziness. I can notice a difference when it dries too, it looks healthier, shinier, smoother and smelling great! Overall I recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li> The Naissant hair oil is wonderful. Keeps my straightened hair wonderfully soft. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It is ok but not what I need after using it</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  Works great though.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny and silky but when it hits the water your hair feel stringy because I got my hair wet my hair felt stringy when I got out of the shower I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get this product again.</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast shipper and loved the product!  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many argan oil treatments, but the Naissant is my absolute favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair, and it makes my hair, and especially my dry ends, so silky smooth.  And the smell is wonderful!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I have ever used on my hair.  I have thick, dry, course hair, and Naissant Argan Oil Elixir makes it smooth and  manageable.  Using this product makes it a lot easier to style and flat iron my hair, and the results far exceed my expectations.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This oil is fabulous for providing deep conditioning benefits for my hair. I use it once every 2 weeks &amp; it has helped improve the overall condition, texture, and length of my hair. I strongly recommend this oil, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing all the positive reviews and I am definitely not blown away. It seems to help my dry over-processed ends but seems to wash out next shower and I am back to square one.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I wish I could write a spectacular review like everyone else here. However I was sent the wrong product and am not going to take my chances hoping for the right one and re order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received argan oil for blonde hair (I have red and I don&#x27;t want to mess with my color). I did have to say I question everyone raving about the wonderful smell, like someone else said mine smelled pretty awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize I can&#x27;t write an honest review of the product, as I was excited to receive it. I just want to warn others to read their bottle carefully and make sure you get what you ordered. I am not sure where this product is from, as there is very little English in small print on it, so just be careful.</li>
            <li> Great product. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my hair feel nice and smooth. It also tames any flyaways. Plus is smells great!!! I have replaced this product with my Moroccan oil</li>
            <li> This oil is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it clump together like other argan oils.  It also has a pleasant scent and tames frizz.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair product that smells divine! Found out about this Argan oil Elixer from YouTube and couldn&#x27;t wait to try! My hair is long, fine, blond and tends to get dry and frizzy especially in the Summer. This has worked great on the ends of my hair and the smell is just delicious! Doesn&#x27;t leave my fine hair limp or greasy.....a little goes a long way so this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The oil is nice. I do not care for the strong smell though which I personally do not find very pleasant. Also the pump puts too much product out even if you try to barely squeeze it. I do not have too much hair so I feel like I am wasting half of the amount which is being dispensed.</li>
            <li> This elixir works very well on my medium thick long frizzy wavy hair. It is light, no greasy and it adds good shine to my dry hair. The smell is nice, a little sweet, not too strong.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and love it.  I have very wavy hair that I straighten and this keeps my hair smooth and non greasy.  This is a product I can&#x27;t live without.  I definitely recommend this product to smooth and condition the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product ! It makes my highlighted hair soooo smoth and silky!! It also helps calm my very dry hair, and tame it on the very humid temperatures of the Caribbean! It makes my daily routine a lot more easy and I love how it moisturies my hair without weighting down. I am never going to stop using this product! I would recommend it!! Actually, I would give it 10 starts if I could !!!!!! You will not regret buying it! :)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and easy to brush, without making them greasy.</li>
            <li> In love with this oil! It does everything good that you want in an oil and none of the bad things. It makes my wavy hair shiny, manageable, smooth, and touchably soft. Will never be without it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Everything i&#x27;ve ever tried i&#x27;ve never loved or never felt like it actually did what it calmed to do! This stuff is a must have for life!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this oil while  purchasing the blonde toning shampoo and conditioner.  This was a wonderful surprise.  I add a little bit to my wet hair and blow dry or air dry and it keeps my ends soft and smooth.  Have also used on dry hair too when restyling.  This oil is super light and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is the best Naissant Argan oil for hair that I have ever used.  I have long colored hair. It is fine and most oils weigh it down.  This does not. This oil works on all hair types - I know friends that use it and love it for their thick, curly hair.  I used it on my toweled dry hair, just on the length from my ears down and then dry it.  Sometimes, especially this winter when it&#x27;s been cold and dry, I add more after drying it. It&#x27;s great at taming fly-aways and keeping the ends nice.  I am careful to not put too much on.  Start small and add more if you need it.  I will rebuy before I run out - it is a must have for my hair.  My order was mailed out quickly and packaged very nicely.  Will shop here again.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a friend recommended it to me. My long hair does get frizzy and tends to look dull and damaged, but this oil has helped with the frizziness and it adds a lot of shine to my hair. I hesitated at first to purchase this because I was afraid the oil would weigh down my fine hair, but it doesn&#x27;t do that at all. My hair feels so smooth and healthy after using this product for a few weeks now. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this for my dry overworked hair!</li>
            <li> I have very short, white hair and have always wanted shine to my hair - even when I was a brunette! This product does the job without weighing it down. This bottle will last me a loooong time but I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Yes, This is the best serum I&#x27;ve  ever used. Even my husband  commented  that my hair looks &#x27;less straw like than usual&#x27; lol.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that is hard to tame and keep under control this is the only product I found that I can wear my hair curly without frizz and have beauitful curl without weighing my hair down I have to say I love this product and can&#x27;t live without it, oh and did I mention how good this smells. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Got the product on time, smells good and does my hair justice. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was very excited on trying this product, because I&#x27;m addicted to Josie Maran argan oil serum but it really is expensive. This argan oil cost less than the one of Josie Maran and it brings twice the amount and I have to say they do exactly the same job, my hair is silky, brighter, softer and healthier and the smell is really amazing like a fruity smell. Really reccomend this product if you want to try argan oil you won&#x27;t regret it. LOVE IT:)</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve gone from dark brown to blonde which of course comes with tons of damage. My hairs gone from dry and damaged to soft and silky!</li>
            <li> Does a great job! Perfect for colored hair..</li>
            <li> I bought this product after I saw youtubers using it and raving about the product. I have thick, wavy, Asian hair that can be dry sometimes and I like trying new products. This oil smells great, does the job and you only need to use a small amount on your hair since it&#x27;s pretty rich. The bottle says it&#x27;s for blonde hair particularly, but it hasn&#x27;t been bleaching my hair or doing anything it shouldn&#x27;t be doing. Unfortunately, the pump isn&#x27;t completely reliable and at times I end up getting more product in one pump than i would like, but those are the only down sides. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again and recommend this to anyone with dry hair looking for shine. The great part is the coupon code provided by the seller, so you&#x27;re saving some money too!</li>
            <li> I have been using Naissant Argan Oil Elixir for a few weeks now and I absolutely love this product. It works wonderful on long hair. Since I use it, my hair never lose its shine and moisture. Plus it smells so good. It&#x60;s lightweight and not greasy at all, adds shine and smoothness. It has instant results and reduces frizz. If you have dry damaged and frizzy hair, this would be the perfect product for you. It definitely helps with healthier looking hair. The ends of my hair are soft and appear less dry. Definitely buying it again when I run out. I love the way my hair feel when I use Naissant Argan Oil Elixir.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I have wavy hair and it always looks frizzy even when I try to straighten it, but with this oil it keeps the frizz away.  I&#x27;ve also been using on my kids natural curly hair and it makes their curls look so soft and shiny, and I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> Love love love this...makes my hair soft and shiny even after a blow dry and after sleeping on it!  My ends damaged by heat and highlights, etc are smooth and healing.  I recommend this to anyone with hair :)</li>
            <li> Miracle in a bottle. Less is more, bottle lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> Have only used once and my hair feels softer After reading all the reviews about the wonderful smell I&#x27;m starting to wonder if I got a different batch, although the smell is not bad, but definitely it is not good.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like a million bucks!! It makes my long, often snarley hair look so shiney and feel super soft! I love that it is super moisturizing and also super light weight. I heard about this product via Youtube and they were telling the absolute truth: This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This works great and smells good, too!</li>
            <li> The best oil on the market!</li>
            <li> Great product. Smoothes out frizzy hair quickly and easily</li>
            <li> This is a light weight oil that does heavy duty things! I have used numerous oils and this one is a favorite. I have used it on damp hair before drying, and also to smooth on dry hair.  My hair is heavily highlighted and it makes it smooth and manageable. I also use this on my daughter to smooth any fly aways, and the fragrance is awesome.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and works great not too oily alrthough I do prefer a more oily serum</li>
            <li> I got this oil to replace my Kerastase Elixir, and so far I really like it. It is very light, yet moisturizing. Makes hair soft and silky. I like to use it on damp hair and then I do my normal styling. But it also works well on dry hair- doesn&#x27;t make it limp or weighed down, so is good for fine hair as well as medium-thick. The consistency is thinner than Kerastase, but that actually makes it easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is kind of sweet, but in a good way- natural and not overpowering. I actually LOVE how it smells, and I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells- hate most perfumes and products.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like in this product is the pump. It is a bit awkward- sometimes spits out too much oil.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent product for beautiful, shiny, soft hair. Doesn&#x27;t ruin the volume or bounciness of hair. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!!!! My favorite hair product!!!! My hair incredibly silky and shiny!!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! THE BEST OIL EVER!!!I have blonde damaged dyed hair this stuff made my hair so soft no oily deposit ,love it Buy it u won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!smells sooooo gooood love love love Buy it ASAP!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great!! Great oil for everyday use on your hair.</li>
            <li> This oil smells great and nourishes my hair really well.  Highly recommended.  A few drops is all you need.</li>
            <li> Omg!  I LOVE this product for my fine, dry, wavy color-treated hair...it does NOT weigh my hair done at all...I use it pre-blow dry and also after blow-drying...It&#x27;s a miracle product for me!  Can not recommend this product enough...Holy Grail!</li>
            <li> Naissant Argan Oil Elixir is not only my favorite hair oil it is my favorite hair product period! I have many oils and some are much more expensive. Yet, they do not even get near to comparing to what this product has done for my hair. I recently used bleach to lighten my hair from dark brown to light blonde mixed with low-lights. My hair was so damaged and frizzy, once the entire process was over, and nothing seemed to tame it. Finally, I purchased Nissant Argan Oil Elixir and was amazed at its ability to tame my hair. It brought shine, life, and softness back to my hair again. It smells so great! Most importantly it didn’t leave my hair looking oily or dirty like other oils I have used. My favorite way to use it is on damp hair but it works great on dry hair as well. This is one product that I would prefer to never live without.</li>
            <li> I have been using this after I take a shower I really like  how my hair feels after drying. It also helps to speed up drying the hair. It keeps it much quite healthy I noticed while blow drying.  Will purchase again! Very recommended for dry damaged color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times an my hair already looks so much more healthier and alive.. doesn&#x27;t have an oily feel while applying it to the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave hair weighed down or oily.. great product</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter&#x27;s frizzy wavy hair. Because it&#x27;s the good stuff, she feels special and actually uses it. Gives that brighter, healthy look after styling/blowdrying and even when she isn&#x27;t fixing it. Makes it easier to get a comb through all the layers. 4 stars because it is pretty pricey, but her hair looks 10x better now that she&#x27;s using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product, my stands lie flat no fly always its light weight and not greasy,  it  also smells great..</li>
            <li> Nice product got it based on a u tube review. Like it, smells good oily a bit, but not as bad as other hair oils, asorbs pretty well. And smells sooooo , wonderful, did i remind you it was also healthy for your hair. I put 4 because it did its job and its as advertised, but its not an exceptional mircale product ...so thats why. It&#x27;s not 5 stars. But i haven&#x27;t used it beyond a month so if it changes my hair into miracle hair ill lift its ratings.</li>
            <li> Oh boy did I over do this oil the first use but I think it&#x27;s really helping.  Try it out and tell us what you think.  I&#x27;ll more than likely go a 2nd round.</li>
            <li> Best Argan Elixir ever. I have tried .so many different products, and none of them have worked for me, but with this product i can actually feel, and see a difference in my hair. It keeps my hair healthy, and shinny, and semi freeze free. The smell could be better though.</li>
            <li> This elixir is amaaaaaazing!!  I started using it back in November after seeing it recommended by someone I follow on YouTube.  I have highlighted blonde hair that’s very prone to breakage and gets VERY dry, however I tend to steer clear of elixirs and serums because they usually weigh my hair down or make it look greasy.  This stuff manages to hydrate my hair and not weigh it down.  I put a little bit on after washing and before I blow it out and then a little bit afterwards to smooth it out and my hair has never looked or felt better.  I definitely plan on repurchasing once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a wonderful hair stylist for soft and manageable hair. She was so right! I use just a little bit after I wash my hair and it makes it feel so much better. I&#x27;ve used this for several weeks now and there&#x27;s so much product it still looks full!! I love this and will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smell so good and its amazing</li>
            <li> I love this ! it&#x27;s a dry light weight oil that smells good, like coconuty and luxe, with argan oil without the grease, weighting your hair down and the smell. I put it in my hair after washing it, after styling and every night before i go to bed, it gives my hair shine and helps my hairstyles last longer (hair is permed by the way). The pump is annoying, i have to be careful and make sure to cup my hand tighly because sometimes the oil the randomly shouts out, splashing things around WHY ? i need every drop of that oil !</li>
            <li> I love this hair oil.  It really does seem to decrease my frizzy blonde hair without feeling greasy.  I have used this product on wet as well as dry hair and works well either way.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair so I have to protect my hair from damage and breakage with the best products. I have used countless serums and elixirs, and this is one of the best. It makes my hair soft and silky without weighing it down. It gives it a lustrous shine and protects it from damage when I use heat styling on it. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an all-in-one product to put on their hair after they wash it and before styling.</li>
