            <li>The Bundle Monster I am delighted, all her friends and to you the reader hyped too unequivocally advise to get his pet Monster ^ _ ^</li>
            <li>and I wanted to give them a fair review before posting.</li>
            <li>i received a good variety of patterns and it worked out to about $1 per plate, compared to the $7 i paid for the konad brand ones.</li>
            <li>The designs are good.</li>
            <li>Some customers are getting good plates while others are not.</li>
            <li>I wish the etchings were deeper, though there&#x27;s a good selection.</li>
            <li>Stick with Konad if you want a good image each &amp; every time.</li>
            <li>The majority of the plates were good, but 5 of the plates didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>, it is good deal.</li>
            <li>What people are always wondering about: Is it as good as the Konad ones.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Good, but polish doesn&#x27;t always stick to my stamper when using them.</li>
            <li>i have to admit the quality of these plates are not as good as konad</li>
            <li>The images are awesome and hope more will be made with even more amazing images!</li>
            <li>Using the Konad special polish or a thicker polish will yield the best results.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs are the perfect size for my nails!  </li>
            <li>The designs are beautiful and I love the safety of the cardboard backing on each plate.</li>
            <li>Seller replies quickly and provides excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>i have purchaced i think 3 sets of bundle monster stamping plates and i&#x27;m super happy with all sets!!</li>
            <li>I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>

            <li>I&#x60;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I received my bundle monster nail art plates and I am very satisfied with it.</li>

            <li>I think the images are great,, veryyyyyyyyy cheap,,I LOVE IT,,i am glad that i  order 2 set of  this Set Kit 25pc.</li>
            <li>There is a backing on the plate so it makes it nice.</li>
            <li>but most of the ones I have have worked really good.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bundle Monster and Amazon for the great products!</li>
            <li>and I was nicely informed me that they will replace any defective plates at a one time deal.  </li>
            <li>The edges are smoother, the backing is a nice touch too.</li>
            <li>Another became a kind of stained glue:</li>
            <li>they are good for the price but some work better than others.</li>
            <li>you really have to practice to see what polish works best with each design</li>
            <li>Nice designs and protective backing.</li>
            <li>Nice nail stamps,</li>
            <li>One plate had a defect, but it wasn&#x27;t a design that I really liked anyway.  </li>
            <li>These were nice.</li>
            <li>nice plates</li>
            <li>I thought they were good quality having seem designs from them on the Internet and most people rating it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Yes, Not every design works as good BUT most of them do and</li>
            <li>The images are classics: flowers, lace, geometrics, nothing incredibly trendy.</li>
            <li>and I was very happy with their product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Adding 4 more plates to the set, plus the improvements made to full-nail images, backings and more, these are an amazing product at an amazing price!  </li>
            <li>So, even though there was this hiccup i am still happy and excited</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use these plates with their great images.</li>
            <li>It was safely packaged, good shipping time and the product arrived in perfect condition (new and sealed).</li>
            <li>Even the older set is great!  </li>
            <li>Decent buy but not the best.</li>
            <li>Overall a great nail art stamping design set at a very good price.</li>

            <li>I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone to buy it if they love konading but don&#x27;t want to pay the price.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use any of them and there are tons of lovely designs I tried.</li>
            <li>Thought all my family would love a set but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li>I love bundle monster and their customer service</li>
            <li>Check out their Facebook page for pics of creative designs.</li>
            <li>Thank you for listening to your fans :)</li>
            <li>I love these plates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definately order some more.</li>
            <li>I love these plates.</li>
            <li>But i still love the plates i have</li>
            <li>I have tried a dozen, and all are 100% ok for stamping.</li>
            <li>I purchased these plates after reading many of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I love the plates and my kids love the designs.</li>
            <li>I really love Bundle Monster.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and this is way better then</li>
            <li>I bought this set because you get a lot more plates than you would with Konad plates and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>so in love with em</li>
            <li>There are a lot of all over nail images, but they are mostly geometric designs.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for maybe some more stars or something along those lines.</li>
            <li>I love the backing that they put on them as well.</li>
            <li>The designs vary a lot and are all interesting.</li>
            <li>Many nail design plates I&#x27;ve looked at on the internet are just plate after plate of swirls and flowers.</li>
            <li>and I love that they listened to their customers.  </li>
            <li>I really do love them.</li>
            <li>The one criticism I have is that most of the all over nail designs don&#x27;t cover my thumbs.</li>
            <li>i really love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I have these plates</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great customer service</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used Konad plates, so I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re any better.</li>
            <li>I like these image plates better than the Bundle Monster 21-pack</li>
            <li>This works a lot better than using the metal scraper.  </li>
            <li>, you will love em too(and</li>
            <li>I am not associated with bm :) .)</li>
            <li>I love all the plates.</li>
            <li>We are both pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this set.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>i love BM plates.</li>
            <li>I got better and better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the konad stamping polish, wondering if it would work better than what I was trying to use.</li>
            <li>The replacement plates are stamping way better.</li>
            <li>and I heard that these were much better.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of holiday options with this set and a cute piano design.</li>
            <li>However, if you love pampering yourself and spending time (alot of time) on yourslef, do not hesitate to purchase this set by bundle monster...</li>
            <li>I think I might be investing in more colors sooner than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I have also purchased these for my nieces and they love them.</li>
            <li>, I was completely satisfied and can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li>i was hesitant on such a good deal, but the plates are great.</li>
            <li>Every plate looked great, every one we have used (even my 9yo daughter) has turned out very well.</li>
            <li>They are kind, fast, and quality people and products with more than fair pricing :)    </li>
            <li>My only wish is that they continue making more designs, cause I&#x27;m hooked and I Won&#x27;t support their Competitor !!!!    </li>
            <li>Love these plates.</li>
            <li>They work great, are good quality and a terrific bargain, to boot.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase and hoped that Bundle Monster come out with more images.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a month now and they are absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love all these stamps.</li>
            <li>I love love love this set.  </li>
            <li>I must say I like this set better then the 21pc.</li>
            <li>This set is great and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I saw these advertised on a fashion website, and they&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li>They are still cute though.</li>
            <li>I love these plates.</li>
            <li>I love this things.  </li>
            <li>probably buy more.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love all the nail tip designs in this set.</li>
            <li>, so I purchased what I thought was a better stamper.  </li>
            <li>Some were scratched but I was able to get a refund.  </li>
            <li>Will return to buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love they way my nails look.</li>
            <li>I love the improvements they have made...</li>
            <li>Thanks Bundle Monster for another great set of image plates:)</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this set.</li>
            <li>It has all sorts of interesting designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so be sure you buy those separately.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be glad you did just like I am.</li>
            <li>I am now going to try the Konaid and see if they work better.</li>
            <li>Cute designs.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>:) Lots of cute designs on these plates, but no bows.</li>
            <li>Overall, these are great!</li>
            <li>more sets to go</li>
            <li>and I will have them all.  :)</li>
            <li>Kanad plates are better but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li>These plates are MUCH better quality than series 1.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with the 1st set :)</li>
            <li>I bought the package of 21 Monster Bundle plates, a while back, and was so impressed that I had to have the package of 25!</li>
            <li>but I love it and the designs seem to transfer well (the ones I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li>i love love</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>id say they are my favorite set.</li>
            <li>My $1 plates from China make better stamps!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I have both Konad and Bundle Monster, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy any more Konad plates.</li>
            <li>Even though they&#x27;re better quality, they&#x27;re not *</li>
            <li>I love nail stamping disks.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that my nail art skills are nothing much better then being able to change colors.  </li>
            <li>The top coat I use, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Still glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>Efficacy of stamp patterns is inconsistent and most do not pick up regardless of the stamper or polish used, which</li>
            <li>I love the variety you get in these bundles.</li>
            <li>planning on buying more</li>
            <li>i love that there are so many designs</li>
            <li>The set included many plates, and had alot of interesting images.</li>
            <li>im totally falling in love with it ‚ô•</li>
            <li>Bundle monster is my favorite.</li>
            <li>i would absolutely purchace more plates from them for the great quality they are the price</li>
            <li>Ok so i bought this thinking</li>
            <li>plates are awesome, some great designs especially for the whole nail stamping.</li>
            <li>I love Bundle Monster stamping plates.</li>
            <li>but there are many options to choose from.</li>
            <li>The design will transfer better if you use stamping polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing the 21 plate set soon to get more images.</li>
            <li>The leopard wasn&#x27;t as crisp and detailed, but I decided to try another design tonight and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>and I had no problem with them not being able to transfer to the stamper.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have either set, this would be a great new start, but the first set is also great.</li>
            <li>I love them so much!!!!</li>
            <li>The new Bundle Monster plate are brilliant, very pretty and nice design.  </li>
            <li>and I love that so many came in the pkg and the price was pretty good too.</li>
            <li>You can make everything unique and your own.</li>
            <li>The images come out nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The designs are super fun and most of them stamp great.</li>
            <li>Great selection high quality</li>
            <li>Additionally, you need a special polish for them to come out with any kind of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; or vibrancy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect any company or product to be flawless all of the time, but as long as mistakes are corrected, I have no problem.   </li>
            <li>I recommend GALS plates, they stamp pretty good for me.</li>
            <li>All of the plates are still a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited!</li>
            <li>So many full nail designs!</li>
            <li>I have used mash nail stamping plates to great effect and thought I would try so,e variety and mix in some new patterns.  </li>
            <li>The images are cute and easy to use.</li>
            <li>, you can make so many combinations and they are easy to find on youtube to practice.</li>
            <li>I love their desings and ho easy</li>
            <li>Overall good product,and  good costumer service.</li>
            <li>The full nail images are bigger, the designs are interesting, and the quality and pricing are excellent.</li>
            <li>the patterns are gorgeous and fresh and there are a lot more full nail</li>
            <li>They are metal, the patterns are great (and the right size for my nails), plus the price is right.</li>
            <li>, they are such a great addition to anyone who is into nail art, or is just getting into it, also they are a huge step up from the Bundle Monster 1st series, I love those too, but these are bigger in size and fit my nails when I have acrylics, also the BM-215 is amazing on it&#x27;s own, love the snake skin!!</li>
            <li>The backing is great new feature, The covering is easy to remove, The bigger full nail design is AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nearly ALL full-nail designs, with some great nail-tip designs.</li>
            <li>WOW, these are great quality.</li>
            <li>I am also impressed with the full nail design size, much improved from the first series.   </li>
            <li>I think these will easily fit most people&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this new set of BM plates, I own the first set they have</li>
            <li>Thank you so much yet another great product I am so enjoying this right</li>
            <li>The previous collection of plates for decoration of nails was good, at a great price</li>
            <li>This is a super great deal for any one who loves nail stamping as much as I do .</li>
            <li>the images are clear and the fine detail is great.</li>
            <li>Many people were very happy that the image were much larger on this set than the first step, so I decided to buy this set.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve had them for about a month, I&#x27;m pleased to say that I still get excited every time that I use them.</li>
            <li>While I still like my first set of Bundle Monster plates, this set is so much better!</li>
            <li>I loved the new designs, the Halloween designs and the full-size images too!</li>
            <li>The plates are great, I love that the full-nail designs are larger.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived fast and in near perfect condition.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The package arrived very quickly, just a week.  </li>
            <li>That being said this system is so easy and so addicting</li>
            <li>it cleans easy.</li>
            <li>received very quickly.</li>
            <li>I own only a couple of Konad plates &amp; these are just as good -</li>
            <li>I bought the set as the price was good $ 17.99 (old one), but most of the images would not transfer.</li>
            <li>I own the first Bundle Monster plate set</li>
            <li>When I bought the first set I couldn¬¥t believe how nice the plates were and how well they worked.</li>
            <li>I can even do it with most normal polishes (something I was quite pleased to find out!).</li>
            <li>I own the first set too</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just a must have to create nice custom nail art ;)</li>
            <li>Most of them are full nail designs</li>
            <li>It is fun and easy!  </li>
            <li>Fun and easy to use!</li>
            <li>As always, BM has amazing value for a good quality product, much more affordable than other name brand stamping plates.  </li>
            <li>I love my first set of BM plates and this is wayyyy better.  </li>
            <li>I have to say my nails turned out gay</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see many options and I am pretty creative.</li>
            <li>They work just fine if you do it that way.</li>
            <li>I am well aware of their excellent service when it comes to replacements, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to even process a claim.</li>
            <li>they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>but I quickly got better.</li>
            <li>the price is super as well!</li>
            <li>i was so exited when i got them because there are so many, and shipping was quick and none of them got damaged.</li>
            <li>images are great and they come out super clear</li>
            <li>easy clean up and easy to use, just takes some practice.</li>
            <li>I will buy the first kit of these plates right now!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just hard to place them perfectly on your nail and takes some practice :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of nail-stamping.</li>
            <li>and I can say that this set is a HUGE improvement.</li>
            <li>My thumb nail must be huge cause</li>
            <li>Huge designs.</li>
            <li>Bundle monster series are terrific and offer some great images.</li>
            <li>They are 100% better and worth the price.  </li>
            <li>They are fantastic, I hope to draw another collection soon</li>
            <li>, the plates are stainless steel and come packed nicely so there are no scratches.</li>
            <li>There are so many fun designs.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;feel\\&quot; cheap; they are lighter, and don&#x27;t feel as durable as the Konad plates.   </li>
            <li>I think the plates are great for the reasons mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>and even I felt fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Overall they work great.</li>
            <li>plates seem smaller than I anticipated, but they work great.</li>
            <li>You will enjoy all the designs .And</li>
            <li>They are a fabulous addition to my manicure supplies</li>
            <li>I will have to break these out again and make sure to get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>and now I have such a great variety to choose from.  </li>
            <li>I tried a few and they work PERFECT every time!</li>
            <li>This set had a lot of Halloween art, so it fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Plates have many nice full nail designs and beautiful french tips, my favorites, also these stamps better than smaller ones.  </li>
            <li>it does take some time to learn how to do it correctly but overall the product works great</li>
            <li>Overall, these are a great investment.</li>
            <li>Even if you only use 5 designs it is a great return.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a good 2/3s of the images on these plates and so far, no issues.</li>
            <li>But overall - I&#x27;m very happy, I really like the plates.</li>
            <li>Also, the best thing, the images that cover the whole nail are now larger for those of us who have wider nails.</li>
            <li>They are very similar to Konad...expect that they are a better deal price wise.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li>it absolutely works!!!  </li>
            <li>I received them in record time, really fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>thanks a lot Bundle Monster!!!</li>
            <li>They stamp work very well!!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li>It is a very fun thing to do on a sleep over</li>
            <li>Very nice customer service, I only wish the stamper would get here now</li>
            <li>Be sure to work quickly because your polish may dry up when you&#x27;re ready to stamp it, and clean the plate after each stamp to get the best results!</li>
            <li>Each plate fits nicely into my current holder and cleanup is, as has been, very easy.    </li>
            <li>It would be great if they would make the full nail designs a lot bigger</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a great variety of images, and I especially the full nail ones.</li>
            <li>was exactly what I expected and it works great too!</li>
            <li>If you like doing nails get these, they are super easy to work with and at eighty eight cents per plate</li>
            <li>The package came very quickly and as for the images themselves, they were very pretty.</li>
            <li>I will shop more on Amazon and with Bundle Monster if you have more new product</li>
            <li>They wkork great, are easy to use and have a wide variety of designs to choose from.</li>
            <li>I love these plates so much!</li>
            <li>The etching seems deeper than the original BM kit.  </li>
            <li>This set is even better than the first.  </li>
            <li>I was totally excited about</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this product on Sept 23rd.</li>
            <li>The draws are cute and pretty.</li>
            <li>I purchased the original Bundle Monster kit [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The quality of the design engravings is better than the first set.   </li>
            <li>This is the second set that I got of these and have referred several more to purchase and myself as well as my nail tech and my daughter have all LOVED them!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>When I knew about the second set I didn¬¥t hesitate to order it immediately, and I have to admit that they are even much more original than the first ones and that their quality is quite superior because they have a background which is really resistent and nice.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to receive bundle yesterday, ..</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is one significant downside to these plates, however.</li>
            <li>I received these along with the first set for Valentine&#x27;s Day from my Husband and I truly Love them...</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these plates.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my nails all the time from all the unique designs I can use with the plates.</li>
            <li>I have the original image plate set</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so fun!  </li>
            <li>I contacted company and they promised to send me replacement for those plates, I think they are more than aware about this problem, but still selling unusable products to people.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to receive these nail stamping plates..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, and all work great.</li>
            <li>When I purchased these plates I was so excited to recieve them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never disappointed</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very hard to decide which one to use :) they all came in perfect shape</li>
            <li>You are going to love these new plates if you already own the first set.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am thrilled with this new set.</li>
            <li>Not a single design was repeated and I loved how there were themed designs like skulls and ghosts for Halloween and a gingerbread cookie and holly for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Fun designs to choose from and easy to use.</li>
            <li>With so many designs to choose from though, It hasn&#x27;t really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but I could clean it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and compared to Konad plates you do get your money&#x27;s worth given the number of plates you get for the price.</li>
            <li>The images come out nice and clear!</li>
            <li>if you dont use a special nail polish it comes out a bit lumpy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy the \\&quot;Special Polish,\\&quot; but instead tested all the polishes I had to see if they worked with the image plates &amp; showed up on the stamper.</li>
            <li>There are special nail stamping polishes you can get.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to get a rubber stamper and google alternative polishes instead of spending a ton of money on the konad special polishes.</li>
            <li>Quick dry are not that great</li>
            <li>- shipped incredibly fast  - amazing price in comparison to name brand (Konad plates)  - variety of styles and designs  - plates seem very durable, not flimsy, good quality  - large images cover a large nail bed  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these plates, they came relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>So, when I got these plates and I was super excited.</li>
            <li>The plates are easy to use and I chose them because I liked these designs better than a lot of the other sets.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot of full nail designs that fit my nails and the designs are really fun.</li>
            <li>There were no issues with the any part of the transaction and overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast and plus its FREE shipping!</li>
            <li>offer some really cool designs to work with.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Bundle Monster :)</li>
            <li>Yes, there are a lot of flowers in all plate sets, but this BM2 has so much variety and truly interesting designs.    </li>
            <li>Cool concept</li>
            <li>As described, it features mostly full nail designs.</li>
            <li>Cons  - some repeated prints  - MAJORITY of the plates consisted of full nail designs</li>
            <li>I love these for the fact that they were bigger and fit my nail better and the engravings were deeper</li>
            <li>There are some really cool designs with this set.</li>
            <li>Cool designs.</li>
            <li>I have found that on YouTube, etching deformities are quite common, contact customer service if you have any concern with the product, I hear they&#x27;re awesome   </li>
            <li>I love these plates, the images all fit my nails, and most of them come out pretty clear.</li>
            <li>they have cute designs and stamp really well</li>
            <li>I really love, I&#x27;m no try the whole images and plates,yet  </li>
            <li>i have heard such good reviews from this product...</li>
            <li>These ones are much lower quality, BUT you&#x27;re still getting way more for your money.</li>
            <li>Some of the images are very deep and really good</li>
            <li>But overall quality is good.</li>
            <li>Regular and gel nail polish don&#x27;t make good imprints.</li>
            <li>These plates are not as detailed as the more expensive Konad plates, but they are wonderful nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>Cheeky has put a curved end on full nail design to give you either option.</li>
            <li>quality is not bad.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth the grab, as it is so much cheaper than others brand!!!</li>
            <li>These are some of my favorite plates.&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive super fast.</li>
            <li>The smaller images I have tried are really nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good if you&#x27;re looking for more full nail stamps rather than little images.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried every single design, but I&#x27;ve always been successful with the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li>[...] I just got it today and tried it immediately, lots of the designs DO NOT work, but many do, if you want full nail designs I would say buy it its a decent value</li>
            <li>and the full images are only 1.5cm in length; so I have to stamp each nail twice to fill my entire nail which is a PITA trying to match up perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love these new plates!  </li>
            <li>I must say that these image plates help me out tremendously.</li>
            <li>This set is a better value than the first set altho the first set is a staple for nail art stamping.  </li>
            <li>Made of durable metal with a protective/safety backing on each disc, this collection should last for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like the plates the designs are attractive</li>
            <li>For me, Wet N&#x27; Wild nail polishes works great!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a great supplement to the real thing (especially if you already have the scraper and polishes from Konad).  </li>
            <li>I think the images are awesome, but they are not etched in deep enough.  </li>
            <li>But other then that, i do love this set better!  </li>
            <li>Extra designs are always a plus for any of the ladies looking to be more creative and stand out.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely satisfied :)</li>
            <li>QUICK,</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love the 2nd.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>a cada nova arte que vou realizar, s√£o pe√ßas com bom acabamento e de otima precis√£o, super aconselh√°vel, quem adquirir vai querer mais, estou muito satisfeita com produto.</li>
            <li>Super contente</li>
            <li>these plates are absolutley amazing they shipped fast and are so much fun to use there are so many different options on the plates and its definatley worth the money!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stamp very well, most of mines are not imprinted right at all.</li>
            <li>Best thing is that they are larger and the edges a nice an dull.</li>
            <li>The image plate sizes are also slightly bigger than in the original Bundle Monster plate set, and this comes in handy for people like me who have a wider nail beds.    </li>
            <li>As a novice with stamping plates, I have had much more success with full-nail designs than most of the individual designs I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love the new backing too.  </li>
            <li>But, really, even with a few not being that useful it is still a great set and very worth the money i paid!</li>
            <li>Having the first bundle I see the difference immediately that the full nail designs have been enlarged and widen to what can equate to a Konad full design size.</li>
            <li>Ok, so first of all I received my image plates sooo fast...</li>
            <li>is an easy way for anyone to really get involved.</li>
            <li>The plates are super easy to use, and are a wonderful value especially considering the price of other brands and how much this pack comes with!</li>
            <li>Not only do you get more choices (designs) in this bundle, IT\\&quot;s ALSO CHEAPER THAN THE KONAD PLATES!</li>
            <li>I just recently bought these plates and I love them!</li>
            <li>You get so many plates with such pretty designs, it can be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i need!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I have beenable to use all other disk designs successfully.</li>
            <li>as long as you have the right polish you can get good images.</li>
            <li>Designs look super cool, and have not had troubles with them, though I wish they had more girly designs, not flowers but other things like more hearts, fairies, lips, etc..</li>
            <li>Images are crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>normal nail polish remover is just a huge pain since I clean off the plate after every stamp.</li>
            <li>Plates are best, but at this price are not bad, but the drawings are very shallow.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised at the beauty of the designs and how well they work!!!!!</li>
            <li>This pack was a very good deal- at least the price was.</li>
            <li>An amazing selection, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>the designs are very pleasing and accurate to what is shown in the images.</li>
            <li>and they were nice enough to replace them for me</li>
            <li>They are a bit pricier, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied, but they should probably be more careful when putting the sets together.</li>
            <li>was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>the thumb!!!I can&#x27;t be happier about this set and its well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The price is definitely worth it (~$0.88 per plate vs. $6.99 on ebay.)    </li>
            <li>However, the payoff is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>They are worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that a lot of the more detailed ones will not transfer well, though some larger prints won&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled, and if Bundle Monster makes a third set, I will buy it as soon as I find out!</li>
            <li>They work just as well as the Konad plates, and they have a lot of fun designs.  </li>
            <li>I have used these for more than a month and most of my regular nail polishes work really well with them.</li>
            <li>As I was doing my nails again 2 nights ago, I discovered more images were not stamping clearly</li>
            <li>Friday so much fun</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>The shipment came in a day earlier than expected and the packaging and plates were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Lots and lots of full nail designs and higher quality</li>
            <li>would say for the price and selection you get it&#x27;s worth it to buy them.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I always work on top of an old magazine and use that to discard the scraped off polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I can finally have some fun with my own nails.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have many more sets in my wish list waiting for later when I got some extra $$ for em.</li>
            <li>So totally addicted to useing these for great designs on my nails and every time I use them I get asked about where I got my nails done when I go anywhere!!!</li>
            <li>* much better when you consider that you&#x27;re getting far fewer design choices.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless,  I like the designs and plan to have a lot of fun experimenting.  </li>
            <li>but if you have patience they are pretty cool.</li>
            <li>and it was so worth it and affordable</li>
            <li>These plates were a great value, all of the images i have used so far have been etched well enough for use.</li>
            <li>work very well, just a few of them don&#x27;t print right with light colors, but in general they are a great product and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that they aren&#x27;t really the right fit for my nails</li>
            <li>I recommend to try BM image plates before Konad, BM images are fun, unique and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love nail art and have to say that this set was a big improvement from the original set of plates.</li>
            <li>Super Fast shipping, got them in one week!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Overall, even for a \\&quot;novice\\&quot; this set a not only SUPERBLY priced, but also very very very easy to use with endless stamping possibilities.      </li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>is where you see right away if there may be an issue with a plates etching.&lt;br /&gt;Try to transfer the design in question first.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>The sent replacement plates out right away</li>
            <li>They sent replacement plates to me right the way.</li>
            <li>But it takes a lot of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the right set of plates that I wanted</li>
            <li>i had 4 defective plates and bundle monster replaced them RIGHT AWAY.</li>
            <li>, that was one of the designs I was excited about, the star on 206 won&#x27;t work but the full nail design with circles works and the heart design works fine on the same plate.</li>
            <li>Strongly out of the new version</li>
            <li>The new image plates are wonderful larger designs as well as a back covering to protect against cuts.</li>
            <li>The quality is much better than their first set and every image I have used so far has worked.</li>
            <li>Ala in all a great little set!</li>
            <li>And the size of the \\&quot;full nail stamp\\&quot; is large enought to cover all my finger&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s reasonable that I&#x27;m not going to love every single design since there are so many</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s nothing major.  :)</li>
            <li>The plates are good, the images are scored deep enough to get a good coat of polish and a proper result when stamping.</li>
            <li>Its so good to received it before Chinese New Year...</li>
            <li>and i would recommend bundle monster as i have gotten great items from them in the past.</li>
            <li>and they worked as well as the brand Konad, but the news is even better, the designs are very original, the size of the drawings allow complete nail decoration is very simple even for the pedicures and prices</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a novice at nail art and a bit of a perfectionist, which means it took me all day to get my nails right the first time I tried this.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is still a great set, they&#x27;re definitely different from Mash and Konad&#x27;s plates (although some plates are copies of Konad&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>They gave clear results, and were shipped very quickly - I would recommend them if you don&#x27;t want to pay an arm and a leg for Konad.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Nearly all the plates stamps perfectly, found 2 plates with not so good etching, therefore, unable to retain enough polish for stamping transfer.</li>
            <li>this was a gift to my cousin, and she likes it very much, using it every day to on transparent nails.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>I like the plates very much.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really get them to fit correctly on my nails (unlike Konad french tip designs which seem to have a more compact design to them), so I can&#x27;t really use 1/4 of the plates.  </li>
            <li>These large full nail designs consists of lots of geometric shapes, swirls, large flow patterns, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to buy the bundle monster first set!</li>
            <li>The designs are new and unique.</li>
            <li>Im so excited to try it out my new</li>
            <li>I had the stamped image on, a quick dry top coat on and got to work on time with pretty nails</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re using cheap $1 and $2 nail polish and they all work just fine, although I&#x27;m thinking about getting the white Konad nail polish, since ours doesn&#x27;t show as much as I&#x27;d want to.</li>
            <li>The images are spot on and crisp.</li>
            <li>In addition, this set has more designs, but still not quiet details as Konad.</li>
            <li>First tip-</li>
            <li>The images are crisp and I have no problem with any images.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to say that I like Mash&#x27;s set better in 3 different ways (which is why this set doesn&#x27;t receive 5 stars):</li>
            <li>first, Mash&#x27;s set was cheaper</li>
            <li>and since then they have added protective paper backings onto the plates and the stamping designs are a lot larger, which makes them better for use on all nail sizes.</li>
            <li>I also love that they already have the cardboard in the back</li>
            <li>If Bundle Monster came out with another multi plate pack of designs I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>There are so many different patterns and designs to choose from.</li>
            <li>First, buff the rubber of the stamper with a nail file to ensure it picks up the designs  2)</li>
            <li>why you ask...because when you apply the stamper/design, you want to be able to roll the stamper across the nail with ease preventing any gaps (again...the stamper also has a curved surface, so if not done correctly, only a portion of the design will transfer).  </li>
            <li>so you can get access to the pretty ones.  </li>
            <li>There are many different designs.</li>
            <li>Once I got the plates I was so satisfied with their quality and all the different designs included.</li>
            <li>I purchased the first set and then this set.  </li>
            <li>The full images are now bigger and fit my nails.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that there aren&#x27;t as many \\&quot;cute\\&quot; images in this set.</li>
            <li>This set is a vast improvement from the first BM plates (you can read more about my gripes about the first set).   </li>
            <li>The blue film on the plates on arrival is nice, it appears to keep the plate smooth until you unwrap it, and there is a minimum of extra packaging.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using Amazon, and I will def.</li>
            <li>This is my first stamping purchase.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I got both this and the first sets put out by BundleMonster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are many different designs.</li>
            <li>Some plates don&#x27;t work very well&#x3D; but for the amount that you are getting its worth it.</li>
            <li>This was my first stamping plate purchase.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely has a design for just about everything you need!</li>
            <li>I purchased the MASH plates recently and love them.  </li>
            <li>They have a lot of holiday designs and pretty images on these plates.</li>
            <li>Full nail designs cover pretty much the whole nail (well, not my thum).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for nail stamping!!</li>
            <li>they work very well, had no issues transfering the design to the nail!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>this is my first experience with nail stamping.  </li>
            <li>This was my first purchase from Bundle Monster and from Amazon.com too.  </li>
            <li>but overall I love the longer length.</li>
            <li>From 25 plates 8 are not working - of course all of them have images I bought this set for in first place.</li>
            <li>just remember to pull the blue plastic off before use and practice, practice, practice!!! :)</li>
            <li>Just make sure you remove plastic from the individual plaes before using....</li>
            <li>25 plates with so many different designs</li>
            <li>The use of an XL stamper, also works better to pick up the tiny details.</li>
            <li>I would most assuredly recommend these to all nail stamping enthusiasts, especially beginners.</li>
            <li>The designs are pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than buying plates individually from Konad.</li>
            <li>Waste of money for they don&#x27;t transfer good at all.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get my Bundle Monster Nail Art Stamping Plates, I did read some &#x27;not-so-good&#x27; reviews that they weren&#x27;t wide enough to fit your nails and that they weren&#x27;t deep enough to give you the perfect detailed stamp, however my experience with the Bundle Monter Stamping Plates was different.</li>
            <li>even if some are not deep enough as long as the majority work I am happy and content with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Amazing fast delivery, was much more earlier to arrive to singapore than expected time frame!</li>
            <li>wow is all i can say these are so way better than the old bm pack</li>
            <li>I bought this product expecting some good quality, but all I got were plates which weren&#x27;t deep enough.</li>
            <li>I can do tons of fun designs with them, I highly recommend them</li>
            <li>Also - be aware, due to the thin nature of the design, most colors tend to be lighter than what you&#x27;ll expect, so be sure to use your most opaque colors or buy some of the special Konad stamping</li>
            <li>I found that the plates I liked the most were not available in the smaller bundle.  </li>
            <li>People are saying that the first set of 21 don&#x27;t cover your whole nail</li>
            <li>the first set I order thank you so much</li>
            <li>thanks seller for fast shipping and keep it up!</li>
            <li>, they send me the image that was missing, very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>and I pretty much taught her how to stamp.</li>
            <li>I also bought from Amazon and after some experimenting and mess ups, I have gotten some cute nail designs!</li>
            <li>They work well thus far and have many different designs and are fun to use.</li>
            <li>The image isn&#x27;t large enough to fit some of my larger nails, but with some practice and patience, I was able to get it to work.</li>
            <li>It has nice backings,so the edges are not sharp, the blue cover</li>
            <li>Although, it the plates would be better if the whole nail images would be bigger &amp; actually fit the entire nail...</li>
            <li>Most of the images are for full nail coverage, but many have such small intricate designs &amp; you have to file your stamper with a nail file to make it grab the images.</li>
            <li>but I have to rate it a three, because most of the full nail images are not large enough to cover my full nail.</li>
            <li>They were very quick to respond and to offer me my money back or to ship another package since mine had gotten lost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The engravings feel slightly rougher than the Konad plates, but the images still transfer from stamper to nail nicely.</li>
            <li>However, for the price it&#x27;s okay seeing as one single plate through Konad is about $5-$6.</li>
            <li>The remaining 20 consisted of ALMOST all large designs.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that some of the plates have large images.</li>
            <li>My husband called me at work to tell me that they arrived and to rub it in my face that I had to wait until the end of my workday to see them, it was pure torture.</li>
            <li>(it had a large gouge on one of the designs) and I notified the seller.</li>
            <li>I really think ALL the positive reviews for this product are written by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the whole set yet, but the few plates I have had a chance to play with came out pretty nice.</li>
            <li>so glad i didn&#x27;t purchase it because the new BM satisfy all my asian motif nail art needs!</li>
            <li>B00150LT40 Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat]</li>
            <li>(IDK what they are actually called,lol) or a tiny 5x7 photo album from the dollar store :) I would buy this again!</li>
            <li>I usually end up doing my nails one a week or more because they are so fun to do!</li>
            <li>there are no sharp edges, the image is nice and crisp, and although ive only used two of the plates so far, i have not experianced any issues.</li>
            <li>Have to work fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the designs in this collection</li>
            <li>Two you need to act fast or it will peal off.</li>
            <li>I really want to get this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>they cover my whole nail even my thumb.  </li>
            <li>They transfer very well &amp; saves me lots of time.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about how much polish or at what angle to scrape.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast</li>
            <li>so skip those unless you can stamp extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks for listening to us BM</li>
            <li>I really thought I would have some learning time to get this to work</li>
            <li>I really like this stamping plates.</li>

            <li>These plates shipped really fast</li>
            <li>I tried to straighten them out as much as I can, but the plates still appear warped.</li>
            <li>It really scratches the plates up &amp; over time</li>
            <li>As always, They stamp very well.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>BARGAIN PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING THANKS.  </li>
            <li>then spend this much time on my nails.</li>
            <li>The product is really as I imagined it</li>
            <li>I really like these plates.</li>
            <li>With this set, there is so much to choose from</li>
            <li>I really like these plates.</li>
            <li>They all stamp really well even with some reguler polishes.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these plates and they all stamped really well expect for maybe 3 plates.</li>
            <li>They work really well with the Konad nail polish.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Designs were all etched very well.</li>
            <li>I like the designs on the plates and almost all the plates work very well.  </li>
            <li>at all... VERY disapointed.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I wish these were a tiny bit longer to fit my thumb</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>, I find myself changing polish twice as much as I used to.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fast)</li>
            <li>They replaced all 5 plates with fast shipping and no cost to me.</li>
            <li>but I look very forward to using them.</li>
            <li>&quot; haha.</li>
            <li>As mention, i have not try any of my plates yet cant comment much about the product but just looking at all my plates</li>
            <li>I can enjoy different style</li>
            <li>Thanks LP speed.</li>
            <li>Too much time to receive it, was for Papa Noel or Reyes magos</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t really figure out how to line it up on my fingers.</li>
            <li>Own about 50 or so varnishes ranging from Wet n Wild to Essie and Sally Hanson.</li>
            <li>I noticed there&#x27;s a tendency for the full nail designs to work better than the small ones that I would apply 2 or 3 times on one nail.</li>
            <li>Complete waste of money, time and ruined what would&#x27;ve been a perfectly good manicure.</li>
            <li>I particularly like this collection because it includes mostly full-nail designs instead of a smattering of single images.&lt;br</li>
            <li>when u scrap it it goes right on it its definitely worth paying the extra $0.99.</li>
            <li>They got here pretty quickly, but the stamps only work on about have the plates.</li>
            <li>I like these stamps, but when I first purchased them I was new to stamping</li>
            <li>Since I live overseas, it didn&#x27;t seem worth it to return and get a new one.  </li>
            <li>Also, I found myself using my thumbnails a lot to correct mistakes &amp; using them the most when removing polish from other fingers</li>
            <li>other than that, love the designs</li>
            <li>They have some unique images which I definitely</li>
            <li>so I did do a different design on each nail and also had a lot of fun playing around with each design!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it was due to shipping and its on the side not on a design</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a lot to choose from &amp; the new batch is better than the old - the images are a lot bigger</li>
            <li>My finers are not tiny, and I was very disapointed that the images still did not cover my full nail.</li>
            <li>seriously, just as good as the Konad plates.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have little nieces that enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who bought another set of plates and the images weren&#x27;t as large, so its harder for her to get a whole design to fit on her nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The designs are a lot more modern and prettier than the previous set.  </li>
            <li>, I would recommend these plates to anyone who likes to have pretty nails but doesn&#x27;t want to spend the money to have them professionally done.</li>
            <li>NOTE: if you are using this kit with your own natural nails, be sure to press firmly and roll the stamper from one side to the other.</li>
            <li>full size images are bigger to suit</li>
            <li>I had is that some of the full nail images did not cover my thumb or middle finger.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re only worth the extra price if you want a light color.  </li>
            <li>There are so many designs to choose from, the possibilities are endless!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait for Monster Bundle to come out with new designs!</li>
            <li>so I could use my new plates!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so easy to use and the manicure possibilities are endless, really.</li>
            <li>As noted in other reviews some designs are not etched deep enough but all in all we are happy with this set.</li>
            <li>A whole lot new images for everyone who likes stamping.</li>
            <li>I emailed them and told them which plates wouldn&#x27;t stamp very well because the etching wasn&#x27;t deep enough and they sent over the 3 new plates free of charge!</li>
            <li>However, I have gone through probably about half my stack of plates testing each design, and MANY of my designs will not transfer onto my Konad stamper.</li>
            <li>They are easy to work with and have a wide range of designs.  </li>
            <li>Always use a rolling motion and steady even pressure to pick up and to transfer the stamp.</li>
            <li>Many of the images just don&#x27;t transfer which is annoying because the image selection is great.  </li>
            <li>Most of the designs in this series are full-nail and tip designs, rather than the small designs on the first series.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I am just lucky or what, but all of mine were fine.</li>
            <li>Most of the designs were not etched deep enough to pick up the polish.  </li>
            <li>None of them are deep enough to hold the nail polish to be able to transfer them to the nails.</li>
            <li>but in this case it works really well with the stamping polish, when some of the reviews said putting on their top coat took off their stamp job, Seche Vite killed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>These have cute designs but the etching isn&#x27;t deep enough so the print doesn&#x27;t show up well on nails.</li>
            <li>The size of the designs is now big enough for normal sized nails :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The designs in this set are gorgeous, the full nail images are much bigger--actually a bit big for my nails--and the backing does make them less sharp.  </li>
            <li>The plates also have a backing on them which is nice since several of my other sets dont.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and my set was complete.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I just had to</li>
            <li>I purchased the Konad double ended stamper and attempted to use it without any success with transferring the designs to the nail.</li>
            <li>However they are so fun to play around with and create different manicures.</li>
            <li>All images are really pretty and precise, only one has a minor flaw in it.</li>
            <li>Overall,  the purchase is worth it.</li>
            <li>I purchased these because I am new to nail stamping and the 25pc kit offered me a wide variety of designs to try out for a much more reasonable price than buying the same amount from Konad.</li>
            <li>The plates are better than the first series because they are laminated on the back, so less change to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty low and it got to me in less than a week &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Hmm ok but almost impossible to do on your own.</li>
            <li>The full nail images covered adequately, although I do have small hands.  </li>
            <li>] I love for a million reasons including the quickest drying and longest lasting I have ever used (pinky is dry by the time you get to your thumb-</li>
            <li>They responded the same day and stated that they will send a replacement plate right away.</li>
            <li>The second and third plates used worked fine.  </li>
            <li>The full nail designs are bigger this time around, so they actually cover your whole nail.  </li>
            <li>There are so many designs that I could have something different on my nails every single day!</li>
            <li>I also had a problem with one of the plates and they shipped a new one to me no questions asked.  </li>
            <li>When I made this purchase I was new to this type of nail art.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what new nail plates they offer.</li>
            <li>When I heard about this new Bundle Monster set</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would buy again if they release a new set of images.</li>
            <li>I recommend this purchase to new users and professionals as well.</li>
            <li>When I saw these new and improved Bundle Monster plates I had to have them too.  </li>
            <li>now i can&#x27;t wait to get the new set..</li>
            <li>For the price, though, I can definitely live with that.</li>
            <li>The stamper has a curved surface and so do your natural nails, so pressing straight down without rolling will not allow for a smooth transfer.  </li>
            <li>It takes a couple of tries for the image to come out clean, and it takes a lot of patience.</li>
            <li>so far I can&#x27;t get a decent transfer off one.  </li>
            <li>Also, you have to be quick with the process or the nail polish will dry in the plate or on the stamper, and will not go on  to the nail.</li>
            <li>I could live without all the tip only designs, My nails just aren&#x27;t long enough to get good use out of them, but the wide variety on all the other plates more than makes up for that.</li>
            <li>I gave this item three stars because I feel like the images could be a little larger so that people with larger nail sizes are able to get full image designs on all fingers &amp; thumbs.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave this a 4 star rating was that I was so excited when I received this new Bundle Monster image plate set, but as I was counting and looking through them, I realized I have two BM-204 image plates and no BM-212 image plate; in which, my excitement suddenly turned into disappointment because the BM-212 image plate was the one that had the peacock prints, and that was the image plate that I was MOST excited for.</li>
            <li>The image etchings transfer very clearly with Konad nail polish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one and they all stamp extremely well...!!! :)</li>
            <li>While you get 25 plates and many designs; several of them did not work, because they were not etched deep enough.  </li>
            <li>I have many other sets: Red Angel, Shany, Cheeky and I</li>
            <li>MUST say this one far surpasses them all!  </li>
            <li>I just recently started getting interested in nail art/stamping.  </li>
            <li>they work well and seem to be exactly the same besides the plate numbers!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these over the first set.  </li>
            <li>I was not able to use many of the plates.  </li>
            <li>What are the odds that the first plate I chose out of 25 was the only defective one in the set.</li>
            <li>even though that are bigger than the first set..  </li>
            <li>Although I think my set would be more suited for her, she lives smaller individual stamps whereas I would rather have larger nail stamps and tips (this set).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember how many years it&#x27;s been since I ordered these, but with all the other plates I have I keep going back to them.  </li>
            <li>And expected it will arrived after 17th Jan. I was received the items on 11th Jan which earlier than what I expected and items are in good conditions.</li>
            <li>paper backing makes the plates less sharp, the plastic is easier to remove from the front, and the all over nail designs are larger and fit my nails better.</li>
            <li>Shipping was relatively quick, within the expected period.</li>
            <li>I recomend using special stamping polishes for the plates, but you can experiment with other polishes, to see what works for you.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use the french tips yet but gonna try as soon as my nails are long enough.  </li>
            <li>And, with 25 plates full of ideas, the possibilities are nearly endless with these.  </li>
            <li>Only black polish seems to stamp ok.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because I won&#x27;t use all the designs simply because of artistic preference.</li>
            <li>You get a whole lot of different designs, from full nail designs, individual ones, to fancy french tip designs.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money through Konad when these work perfectly fine just like Konad.</li>
            <li>Love the images but just know that some on them are a little large in the way that when you scrap the polish off the image gets sparse in some spots but it is not real noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I thought they were a little pricy, but that may just be because Im cheap.</li>
            <li>The designs are larger than the first set, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>second, Mash&#x27;s plates were packaged individually, whereas BM&#x27;s plates came in a single plastic wrap; third, 80% of the plates are all full nail stamps, and I would have preferred more nail tip as well as single image stamps.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so disappointing because the designs are great.</li>
            <li>The images are clear &amp; I didn&#x27;t even use that so called \\&quot;SPECIAL\\&quot; polish from.....</li>
            <li>Figures clearly transferred to the nail.</li>
            <li>You will need to apply a clear coat over your nails when you&#x27;re finished.  </li>
            <li>I really like the seasonal designs, especially for Halloween/Samhain.</li>
            <li>They have all transferred well so far.</li>
            <li>and I know I&#x27;m really gonna&#x27; take my nail art to the next level!</li>
            <li>As always BM plates transfer really well, there isn&#x27;t an image that I used that has problem transferring yet and for BM1 theres only 1 image that didn&#x27;t transfer for me.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money until they change the quality of their plates.</li>
            <li>I realized that I had simply been scraping too much polish off.</li>
            <li>To avoid this I suggest using a used gift card or an old credit card.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am really statify with the purchase.</li>
            <li>and it works very well and was sent on time and even earlier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality product that works with every polish I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of the designs already and they stamped quite well, although it really does depend on the polish you use.  </li>
            <li>Bought a while ago and have used frequently.  </li>
            <li>so if you have wider nails you&#x27;ll also have to stamp each nail twice for complete coverage.</li>
            <li>I first came in contact with stamping plate a few months ago, and I must say, I was hooked from the moment I first laid eyes on them.</li>
            <li>I convinced my fiance to buy me a few sets for Christmas (finally!), and I must say, I am still deeply in love with stamping.</li>
            <li>The first set let me down when I realized that they were not big enough to fit on my nail.</li>
            <li>the Konad has a little more detail and complicated designs, but it&#x27;s not worth being picky over since the bundle monster price is so great.</li>
            <li>The quality of these plates is better than expected: all of them have backing, and the borders are not too sharp.  </li>
            <li>The full nail images are large enough for my index finger, but not large enough for my thumb.</li>
            <li>The blue film definitely helps, unlike the clear one on the first series.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast from Hawaii all the way to me in Florida was only a few days.</li>
            <li>NO HIDDEN</li>
            <li>The plates can take a little bit of practice to master accuracy in placement (especially with the tips), but it&#x27;s definitely worth it, and so much cheaper than going to a salon, for those of us who can&#x27;t afford to have our nails done professionally.  </li>
            <li>The only thing i have a little problem with is some of the images don&#x27;t always like to lift onto the stamp easily to place it on my finger.</li>
            <li>Earlier I was thinking that I will buy the new design plates, but now after trying the old ones I don&#x27;t think I will.</li>
            <li>full images are small if you have deep nail beds, long nails, or bigger nails.&lt;br /&gt;There are too many French tip designs.  </li>
            <li>There are now backings on each plate, so no sharp edges!</li>
            <li>Quality has majorly improved compared to the 2010 Bundle Monster set!</li>
            <li>It was such a huge disappointment not being able to use most/many of the designs.</li>
            <li>You must roughly file the stamper first</li>
            <li>With just a little bit of practice,  I did a perfect french manicure using BM 310 as a delicate netting and toped it with Konad M19 solid white french tips.  </li>
            <li>These are fun (and sometimes meditative) and the combinations are endless!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I think the images aren&#x27;t imprinted deep enough because I often can&#x27;t pick certain images up with my stamper.</li>
            <li>However the one MAJOR flaw is that the full nail images are way too narrow.</li>
            <li>The plastic film was easy to remove and the paper backing on these new plates make them less sharp and easier to handle.</li>
            <li>But because a few were not as sharp as i would have liked I only gave this set 4 stars.</li>
            <li>you will make mistakes especially if you are new to nail stamping like myself.  </li>
            <li>I live in California, so the only thing I would say I don&#x27;t like about it where it&#x27;s being shipped from.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to their next new set, I&#x27;ll probably get those too.</li>
            <li>i hope they come out with new designs soon because i will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li>The only thing is i got a double plate, so I really got 24 plates instead of 25.</li>
            <li>I have long nails beds and most plates are too small.</li>
            <li>All the images stamp well even using inexpensive wet n wild or Sally Hanson quick dry polish.  </li>
            <li>I emailed them and the missing plate was replaced quickly.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>The first plate I used did not work properly as if the grooves weren&#x27;t deep enough.  </li>
            <li>Even conad much inferior to them, many small figures conad still misfire and not fully translated.</li>
            <li>The full nail designs in this set are larger than before which is a big improvement especially if you have long nails.  </li>
            <li>There was a duplicate of one plate, and one plate missing (like many other reviews have said).</li>
            <li>I would purchase this product again if bundle monster would make the full nail image plates a little larger.</li>
            <li>I am starting my journey into nail stamping and have ordered BM 2011 and 2012 collection based on such a high number of reviews.  </li>
            <li>, they also put the paper backing on them which makes them less sharp, and made the full nail designs bigger so they cover the whole nail</li>
            <li>The images are clear, only 2 or 3 in all 25 plates were defective.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to send the old plates back either.  </li>
            <li>that the image plate BM-201 was not really centered so the image got kinda cut off over all its really good...5 stars from me</li>
            <li>The only nail I can completely cover with an image is my pinkie nail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the actual plate review:&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>BM has definitely listened to their customers, because they have considerably improved the image plates.</li>
            <li>so I have to redo them several times to get them to show up completely.</li>
            <li>Seller offers low cost shipping.</li>
            <li>The more intricate designs which feature thin lines are somewhat difficult to work with, but persistence is key - just glance at your design before you stamp it to make sure the whole thing is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Bundle Monster Plates are not Perfect some of them had flaws, but they work really nice.  </li>
            <li>Too small (my 4 year is about the biggest to be able to use the full nail designs) and the others were shaved too thin and won&#x27;t stamp the image on the nail.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>I love the designs, but the stamps are not nearly deep enough; hardly any of the images fully transfer, regardless of the polish I use, how clean the stamper and plates are, how quickly or slowly I work, etc.</li>
            <li>This new set has some big improvement since the last set.</li>
            <li>The difference between the two is these new plates are all different designs and each design is allot bigger in size.</li>
            <li>Not only the new images ROCK but the plates themselves are bigger, safer and the paper/plastic that comes with it is also easier to remove.</li>
            <li>All the plates stamped very clearly, they were all etched deep enough!</li>
            <li>When I received the order it was missing a plate, but after notifying Bundle Monster, they sent that plate right away.</li>
            <li>They sent me the ones I was missing right away.</li>
            <li>Previously, I had purchased the first set of plates that Bundle monster sells</li>
            <li>I work fast, use Konad polishes and other polishes.</li>
            <li>What I mean by \\&quot;complete set\\&quot; is, when I received my product I only got 24 plates not the full 25 but not to worry because when I notified Bundle Monster through Amazon, and immediately got a reply.</li>
            <li>At first I got frustrated with the designs that didn&#x27;t come out clear, but there are more good designs than the bad ones.  </li>
            <li>It can be a pretty messy project, even for this 29-year-old.  </li>
            <li>They look really pretty on short nails, I was a little worried about that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the imprint isn&#x27;t deep enough, but I use the same technique every time and there are just a few that don&#x27;t come out looking right.</li>
            <li>These full nail designs are larger than the other set, but still they are not large enough to cover the nail of my thumb or middle finger in only one pass.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use a few of the designs, but not many.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a little skeptical to buy, but now I LOVE stamping my nails.</li>
            <li>If you have petite hands, you will have the use of the entire collection and it is of high quality as other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li>My only complaint (thus 3 stars) is that the images from 2011 collection for the full nail are not big enough.  </li>
            <li>Dark colors work fantastic, BUT when using bright colors like yellow, orange and green, use dark yellow, dark orange and dark green to ensure the color shows up well against the desired background.  </li>
            <li>Once the design has been transferred, apply a clear top coat to the artificial nail tip and let dry (the clear coat will prevent the design from smudging when applyingthe acrylic to your nails.  </li>
            <li>Wild Wild Shine nail polish in silver metalic, black creme, and french white creme over my existing Shellac manicure.  </li>
            <li>I love these plates, except for a few, which was hard to get images onto stamp.</li>
            <li>Not good using regular polish, need special stamping polish</li>
            <li>For $21, it&#x27;s a good price, you&#x27;ll get use to the designs that come out bad, just ignore using them.</li>

            <li> The quality is excellent, and it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> The Bundle Monster I am delighted, all her friends and to you the reader hyped too unequivocally advise to get his pet Monster ^ _ ^</li>
            <li> and I wanted to give them a fair review before posting.</li>
            <li> i received a good variety of patterns and it worked out to about $1 per plate, compared to the $7 i paid for the konad brand ones.</li>
            <li> The designs are good.</li>
            <li> Some customers are getting good plates while others are not.</li>
            <li> I wish the etchings were deeper, though there&#x27;s a good selection.</li>
            <li> Stick with Konad if you want a good image each &amp; every time.</li>
            <li> The majority of the plates were good, but 5 of the plates didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> , it is good deal.</li>
            <li> What people are always wondering about: Is it as good as the Konad ones.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Good, but polish doesn&#x27;t always stick to my stamper when using them.</li>
            <li> i have to admit the quality of these plates are not as good as konad</li>
            <li> The images are awesome and hope more will be made with even more amazing images!</li>
            <li> Using the Konad special polish or a thicker polish will yield the best results.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs are the perfect size for my nails!  </li>
            <li> The designs are beautiful and I love the safety of the cardboard backing on each plate.</li>
            <li> Seller replies quickly and provides excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li> i have purchaced i think 3 sets of bundle monster stamping plates and i&#x27;m super happy with all sets!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>

            <li> I received my bundle monster nail art plates and I am very satisfied with it.</li>

            <li> already recommended to co-workers and some of them ordered their own sets.</li>
            <li> I loved it, are beautiful and work very well!</li>
            <li> Oh, &amp; one of my plates was kind of defective</li>
            <li> I used a gift card to buy it which was nice, and it was a lot cheaper than konad.</li>
            <li> Awesome, fast customer service.     </li>
            <li> I liked the Plates.</li>
            <li> tip:&lt;br /&gt;Before I tried any of the plates from any of the three brands I own...</li>
            <li> The packaging was also nicely done.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased them and most of the reviews are really good</li>
            <li> these are really nice for the price.</li>
            <li> I also have Mash plates and these are just as nice as they are.</li>
            <li> if I liked them I was going to buy the 21 piece set</li>
            <li> I think the images are great,, veryyyyyyyyy cheap,,I LOVE IT,,i am glad that i  order 2 set of  this Set Kit 25pc.</li>
            <li> There is a backing on the plate so it makes it nice.</li>
            <li> but most of the ones I have have worked really good.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bundle Monster and Amazon for the great products!</li>
            <li> and I was nicely informed me that they will replace any defective plates at a one time deal.  </li>
            <li> The edges are smoother, the backing is a nice touch too.</li>
            <li> Another became a kind of stained glue:</li>
            <li> they are good for the price but some work better than others.</li>
            <li> you really have to practice to see what polish works best with each design</li>
            <li> Nice designs and protective backing.</li>
            <li> Nice nail stamps,</li>
            <li> One plate had a defect, but it wasn&#x27;t a design that I really liked anyway.  </li>
            <li> These were nice.</li>
            <li> nice plates</li>
            <li> I thought they were good quality having seem designs from them on the Internet and most people rating it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Yes, Not every design works as good BUT most of them do and</li>
            <li> The images are classics: flowers, lace, geometrics, nothing incredibly trendy.</li>
            <li> and I was very happy with their product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Adding 4 more plates to the set, plus the improvements made to full-nail images, backings and more, these are an amazing product at an amazing price!  </li>
            <li> So, even though there was this hiccup i am still happy and excited</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use these plates with their great images.</li>
            <li> It was safely packaged, good shipping time and the product arrived in perfect condition (new and sealed).</li>
            <li> Even the older set is great!  </li>
            <li> Decent buy but not the best.</li>
            <li> Overall a great nail art stamping design set at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Practice makes perfect, so I&#x27;ll be trying a new design this week.</li>

            <li> But that&#x27;s fine with me because there are 25 plates full of images, that are so beautiful by the way.</li>
            <li> The images are wonderful, and they come out clean and crisp when stamped on the nail.  </li>
            <li> good product, good seller, fast shipment to France.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>

            <li> 8)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these plates.</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone to buy it if they love konading but don&#x27;t want to pay the price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use any of them and there are tons of lovely designs I tried.</li>
            <li> Thought all my family would love a set but won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I love bundle monster and their customer service</li>
            <li> Check out their Facebook page for pics of creative designs.</li>
            <li> Thank you for listening to your fans :)</li>
            <li> I love these plates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definately order some more.</li>
            <li> I love these plates.</li>
            <li> But i still love the plates i have</li>
            <li> I have tried a dozen, and all are 100% ok for stamping.</li>
            <li> I purchased these plates after reading many of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I love the plates and my kids love the designs.</li>
            <li> I really love Bundle Monster.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and this is way better then</li>
            <li> I bought this set because you get a lot more plates than you would with Konad plates and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> so in love with em</li>
            <li> There are a lot of all over nail images, but they are mostly geometric designs.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for maybe some more stars or something along those lines.</li>
            <li> I love the backing that they put on them as well.</li>
            <li> The designs vary a lot and are all interesting.</li>
            <li> Many nail design plates I&#x27;ve looked at on the internet are just plate after plate of swirls and flowers.</li>
            <li> and I love that they listened to their customers.  </li>
            <li> I really do love them.</li>
            <li> The one criticism I have is that most of the all over nail designs don&#x27;t cover my thumbs.</li>
            <li> i really love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I have these plates</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great customer service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Konad plates, so I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re any better.</li>
            <li> I like these image plates better than the Bundle Monster 21-pack</li>
            <li> This works a lot better than using the metal scraper.  </li>
            <li> , you will love em too(and</li>
            <li> I am not associated with bm :) .)</li>
            <li> I love all the plates.</li>
            <li> We are both pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this set.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> i love BM plates.</li>
            <li> I got better and better.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the konad stamping polish, wondering if it would work better than what I was trying to use.</li>
            <li> The replacement plates are stamping way better.</li>
            <li> and I heard that these were much better.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of holiday options with this set and a cute piano design.</li>
            <li> However, if you love pampering yourself and spending time (alot of time) on yourslef, do not hesitate to purchase this set by bundle monster...</li>
            <li> I think I might be investing in more colors sooner than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I have also purchased these for my nieces and they love them.</li>
            <li> , I was completely satisfied and can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li> i was hesitant on such a good deal, but the plates are great.</li>
            <li> Every plate looked great, every one we have used (even my 9yo daughter) has turned out very well.</li>
            <li> They are kind, fast, and quality people and products with more than fair pricing :)    </li>
            <li> My only wish is that they continue making more designs, cause I&#x27;m hooked and I Won&#x27;t support their Competitor !!!!    </li>
            <li> Love these plates.</li>
            <li> They work great, are good quality and a terrific bargain, to boot.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase and hoped that Bundle Monster come out with more images.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a month now and they are absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love all these stamps.</li>
            <li> I love love love this set.  </li>
            <li> I must say I like this set better then the 21pc.</li>
            <li> This set is great and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I saw these advertised on a fashion website, and they&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li> They are still cute though.</li>
            <li> I love these plates.</li>
            <li> I love this things.  </li>
            <li> probably buy more.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love all the nail tip designs in this set.</li>
            <li> , so I purchased what I thought was a better stamper.  </li>
            <li> Some were scratched but I was able to get a refund.  </li>
            <li> Will return to buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love they way my nails look.</li>
            <li> I love the improvements they have made...</li>
            <li> Thanks Bundle Monster for another great set of image plates:)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this set.</li>
            <li> It has all sorts of interesting designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so be sure you buy those separately.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be glad you did just like I am.</li>
            <li> I am now going to try the Konaid and see if they work better.</li>
            <li> Cute designs.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> :) Lots of cute designs on these plates, but no bows.</li>
            <li> Overall, these are great!</li>
            <li> more sets to go</li>
            <li> and I will have them all.  :)</li>
            <li> Kanad plates are better but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li> These plates are MUCH better quality than series 1.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the 1st set :)</li>
            <li> I bought the package of 21 Monster Bundle plates, a while back, and was so impressed that I had to have the package of 25!</li>
            <li> but I love it and the designs seem to transfer well (the ones I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li> i love love</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> id say they are my favorite set.</li>
            <li> My $1 plates from China make better stamps!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I have both Konad and Bundle Monster, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy any more Konad plates.</li>
            <li> Even though they&#x27;re better quality, they&#x27;re not *</li>
            <li> I love nail stamping disks.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that my nail art skills are nothing much better then being able to change colors.  </li>
            <li> The top coat I use, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Still glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> Efficacy of stamp patterns is inconsistent and most do not pick up regardless of the stamper or polish used, which</li>
            <li> I love the variety you get in these bundles.</li>
            <li> planning on buying more</li>
            <li> i love that there are so many designs</li>
            <li> The set included many plates, and had alot of interesting images.</li>
            <li> im totally falling in love with it ‚ô•</li>
            <li> Bundle monster is my favorite.</li>
            <li> i would absolutely purchace more plates from them for the great quality they are the price</li>
            <li> Ok so i bought this thinking</li>
            <li> plates are awesome, some great designs especially for the whole nail stamping.</li>
            <li> I love Bundle Monster stamping plates.</li>
            <li> but there are many options to choose from.</li>
            <li> The design will transfer better if you use stamping polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing the 21 plate set soon to get more images.</li>
            <li> The leopard wasn&#x27;t as crisp and detailed, but I decided to try another design tonight and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> and I had no problem with them not being able to transfer to the stamper.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have either set, this would be a great new start, but the first set is also great.</li>
            <li> I love them so much!!!!</li>
            <li> The new Bundle Monster plate are brilliant, very pretty and nice design.  </li>
            <li> and I love that so many came in the pkg and the price was pretty good too.</li>
            <li> You can make everything unique and your own.</li>
            <li> The images come out nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The designs are super fun and most of them stamp great.</li>
            <li> Great selection high quality</li>
            <li> Additionally, you need a special polish for them to come out with any kind of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; or vibrancy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect any company or product to be flawless all of the time, but as long as mistakes are corrected, I have no problem.   </li>
            <li> I recommend GALS plates, they stamp pretty good for me.</li>
            <li> All of the plates are still a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited!</li>
            <li> So many full nail designs!</li>
            <li> I have used mash nail stamping plates to great effect and thought I would try so,e variety and mix in some new patterns.  </li>
            <li> The images are cute and easy to use.</li>
            <li> , you can make so many combinations and they are easy to find on youtube to practice.</li>
            <li> I love their desings and ho easy</li>
            <li> Overall good product,and  good costumer service.</li>
            <li> The full nail images are bigger, the designs are interesting, and the quality and pricing are excellent.</li>
            <li> the patterns are gorgeous and fresh and there are a lot more full nail</li>
            <li> They are metal, the patterns are great (and the right size for my nails), plus the price is right.</li>
            <li> , they are such a great addition to anyone who is into nail art, or is just getting into it, also they are a huge step up from the Bundle Monster 1st series, I love those too, but these are bigger in size and fit my nails when I have acrylics, also the BM-215 is amazing on it&#x27;s own, love the snake skin!!</li>
            <li> The backing is great new feature, The covering is easy to remove, The bigger full nail design is AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly ALL full-nail designs, with some great nail-tip designs.</li>
            <li> WOW, these are great quality.</li>
            <li> I am also impressed with the full nail design size, much improved from the first series.   </li>
            <li> I think these will easily fit most people&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this new set of BM plates, I own the first set they have</li>
            <li> Thank you so much yet another great product I am so enjoying this right</li>
            <li> The previous collection of plates for decoration of nails was good, at a great price</li>
            <li> This is a super great deal for any one who loves nail stamping as much as I do .</li>
            <li> the images are clear and the fine detail is great.</li>
            <li> Many people were very happy that the image were much larger on this set than the first step, so I decided to buy this set.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve had them for about a month, I&#x27;m pleased to say that I still get excited every time that I use them.</li>
            <li> While I still like my first set of Bundle Monster plates, this set is so much better!</li>
            <li> I loved the new designs, the Halloween designs and the full-size images too!</li>
            <li> The plates are great, I love that the full-nail designs are larger.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived fast and in near perfect condition.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The package arrived very quickly, just a week.  </li>
            <li> That being said this system is so easy and so addicting</li>
            <li> it cleans easy.</li>
            <li> received very quickly.</li>
            <li> I own only a couple of Konad plates &amp; these are just as good -</li>
            <li> I bought the set as the price was good $ 17.99 (old one), but most of the images would not transfer.</li>
            <li> I own the first Bundle Monster plate set</li>
            <li> When I bought the first set I couldn¬¥t believe how nice the plates were and how well they worked.</li>
            <li> I can even do it with most normal polishes (something I was quite pleased to find out!).</li>
            <li> I own the first set too</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just a must have to create nice custom nail art ;)</li>
            <li> Most of them are full nail designs</li>
            <li> It is fun and easy!  </li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use!</li>
            <li> As always, BM has amazing value for a good quality product, much more affordable than other name brand stamping plates.  </li>
            <li> I love my first set of BM plates and this is wayyyy better.  </li>
            <li> I have to say my nails turned out gay</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see many options and I am pretty creative.</li>
            <li> They work just fine if you do it that way.</li>
            <li> I am well aware of their excellent service when it comes to replacements, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to even process a claim.</li>
            <li> they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> but I quickly got better.</li>
            <li> the price is super as well!</li>
            <li> i was so exited when i got them because there are so many, and shipping was quick and none of them got damaged.</li>
            <li> images are great and they come out super clear</li>
            <li> easy clean up and easy to use, just takes some practice.</li>
            <li> I will buy the first kit of these plates right now!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just hard to place them perfectly on your nail and takes some practice :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of nail-stamping.</li>
            <li> and I can say that this set is a HUGE improvement.</li>
            <li> My thumb nail must be huge cause</li>
            <li> Huge designs.</li>
            <li> Bundle monster series are terrific and offer some great images.</li>
            <li> They are 100% better and worth the price.  </li>
            <li> They are fantastic, I hope to draw another collection soon</li>
            <li> , the plates are stainless steel and come packed nicely so there are no scratches.</li>
            <li> There are so many fun designs.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;feel\\&quot; cheap; they are lighter, and don&#x27;t feel as durable as the Konad plates.   </li>
            <li> I think the plates are great for the reasons mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> and even I felt fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Overall they work great.</li>
            <li> plates seem smaller than I anticipated, but they work great.</li>
            <li> You will enjoy all the designs .And</li>
            <li> They are a fabulous addition to my manicure supplies</li>
            <li> I will have to break these out again and make sure to get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> and now I have such a great variety to choose from.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few and they work PERFECT every time!</li>
            <li> This set had a lot of Halloween art, so it fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Plates have many nice full nail designs and beautiful french tips, my favorites, also these stamps better than smaller ones.  </li>
            <li> it does take some time to learn how to do it correctly but overall the product works great</li>
            <li> Overall, these are a great investment.</li>
            <li> Even if you only use 5 designs it is a great return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a good 2/3s of the images on these plates and so far, no issues.</li>
            <li> But overall - I&#x27;m very happy, I really like the plates.</li>
            <li> Also, the best thing, the images that cover the whole nail are now larger for those of us who have wider nails.</li>
            <li> They are very similar to Konad...expect that they are a better deal price wise.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li> it absolutely works!!!  </li>
            <li> I received them in record time, really fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> thanks a lot Bundle Monster!!!</li>
            <li> They stamp work very well!!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li> It is a very fun thing to do on a sleep over</li>
            <li> Very nice customer service, I only wish the stamper would get here now</li>
            <li> Be sure to work quickly because your polish may dry up when you&#x27;re ready to stamp it, and clean the plate after each stamp to get the best results!</li>
            <li> Each plate fits nicely into my current holder and cleanup is, as has been, very easy.    </li>
            <li> It would be great if they would make the full nail designs a lot bigger</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a great variety of images, and I especially the full nail ones.</li>
            <li> was exactly what I expected and it works great too!</li>
            <li> If you like doing nails get these, they are super easy to work with and at eighty eight cents per plate</li>
            <li> The package came very quickly and as for the images themselves, they were very pretty.</li>
            <li> I will shop more on Amazon and with Bundle Monster if you have more new product</li>
            <li> They wkork great, are easy to use and have a wide variety of designs to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love these plates so much!</li>
            <li> The etching seems deeper than the original BM kit.  </li>
            <li> This set is even better than the first.  </li>
            <li> I was totally excited about</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product on Sept 23rd.</li>
            <li> The draws are cute and pretty.</li>
            <li> I purchased the original Bundle Monster kit [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The quality of the design engravings is better than the first set.   </li>
            <li> This is the second set that I got of these and have referred several more to purchase and myself as well as my nail tech and my daughter have all LOVED them!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> When I knew about the second set I didn¬¥t hesitate to order it immediately, and I have to admit that they are even much more original than the first ones and that their quality is quite superior because they have a background which is really resistent and nice.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to receive bundle yesterday, ..</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one significant downside to these plates, however.</li>
            <li> I received these along with the first set for Valentine&#x27;s Day from my Husband and I truly Love them...</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these plates.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my nails all the time from all the unique designs I can use with the plates.</li>
            <li> I have the original image plate set</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so fun!  </li>
            <li> I contacted company and they promised to send me replacement for those plates, I think they are more than aware about this problem, but still selling unusable products to people.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to receive these nail stamping plates..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, and all work great.</li>
            <li> When I purchased these plates I was so excited to recieve them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never disappointed</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very hard to decide which one to use :) they all came in perfect shape</li>
            <li> You are going to love these new plates if you already own the first set.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am thrilled with this new set.</li>
            <li> Not a single design was repeated and I loved how there were themed designs like skulls and ghosts for Halloween and a gingerbread cookie and holly for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Fun designs to choose from and easy to use.</li>
            <li> With so many designs to choose from though, It hasn&#x27;t really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but I could clean it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and compared to Konad plates you do get your money&#x27;s worth given the number of plates you get for the price.</li>
            <li> The images come out nice and clear!</li>
            <li> if you dont use a special nail polish it comes out a bit lumpy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the \\&quot;Special Polish,\\&quot; but instead tested all the polishes I had to see if they worked with the image plates &amp; showed up on the stamper.</li>
            <li> There are special nail stamping polishes you can get.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to get a rubber stamper and google alternative polishes instead of spending a ton of money on the konad special polishes.</li>
            <li> Quick dry are not that great</li>
            <li> - shipped incredibly fast  - amazing price in comparison to name brand (Konad plates)  - variety of styles and designs  - plates seem very durable, not flimsy, good quality  - large images cover a large nail bed  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these plates, they came relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> So, when I got these plates and I was super excited.</li>
            <li> The plates are easy to use and I chose them because I liked these designs better than a lot of the other sets.  </li>
            <li> It has a lot of full nail designs that fit my nails and the designs are really fun.</li>
            <li> There were no issues with the any part of the transaction and overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast and plus its FREE shipping!</li>
            <li> offer some really cool designs to work with.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Bundle Monster :)</li>
            <li> Yes, there are a lot of flowers in all plate sets, but this BM2 has so much variety and truly interesting designs.    </li>
            <li> Cool concept</li>
            <li> As described, it features mostly full nail designs.</li>
            <li> Cons  - some repeated prints  - MAJORITY of the plates consisted of full nail designs</li>
            <li> I love these for the fact that they were bigger and fit my nail better and the engravings were deeper</li>
            <li> There are some really cool designs with this set.</li>
            <li> Cool designs.</li>
            <li> I have found that on YouTube, etching deformities are quite common, contact customer service if you have any concern with the product, I hear they&#x27;re awesome   </li>
            <li> I love these plates, the images all fit my nails, and most of them come out pretty clear.</li>
            <li> they have cute designs and stamp really well</li>
            <li> I really love, I&#x27;m no try the whole images and plates,yet  </li>
            <li> i have heard such good reviews from this product...</li>
            <li> These ones are much lower quality, BUT you&#x27;re still getting way more for your money.</li>
            <li> Some of the images are very deep and really good</li>
            <li> But overall quality is good.</li>
            <li> Regular and gel nail polish don&#x27;t make good imprints.</li>
            <li> These plates are not as detailed as the more expensive Konad plates, but they are wonderful nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> Cheeky has put a curved end on full nail design to give you either option.</li>
            <li> quality is not bad.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth the grab, as it is so much cheaper than others brand!!!</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite plates.&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive super fast.</li>
            <li> The smaller images I have tried are really nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good if you&#x27;re looking for more full nail stamps rather than little images.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried every single design, but I&#x27;ve always been successful with the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> [...] I just got it today and tried it immediately, lots of the designs DO NOT work, but many do, if you want full nail designs I would say buy it its a decent value</li>
            <li> and the full images are only 1.5cm in length; so I have to stamp each nail twice to fill my entire nail which is a PITA trying to match up perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love these new plates!  </li>
            <li> I must say that these image plates help me out tremendously.</li>
            <li> This set is a better value than the first set altho the first set is a staple for nail art stamping.  </li>
            <li> Made of durable metal with a protective/safety backing on each disc, this collection should last for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the plates the designs are attractive</li>
            <li> For me, Wet N&#x27; Wild nail polishes works great!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a great supplement to the real thing (especially if you already have the scraper and polishes from Konad).  </li>
            <li> I think the images are awesome, but they are not etched in deep enough.  </li>
            <li> But other then that, i do love this set better!  </li>
            <li> Extra designs are always a plus for any of the ladies looking to be more creative and stand out.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely satisfied :)</li>
            <li> QUICK,</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love the 2nd.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> a cada nova arte que vou realizar, s√£o pe√ßas com bom acabamento e de otima precis√£o, super aconselh√°vel, quem adquirir vai querer mais, estou muito satisfeita com produto.</li>
            <li> Super contente</li>
            <li> these plates are absolutley amazing they shipped fast and are so much fun to use there are so many different options on the plates and its definatley worth the money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stamp very well, most of mines are not imprinted right at all.</li>
            <li> Best thing is that they are larger and the edges a nice an dull.</li>
            <li> The image plate sizes are also slightly bigger than in the original Bundle Monster plate set, and this comes in handy for people like me who have a wider nail beds.    </li>
            <li> As a novice with stamping plates, I have had much more success with full-nail designs than most of the individual designs I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love the new backing too.  </li>
            <li> But, really, even with a few not being that useful it is still a great set and very worth the money i paid!</li>
            <li> Having the first bundle I see the difference immediately that the full nail designs have been enlarged and widen to what can equate to a Konad full design size.</li>
            <li> Ok, so first of all I received my image plates sooo fast...</li>
            <li> is an easy way for anyone to really get involved.</li>
            <li> The plates are super easy to use, and are a wonderful value especially considering the price of other brands and how much this pack comes with!</li>
            <li> Not only do you get more choices (designs) in this bundle, IT\\&quot;s ALSO CHEAPER THAN THE KONAD PLATES!</li>
            <li> I just recently bought these plates and I love them!</li>
            <li> You get so many plates with such pretty designs, it can be a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i need!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have beenable to use all other disk designs successfully.</li>
            <li> as long as you have the right polish you can get good images.</li>
            <li> Designs look super cool, and have not had troubles with them, though I wish they had more girly designs, not flowers but other things like more hearts, fairies, lips, etc..</li>
            <li> Images are crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> normal nail polish remover is just a huge pain since I clean off the plate after every stamp.</li>
            <li> Plates are best, but at this price are not bad, but the drawings are very shallow.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised at the beauty of the designs and how well they work!!!!!</li>
            <li> This pack was a very good deal- at least the price was.</li>
            <li> An amazing selection, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> the designs are very pleasing and accurate to what is shown in the images.</li>
            <li> and they were nice enough to replace them for me</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricier, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m satisfied, but they should probably be more careful when putting the sets together.</li>
            <li> was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> the thumb!!!I can&#x27;t be happier about this set and its well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The price is definitely worth it (~$0.88 per plate vs. $6.99 on ebay.)    </li>
            <li> However, the payoff is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> They are worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that a lot of the more detailed ones will not transfer well, though some larger prints won&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled, and if Bundle Monster makes a third set, I will buy it as soon as I find out!</li>
            <li> They work just as well as the Konad plates, and they have a lot of fun designs.  </li>
            <li> I have used these for more than a month and most of my regular nail polishes work really well with them.</li>
            <li> As I was doing my nails again 2 nights ago, I discovered more images were not stamping clearly</li>
            <li> Friday so much fun</li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> The shipment came in a day earlier than expected and the packaging and plates were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of full nail designs and higher quality</li>
            <li> would say for the price and selection you get it&#x27;s worth it to buy them.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I always work on top of an old magazine and use that to discard the scraped off polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I can finally have some fun with my own nails.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have many more sets in my wish list waiting for later when I got some extra $$ for em.</li>
            <li> So totally addicted to useing these for great designs on my nails and every time I use them I get asked about where I got my nails done when I go anywhere!!!</li>
            <li> * much better when you consider that you&#x27;re getting far fewer design choices.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless,  I like the designs and plan to have a lot of fun experimenting.  </li>
            <li> but if you have patience they are pretty cool.</li>
            <li> and it was so worth it and affordable</li>
            <li> These plates were a great value, all of the images i have used so far have been etched well enough for use.</li>
            <li> work very well, just a few of them don&#x27;t print right with light colors, but in general they are a great product and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that they aren&#x27;t really the right fit for my nails</li>
            <li> I recommend to try BM image plates before Konad, BM images are fun, unique and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love nail art and have to say that this set was a big improvement from the original set of plates.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping, got them in one week!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Overall, even for a \\&quot;novice\\&quot; this set a not only SUPERBLY priced, but also very very very easy to use with endless stamping possibilities.      </li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> is where you see right away if there may be an issue with a plates etching.&lt;br /&gt;Try to transfer the design in question first.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> The sent replacement plates out right away</li>
            <li> They sent replacement plates to me right the way.</li>
            <li> But it takes a lot of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the right set of plates that I wanted</li>
            <li> i had 4 defective plates and bundle monster replaced them RIGHT AWAY.</li>
            <li> , that was one of the designs I was excited about, the star on 206 won&#x27;t work but the full nail design with circles works and the heart design works fine on the same plate.</li>
            <li> Strongly out of the new version</li>
            <li> The new image plates are wonderful larger designs as well as a back covering to protect against cuts.</li>
            <li> The quality is much better than their first set and every image I have used so far has worked.</li>
            <li> Ala in all a great little set!</li>
            <li> And the size of the \\&quot;full nail stamp\\&quot; is large enought to cover all my finger&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s reasonable that I&#x27;m not going to love every single design since there are so many</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s nothing major.  :)</li>
            <li> The plates are good, the images are scored deep enough to get a good coat of polish and a proper result when stamping.</li>
            <li> Its so good to received it before Chinese New Year...</li>
            <li> and i would recommend bundle monster as i have gotten great items from them in the past.</li>
            <li> and they worked as well as the brand Konad, but the news is even better, the designs are very original, the size of the drawings allow complete nail decoration is very simple even for the pedicures and prices</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at nail art and a bit of a perfectionist, which means it took me all day to get my nails right the first time I tried this.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is still a great set, they&#x27;re definitely different from Mash and Konad&#x27;s plates (although some plates are copies of Konad&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> They gave clear results, and were shipped very quickly - I would recommend them if you don&#x27;t want to pay an arm and a leg for Konad.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Nearly all the plates stamps perfectly, found 2 plates with not so good etching, therefore, unable to retain enough polish for stamping transfer.</li>
            <li> this was a gift to my cousin, and she likes it very much, using it every day to on transparent nails.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> I like the plates very much.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really get them to fit correctly on my nails (unlike Konad french tip designs which seem to have a more compact design to them), so I can&#x27;t really use 1/4 of the plates.  </li>
            <li> These large full nail designs consists of lots of geometric shapes, swirls, large flow patterns, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy the bundle monster first set!</li>
            <li> The designs are new and unique.</li>
            <li> Im so excited to try it out my new</li>
            <li> I had the stamped image on, a quick dry top coat on and got to work on time with pretty nails</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re using cheap $1 and $2 nail polish and they all work just fine, although I&#x27;m thinking about getting the white Konad nail polish, since ours doesn&#x27;t show as much as I&#x27;d want to.</li>
            <li> The images are spot on and crisp.</li>
            <li> In addition, this set has more designs, but still not quiet details as Konad.</li>
            <li> First tip-</li>
            <li> The images are crisp and I have no problem with any images.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say that I like Mash&#x27;s set better in 3 different ways (which is why this set doesn&#x27;t receive 5 stars):</li>
            <li> first, Mash&#x27;s set was cheaper</li>
            <li> and since then they have added protective paper backings onto the plates and the stamping designs are a lot larger, which makes them better for use on all nail sizes.</li>
            <li> I also love that they already have the cardboard in the back</li>
            <li> If Bundle Monster came out with another multi plate pack of designs I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> There are so many different patterns and designs to choose from.</li>
            <li> First, buff the rubber of the stamper with a nail file to ensure it picks up the designs  2)</li>
            <li> why you ask...because when you apply the stamper/design, you want to be able to roll the stamper across the nail with ease preventing any gaps (again...the stamper also has a curved surface, so if not done correctly, only a portion of the design will transfer).  </li>
            <li> so you can get access to the pretty ones.  </li>
            <li> There are many different designs.</li>
            <li> Once I got the plates I was so satisfied with their quality and all the different designs included.</li>
            <li> I purchased the first set and then this set.  </li>
            <li> The full images are now bigger and fit my nails.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that there aren&#x27;t as many \\&quot;cute\\&quot; images in this set.</li>
            <li> This set is a vast improvement from the first BM plates (you can read more about my gripes about the first set).   </li>
            <li> The blue film on the plates on arrival is nice, it appears to keep the plate smooth until you unwrap it, and there is a minimum of extra packaging.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using Amazon, and I will def.</li>
            <li> This is my first stamping purchase.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I got both this and the first sets put out by BundleMonster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are many different designs.</li>
            <li> Some plates don&#x27;t work very well&#x3D; but for the amount that you are getting its worth it.</li>
            <li> This was my first stamping plate purchase.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely has a design for just about everything you need!</li>
            <li> I purchased the MASH plates recently and love them.  </li>
            <li> They have a lot of holiday designs and pretty images on these plates.</li>
            <li> Full nail designs cover pretty much the whole nail (well, not my thum).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for nail stamping!!</li>
            <li> they work very well, had no issues transfering the design to the nail!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> this is my first experience with nail stamping.  </li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from Bundle Monster and from Amazon.com too.  </li>
            <li> but overall I love the longer length.</li>
            <li> From 25 plates 8 are not working - of course all of them have images I bought this set for in first place.</li>
            <li> just remember to pull the blue plastic off before use and practice, practice, practice!!! :)</li>
            <li> Just make sure you remove plastic from the individual plaes before using....</li>
            <li> 25 plates with so many different designs</li>
            <li> The use of an XL stamper, also works better to pick up the tiny details.</li>
            <li> I would most assuredly recommend these to all nail stamping enthusiasts, especially beginners.</li>
            <li> The designs are pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than buying plates individually from Konad.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for they don&#x27;t transfer good at all.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my Bundle Monster Nail Art Stamping Plates, I did read some &#x27;not-so-good&#x27; reviews that they weren&#x27;t wide enough to fit your nails and that they weren&#x27;t deep enough to give you the perfect detailed stamp, however my experience with the Bundle Monter Stamping Plates was different.</li>
            <li> even if some are not deep enough as long as the majority work I am happy and content with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Amazing fast delivery, was much more earlier to arrive to singapore than expected time frame!</li>
            <li> wow is all i can say these are so way better than the old bm pack</li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting some good quality, but all I got were plates which weren&#x27;t deep enough.</li>
            <li> I can do tons of fun designs with them, I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> Also - be aware, due to the thin nature of the design, most colors tend to be lighter than what you&#x27;ll expect, so be sure to use your most opaque colors or buy some of the special Konad stamping</li>
            <li> I found that the plates I liked the most were not available in the smaller bundle.  </li>
            <li> People are saying that the first set of 21 don&#x27;t cover your whole nail</li>
            <li> the first set I order thank you so much</li>
            <li> thanks seller for fast shipping and keep it up!</li>
            <li> , they send me the image that was missing, very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> and I pretty much taught her how to stamp.</li>
            <li> I also bought from Amazon and after some experimenting and mess ups, I have gotten some cute nail designs!</li>
            <li> They work well thus far and have many different designs and are fun to use.</li>
            <li> The image isn&#x27;t large enough to fit some of my larger nails, but with some practice and patience, I was able to get it to work.</li>
            <li> It has nice backings,so the edges are not sharp, the blue cover</li>
            <li> Although, it the plates would be better if the whole nail images would be bigger &amp; actually fit the entire nail...</li>
            <li> Most of the images are for full nail coverage, but many have such small intricate designs &amp; you have to file your stamper with a nail file to make it grab the images.</li>
            <li> but I have to rate it a three, because most of the full nail images are not large enough to cover my full nail.</li>
            <li> They were very quick to respond and to offer me my money back or to ship another package since mine had gotten lost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The engravings feel slightly rougher than the Konad plates, but the images still transfer from stamper to nail nicely.</li>
            <li> However, for the price it&#x27;s okay seeing as one single plate through Konad is about $5-$6.</li>
            <li> The remaining 20 consisted of ALMOST all large designs.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that some of the plates have large images.</li>
            <li> My husband called me at work to tell me that they arrived and to rub it in my face that I had to wait until the end of my workday to see them, it was pure torture.</li>
            <li> (it had a large gouge on one of the designs) and I notified the seller.</li>
            <li> I really think ALL the positive reviews for this product are written by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the whole set yet, but the few plates I have had a chance to play with came out pretty nice.</li>
            <li> so glad i didn&#x27;t purchase it because the new BM satisfy all my asian motif nail art needs!</li>

            <li> Arrived fast</li>
            <li> so skip those unless you can stamp extremely fast.</li>

            <li> With this set, there is so much to choose from</li>
            <li> I really like these plates.</li>
            <li> They all stamp really well even with some reguler polishes.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these plates and they all stamped really well expect for maybe 3 plates.</li>
            <li> They work really well with the Konad nail polish.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Designs were all etched very well.</li>
            <li> I like the designs on the plates and almost all the plates work very well.  </li>
            <li> at all... VERY disapointed.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wish these were a tiny bit longer to fit my thumb</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> , I find myself changing polish twice as much as I used to.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fast)</li>
            <li> They replaced all 5 plates with fast shipping and no cost to me.</li>
            <li> but I look very forward to using them.</li>
            <li> &quot; haha.</li>
            <li> As mention, i have not try any of my plates yet cant comment much about the product but just looking at all my plates</li>
            <li> I can enjoy different style</li>
            <li> Thanks LP speed.</li>
            <li> Too much time to receive it, was for Papa Noel or Reyes magos</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t really figure out how to line it up on my fingers.</li>
            <li> Own about 50 or so varnishes ranging from Wet n Wild to Essie and Sally Hanson.</li>
            <li> I noticed there&#x27;s a tendency for the full nail designs to work better than the small ones that I would apply 2 or 3 times on one nail.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money, time and ruined what would&#x27;ve been a perfectly good manicure.</li>
            <li> I particularly like this collection because it includes mostly full-nail designs instead of a smattering of single images.&lt;br</li>
            <li> when u scrap it it goes right on it its definitely worth paying the extra $0.99.</li>
            <li> They got here pretty quickly, but the stamps only work on about have the plates.</li>
            <li> I like these stamps, but when I first purchased them I was new to stamping</li>
            <li> Since I live overseas, it didn&#x27;t seem worth it to return and get a new one.  </li>
            <li> Also, I found myself using my thumbnails a lot to correct mistakes &amp; using them the most when removing polish from other fingers</li>
            <li> other than that, love the designs</li>
            <li> They have some unique images which I definitely</li>
            <li> so I did do a different design on each nail and also had a lot of fun playing around with each design!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it was due to shipping and its on the side not on a design</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a lot to choose from &amp; the new batch is better than the old - the images are a lot bigger</li>
            <li> My finers are not tiny, and I was very disapointed that the images still did not cover my full nail.</li>
            <li> seriously, just as good as the Konad plates.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have little nieces that enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who bought another set of plates and the images weren&#x27;t as large, so its harder for her to get a whole design to fit on her nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The designs are a lot more modern and prettier than the previous set.  </li>
            <li> , I would recommend these plates to anyone who likes to have pretty nails but doesn&#x27;t want to spend the money to have them professionally done.</li>
            <li> NOTE: if you are using this kit with your own natural nails, be sure to press firmly and roll the stamper from one side to the other.</li>
            <li> full size images are bigger to suit</li>
            <li> I had is that some of the full nail images did not cover my thumb or middle finger.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re only worth the extra price if you want a light color.  </li>
            <li> There are so many designs to choose from, the possibilities are endless!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait for Monster Bundle to come out with new designs!</li>
            <li> so I could use my new plates!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so easy to use and the manicure possibilities are endless, really.</li>
            <li> As noted in other reviews some designs are not etched deep enough but all in all we are happy with this set.</li>
            <li> A whole lot new images for everyone who likes stamping.</li>
            <li> I emailed them and told them which plates wouldn&#x27;t stamp very well because the etching wasn&#x27;t deep enough and they sent over the 3 new plates free of charge!</li>
            <li> However, I have gone through probably about half my stack of plates testing each design, and MANY of my designs will not transfer onto my Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> They are easy to work with and have a wide range of designs.  </li>
            <li> Always use a rolling motion and steady even pressure to pick up and to transfer the stamp.</li>
            <li> Many of the images just don&#x27;t transfer which is annoying because the image selection is great.  </li>
            <li> Most of the designs in this series are full-nail and tip designs, rather than the small designs on the first series.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I am just lucky or what, but all of mine were fine.</li>
            <li> Most of the designs were not etched deep enough to pick up the polish.  </li>
            <li> None of them are deep enough to hold the nail polish to be able to transfer them to the nails.</li>
            <li> but in this case it works really well with the stamping polish, when some of the reviews said putting on their top coat took off their stamp job, Seche Vite killed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> These have cute designs but the etching isn&#x27;t deep enough so the print doesn&#x27;t show up well on nails.</li>
            <li> The size of the designs is now big enough for normal sized nails :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The designs in this set are gorgeous, the full nail images are much bigger--actually a bit big for my nails--and the backing does make them less sharp.  </li>
            <li> The plates also have a backing on them which is nice since several of my other sets dont.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and my set was complete.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I just had to</li>
            <li> I purchased the Konad double ended stamper and attempted to use it without any success with transferring the designs to the nail.</li>
            <li> However they are so fun to play around with and create different manicures.</li>
            <li> All images are really pretty and precise, only one has a minor flaw in it.</li>
            <li> Overall,  the purchase is worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I am new to nail stamping and the 25pc kit offered me a wide variety of designs to try out for a much more reasonable price than buying the same amount from Konad.</li>
            <li> The plates are better than the first series because they are laminated on the back, so less change to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty low and it got to me in less than a week &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Hmm ok but almost impossible to do on your own.</li>
            <li> The full nail images covered adequately, although I do have small hands.  </li>
            <li> ] I love for a million reasons including the quickest drying and longest lasting I have ever used (pinky is dry by the time you get to your thumb-</li>
            <li> They responded the same day and stated that they will send a replacement plate right away.</li>
            <li> The second and third plates used worked fine.  </li>
            <li> The full nail designs are bigger this time around, so they actually cover your whole nail.  </li>
            <li> There are so many designs that I could have something different on my nails every single day!</li>
            <li> I also had a problem with one of the plates and they shipped a new one to me no questions asked.  </li>
            <li> When I made this purchase I was new to this type of nail art.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what new nail plates they offer.</li>
            <li> When I heard about this new Bundle Monster set</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would buy again if they release a new set of images.</li>
            <li> I recommend this purchase to new users and professionals as well.</li>
            <li> When I saw these new and improved Bundle Monster plates I had to have them too.  </li>
            <li> now i can&#x27;t wait to get the new set..</li>
            <li> For the price, though, I can definitely live with that.</li>
            <li> The stamper has a curved surface and so do your natural nails, so pressing straight down without rolling will not allow for a smooth transfer.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple of tries for the image to come out clean, and it takes a lot of patience.</li>
            <li> so far I can&#x27;t get a decent transfer off one.  </li>
            <li> Also, you have to be quick with the process or the nail polish will dry in the plate or on the stamper, and will not go on  to the nail.</li>
            <li> I could live without all the tip only designs, My nails just aren&#x27;t long enough to get good use out of them, but the wide variety on all the other plates more than makes up for that.</li>
            <li> I gave this item three stars because I feel like the images could be a little larger so that people with larger nail sizes are able to get full image designs on all fingers &amp; thumbs.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this a 4 star rating was that I was so excited when I received this new Bundle Monster image plate set, but as I was counting and looking through them, I realized I have two BM-204 image plates and no BM-212 image plate; in which, my excitement suddenly turned into disappointment because the BM-212 image plate was the one that had the peacock prints, and that was the image plate that I was MOST excited for.</li>
            <li> The image etchings transfer very clearly with Konad nail polish.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one and they all stamp extremely well...!!! :)</li>
            <li> While you get 25 plates and many designs; several of them did not work, because they were not etched deep enough.  </li>
            <li> I have many other sets: Red Angel, Shany, Cheeky and I</li>
            <li> MUST say this one far surpasses them all!  </li>
            <li> I just recently started getting interested in nail art/stamping.  </li>
            <li> they work well and seem to be exactly the same besides the plate numbers!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these over the first set.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to use many of the plates.  </li>
            <li> What are the odds that the first plate I chose out of 25 was the only defective one in the set.</li>
            <li> even though that are bigger than the first set..  </li>
            <li> Although I think my set would be more suited for her, she lives smaller individual stamps whereas I would rather have larger nail stamps and tips (this set).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how many years it&#x27;s been since I ordered these, but with all the other plates I have I keep going back to them.  </li>
            <li> And expected it will arrived after 17th Jan. I was received the items on 11th Jan which earlier than what I expected and items are in good conditions.</li>
            <li> paper backing makes the plates less sharp, the plastic is easier to remove from the front, and the all over nail designs are larger and fit my nails better.</li>
            <li> Shipping was relatively quick, within the expected period.</li>
            <li> I recomend using special stamping polishes for the plates, but you can experiment with other polishes, to see what works for you.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use the french tips yet but gonna try as soon as my nails are long enough.  </li>
            <li> And, with 25 plates full of ideas, the possibilities are nearly endless with these.  </li>
            <li> Only black polish seems to stamp ok.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because I won&#x27;t use all the designs simply because of artistic preference.</li>
            <li> You get a whole lot of different designs, from full nail designs, individual ones, to fancy french tip designs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money through Konad when these work perfectly fine just like Konad.</li>
            <li> Love the images but just know that some on them are a little large in the way that when you scrap the polish off the image gets sparse in some spots but it is not real noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were a little pricy, but that may just be because Im cheap.</li>
            <li> The designs are larger than the first set, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> second, Mash&#x27;s plates were packaged individually, whereas BM&#x27;s plates came in a single plastic wrap; third, 80% of the plates are all full nail stamps, and I would have preferred more nail tip as well as single image stamps.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so disappointing because the designs are great.</li>
            <li> The images are clear &amp; I didn&#x27;t even use that so called \\&quot;SPECIAL\\&quot; polish from.....</li>
            <li> Figures clearly transferred to the nail.</li>
            <li> You will need to apply a clear coat over your nails when you&#x27;re finished.  </li>
            <li> I really like the seasonal designs, especially for Halloween/Samhain.</li>
            <li> They have all transferred well so far.</li>
            <li> and I know I&#x27;m really gonna&#x27; take my nail art to the next level!</li>
            <li> As always BM plates transfer really well, there isn&#x27;t an image that I used that has problem transferring yet and for BM1 theres only 1 image that didn&#x27;t transfer for me.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money until they change the quality of their plates.</li>
            <li> I realized that I had simply been scraping too much polish off.</li>
            <li> To avoid this I suggest using a used gift card or an old credit card.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am really statify with the purchase.</li>
            <li> and it works very well and was sent on time and even earlier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality product that works with every polish I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of the designs already and they stamped quite well, although it really does depend on the polish you use.  </li>
            <li> Bought a while ago and have used frequently.  </li>
            <li> so if you have wider nails you&#x27;ll also have to stamp each nail twice for complete coverage.</li>
            <li> I first came in contact with stamping plate a few months ago, and I must say, I was hooked from the moment I first laid eyes on them.</li>
            <li> I convinced my fiance to buy me a few sets for Christmas (finally!), and I must say, I am still deeply in love with stamping.</li>
            <li> The first set let me down when I realized that they were not big enough to fit on my nail.</li>
            <li> the Konad has a little more detail and complicated designs, but it&#x27;s not worth being picky over since the bundle monster price is so great.</li>
            <li> The quality of these plates is better than expected: all of them have backing, and the borders are not too sharp.  </li>
            <li> The full nail images are large enough for my index finger, but not large enough for my thumb.</li>
            <li> The blue film definitely helps, unlike the clear one on the first series.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast from Hawaii all the way to me in Florida was only a few days.</li>
            <li> NO HIDDEN</li>
            <li> The plates can take a little bit of practice to master accuracy in placement (especially with the tips), but it&#x27;s definitely worth it, and so much cheaper than going to a salon, for those of us who can&#x27;t afford to have our nails done professionally.  </li>
            <li> The only thing i have a little problem with is some of the images don&#x27;t always like to lift onto the stamp easily to place it on my finger.</li>
            <li> Earlier I was thinking that I will buy the new design plates, but now after trying the old ones I don&#x27;t think I will.</li>
            <li> full images are small if you have deep nail beds, long nails, or bigger nails.&lt;br /&gt;There are too many French tip designs.  </li>
            <li> There are now backings on each plate, so no sharp edges!</li>
            <li> Quality has majorly improved compared to the 2010 Bundle Monster set!</li>
            <li> It was such a huge disappointment not being able to use most/many of the designs.</li>
            <li> You must roughly file the stamper first</li>
            <li> With just a little bit of practice,  I did a perfect french manicure using BM 310 as a delicate netting and toped it with Konad M19 solid white french tips.  </li>
            <li> These are fun (and sometimes meditative) and the combinations are endless!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think the images aren&#x27;t imprinted deep enough because I often can&#x27;t pick certain images up with my stamper.</li>
            <li> However the one MAJOR flaw is that the full nail images are way too narrow.</li>
            <li> The plastic film was easy to remove and the paper backing on these new plates make them less sharp and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> But because a few were not as sharp as i would have liked I only gave this set 4 stars.</li>
            <li> you will make mistakes especially if you are new to nail stamping like myself.  </li>
            <li> I live in California, so the only thing I would say I don&#x27;t like about it where it&#x27;s being shipped from.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to their next new set, I&#x27;ll probably get those too.</li>
            <li> i hope they come out with new designs soon because i will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> The only thing is i got a double plate, so I really got 24 plates instead of 25.</li>
            <li> I have long nails beds and most plates are too small.</li>
            <li> All the images stamp well even using inexpensive wet n wild or Sally Hanson quick dry polish.  </li>
            <li> I emailed them and the missing plate was replaced quickly.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> The first plate I used did not work properly as if the grooves weren&#x27;t deep enough.  </li>
            <li> Even conad much inferior to them, many small figures conad still misfire and not fully translated.</li>
            <li> The full nail designs in this set are larger than before which is a big improvement especially if you have long nails.  </li>
            <li> There was a duplicate of one plate, and one plate missing (like many other reviews have said).</li>
            <li> I would purchase this product again if bundle monster would make the full nail image plates a little larger.</li>
            <li> I am starting my journey into nail stamping and have ordered BM 2011 and 2012 collection based on such a high number of reviews.  </li>
            <li> , they also put the paper backing on them which makes them less sharp, and made the full nail designs bigger so they cover the whole nail</li>
            <li> The images are clear, only 2 or 3 in all 25 plates were defective.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to send the old plates back either.  </li>
            <li> that the image plate BM-201 was not really centered so the image got kinda cut off over all its really good...5 stars from me</li>
            <li> The only nail I can completely cover with an image is my pinkie nail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the actual plate review:&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> BM has definitely listened to their customers, because they have considerably improved the image plates.</li>
            <li> so I have to redo them several times to get them to show up completely.</li>
            <li> Seller offers low cost shipping.</li>
            <li> The more intricate designs which feature thin lines are somewhat difficult to work with, but persistence is key - just glance at your design before you stamp it to make sure the whole thing is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Bundle Monster Plates are not Perfect some of them had flaws, but they work really nice.  </li>
            <li> Too small (my 4 year is about the biggest to be able to use the full nail designs) and the others were shaved too thin and won&#x27;t stamp the image on the nail.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> I love the designs, but the stamps are not nearly deep enough; hardly any of the images fully transfer, regardless of the polish I use, how clean the stamper and plates are, how quickly or slowly I work, etc.</li>
            <li> This new set has some big improvement since the last set.</li>
            <li> The difference between the two is these new plates are all different designs and each design is allot bigger in size.</li>
            <li> Not only the new images ROCK but the plates themselves are bigger, safer and the paper/plastic that comes with it is also easier to remove.</li>
            <li> All the plates stamped very clearly, they were all etched deep enough!</li>
            <li> When I received the order it was missing a plate, but after notifying Bundle Monster, they sent that plate right away.</li>
            <li> They sent me the ones I was missing right away.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had purchased the first set of plates that Bundle monster sells</li>
            <li> I work fast, use Konad polishes and other polishes.</li>
            <li> What I mean by \\&quot;complete set\\&quot; is, when I received my product I only got 24 plates not the full 25 but not to worry because when I notified Bundle Monster through Amazon, and immediately got a reply.</li>
            <li> At first I got frustrated with the designs that didn&#x27;t come out clear, but there are more good designs than the bad ones.  </li>
            <li> It can be a pretty messy project, even for this 29-year-old.  </li>
            <li> They look really pretty on short nails, I was a little worried about that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the imprint isn&#x27;t deep enough, but I use the same technique every time and there are just a few that don&#x27;t come out looking right.</li>
            <li> These full nail designs are larger than the other set, but still they are not large enough to cover the nail of my thumb or middle finger in only one pass.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use a few of the designs, but not many.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical to buy, but now I LOVE stamping my nails.</li>
            <li> If you have petite hands, you will have the use of the entire collection and it is of high quality as other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> My only complaint (thus 3 stars) is that the images from 2011 collection for the full nail are not big enough.  </li>
            <li> Dark colors work fantastic, BUT when using bright colors like yellow, orange and green, use dark yellow, dark orange and dark green to ensure the color shows up well against the desired background.  </li>
            <li> Once the design has been transferred, apply a clear top coat to the artificial nail tip and let dry (the clear coat will prevent the design from smudging when applyingthe acrylic to your nails.  </li>
            <li> Wild Wild Shine nail polish in silver metalic, black creme, and french white creme over my existing Shellac manicure.  </li>
            <li> I love these plates, except for a few, which was hard to get images onto stamp.</li>
            <li> Not good using regular polish, need special stamping polish</li>
            <li> For $21, it&#x27;s a good price, you&#x27;ll get use to the designs that come out bad, just ignore using them.</li>
            <li> I will say that it took me about three tries to get the scraping and stamping technique down, but now that I have...I&#x27;m doing it pretty efficiently.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use an image due to a bulge of some sort directly on it.</li>
            <li> , I was extremely surprised to recieve them 3 days before the expected arrival date!</li>
            <li> The variety of the images allows you to do french tips, whole nails, small images &amp; has something for every occasion including holidays.</li>
            <li> I have natural, short/medium length nails that are of average width and some of the images do not fully cover the nail surface for my middle and thumb fingers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several nail polishes with the plates and as long as you use enough you will have no problems.</li>
            <li> but I still think the full nail images; although bigger than the previous set; are still too small.</li>
            <li> The full nail deigns are bigger but still leave a thin space for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the small surface area designs worked, but the ones with a large surface area (i.e. Gingerbread man) did not come out at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a little while to get into the groove, but once you find it, it&#x27;s not hard.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that you have to have the following on hand:&lt;br /&gt;cotton ball, nail polish remover, extra cotton ball to dry each plate, after each stamp.</li>
            <li> so now I save my thumbs for last, once all other nails are completely done &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of full nail patterns, manicure tip patterns, and a lot of little images, though I have noticed very few of my smaller images will transfer correctly.</li>
            <li> The delays of delivery are long (about ten days) because this product is sent from Hawa√Ø !!</li>
            <li> I have naturally longer base nails and the full size images from the first batch of BM</li>
            <li> (see details below)  - not exactly my preference of prints (this is a personal choice that will differ between users)  - lacking smaller individual prints (ie.</li>
            <li> Like, the one didn&#x27;t have any rust on it and the other wasn&#x27;t scratched anymore, but some of the smaller designs still aren&#x27;t deep enough.</li>
            <li> Really the only complaint I have.</li>
            <li> I spent a total of five hours trying to make various patterns work.  </li>
            <li> There are other US and European companies making nail stamping plates with larger images for those of us with longer nails</li>
            <li> The images are a bit small, mainly for my thumb.</li>
            <li> The only negative, the full nail designs are too small to completely cover larger sized thumb nails, but it&#x27;s not a huge problem.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find one that fits the whole nail.</li>
            <li> The first couple of tries were kinda wonky</li>
            <li> There was a personal email already waiting in my inbox when I closed the browser after filling out the form.  </li>
            <li> it arrived the last day in the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> This was definitely money well spent.</li>
            <li> it takes ten tries to get one design....</li>
            <li> I agonized for waaaaaay too long over who to purchase from, and settled on bundle monster.</li>
            <li> Any Nail polish works as long as it&#x27;s an opaque color.</li>
            <li> I have long slender nails and long nail beds, and I do not want to have to stamp twice like others must be doing.</li>
            <li> once finished, jazz it up a bit by adding clear/colored rhinestones randomly across the nail to really make it pop and sparkle!!!</li>
            <li> It only stamps in the center due to my larger sized nails.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little worried after reading some reviews that the etchings aren&#x27;t deep enough, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> The plates actually come with a paper backing this time, but the edges are still a bit sharp, so use caution.   </li>
            <li> I just recently purchased these after having bought (and used) the other BM collection.  </li>
            <li> I recently got into nail stamping and bought this set due to all the *buzz*</li>
            <li> It gives you a lot of color combos to work with &amp; doesn&#x27;t bleed your wallet dry.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish is supposed to dry slower.</li>
            <li> I have not tried every single plate</li>
            <li> I could not get a single image to work out of all 25 plates.</li>
            <li> These are such a big improvement over the previous BM set and other stamping plates.</li>
            <li> The only down fall was</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that the key to getting them to work is to scrape them sideways instead of up and down.</li>
            <li> A little experimenting goes a long way to finding different things to try with these.</li>
            <li> Only the thumbs are missing a little bit on the sides, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> (Really, it was hard to decide which one to use tonight!).  </li>
            <li> If your not really fast, the nail polish will dry.</li>
            <li> The edges aren&#x27;t sharp like the other ones (they&#x27;re obviously listening to feedback)...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $5+ for only 4-5 designs when I could get 5-6 designs(25 plates) for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> When I did get them to work, it was inconsistent and ended up being a big mess on my nails and hands.  </li>
            <li> There is at least one design I like on each of the 25 plates, and the ones I&#x27;ve used so far have all worked without a problem!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the very last plate in this collection (I do believe is Plate 225) one of the images was barely visible/not completely etched.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t scrape enough, the design is a mess.</li>
            <li> individual flowers or various other small designs)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, but it does take practice; my friend and I bought a bunch of fake nails to practice color combinations and images:that was a blast!</li>
            <li> I have tried at least one image from each image plate so far, and have not had any issues with any of them.  </li>
            <li> The plate arrived a few days later.</li>
            <li> I ordered both sets of bundle monsters at the same time and received a duplicate plate and missing another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Konad plates for a few years now, and was recently introduced to Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li> I gave this 2 stars only because a few images does work, but that doesn&#x27;t make up for the $22 price tag for only a few images.</li>
            <li> Wide variety of designs to choose from and</li>
            <li> even worse, paid as much for shipping as I paid for the product.</li>
            <li> I used Wet &#x27;n</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering these since they&#x27;re a different brand than the other plates I have.  </li>
            <li> I think dark colors stay wet longer, so they are easier to stamp because they will not immediately dry up on the plate or on the stamp.  </li>
            <li> This is a little frustrating, but for the price and amount of plates I got, I can&#x27;t complain very much.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but I&#x27;ll stick with Konad brand next time unfortunately</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think a few of the stamps aren&#x27;t quite deep enough, so getting a decent stamp out of them is very difficult.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and figured whatever I&#x27;ll give it a try its cheaper than my Konad plates which I got 3 or 4 and a bottle of black white pink and green polish and a stamper</li>
            <li> Some designs are hard to pick up and some still leave smears and blogs when you press onto nails, but overall, most of these plate aren&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> even thought i am still getting use to it as well as some other products i have bought</li>
            <li> Im just disappointed that BM couldn&#x27;t make the images alittle better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of luck with other plates but the two Bundle Monster sets I purchased gave me nothing but duds.  </li>
            <li> These image plates are sturdy, but I agree with other reviews that say not to use the Konad scraper that comes with the stamper.</li>
            <li> The backing on the plates prevents damage and they aren&#x27;t so sharp.</li>
            <li> I also have the Konad plates, and the difference in quality is extreme; I will be sticking with Konad and putting my BM plates on my swap list.</li>
            <li> I got these because I had the other bundle monster plates</li>
            <li> Other than that, designs could use a re-vamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re trying to decide between this set and the other set...</li>
            <li> deigns to pick from.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper, then other plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that some people stated that the plates had sharp edges that cut them.</li>
            <li> I will have to peel off the protective covering off of the other 33 plates this weekend and test them.  </li>
            <li> BUT the beauty is we can trade (or steal) each other&#x27;s plates.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the french tip designs ended up being too big for the same reason.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the scratches were during shipment or weren&#x27;t inspected properly before shipment.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned, count your plates when you get them.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t print as well as other ones</li>
            <li> One of them had a scratch through it and the other had some rust (I think).</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other review about this product, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If you have longer nails some of the images will be too small, but could be made larger by making a decal.  </li>
            <li> MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit]] and very few similar designs, although some of the small BM1 full-nail designs have larger counterparts in this set.</li>
            <li> I received 2 double plates, 2 missing plates and few were scratched.</li>
            <li> but I think I might delay that and instead buy a single Konad plate or maybe a few because I trust them.</li>
            <li> These have a paper backing which makes the edges less sharp.</li>
            <li> If you scrape too hard, no polish is left for the design.  </li>
            <li> but this was definitely not worth the time or money</li>
            <li> Need to buy a nail polish the same brand, it has to be thick for this to work.</li>
            <li> Then I use the thick polish for the actual stamp.  </li>
            <li> Some plates work good and some are completly horrible.</li>
            <li> biggest piece of advice is to do a top coat after you put your base coat on so that if you make a mistake when stamping you can take it off and it wont ruin your polish job.</li>
            <li> Some cover  more of the base color than others.</li>
            <li> if children are going to use these just supervise them because the edges are a little sharp.</li>
            <li> but I have tried about half and</li>
            <li> She used me as her test subject.  </li>
            <li> I have tried SHANY brand, which is what typically pairs with nail stamping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it with OPI (fyi doesn&#x27;t work, definately not quick</li>
            <li> The plates stamp just as well as konad and cost a lot less.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way LESS</li>
            <li> That is less than a dollar per plate, whereas Konad is $5 per plate.</li>
            <li> I was sad that the ONE plate I mainly wanted in this set was one of the ones that will not work.</li>
            <li> The key is the the polish has to be thick and dry slowly.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is that some of my plates weren&#x27;t etched in deep enough, making it almost impossible to use a few of the designs.</li>
            <li> But there was a small disadvantage: one plate has been scratched, but it is not much spoiled the design.</li>
            <li> But this is not true.</li>
            <li> you can keep them in those little plastic picture holders that go inside wallets</li>
            <li> It is sooo much easier to prep artificial nails before they are attached to allow for touch ups if you do make mistakes...</li>
            <li> Had a few problems</li>
            <li> w/a few plates</li>
            <li> and I received my missing plates as promised (in 3-5 days).</li>
            <li> After spending $7.00 each on a few Konad plates I decided to order this set.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m impatient, so</li>
            <li> There were some issues with a few plates</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m now missing a disk.</li>
            <li> all the plates are there with no repeats or none missing.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a few scratches</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste your polish.</li>
            <li> missing -</li>
            <li> I wasted all that money on junk .</li>
            <li> The reason I have four stars instead of five is because my set was missing a plate, but the seller said its on</li>
            <li> I found the MoYou London plates and purchased a few of them</li>
            <li> There was one plate missing and a duplicate of another.  </li>
            <li> I have a set for myself, the full nail designs don&#x27;t cover my thumb :-(</li>
            <li> still wound up buying another collection because there were a few images</li>
            <li> I was missing -</li>
            <li> I was missing 1 or 2, so I checked the designs and contacted the seller.</li>
            <li> My children &amp; I tested a few designs as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> I have had trouble some days with images transferring but usualy</li>
            <li> , bad idea right?</li>
            <li> it is usually because you aren&#x27;t applying enough pressure (you don&#x27;t need to press that hard) or you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that some of the designs are shallow</li>
            <li> it does take some practice to get the hang of it, but i&#x27;m doing it over shellac, so if i mess up, i can just &#x27;erase&#x27; and try again!  </li>
            <li> Second, paint the artificial nail in desired color and let dry  3)</li>
            <li> I contacted bundle monster about this, they responded within a few hours and shipped the missing plate at no cost to me!</li>
            <li> If you are a new BM customer, you are going to be addicted!!</li>
            <li> but I have bigger finger nails and my thumbs are way to big for them :(</li>
            <li> Sorry for my english, hope it Will help you to take a d√©cision : go !</li>
            <li> I had purchased a few cometitors brand plates which retailed for over $7.00 a plate!  </li>
            <li> SMALL DESIGNS DO NOT TRANSFER.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a friend of mine into stamping, so I gave her the doubles and a couple of my BM1 plates for her children with small nails.    </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a standard french tip template which disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about nail polish.  </li>
            <li> A few of them don&#x27;t work at all but the bulk of them do!</li>
            <li> Some of the designs seems to be repetitive though.</li>
            <li> I usually do my nails every couple of days and it takes me forever to decide which designs to use.</li>
            <li> Also, I would not recommend this for small children.  </li>
            <li> Well I bought these nail art stamps and at least a few hundred stamps.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate part...is that the plates that were replaced weren&#x27;t much different.</li>
            <li> Some of the images are too small for my nails which I consider to be medium in length.</li>
            <li> And there are several designs that are cut very thin, because of this they do not get stamped on the nails.</li>
            <li> At first, I&#x27;d recommend not fully painting your nails with the base &amp; color, but just stamping the images on there to test it out</li>
            <li> Some of the plates are hard to transfer.  </li>
            <li> some are hard to transfer</li>
            <li> It is ridiculously hard to stamp those.</li>
            <li> This set has an assortment of very delicate floral patterns, tip designs, and geometric shapes (as well as a few animal prints).  </li>
            <li> (sorry for my bad english because I&#x27;m french)</li>
            <li> It was really annoying to have to do my whole finger over because it smudged or the cotton got stuck in it,</li>
            <li> I like this stamp set, although there are quite a few that don&#x27;t work or come out looking sloppy.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack solely for the \\&quot;chevron\\&quot; pattern and it was TOO SMALL and etched POORLY.</li>
            <li> The indentations are so shallow they don&#x27;t allow for any stamping to occur.</li>
            <li> The grooves of the samps were just too shallow to hold my images.</li>
            <li> The BM plates are etched too shallow thus causing your image not to transfer.</li>
            <li> These are terrible the engravings aren&#x27;t deep enough to work</li>
            <li> I like the stamping plates some are prefect but some are a little difficult to use.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just too bad that some of the designs are just not made properly</li>
            <li> I use reg polish for the base coat and dry it a few mins with my hair dryer,lol.</li>
            <li> Not happy camper.</li>
            <li> I hate looking for matching designs on different plates.</li>
            <li> its so frustrating that by the time ur done with one, you have no energy to finish your nails.  </li>
            <li> I Am NOT HAPPY With My Purchase.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try all the plates yet because I&#x27;m afraid it will just be a waste of time &amp; nail polish for designs that will not work.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that well, some of these plates have ugly images!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with our Nailart Stamps.  </li>
            <li> If you like nail art, you will not be bored with this set.</li>
            <li> If you like to do your nails with stamps you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought it, and</li>
            <li> You could never go wrong with bundle monster</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing and is why I can only give the product 3 stars. :-(</li>
            <li> It can be very frustrating to get some of the images to work.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no danger of cutting your finger on the plates.</li>
            <li> However, the plates didn&#x27;t include the pattern that was showcased which was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bad plate contact the company immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about BM.</li>
            <li> You get 25 plates for the price which is not that bad.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re going to have some ugly ones</li>
            <li> and was, like others, disappointed with the size of the full-nail designs.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed with this set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was a mistake or what, but i was a bit disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed</li>
            <li> The pads are worthless even after filing.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think they suck real bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish these BM designs were bigger! They are so cute but I have bigger finger nails and my thumbs are way to big for them :(</li>
            <li> work very well, just a few of them don&#x27;t print right with light colors, but in general they are a great product and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bundle monster series are terrific and offer some great images. I will buy every set they put out. The images are spot on and crisp. Great starter sets for the beginner.</li>
            <li> Need to buy a nail polish the same brand, it has to be thick for this to work. Have to work fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the designs in this collection but I still think the full nail images; although bigger than the previous set; are still too small. It would be great if they would make the full nail designs a lot bigger then I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased these plates and a couple actual Konad plates and a stamper from another seller on the same day.  The BM plates arrived 2 days sooner.  I also had a problem with one of the plates and they shipped a new one to me no questions asked.  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> Love the designs on the plates, love the size and love how they work. very happy with the improvements. already recommended to co-workers and some of them ordered their own sets.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!!! I love these plates, except for a few, which was hard to get images onto stamp. This new set has some big improvement since the last set. In addition, this set has more designs, but still not quiet details as Konad. Some designs are hard to pick up and some still leave smears and blogs when you press onto nails, but overall, most of these plate aren&#x27;t that bad. At first I got frustrated with the designs that didn&#x27;t come out clear, but there are more good designs than the bad ones.  There are more images that came out clearer and better than others and well cut. For $21, it&#x27;s a good price, you&#x27;ll get use to the designs that come out bad, just ignore using them. For $21, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love the plates I got they were great!! Had a few problems w/a few plates and they were nice enough to replace them for me now they all work great!!! I recommend them to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> My friend got this and it was great! It is a very fun thing to do on a sleep over and i works fairly well. My friend did piano nails on me and the came out great. I only have two things to say that i didnt like. One if you dont use a special nail polish it comes out a bit lumpy. Two you need to act fast or it will peal off. I really want to get this and i would recommend it to any one that likes AWESOME nail art.</li>
            <li> I loved it, are beautiful and work very well! The designs are crisp, perfectly stamp, the plates are of good quality. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great purchase! I would definitely order again.  It was shipped quickly, arrived in perfect condition, and I love using it.</li>
            <li> Wooot!! I placed my order for this Bundle Monster 25pcs set on 29th Dec 2011. And expected it will arrived after 17th Jan. I was received the items on 11th Jan which earlier than what I expected and items are in good conditions. Its so good to received it before Chinese New Year... this is amazing and i love it!! I will shop more on Amazon and with Bundle Monster if you have more new product attracted me :P  mirimomo (from Singapore)</li>
            <li> These are amazing!!!!!  they cover my whole nail even my thumb.  People are saying that the first set of 21 don&#x27;t cover your whole nail so i would definitely recommend this product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money through Konad when these work perfectly fine just like Konad. Although i would recommend getting the [[ASIN:B000PQGYOU Konad Stamping Nail Art Image Plate Holder]] it holds the plates in and when u scrap it it goes right on it its definitely worth paying the extra $0.99.</li>
            <li> I love nail art. I must say that these image plates help me out tremendously. They transfer very well &amp; saves me lots of time. I do have to say that they aren&#x27;t really the right fit for my nails but I can work with them. The images are a bit small, mainly for my thumb. I also tried the images on my big toe which yields the same result as my thumb. It only stamps in the center due to my larger sized nails. The images are clear &amp; I didn&#x27;t even use that so called \\&quot;SPECIAL\\&quot; polish from.....(well u know who makes it). Oh, &amp; one of my plates was kind of defective so I can&#x27;t use an image due to a bulge of some sort directly on it. Other than that, I would recommend these. Theeeeey&#x27;re Greeeaaat! Lol. :-]  I gave this item three stars because I feel like the images could be a little larger so that people with larger nail sizes are able to get full image designs on all fingers &amp; thumbs.</li>
            <li> When I made this purchase I was new to this type of nail art.  I was looking for the best value for the most product.  While you get 25 plates and many designs; several of them did not work, because they were not etched deep enough.  When I did get them to work, it was inconsistent and ended up being a big mess on my nails and hands.  I decided to invest in the Konad plates.  They are 100% better and worth the price.  I just ended up buying several individual plates on Amazon  They are a bit pricier, but worth it.  They always work and always transfer. You don&#x27;t have to worry about how much polish or at what angle to scrape.  I&#x27;d suggest skipping the Bundle Monster!</li>
            <li> Ordered this set of image plates at the same time that I ordered the Konad nail stamper and scraper. Arrived fast and I went to stamping! I love it. I have already done my nails 6 times and my daughters nails 4 times. The first couple of tries were kinda wonky but I quickly got better. Practice makes perfect! First tip- you must remove the blue film!!!! It WILL NOT work unless you do. Second tip- Use thicker polishes for the stamps. Quick dry are not that great so skip those unless you can stamp extremely fast. I use reg polish for the base coat and dry it a few mins with my hair dryer,lol. Then I use the thick polish for the actual stamp.  Third tip- Always use a rolling motion and steady even pressure to pick up and to transfer the stamp. I find the side to side rolling method to work best. Fourth tip- go to youtube and watch some videos of nail stamping. You will learn a lot of tips to help achieve the look you want.&lt;br /&gt;Also so you don&#x27;t lose your plates you can keep them in those little plastic picture holders that go inside wallets (IDK what they are actually called,lol) or a tiny 5x7 photo album from the dollar store :) I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> good product, good seller, fast shipment to France.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase, the grounds are nice and all the stamping is done very well. Strongly out of the new version</li>
            <li> they dont work for me. ive watched videos on how to apply them but i cant get the stamp to work on my nail without messing it up.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these plates!! The backing is great new feature, The covering is easy to remove, The bigger full nail design is AWESOME!!!! All in all I&#x27;m really happy with them! Thanks for listening to us BM</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster had a great set of plates before, and these are even BETTER!  Adding 4 more plates to the set, plus the improvements made to full-nail images, backings and more, these are an amazing product at an amazing price!  What a value!  And, with 25 plates full of ideas, the possibilities are nearly endless with these.  I&#x27;m so happy with them, and I use them all the time.  Even the older set is great!  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> The previous collection of plates for decoration of nails was good, at a great price and they worked as well as the brand Konad, but the news is even better, the designs are very original, the size of the drawings allow complete nail decoration is very simple even for the pedicures and prices remain That&#x27;s great. They are fantastic, I hope to draw another collection soon</li>
            <li> The set just came in the mail today and I&#x27;m excited! I used a gift card to buy it which was nice, and it was a lot cheaper than konad. I haven&#x27;t used them yet and I&#x27;m a little worried after reading some reviews that the etchings aren&#x27;t deep enough, but we&#x27;ll see. Also I noticed that I received two 208 plates instead of a 207 plate and two 212 plates and no 213 plate... So I guess I&#x27;ll just give the extras away. I still got 23 plates for $22 so I&#x27;m satisfied, but they should probably be more careful when putting the sets together.</li>
            <li> Loved these when I got them. They are good quality and priced well. BundleMonster has been amazing to work with when there were questions or issues. This company seems to care about Customer Service. I can&#x27;t wait to see what new nail plates they offer.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m very happy that i am owner at Bundle Monster Nail Art  Polish Stamps. I&#x60;m very pleased. My nails are different every day. All of people see it.</li>
            <li> I love these plates so much! I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I just had to, they are such a great addition to anyone who is into nail art, or is just getting into it, also they are a huge step up from the Bundle Monster 1st series, I love those too, but these are bigger in size and fit my nails when I have acrylics, also the BM-215 is amazing on it&#x27;s own, love the snake skin!! So if you want to add to your nail collection,  I recommend buying these, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping, got them in one week! Designs look super cool, and have not had troubles with them, though I wish they had more girly designs, not flowers but other things like more hearts, fairies, lips, etc..</li>
            <li> I love this 25 piece set of image plates. There&#x27;s a great variety of images, and I especially the full nail ones. The images are crisp and I have no problem with any images. Right off the bat I&#x27;m going to say that I like Mash&#x27;s set better in 3 different ways (which is why this set doesn&#x27;t receive 5 stars): first, Mash&#x27;s set was cheaper (I got their 25 piece set for UNDER $15); second, Mash&#x27;s plates were packaged individually, whereas BM&#x27;s plates came in a single plastic wrap; third, 80% of the plates are all full nail stamps, and I would have preferred more nail tip as well as single image stamps.     Overall, this is still a great set, they&#x27;re definitely different from Mash and Konad&#x27;s plates (although some plates are copies of Konad&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> This is a really great buy! This plates are awsome and are an awsome price! There are so many different designs to work with its great! The shipping was really fast and plus its FREE shipping! Thats a plus for me! I would recommend this product and seller to anyone! They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> What I mean by \\&quot;complete set\\&quot; is, when I received my product I only got 24 plates not the full 25 but not to worry because when I notified Bundle Monster through Amazon, and immediately got a reply. They replied within 30 mins actually and I received my missing plates as promised (in 3-5 days). I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the whole set yet, but the few plates I have had a chance to play with came out pretty nice. Overall good product,and  good costumer service.</li>
            <li> After spending $7.00 each on a few Konad plates I decided to order this set. I&#x27;m so glad I did. The images are great and the price per plate is excellent!! There is even a paper backing on each of the plates! The shipping was super fast from Hawaii all the way to me in Florida was only a few days.</li>
            <li> This package has so many great image plates! Me &amp; my family had a girls nail painting night &amp; they all loved my plates &amp; it was a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> This set is a better value than the first set altho the first set is a staple for nail art stamping.  I really like the seasonal designs, especially for Halloween/Samhain. I am still hoping for someone in this line of business to make nail art stamping plates with celestial designs and fantasy art and Celtic designs.      The full nail designs in this set are larger than before which is a big improvement especially if you have long nails.  Overall a great nail art stamping design set at a very good price. Made of durable metal with a protective/safety backing on each disc, this collection should last for many, many years.  Therefore I&#x27;d put this in the nail art design \\&quot;investment\\&quot; category.  At this price it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> These are good image plates to use for an awesome price. Fun designs to choose from and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have just received my Bundle Monster stamping plates and they are awesome! I will buy the first kit of these plates right now!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this new set of BM plates, I own the first set they have and since then they have added protective paper backings onto the plates and the stamping designs are a lot larger, which makes them better for use on all nail sizes. As always, BM has amazing value for a good quality product, much more affordable than other name brand stamping plates.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because I won&#x27;t use all the designs simply because of artistic preference.</li>
            <li> Day I received my purchase on Amazon.com 30/05/2011 / Monster Bundle and everything arrived in perfect condition. The Monster Bundle Amazon.com and seller are recommended. Very good!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT deal!!! I place my order for one KONAD plate and it cost $6 for just one! for around $20 I got 25 plates. I have not tried all the images yet, but i plan to do so. even if some are not deep enough as long as the majority work I am happy and content with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this a 4 star rating was that I was so excited when I received this new Bundle Monster image plate set, but as I was counting and looking through them, I realized I have two BM-204 image plates and no BM-212 image plate; in which, my excitement suddenly turned into disappointment because the BM-212 image plate was the one that had the peacock prints, and that was the image plate that I was MOST excited for.</li>
            <li> even thought i am still getting use to it as well as some other products i have bought i have to say i love the possibilities. I also love that they already have the cardboard in the back so i wont cut myself and restickable covers on the front.</li>
            <li> I really thought I would have some learning time to get this to work but I already had my basecoat on, so thought I would give it a try 20 mins before I had to be at work, bad idea right? I had the stamped image on, a quick dry top coat on and got to work on time with pretty nails, I would recommend these plates to anyone who likes to have pretty nails but doesn&#x27;t want to spend the money to have them professionally done.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I am new to nail stamping and the 25pc kit offered me a wide variety of designs to try out for a much more reasonable price than buying the same amount from Konad. Overall, I really like the plates the designs are attractive, the plates are stainless steel and come packed nicely so there are no scratches. In my opinion they work just as well as the more expensive plates. If Bundle Monster came out with another multi plate pack of designs I would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I really like this stamping plates. They wkork great, are easy to use and have a wide variety of designs to choose from. Definitely would recommend to anyone. It&#x27;s a thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> I love these plates! Every design I&#x27;ve used has worked great. They have all transferred well so far. I&#x27;ve been doing my nails and friends nails a lot, and we all love these plates! There are so many different patterns and designs to choose from. An amazing selection, especially considering the price. Very easy to use and the result is amazing!     The only negative, the full nail designs are too small to completely cover larger sized thumb nails, but it&#x27;s not a huge problem. This would not stop me from buying them!     There was a duplicate of one plate, and one plate missing (like many other reviews have said). I contacted bundle monster about this, they responded within a few hours and shipped the missing plate at no cost to me! The plate arrived a few days later. Awesome, fast customer service.     I recommend this product and bundle monster! I&#x27;ll definitely buy from them again, especially if more plates are made!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and in good quality. I received my bundle monster nail art plates and I am very satisfied with it. The designs are definitely interesting. I did find a dent in  plate that I knew would cause the images to stamp with flaws. I sent an email to customer support. Already sent me a replacement plate!  I don&#x27;t expect any company or product to be flawless all of the time, but as long as mistakes are corrected, I have no problem.   Super Seller!!! Can&#x27;t wait to order more. Pozdrawiam z Gdyni. Urszula</li>
            <li> as long as you have the right polish you can get good images. there&#x27;s a lot to choose from &amp; the new batch is better than the old - the images are a lot bigger so you can cover your thumb nail with 1 try &amp; they have backings so there&#x27;s no danger of cutting your finger on the plates. I own only a couple of Konad plates &amp; these are just as good - the Konad has a little more detail and complicated designs, but it&#x27;s not worth being picky over since the bundle monster price is so great. The variety of the images allows you to do french tips, whole nails, small images &amp; has something for every occasion including holidays.</li>
            <li> Great, quick service! Will definitely order again! I received it within the specified time frame and item was exactly what I expected and it works great too!</li>
            <li> purchased this set for my daughters and me. very nice variety of designs and they worked perfectly. i would def. order again. Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Ok, here is the deal with Bundle Monster...it absolutely works!!!  Yes, in the beginning, I thought it was garbage and didnt work.  I purchased the Konad double ended stamper and attempted to use it without any success with transferring the designs to the nail. HOWEVER, upon watching a youtube video about \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; the rubber ends of the stamper with a nail file, I tried it and this solved the entire problem.  Im sure others have posted their ideas on what works, but here are some thoughts of my own.  I wear acrylic nails, so here are my tips on how to use bundle monster designs with acrylics.  NOTE: if you are using this kit with your own natural nails, be sure to press firmly and roll the stamper from one side to the other. The stamper has a curved surface and so do your natural nails, so pressing straight down without rolling will not allow for a smooth transfer.  How to use with Acrylic Nails:  Prepare the nail tips/designs before you glue them to your nails to allow for trial and error.  For me, Wet N&#x27; Wild nail polishes works great!  Try Wet N&#x27; Wild Shine, Fastdry or Megalast.  Dark colors work fantastic, BUT when using bright colors like yellow, orange and green, use dark yellow, dark orange and dark green to ensure the color shows up well against the desired background.  1) First, buff the rubber of the stamper with a nail file to ensure it picks up the designs  2) Second, paint the artificial nail in desired color and let dry  3) Since artifical nails are curved, hold the nail horizontally between your thumb nail and index finger...why you ask...because when you apply the stamper/design, you want to be able to roll the stamper across the nail with ease preventing any gaps (again...the stamper also has a curved surface, so if not done correctly, only a portion of the design will transfer).  4) Once the design has been transferred, apply a clear top coat to the artificial nail tip and let dry (the clear coat will prevent the design from smudging when applyingthe acrylic to your nails.  5) Now, you can glue on the nails and apply the acrylic without any worry of any mistakes or having to redo the nails. It is sooo much easier to prep artificial nails before they are attached to allow for touch ups if you do make mistakes...cause believe me...you will make mistakes especially if you are new to nail stamping like myself.  8) Optional...once finished, jazz it up a bit by adding clear/colored rhinestones randomly across the nail to really make it pop and sparkle!!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is this is great value and outstanding quality, just like the originals from konad. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these plates. They&#x27;re a great supplement to the real thing (especially if you already have the scraper and polishes from Konad).  My only gripe is that well, some of these plates have ugly images! HA! But that&#x27;s going to happen with any plates, you&#x27;re going to have some ugly ones so you can get access to the pretty ones.  All in all, a great purchase. I&#x27;ve used a good 2/3s of the images on these plates and so far, no issues. Very well made.</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with this product. The images are awesome and I know I&#x27;m really gonna&#x27; take my nail art to the next level!</li>
            <li> The new Bundle Monster plate are brilliant, very pretty and nice design.  I would recommend anyone to buy it if they love konading but don&#x27;t want to pay the price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use any of them and there are tons of lovely designs I tried. I work fast, use Konad polishes and other polishes. Own about 50 or so varnishes ranging from Wet n Wild to Essie and Sally Hanson. All to no avail. The indentations are so shallow they don&#x27;t allow for any stamping to occur. Waste of money. I guess from good reviews, it&#x27;s either hit or miss. I guess I got the short straw. Can&#x27;t return them but will contact the company to complain. Thought all my family would love a set but won&#x27;t order again. I followed all the directions. Nothing would transfer at all. Not happy camper.</li>
            <li> The plates are really good and I love that so many came in the pkg and the price was pretty good too. I don&#x27;t have any complaints. I&#x27;ve used several nail polishes with the plates and as long as you use enough you will have no problems.</li>
            <li> I own the first Bundle Monster plate set and it is awesome. The difference between the two is these new plates are all different designs and each design is allot bigger in size. The design wraps around each nail very well. You are going to love these new plates if you already own the first set. If you don&#x27;t have either set, this would be a great new start, but the first set is also great. I love bundle monster and their customer service is great.

            <li> BM perfected their plates! I love my first set of BM plates and this is wayyyy better.  It has nice backings,so the edges are not sharp, the blue cover so you&#x27;d know to peel it off before use. and best of all! full size images are bigger to suit the thumb!!!I can&#x27;t be happier about this set and its well worth the money.  The designs are a lot more modern and prettier than the previous set.  As always BM plates transfer really well, there isn&#x27;t an image that I used that has problem transferring yet and for BM1 theres only 1 image that didn&#x27;t transfer for me.  There&#x27;s a lot of images on this set that i would classify as asian motifs! which is great! Ive been lusting over konad&#x27;s s6 and im so glad i didn&#x27;t purchase it because the new BM satisfy all my asian motif nail art needs!</li>
            <li> I think the images are awesome, but they are not etched in deep enough.  Many of the images just don&#x27;t transfer which is annoying because the image selection is great.  I don&#x27;t get why the images aren&#x27;t made deep enough into the plate!! I also have the MASH plates which are a knockoff brand of Konad and they are made perfectly.  Im just disappointed that BM couldn&#x27;t make the images alittle better so they all transfer perfectly too.</li>
            <li> The plates are great, I love that the full-nail designs are larger. The etching seems deeper than the original BM kit.  Wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I love these plates. Bundle monster did a great job with theses plates. Best thing is that they are larger and the edges a nice an dull. The images come out nice and clear! Good quality for a great price</li>
            <li> I was waiting for my purchase with impatience. Shipping was very fast. I liked the Plates. There are many different designs. But there was a small disadvantage: one plate has been scratched, but it is not much spoiled the design. And there are several designs that are cut very thin, because of this they do not get stamped on the nails. But overall - I&#x27;m very happy, I really like the plates.</li>
            <li> I love these plates!  This set is even better than the first.  The full nail images are bigger, the designs are interesting, and the quality and pricing are excellent.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of Bundle Monster nail stamping plates. I am happy with the designs and the size of the designs. Having the first bundle I see the difference immediately that the full nail designs have been enlarged and widen to what can equate to a Konad full design size. As luck would have it the one plate I was totally excited about was the one that did not work.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company and told them BM-207 (piano keys) did not transfer.&lt;br /&gt;The plate just wasn&#x27;t etched enough and in trying to use it had zero transfer happening.&lt;br /&gt;The company was speedy in their response and are sending out a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip:&lt;br /&gt;Before I tried any of the plates from any of the three brands I own...&lt;br /&gt;I run my finger over each design plate as I remove the blue film.&lt;br /&gt;This is where you see right away if there may be an issue with a plates etching.&lt;br /&gt;Try to transfer the design in question first.&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s a bad plate contact the company immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Stamping!</li>
            <li> These nail plate designs work very well and give a lot of variety. Great product, so glad that I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of luck with other plates but the two Bundle Monster sets I purchased gave me nothing but duds.  I have not tried every single plate but I have tried about half and so far I can&#x27;t get a decent transfer off one.  It&#x27;s so disappointing because the designs are great.</li>
            <li> This is a definite improvement on quality of images. I have naturally longer base nails and the full size images from the first batch of BM covered only 2/3 of my nail...this covers the entire nail! Loving it!! Hope they come out with more originals!! Maybe even create sets on one plate. I hate looking for matching designs on different plates. Just a thought...</li>
            <li> I am always doing my nails and creating designs so I decided to look into nail art plates to save myself some time. My sister got the pack of 21 plates a while back and I decided to get my own, but got the 25 pack instead! (Counted my number of plates and found out I got 26 instead -- I got doubles of BM-219!)    The price is definitely worth it (~$0.88 per plate vs. $6.99 on ebay.)    It takes a couple of tries for the image to come out clean, and it takes a lot of patience. However, the payoff is totally worth it. Be sure to work quickly because your polish may dry up when you&#x27;re ready to stamp it, and clean the plate after each stamp to get the best results! (:</li>
            <li> This is the second edition of Bundle Monster plates.  Previously, I had purchased the first set of plates that Bundle monster sells and I now have this 2nd edition.  The plates are really great!!  I have tried them all and I must say that bundle monster are good plates to stamp with.  I like the variety of the different designs and this 2nd series offer some really cool designs to work with.  I have posted a pic of one of my nail designs.  Also, their shipments are very securely packaged.  I have been very pleased with my plates and this seller.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for so many stamping plates and great for begginers. I am very pleased with this and I would definitly recommened this to some one who loves doing nail art. The shipping was great and came 4 days after ordered it.The packaging was also nicely done. Thanks Bundle Monster :)</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product on Sept 23rd. After the estimated delivery date and still no delivered package I email  Bundle Monster. They were very quick to respond and to offer me my money back or to ship another package since mine had gotten lost.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order another package and recieved it in about 3 business days. Once I got the plates I was so satisfied with their quality and all the different designs included. I love my nailart stamps!! I&#x27;ll definately order some more.</li>
            <li> I love these plates. They arrive on time and they look really good. HOWEVER, i got a duplicate of plate 214, the one with the deer and Christmas hat. I didnt get plate 206 sigh, this is why i gave 4 stars. But i still love the plates i have and i would recommend bundle monster as i have gotten great items from them in the past. So, even though there was this hiccup i am still happy and excited and i do like the designs plus there is a lot of them to choose from. Happy stamping :) !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, these Bundle Monster plates are fantastics ! I have tried a dozen, and all are 100% ok for stamping. The draws are cute and pretty. Sorry for my english, hope it Will help you to take a d√©cision : go !</li>
            <li> I purchased these plates after reading many of the reviews. Many people were very happy that the image were much larger on this set than the first step, so I decided to buy this set. The package came very quickly and as for the images themselves, they were very pretty.The only draw back I had is that some of the full nail images did not cover my thumb or middle finger. My finers are not tiny, and I was very disapointed that the images still did not cover my full nail. This product would have received 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for this. I love the plates and my kids love the designs. I would purchase this product again if bundle monster would make the full nail image plates a little larger. (please consider that not everyones nails are tiny.)</li>
            <li> I purchased the first set and then this set.  I&#x27;m going to be purchasing the third set when it comes out.  I really love Bundle Monster.  TONS of designs for a GREAT value.  I have many other sets: Red Angel, Shany, Cheeky and I MUST say this one far surpasses them all!  Great job BUNDLE MONSTER, you have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Decent buy but not the best. Some plates work good and some are completly horrible. For the most part I am happy to have them for once in awhile nail painting sessions.</li>
            <li> Not only do you get more choices (designs) in this bundle, IT\\&quot;s ALSO CHEAPER THAN THE KONAD PLATES! I&#x27;ve tried them and they work perfectly well. I live in California, so the only thing I would say I don&#x27;t like about it where it&#x27;s being shipped from. They ship from Honolulu so it took a while... but I&#x27;m impatient, so that&#x27;s probably why I&#x27;m complaining about it. Go buy these! They are worth the money. Instead of paying 6+ for 1 KONAD plate.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product. I absolutely love it. The designs are beautiful and the plates work perfectly. It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> These plates are a great value compared to Konad plates. The images are cute and easy to use. I ordered both sets of bundle monsters at the same time and received a duplicate plate and missing another. Customer service was awesome. I just emailed them and they sent me a replacement!!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set of nail plates.  There is a great selection of images and they work well.  I have tried at least one image from each image plate so far, and have not had any issues with any of them.  The full nail designs are the perfect size for my nails!  My nails look great, thank you Bundle Monster! :)</li>
            <li> The designs in this set are gorgeous, the full nail images are much bigger--actually a bit big for my nails--and the backing does make them less sharp.  The quality is excellent, and it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy about this set! The full images are now bigger and fit my nails. Thank you bundle monster for listening to your customers! You guys rock!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much yet another great product I am so enjoying this right and this is way better then the first set I order thank you so much and it was well packed. I will keep a look out for more of your wonderful products.</li>
            <li> I just recently started getting interested in nail art/stamping.  I had purchased a few cometitors brand plates which retailed for over $7.00 a plate!  When I heard about this new Bundle Monster set I knew I had to try it.  This set has an assortment of very delicate floral patterns, tip designs, and geometric shapes (as well as a few animal prints).  There is a great balance of designs so it is sure to please everyone!    I also like how each plate came with a blue shield to protect it from scratching while in the mail.  The image plate sizes are also slightly bigger than in the original Bundle Monster plate set, and this comes in handy for people like me who have a wider nail beds.    Overall, even for a \\&quot;novice\\&quot; this set a not only SUPERBLY priced, but also very very very easy to use with endless stamping possibilities.      This product also shipped very fast and arrived in perfect condition.    Very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Please DO NOT IGNORE this review. THE PLATES ARE NOT ETCHED DEEP ENOUGH. The nailpolish WILL NOT TRANSFER over to the stamper. I have tried multiple times. It will only transfer BIG designs and even then, it did not pick up every thing. SMALL DESIGNS DO NOT TRANSFER. I bought this pack solely for the \\&quot;chevron\\&quot; pattern and it was TOO SMALL and etched POORLY. Do not waste your money until they change the quality of their plates. I want a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because you get a lot more plates than you would with Konad plates and for a fraction of the price. However, I have gone through probably about half my stack of plates testing each design, and MANY of my designs will not transfer onto my Konad stamper. I have noticed that a lot of the more detailed ones will not transfer well, though some larger prints won&#x27;t either. I was sad that the ONE plate I mainly wanted in this set was one of the ones that will not work. However, for the price it&#x27;s okay seeing as one single plate through Konad is about $5-$6. There are a lot of full nail patterns, manicure tip patterns, and a lot of little images, though I have noticed very few of my smaller images will transfer correctly. I think it&#x27;s hit or miss with these things. I read the reviews before I purchased them and most of the reviews are really good, it&#x27;s just too bad that some of the designs are just not made properly and I can&#x27;t use them. The ones that do work, however, are great and I plan on using them.</li>
            <li> wow is all i can say these are so way better than the old bm pack im so in love with em</li>
            <li> I just recently bought these plates and I love them! The quality is much better than their first set and every image I have used so far has worked. The only downside is that there aren&#x27;t as many \\&quot;cute\\&quot; images in this set. There are a lot of all over nail images, but they are mostly geometric designs. I was hoping for maybe some more stars or something along those lines. There are plenty of Halloween and Christmas images though! I love the backing that they put on them as well. Also, the best thing, the images that cover the whole nail are now larger for those of us who have wider nails. Can&#x27;t wait for their next set!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of nail-stamping. I purchased the original Bundle Monster kit [[ASIN:B003ILUQPM Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 21pc]] and was, like others, disappointed with the size of the full-nail designs. Well, this set goes above and beyond my expectations.    It&#x27;s nearly ALL full-nail designs, with some great nail-tip designs. The best part, the very best part, is that there is NO repetition between either the BM1 set or the MASH set [[ASIN:B004IZX4OM MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit]] and very few similar designs, although some of the small BM1 full-nail designs have larger counterparts in this set. When the best value comes in sets, you want each set to be fully valuable, and it certainly is, in this case.    The error level has also improved. In my BM1 kit, there were a couple plates with tiny gobs of metal in the actual design, leaving a gap when stamped. I only had one tiny tiny such blemish on this entire set of 25. There are now backings on each plate, so no sharp edges! Also, like many others, I got some doubles! I wanted to get a friend of mine into stamping, so I gave her the doubles and a couple of my BM1 plates for her children with small nails.    The designs vary a lot and are all interesting. Many nail design plates I&#x27;ve looked at on the internet are just plate after plate of swirls and flowers. Yes, there are a lot of flowers in all plate sets, but this BM2 has so much variety and truly interesting designs.    I&#x27;m thrilled, and if Bundle Monster makes a third set, I will buy it as soon as I find out!</li>
            <li> These plates are a really great value. They work just as well as the Konad plates, and they have a lot of fun designs.  It averages about $1.14 per plate, whereas Konad plates are anywhere from $3-7 each.  The engravings feel slightly rougher than the Konad plates, but the images still transfer from stamper to nail nicely.</li>
            <li> Recib√≠ dos platos repetidos, y faltaban dos. Se lo comuniqu√© y me enviaron r√°pidamente los dos que me faltaban sin coste alguno, y no fue necesario enviar los dos repetidos. Muy amables y responsables. En cuanto al producto, genial, funciona bien y los dise√±os son muy interesantes, aunque no he probado todos a√∫n.  Lo recomendar√© por el gran servicio de atencion al cliente, que da confianza y seguridad.</li>
            <li> I love these new plates!  All the improvements are great and I love that they listened to their customers.  I also had great customer service.  There were some issues with a few plates so I contacted the seller.  There was a personal email already waiting in my inbox when I closed the browser after filling out the form.  The sent replacement plates out right away and I didn&#x27;t have to send the old plates back either.  Nice!</li>
            <li> Cool concept but I haven&#x27;t quite mastered nail stamping yet. The only problem was they sent me 2 of the same disks so I&#x27;m now missing a disk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing Konad for about 2 years and I jumped at the opportunity to buy these plates. There are so many fun designs. I really do love them. The one criticism I have is that most of the all over nail designs don&#x27;t cover my thumbs. This is a little frustrating, but for the price and amount of plates I got, I can&#x27;t complain very much.</li>
            <li> all the plates are there with no repeats or none missing. there&#x27;s a few scratches but they don&#x27;t interfere with the image when you pick it up. it arrived the last day in the expected delivery date. i really love them. i can&#x27;t wait to test out all of them! :D</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping. I ordered it and got it the next day. It was well packed and worked really well. The only down fall was that the image plate BM-201 was not really centered so the image got kinda cut off over all its really good...5 stars from me(:</li>
            <li> These plates shipped really fast, I got them 5 days after I ordered them. The price is great and the images are really fun. It has a lot of full nail designs that fit my nails and the designs are really fun. There weren&#x27;t any repeats of designs and none of the etchings are messed up. If you have a problem with them transferring to the stamper it is usually because you aren&#x27;t applying enough pressure (you don&#x27;t need to press that hard) or you are pressing too hard. I have used these for more than a month and most of my regular nail polishes work really well with them. I usually end up doing my nails one a week or more because they are so fun to do! Love them!!</li>
            <li> This, I believe, is the second nail plates set from Bundle Monster. As described, it features mostly full nail designs. This set is a vast improvement from the first BM plates (you can read more about my gripes about the first set).   Pros:   The plates actually come with a paper backing this time, but the edges are still a bit sharp, so use caution.   The quality of the design engravings is better than the first set.   The full nail designs are bigger this time around, so they actually cover your whole nail.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!   Cons:   The plates \\&quot;feel\\&quot; cheap; they are lighter, and don&#x27;t feel as durable as the Konad plates.   When my plates arrived, some of them were bent. I tried to straighten them out as much as I can, but the plates still appear warped. This may effect how the designs transfer on the stamp (have not tried them yet, will edit review when I get around to that).   Again, you get what you pay for. All around, with the exception of the low price, the BM plates do not compare to the Konad plates.</li>
            <li> When I look at these plates, my heart skips a beat. I remember that day when I got that long-awaited parcel and ran home. I&#x27;m so glad that I have these plates - it&#x27;s the best thing I could try. Even conad much inferior to them, many small figures conad still misfire and not fully translated. The Bundle Monster I am delighted, all her friends and to you the reader hyped too unequivocally advise to get his pet Monster ^ _ ^</li>
            <li> This was definitely money well spent. You get a whole lot of different designs, from full nail designs, individual ones, to fancy french tip designs. Not a single design was repeated and I loved how there were themed designs like skulls and ghosts for Halloween and a gingerbread cookie and holly for Christmas. These were cut well so the design transfers perfectly. Fast shipping, great customer service and you get what you signed up for. Good things all around!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Konad plates, so I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re any better. I&#x27;m a novice at nail art and a bit of a perfectionist, which means it took me all day to get my nails right the first time I tried this. You must roughly file the stamper first so it picks up the image. I didn&#x27;t buy the \\&quot;Special Polish,\\&quot; but instead tested all the polishes I had to see if they worked with the image plates &amp; showed up on the stamper. Metallic ones showed best, but I have a lot of others that worked great too. It gives you a lot of color combos to work with &amp; doesn&#x27;t bleed your wallet dry.  I like these image plates better than the Bundle Monster 21-pack I purchased for someone else, but that has nothing to do with the quality, it&#x27;s just personal design preference. These image plates are sturdy, but I agree with other reviews that say not to use the Konad scraper that comes with the stamper. It really scratches the plates up &amp; over time I can definitely see this causing a problem with the image, so I started using an expired credit card. Every gift card I tried wasn&#x27;t sturdy enough, but the credit card is. To get it to work though, you need to practice with it a bit. At first, I&#x27;d recommend not fully painting your nails with the base &amp; color, but just stamping the images on there to test it out so you don&#x27;t waste your polish. Also, I found myself using my thumbnails a lot to correct mistakes &amp; using them the most when removing polish from other fingers I screwed up on with a cotton ball &amp; polish remover. It was really annoying to have to do my whole finger over because it smudged or the cotton got stuck in it, so now I save my thumbs for last, once all other nails are completely done &amp; dry.  Practice makes perfect, so I&#x27;ll be trying a new design this week.</li>
            <li> Nearly all the plates stamps perfectly, found 2 plates with not so good etching, therefore, unable to retain enough polish for stamping transfer.</li>
            <li> Great plates! A whole lot new images for everyone who likes stamping. The plates are better than the first series because they are laminated on the back, so less change to cut yourself. I love them!</li>
            <li> Pros:  - shipped incredibly fast  - amazing price in comparison to name brand (Konad plates)  - variety of styles and designs  - plates seem very durable, not flimsy, good quality  - large images cover a large nail bed  Cons  - some repeated prints  - MAJORITY of the plates consisted of full nail designs (see details below)  - not exactly my preference of prints (this is a personal choice that will differ between users)  - lacking smaller individual prints (ie. individual flowers or various other small designs)  I had actually received my order a couple of weeks ago and I wanted to give them a fair review before posting. I think the plates are great for the reasons mentioned above.  I also believe that the type of polish makes a great difference in the quality of prints you will obtain.  Using the Konad special polish or a thicker polish will yield the best results. Of the 25 plates, 5 of them were specifically for tips. The remaining 20 consisted of ALMOST all large designs. These large full nail designs consists of lots of geometric shapes, swirls, large flow patterns, etc.  I honestly do not like the majority of the prints which consists of things such as zippers, aliens, a reindeer, santa cap, bats, and a sleigh (to name a few:) The quality of the plates are amazing. I haven&#x27;t yet come across a plate that is not etched properly. When I thought I found such a plate I realized that I had simply been scraping too much polish off. To avoid this I suggest using a used gift card or an old credit card. This works a lot better than using the metal scraper.  All in all I gave these plates a 4 out of 5 simply because I do not like the print selection. I think it is aimed for a younger audience. Other than that the product does exactly what it says it does. I actually intend to order this as a gift.</li>
            <li> This thing just doesn&#x27;t work.   it takes ten tries to get one design....its so frustrating that by the time ur done with one, you have no energy to finish your nails.  I haven&#x27;t tried the Konad but this was definitely not worth the time or money</li>
            <li> The new Bundle Monster image plates are very nice!!! I received them in record time, really fast shipping!!! Really nice designs, great price, fits nails, love the thickness/backing. Compared to name brand plates these are really nice for the price. I also have Mash plates and these are just as nice as they are. If you like doing nails get these, they are super easy to work with and at eighty eight cents per plate that is  a deal that cant be passed up!Get them now, you will love em too(and no I am not associated with bm :) .)</li>
            <li> Thank you monster for listening to us. I love all the plates. The only thing i have a little problem with is some of the images don&#x27;t always like to lift onto the stamp easily to place it on my finger. But other then that, i do love this set better!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> WOW, these are great quality. As always, They stamp very well. the images are clear and the fine detail is great. You wont be disappointed with this set.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter. Item is as described by seller. We are both pleased with the purchase. Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li> I Am NOT HAPPY With My Purchase.    I bought the set as the price was good $ 17.99 (old one), but most of the images would not transfer. Where as when I use my KONAD plates the images transfer so well. I think there designs are not engraved deep enough. I wish they had a return policy, so, that I could return the product to them. Earlier I was thinking that I will buy the new design plates, but now after trying the old ones I don&#x27;t think I will.</li>
            <li> This is the second set that I got of these and have referred several more to purchase and myself as well as my nail tech and my daughter have all LOVED them!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Pedi dos paquetes y en uno de ellos faltaba una placa.  Escribi explicando lo que ocurria.  Me respondieron que me la enviarian y efectivamente a los pocos dias recibi la placa sin coste alguno.      Respecto a las placas, aunque no las he probado todas hasta ahora estoy muy contenta, estampan muy bien y el tama√±o es perfecto para u√±as grandes.    Lo recomiendo.    Saludos.

            <li> I have to say that my experience with Bundle Monster Plates has been amazing. When I bought the first set I couldn¬¥t believe how nice the plates were and how well they worked. When I knew about the second set I didn¬¥t hesitate to order it immediately, and I have to admit that they are even much more original than the first ones and that their quality is quite superior because they have a background which is really resistent and nice. ALL the designs work perfectly on the stamper! I love them!!! I¬¥m looking forward hearing about the 3rd set!!! XXX</li>
            <li> these are on par with the konad brand plates but wayyyy cheaper! i received a good variety of patterns and it worked out to about $1 per plate, compared to the $7 i paid for the konad brand ones. they work well and seem to be exactly the same besides the plate numbers! so pumped i found out about these. i definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!! They are amazing and work great. The images are awesome and hope more will be made with even more amazing images!</li>
            <li> i just got my orders in today. shipping was super fast but when i was looking at my bundle monster plates i noticed there was two plates that was repeated. I don&#x27;t know if it was a mistake or what, but i was a bit disappointed in that. other than that, love the designs</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this set. I&#x27;ve been using Konad plates for a few years now, and was recently introduced to Bundle Monster. I ordered this set and received 2 duplicates and 1 missing - which was remedied *immediately* by Bundle Monster. Excellent customer service!    The plates are good, the images are scored deep enough to get a good coat of polish and a proper result when stamping. The choices of designs on this set are excellent and I&#x27;ve been able to do some fun creative nails - and a canvas! - with these plates.    The blue film on the plates on arrival is nice, it appears to keep the plate smooth until you unwrap it, and there is a minimum of extra packaging. Each plate fits nicely into my current holder and cleanup is, as has been, very easy.    I was not sold on these plates until my friend bought her set and let me look  through them. Something about looking at the images on the website just was not quite enough for me. But I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife.  She used me as her test subject.  I have to say my nails turned out gay and even I felt fabulous.  Extra designs are always a plus for any of the ladies looking to be more creative and stand out.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with our Nailart Stamps.  Get it today!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been playing around with these and think I&#x27;m getting the hang of it.  It is fun and easy!  Definitely happy with my purchase.  As others have said, some of the designs dont work so well.</li>
            <li> Ok, so first of all I received my image plates sooo fast...2 business day as a matter of fact and it was free!The images were etched perfectly except for 1 image. But that&#x27;s fine with me because there are 25 plates full of images, that are so beautiful by the way. Most of the designs in this series are full-nail and tip designs, rather than the small designs on the first series. It just depends on what your style is. You can make everything unique and your own. The backing on the plates prevents damage and they aren&#x27;t so sharp. The blue film definitely helps, unlike the clear one on the first series. And if you don&#x27;t know how to use them there are tons of videos on youtube that show you. Overall, I am extremely satisfied :)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and figured whatever I&#x27;ll give it a try its cheaper than my Konad plates which I got 3 or 4 and a bottle of black white pink and green polish and a stamper [...] I just got it today and tried it immediately, lots of the designs DO NOT work, but many do, if you want full nail designs I would say buy it its a decent value but if your looking for smaller designs like me, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it. Some of the designs do not work and I noticed there&#x27;s a tendency for the full nail designs to work better than the small ones that I would apply 2 or 3 times on one nail. For example the skull design on 225 and 211 do not print, that was one of the designs I was excited about, the star on 206 won&#x27;t work but the full nail design with circles works and the heart design works fine on the same plate. I was going to buy a second set from here if I liked them I was going to buy the 21 piece set but I think I might delay that and instead buy a single Konad plate or maybe a few because I trust them.</li>
            <li> this was a gift to my cousin, and she likes it very much, using it every day to on transparent nails.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCTS. BARGAIN PRICE AND FAST SHIPPING THANKS.  thanks seller for fast shipping and keep it up! hoping for the next bundle monster plate set3 soon. i love BM plates. The designs are superb.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to receive bundle yesterday, ..I think the images are great,, veryyyyyyyyy cheap,,I LOVE IT,,i am glad that i  order 2 set of  this Set Kit 25pc., one for gift and one for myself.</li>
            <li> I order a set of the nail art stamping image plate set, for  my grandkids for chirstmas. They came in the mail Monday. I decide to try them out, I can&#x27;t get any of them to work. I think they suck real bad I wasted all that money on junk . Does anybody know how I can get my money back.</li>
            <li> These are great plates. The images come out nice and clean. However the one MAJOR flaw is that the full nail images are way too narrow. The only nail I can completely cover with an image is my pinkie nail. It is very disappointing and is why I can only give the product 3 stars. :-(</li>
            <li> This pack was a very good deal- at least the price was. I love the designs, but the stamps are not nearly deep enough; hardly any of the images fully transfer, regardless of the polish I use, how clean the stamper and plates are, how quickly or slowly I work, etc. I also have the Konad plates, and the difference in quality is extreme; I will be sticking with Konad and putting my BM plates on my swap list. :/</li>
            <li> All around great service. It was my first time using Amazon, and I will def. use it again!   Bundle Monster was fab...QUICK, NO HIDDEN FEES!...exactly what I wanted :)</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  The images are wonderful, and they come out clean and crisp when stamped on the nail.  Very good value for the price.  Would recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> Gostaria de saber sobre a entrega do produto que comprei dia  28/10 e o prazo de entrega era do dia 15/11 ao dia 01/12 e at√© agora n√£o chegou, como posso rastrear a entrega.  Grata</li>
            <li> This is my first stamping purchase.  The designs are good. There isn&#x27;t a standard french tip template which disappointed me.  I need a lot of practice, but just in messing with it for about 1/2 an hour I got better and better.  Not sure about nail polish.  I don&#x27;t have the konad stamping polish, wondering if it would work better than what I was trying to use.</li>
            <li> These plates were very easy to use, they come with a paper backing and a protective plastic seal. The full nail images are large enough for my index finger, but not large enough for my thumb. They gave clear results, and were shipped very quickly - I would recommend them if you don&#x27;t want to pay an arm and a leg for Konad.</li>
            <li> I ordered the BM 25 nail plates 2 weeks ago. It came within 3 business days. Some of the images are not stamping well, so I called customer service. They sent replacement plates to me right the way. The replacement plates are stamping way better. As I was doing my nails again 2 nights ago, I discovered more images were not stamping clearly( I don&#x27;t have time to try all images in a week), so I called customer service 2nd time. They are sending me the replacement plates again. Overall, I am really statify with the purchase. Just expect not all the images are perfect and don&#x27;t hesitate to call customer service.</li>
            <li> I got my 25 plate set two days ago and I love it! It&#x27;s easy to use, but it does take practice; my friend and I bought a bunch of fake nails to practice color combinations and images:that was a blast! it made our rainy Friday so much fun ;) We&#x27;re using cheap $1 and $2 nail polish and they all work just fine, although I&#x27;m thinking about getting the white Konad nail polish, since ours doesn&#x27;t show as much as I&#x27;d want to. The shipping was fast and my set was complete. I LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> I got these because I had the other bundle monster plates and I heard that these were much better. I love these for the fact that they were bigger and fit my nail better and the engravings were deeper so the stamp picked them up easier. The only problem I had was there were duplicates in my set. Overall they work great.</li>
            <li> My 10 years old girl was very happy to get it ,&lt;br /&gt;Item was as describ and brand new&lt;br /&gt;Nice design .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> If your not really fast, the nail polish will dry. I have tried SHANY brand, which is what typically pairs with nail stamping. This nail polish is supposed to dry slower. I&#x27;ve tried it with OPI (fyi doesn&#x27;t work, definately not quick enough).&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual plate review:&lt;br /&gt;Good quality, what you would expect. Designs are lacking on this set- I don&#x27;t see many options and I am pretty creative. There are a lot of holiday options with this set and a cute piano design. Other than that, designs could use a re-vamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again--but now after realizing that nail design takes a lot of time. Keep in mind that you have to have the following on hand:&lt;br /&gt;cotton ball, nail polish remover, extra cotton ball to dry each plate, after each stamp. Everytime you make a stamp, you have to remove all nail polish from the plate and then re-do it per each stamp. Times that process by 10 and your looking at a good hour for both hands! Personally I would rather go to the nail salon and have someone do it then spend this much time on my nails. However, if you love pampering yourself and spending time (alot of time) on yourslef, do not hesitate to purchase this set by bundle monster...</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality plates comparable to Konad.  They have some unique images which I definitely love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again if they release a new set of images.</li>
            <li> I first came in contact with stamping plate a few months ago, and I must say, I was hooked from the moment I first laid eyes on them. I convinced my fiance to buy me a few sets for Christmas (finally!), and I must say, I am still deeply in love with stamping. I got both this and the first sets put out by BundleMonster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates seem smaller than I anticipated, but they work great. As a novice with stamping plates, I have had much more success with full-nail designs than most of the individual designs I have tried. The more intricate designs which feature thin lines are somewhat difficult to work with, but persistence is key - just glance at your design before you stamp it to make sure the whole thing is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one significant downside to these plates, however. I have found myself wanting to change my mani WAAAAYYYY before it needs to be. I think I might be investing in more colors sooner than I anticipated. Also - be aware, due to the thin nature of the design, most colors tend to be lighter than what you&#x27;ll expect, so be sure to use your most opaque colors or buy some of the special Konad stamping polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Stamping!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have also purchased these for my nieces and they love them. The plates stamp just as well as konad and cost a lot less. Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love my plates! A few of them don&#x27;t work at all but the bulk of them do!</li>
            <li> Really happy with the stamping plates!  They work perfectly.  It&#x27;s just hard to place them perfectly on your nail and takes some practice :)</li>
            <li> I received these along with the first set for Valentine&#x27;s Day from my Husband and I truly Love them...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one and they all stamp extremely well...!!! :)</li>
            <li> The product is really as I imagined it and it works very well and was sent on time and even earlier.</li>
            <li> Received my image plates and attempted to use them......none of the images would transfer onto my stamper and when i scrapped the ink off the plate there was none left.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> these plates are absolutley amazing they shipped fast and are so much fun to use there are so many different options on the plates and its definatley worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is my third set of plates. I really like these plates. There are some really cool designs with this set. There is a backing on the plate so it makes it nice. There were no doubles in the set which was great. Also there was no issues with stamping. I have a konad and a mash stamper and they both work.</li>
            <li> The plates were excellent in variety. I highly recommend them. I would definately purchase from this store again, I was completely satisfied and can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li> Cool designs. I haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet but most of the ones I have have worked really good. They look really pretty on short nails, I was a little worried about that. I&#x27;m looking forward to their next new set, I&#x27;ll probably get those too.</li>
            <li> seriously, just as good as the Konad plates. i was hesitant on such a good deal, but the plates are great. there are no sharp edges, the image is nice and crisp, and although ive only used two of the plates so far, i have not experianced any issues.</li>
            <li> I agonized for waaaaaay too long over who to purchase from, and settled on bundle monster. I&#x27;m very happy I did! Every plate looked great, every one we have used (even my 9yo daughter) has turned out very well. Will definitely order again from them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Been buying and dealing with these folks for about a year or so....They are kind, fast, and quality people and products with more than fair pricing :)    My only wish is that they continue making more designs, cause I&#x27;m hooked and I Won&#x27;t support their Competitor !!!!    Have a great day , I tell everyone who sees my nails about you guys :)</li>
            <li> Love these plates. They work great, are good quality and a terrific bargain, to boot. Mine arrived fast and in near perfect condition. The plastic film was easy to remove and the paper backing on these new plates make them less sharp and easier to handle. If you want great stamping plates for a good price, try these. :D</li>
            <li> This is the second bundle monter&#x27; plates I buy and I&#x27;m always happy with ! It work good and motifs are easy to stamp !  I will buy a third !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been notified that this product arrived a week ago. But this is not true. I don&#x27;t receive anything.  I think that I will not purchase anything here anymore.</li>
            <li> I was amazed with the amount of plates I received. With this set, there is so much to choose from and I can actually see the design on my big toes. I like the fact that some of the plates have large images. I am satisfied with my purchase and hoped that Bundle Monster come out with more images. If you like nail art, you will not be bored with this set. It is been some time since I bought this set and I am still ecited about it. What about some nail polish, Bundle Monster!!</li>
            <li> This is a super great deal for any one who loves nail stamping as much as I do . You will enjoy all the designs .And the price is super as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a month now and they are absolutely fantastic! The designs are incredible and all of them work beautifully. The only &amp;#34;struggle&amp;#34; of using them is finding polishes that actually work for the stamping. A little experimenting goes a long way to finding different things to try with these. The shipment came in a day earlier than expected and the packaging and plates were in perfect condition. Would definitely recommend for anyone (:</li>
            <li> I love all these stamps. There are so many designs that I could have something different on my nails every single day!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased these after having bought (and used) the other BM collection.  I love love love this set.  The edges aren&#x27;t sharp like the other ones (they&#x27;re obviously listening to feedback)... the patterns are gorgeous and fresh and there are a lot more full nail designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am so very glad I bought these... if you&#x27;re trying to decide between this set and the other set... I definitely recommend these over the first set.  Lots and lots of full nail designs and higher quality overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super great fun product and great value!</li>
            <li> I got both bundles. I must say I like this set better then the 21pc. Unlike the first set this one is nearly flawless. Plate BM203 has burns on two of the designs, I haven&#x27;t used this plate yet but it shouldn&#x27;t interfere with the stamping process. The full nail deigns are bigger but still leave a thin space for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Many deigns to pick from.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper, then other plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;They are dupes.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading all the reviews still a bit on the fence about them. You get so many plates with such pretty designs, it can be a bit overwhelming. I would say over all, this was a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I gave them a 4 because as some others stated, you will find a couple patterns that are not cut deep enough into the metal plate, so the design does not want to stick. Really the only complaint I have. With so many designs to choose from though, It hasn&#x27;t really made a huge difference. I know that some people stated that the plates had sharp edges that cut them. Not sure if I am just lucky or what, but all of mine were fine. Haven&#x27;t cut myself yet.&lt;br /&gt;I would say for the price and selection you get it&#x27;s worth it to buy them. I have been very happy with them. Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> This set is great and very inexpensive. Worth the money. Designs are well carved in the image plate so they are very easy to get on your nails.  Any Nail polish works as long as it&#x27;s an opaque color. The reason I have four stars instead of five is because my set was missing a plate, but the seller said its on it&#x27;s way.</li>
            <li> I saw these advertised on a fashion website, and they&#x27;re cute. However, the plates didn&#x27;t include the pattern that was showcased which was a disappointment. They are still cute though.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted!!</li>
            <li> I love these plates. When I received the order it was missing a plate, but after notifying Bundle Monster, they sent that plate right away. These plates are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require the Konrad stamping polish.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my Bundle Monster Nail Art Stamping Plates, I did read some &#x27;not-so-good&#x27; reviews that they weren&#x27;t wide enough to fit your nails and that they weren&#x27;t deep enough to give you the perfect detailed stamp, however my experience with the Bundle Monter Stamping Plates was different. They stamped great, the image was very detailed, I could see exactly what design is on each plate and the image once stamped was awesome! The image isn&#x27;t large enough to fit some of my larger nails, but with some practice and patience, I was able to get it to work. For the money, I would say that these are perfect! I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $5+ for only 4-5 designs when I could get 5-6 designs(25 plates) for a lot less money. They shipped way before the estimated delivery date which was awesome! I couldn&#x27;t wait to get stamping so I did do a different design on each nail and also had a lot of fun playing around with each design! Thanks Bundle Monster and Amazon for the great products!</li>
            <li> I could not get a single image to work out of all 25 plates. I am very upset and do not recommend you to waste your money.</li>
            <li> I really like these plates. They all stamp really well even with some reguler polishes.  I haven&#x27;t been able to use the french tips yet but gonna try as soon as my nails are long enough.  The plates also have a backing on them which is nice since several of my other sets dont.  Great addition to my collection!</li>
            <li> The Bundle Monster Plates are not Perfect some of them had flaws, but they work really nice.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These took some practice to get the hang of. However they are so fun to play around with and create different manicures. They are a fabulous addition to my manicure supplies</li>
            <li> Bundle Monster is a great company and they make quality merchandise. I ordered these plates and they all stamped really well expect for maybe 3 plates. I emailed them and told them which plates wouldn&#x27;t stamp very well because the etching wasn&#x27;t deep enough and they sent over the 3 new plates free of charge! You should have no fear when you order from Bundle Monster! Will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these plates. Now that I&#x27;ve had them for about a month, I&#x27;m pleased to say that I still get excited every time that I use them. I will say that it took me about three tries to get the scraping and stamping technique down, but now that I have...I&#x27;m doing it pretty efficiently. I can even do it with most normal polishes (something I was quite pleased to find out!). Definitely a must for anyone looking to expand their nail designs!</li>
            <li> I am SO happy about this set! There are many different designs. These plates are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require the Konrad stamping polish.</li>
            <li> I like these stamps, but when I first purchased them I was new to stamping so I wasn&#x27;t very creative.  I will have to break these out again and make sure to get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I love this things.  So easy to use and my kids adore them!&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Would be awesome if they&#x27;d come in a better container for storage as the bag was split when they arrived but that&#x27;s nothing major.  :)&lt;br /&gt;Will probably buy more.  :)</li>
            <li> Some plates don&#x27;t work very well&#x3D; but for the amount that you are getting its worth it. I would say maybe about 5 plates don&#x27;t print as well as you wish they did.the item arrived on time. There were no issues with the any part of the transaction and overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love all the nail tip designs in this set. Most of the designs are well cut and stamp very nicely. But because a few were not as sharp as i would have liked I only gave this set 4 stars. But, really, even with a few not being that useful it is still a great set and very worth the money i paid!</li>
            <li> This was my first stamping plate purchase.  I was not able to use many of the plates.  I though initially it was my stamper, so I purchased what I thought was a better stamper.  Still no luck.  I found the MoYou London plates and purchased a few of them and they all work with all of my stampers.  Process of elimination dictates that my problem is with the Bundle Monster plates.  Most of the designs were not etched deep enough to pick up the polish.  I am able to use a few of the designs, but not many.  From reading the reviews, it seems hit or miss.  Some customers are getting good plates while others are not.</li>
            <li> Great designs. Some were scratched but I was able to get a refund.  They work well thus far and have many different designs and are fun to use. Take some practice and stamping polish.</li>
            <li> Loving it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &#x3D;) easy to use with great design!&lt;br /&gt;You will have fun while you doing nail stamping artwork!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping with good value product! Will return to buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Some of the plates are hard to transfer.  The set gives me some variety with nail designs.  But it takes a lot of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> The metal plates offer a vast assortment of designs for almost any sort of occasion or nail art idea. The plates are super easy to use, and are a wonderful value especially considering the price of other brands and how much this pack comes with! It&#x27;s a quality product that works with every polish I&#x27;ve used so far. I get compliments on my nails all the time from all the unique designs I can use with the plates.</li>
            <li> I loved it! All the shapes and designs I wanted, and it fits perfectly in my nail kit. Some of the designs seems to be repetitive though.</li>
            <li> These are awesome and they work perfectly. We had no issues with them at all! If you like to do your nails with stamps you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> These plates do not work at all. Could not get even one image to transfer to my nails while using the Konad stamping polish. Complete waste of money, time and ruined what would&#x27;ve been a perfectly good manicure.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I am very pleased with my purchase! It is exactly what i was looking for, to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. All of it in one piece, on the disks was glued protective film. Figures clearly transferred to the nail.</li>
            <li> These are great. I love they way my nails look. They work really well with the Konad nail polish.</li>
            <li> Hmm ok but almost impossible to do on your own.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why anyone would buy the pricey version of these because these work perfectly. They are metal, the patterns are great (and the right size for my nails), plus the price is right. My only advice is to use 100% acetone when using these or cleaning them- normal nail polish remover is just a huge pain since I clean off the plate after every stamp.</li>
            <li> The first plate I used did not work properly as if the grooves weren&#x27;t deep enough.  The second and third plates used worked fine.  I contacted BM customer service and I was nicely informed me that they will replace any defective plates at a one time deal.  I will have to peel off the protective covering off of the other 33 plates this weekend and test them.  Maybe I should have purchased the Konad plates to begin with.  What are the odds that the first plate I chose out of 25 was the only defective one in the set. Hmmmmmm</li>
            <li> I like the stamping plates some are prefect but some are a little difficult to use. Meaning some of the plates don&#x27;t come out perfect on the stamp.</li>
            <li> While I still like my first set of Bundle Monster plates, this set is so much better! I love the improvements they have made... paper backing makes the plates less sharp, the plastic is easier to remove from the front, and the all over nail designs are larger and fit my nails better. There are so many designs to choose from, the possibilities are endless! I could live without all the tip only designs, My nails just aren&#x27;t long enough to get good use out of them, but the wide variety on all the other plates more than makes up for that. Thanks Bundle Monster for another great set of image plates:)</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase from Bundle Monster. I have the original image plate set and I can say that this set is a HUGE improvement. So many full nail designs! The edges are smoother, the backing is a nice touch too. I was so excited to get these plates, they came relatively quickly. My husband called me at work to tell me that they arrived and to rub it in my face that I had to wait until the end of my workday to see them, it was pure torture. I am also impressed with the full nail design size, much improved from the first series.   The only reason I gave it four stars is that some of my plates weren&#x27;t etched in deep enough, making it almost impossible to use a few of the designs. I have found that on YouTube, etching deformities are quite common, contact customer service if you have any concern with the product, I hear they&#x27;re awesome   All in all, I am thrilled with this new set. Love the price! Fast shipping.  Happy stamping!!!</li>
            <li> Yo estoy encantada con estas placas trae unos dise√±os preciosos y se agarran muy bien al estampador,y estan geniales de precio son de las mejores que he encontrado en el mercado    Las recopmiendo 100%,yo estoy muy contenta        Saludos</li>
            <li> One of the plates arrived I repeated. Another became a kind of stained glue: S but I could clean it. Plates are best, but at this price are not bad, but the drawings are very shallow.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this set. It has all sorts of interesting designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my 3rd purchase from bundle monster. I usually do my nails every couple of days and it takes me forever to decide which designs to use.</li>
            <li> Great starter pack. Absolutely has a design for just about everything you need!</li>
            <li> I like the plates very much. Very easy to use. I recommend this purchase to new users and professionals as well.</li>
            <li> These are fun (and sometimes meditative) and the combinations are endless! If you haven&#x27;t tried nail stamping before, here&#x27;s a brief overview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates have engraved images on them.  You dab your polish onto the plate and then scrape off the excess, leaving the polish sitting in the engraved design.  As fast as you can, firmly dab the stamper on the design.  This will lift the polish out of the engraved shape and onto the rubber stamp.  Then you stamp it onto your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little while to get into the groove, but once you find it, it&#x27;s not hard.  Things to consider are the speed at which your polish dries.  I think dark colors stay wet longer, so they are easier to stamp because they will not immediately dry up on the plate or on the stamp.  There are special nail stamping polishes you can get.  I think they&#x27;re only worth the extra price if you want a light color.  I find that they&#x27;re about the consistency of white-out and they flake off like it too.  You will need to apply a clear coat over your nails when you&#x27;re finished.  Also, I would not recommend this for small children.  It can be a pretty messy project, even for this 29-year-old.  I always work on top of an old magazine and use that to discard the scraped off polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates do not come with the stamper and scraper tool so be sure you buy those separately.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these plates! They stamp perfect and the designs are so cool!!! I can do tons of fun designs with them, I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> they are good for the price but some work better than others. you really have to practice to see what polish works best with each design</li>
            <li> This item is what she wanted and she told me she loves it. What else can I say to that.</li>
            <li> I love these plates, the images all fit my nails, and most of them come out pretty clear. I had only one dud plate (the one with zebra print) so none of those images scrape or transfer clearly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased the MASH plates recently and love them.  When I saw these new and improved Bundle Monster plates I had to have them too.  They have totally different designs than MASH and now I have such a great variety to choose from.  Love the new backing too.  They arrived quickly. There was one plate missing and a duplicate of another.  I emailed them and the missing plate was replaced quickly. Who needs Konad when you can have these at a fraction of the cost?  Buy these and you&#x27;ll be glad you did just like I am.</li>
            <li> The product came in great condition and the price is awesome. The only thing is i got a double plate, so I really got 24 plates instead of 25. But all in all its still a great deal.</li>
            <li> Well I bought these nail art stamps and at least a few hundred stamps. None of them are deep enough to hold the nail polish to be able to transfer them to the nails. I tried multiple times. I am now going to try the Konaid and see if they work better. I was so disappointed, I spend $40.00 for this stuff.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think the images aren&#x27;t imprinted deep enough because I often can&#x27;t pick certain images up with my stamper. They have a lot of holiday designs and pretty images on these plates. My thumb nail must be huge cause it&#x27;s hard to find one that fits the whole nail.</li>
            <li> Produto lindo ! adorei! Aqui no brasil n√£o tem essas plaquinhas! Muito Feliz \o/ Parab√©ns √† bundle Monster!Vale muito a pena.</li>
            <li> Everything ok! Selers contact great, they send me the image that was missing, very satisfied with purchase. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift  for a friend for Christmas.  I have a set for myself, the full nail designs don&#x27;t cover my thumb :-( even though that are bigger than the first set..  Cute designs.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! I own the first set too they have cute designs and stamp really well, they also put the paper backing on them which makes them less sharp, and made the full nail designs bigger so they cover the whole nail :) This is a great purchase for anyone who likes to do nails</li>
            <li> The plates came in perfect condition:) lots and lots of designs for the price. I tried a few and they work PERFECT every time! Love this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you Bundle Monster for improving your designs. The first set let me down when I realized that they were not big enough to fit on my nail. Luckily, I have little nieces that enjoy using them. This set here however is the perfect size for an adult size fingernail. I used this the very same day I got them in the mail and the designs are very pleasing and accurate to what is shown in the images. Now I can finally have some fun with my own nails. Thank You BM.</li>
            <li> Awesome item. Huge designs. Easy to use. Designs were all etched very well. Great for a beginner. The best set of plates to buy. Great value.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my sister after she was very obviously jealous of my 21pc set. She was my guinea pig and I pretty much taught her how to stamp. Although I think my set would be more suited for her, she lives smaller individual stamps whereas I would rather have larger nail stamps and tips (this set). If I had to buy the stamp plate sets all over again I would do it the opposite and get myself this set and the smaller set for my sister. BUT the beauty is we can trade (or steal) each other&#x27;s plates. Don&#x27;t forget to get a rubber stamper and google alternative polishes instead of spending a ton of money on the konad special polishes.</li>
            <li> I love these plates! I have tried a bunch of the designs and haven&#x27;t come across one that doesn&#x27;t work yet.  The tip designs that have a lot of open space can be tricky - but I&#x27;ve found that the key to getting them to work is to scrape them sideways instead of up and down. They work just fine if you do it that way. :) Lots of cute designs on these plates, but no bows. Overall, these are great!</li>
            <li> I like the designs on the plates and almost all the plates work very well.  The only plate I&#x27;ve had problem with is 223, especially the ghost.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and compared to Konad plates you do get your money&#x27;s worth given the number of plates you get for the price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about BM. These are some of my favorite plates.&lt;br /&gt;Always arrive super fast. Always packed well, and always awesome images.&lt;br /&gt;Two more sets to go and I will have them all.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to get my last two sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you BM</li>
            <li> The set stamps relatively well i stamped all the images and only one image would not stamp at all. Nice designs and protective backing.</li>
            <li> I really love, I&#x27;m no try the whole images and plates,yet  I&#x27;m ready to buy the bundle monster first set!</li>
            <li> Great variety of designs and they are close to same quality is Konad. Images are crisp and clean. Full nail designs cover pretty much the whole nail (well, not my thum). I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wish the etchings were deeper, though there&#x27;s a good selection.</li>
            <li> Nice nail stamps, but I have to rate it a three, because most of the full nail images are not large enough to cover my full nail. I have long slender nails and long nail beds, and I do not want to have to stamp twice like others must be doing. The smaller images I have tried are really nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The quality of these plates is better than expected: all of them have backing, and the borders are not too sharp.  The images are clear, only 2 or 3 in all 25 plates were defective.  I bought all 3 sets (2010, 1011 &amp; 2012), and I&#x27;m not regretting it!</li>
            <li> I have used mash nail stamping plates to great effect and thought I would try so,e variety and mix in some new patterns.  This set had a lot of Halloween art, so it fit the bill. I spent a total of five hours trying to make various patterns work.  The grooves of the samps were just too shallow to hold my images. I tried buffing my damper with a nail file, tred different polish, tried different plates. None helped the situation.</li>

            <li> this is exactly what i need! the stamp are so cute! my nails are beautifull!! thanks a lot Bundle Monster!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality and selection</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, as advertised.  I&#x27;ve used several of the designs already and they stamped quite well, although it really does depend on the polish you use.  One plate had a defect, but it wasn&#x27;t a design that I really liked anyway.  Since I live overseas, it didn&#x27;t seem worth it to return and get a new one.  The full nail images covered adequately, although I do have small hands.  Unfortunately, the french tip designs ended up being too big for the same reason.  I couldn&#x27;t really get them to fit correctly on my nails (unlike Konad french tip designs which seem to have a more compact design to them), so I can&#x27;t really use 1/4 of the plates.  Otherwise, I would have given it 4 stars.  Overall though, I can&#x27;t complain given what I paid.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try the Bundle Monster for the number of plates for the value. You get what you pay for. Some of the small surface area designs worked, but the ones with a large surface area (i.e. Gingerbread man) did not come out at all. It was such a huge disappointment not being able to use most/many of the designs. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with the Konad plates, NEVER, not even once. The BM plates are etched too shallow thus causing your image not to transfer. I didn&#x27;t try all the plates yet because I&#x27;m afraid it will just be a waste of time &amp; nail polish for designs that will not work. I will eventually get through them just to see which works &amp; which to avoid. Stick with Konad if you want a good image each &amp; every time. They do not disappoint. I gave this 2 stars only because a few images does work, but that doesn&#x27;t make up for the $22 price tag for only a few images.</li>
            <li> I received 2 double plates, 2 missing plates and few were scratched. I&#x27;m not sure if the scratches were during shipment or weren&#x27;t inspected properly before shipment. They were not etched deep enough so they did not transfer too well. I hope they work on improving these issues.  The designs were very nice. I am waiting to hear back from bundle monster customer service regarding the issues.     My daughter also ordered a set.  She has similar issues and it has been 4+ days since she emailed them.  Haven&#x27;t heard any respond yet. Hopefully we&#x27;ll get satisfactory resolution.</li>
            <li> My Bundle Monster image plates are great I love them so much!!!! They are very similar to Konad...expect that they are a better deal price wise. One Konad Image plate run from $3.99-$7.99 while u get 25 for like 22 bucks!  Although, it the plates would be better if the whole nail images would be bigger &amp; actually fit the entire nail...they will not cover your thumb.</li>
            <li> Love the images but just know that some on them are a little large in the way that when you scrap the polish off the image gets sparse in some spots but it is not real noticeable.  Kanad plates are better but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  Would recommend getting them anyway.</li>
            <li> These plates are MUCH better quality than series 1. They are etched deep enough and now come with a protective back like the more expensive Konad plates. The designs are new and unique. Don&#x27;t bother with the 1st set :)</li>
            <li> Had I bought 25 of the Konad plates it would have cost $175.00!!! The designs are beautiful and I love the safety of the cardboard backing on each plate. I bought the package of 21 Monster Bundle plates, a while back, and was so impressed that I had to have the package of 25! I thought there would be duplicates but there were none! This package is just AWSOME and I can&#x27;t wait for Monster Bundle to come out with new designs! I&#x27;ve had problems with some of the Konad plates not being laser cut correctly (Konad polish will not transfer to nails) but I haven&#x27;t had this issue with Bundle Monster plates. Just buy them! You&#x27;ll be surprised at the beauty of the designs and how well they work!!!!!</li>
            <li> i have heard such good reviews from this product... but... the image does not transfer well.. at all... VERY disapointed. could have lived without this item... but does anyone have a trick for this item?</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering these since they&#x27;re a different brand than the other plates I have.  But I love them, they&#x27;re great!!  There is at least one design I like on each of the 25 plates, and the ones I&#x27;ve used so far have all worked without a problem!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for nail stamping!! It was safely packaged, good shipping time and the product arrived in perfect condition (new and sealed). Wide variety of designs to choose from and they work very well, had no issues transfering the design to the nail!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect! BM has definitely listened to their customers, because they have considerably improved the image plates. Not only the new images ROCK but the plates themselves are bigger, safer and the paper/plastic that comes with it is also easier to remove. I loved the new designs, the Halloween designs and the full-size images too! If you have the 1st BM set I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love the 2nd. If you are a new BM customer, you are going to be addicted!! That&#x27;s all! ;)</li>
            <li> These plates are a great value and great quality. I did receive a damaged plate (it had a large gouge on one of the designs) and I notified the seller. They responded the same day and stated that they will send a replacement plate right away. I&#x27;m very pleased with the plates as well as the customer service. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Estampan muy bien, sin problemas y a un precio inmejorable, los dise√±os son mas grandes que en el lote anterior y cubren mucho mejor la u√±a entera.  A ver si se animan y sacan otro lote pronto!!!</li>
            <li> this is my first experience with nail stamping.  it&#x27;s so fun!  it does take some practice to get the hang of it, but i&#x27;m doing it over shellac, so if i mess up, i can just &#x27;erase&#x27; and try again!  love it!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase from Bundle Monster and from Amazon.com too.  The package arrived very quickly, just a week.  Plates have many nice full nail designs and beautiful french tips, my favorites, also these stamps better than smaller ones.  These full nail designs are larger than the other set, but still they are not large enough to cover the nail of my thumb or middle finger in only one pass.  I like them but, i would like to buy another Bundle Monster set with larger designs. Thanks.</li>
            <li> They got here pretty quickly, but the stamps only work on about have the plates. Too small (my 4 year is about the biggest to be able to use the full nail designs) and the others were shaved too thin and won&#x27;t stamp the image on the nail. I had high hopes, but I&#x27;ll stick with Konad brand next time unfortunately</li>
            <li> Great designs and collection of images.  They have almost every holiday covered in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still wound up buying another collection because there were a few images I was missing - but I love it and the designs seem to transfer well (the ones I&#x27;ve used).</li>
            <li> This was my second set of stamping plates, and I have never regretted this purchase! All the plates stamped very clearly, they were all etched deep enough!</li>
            <li> Genial y llego una semana antes de lo previsto, reparto perfecto y envio sin problemas. Ideal para pintar u√±as. Saludos</li>
            <li> This PRuduct is one of the best pruducts that amazon eves sold i love love ove love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE  PRuduct is amazing u should really get it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY nails are iresistible !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WAnt my Advice?????????????????????????? OK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY ITTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are such a big improvement over the previous BM set and other stamping plates. I have long nails beds and most plates are too small. I wish these were a tiny bit longer to fit my thumb but overall I love the longer length. I think these will easily fit most people&#x27;s nails. These have a paper backing which makes the edges less sharp. My only complaint is that some of the designs are shallow so I have to redo them several times to get them to show up completely. Overall, a great product and a great deal for 25 plates.</li>
            <li> These had alot of great stamps on them. I thought they were a little pricy, but that may just be because Im cheap. I also had alot of problems with getting the nailpolish to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;. It may have just been the nailpolish I used though.</li>
            <li> So I just got this set in and I love it. This is my 5th set of plates I have bought and of the ones I have now id say they are my favorite set. One of the discs did have a dent in it but I&#x27;m sure it was due to shipping and its on the side not on a design so I don&#x27;t see where it should cause a problem. I love this product and have many more sets in my wish list waiting for later when I got some extra $$ for em. So totally addicted to useing these for great designs on my nails and every time I use them I get asked about where I got my nails done when I go anywhere!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product expecting some good quality, but all I got were plates which weren&#x27;t deep enough. From 25 plates 8 are not working - of course all of them have images I bought this set for in first place. My $1 plates from China make better stamps!&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the difference between some of them which work with your finger. I contacted company and they promised to send me replacement for those plates, I think they are more than aware about this problem, but still selling unusable products to people. Still wainting for my replacemnt to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy anything from Bundle Monster again. I recommend GALS plates, they stamp pretty good for me.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the right set of plates that I wanted so I returned them to the manufacturer. I ordered the 2013 Bundle Monster Plates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these since 2011 and I love them. I have both Konad and Bundle Monster, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy any more Konad plates. Even though they&#x27;re better quality, they&#x27;re not *that* much better when you consider that you&#x27;re getting far fewer design choices. These ones are much lower quality, BUT you&#x27;re still getting way more for your money. Some of the designs will be faded as the engravings are not as deep. You do need to still buy the Konad stamper (can use a credit card instead of a scraper) in order to use these plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, count your plates when you get them. I was missing 1 or 2, so I checked the designs and contacted the seller. They sent me the ones I was missing right away.</li>
            <li> Seller replies quickly and provides excellent customer service.  The plates are easy to use and I chose them because I liked these designs better than a lot of the other sets.  The plates can take a little bit of practice to master accuracy in placement (especially with the tips), but it&#x27;s definitely worth it, and so much cheaper than going to a salon, for those of us who can&#x27;t afford to have our nails done professionally.  Would definitely buy from again!</li>
            <li> Great variety of stamps. There are some cute holiday stamps and nice geometric ones. Good if you&#x27;re looking for more full nail stamps rather than little images. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think a few of the stamps aren&#x27;t quite deep enough, so getting a decent stamp out of them is very difficult. But that&#x27;s only with a couple of the stamps, and otherwise I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Great if you have time for it!</li>
            <li> They stamp work very well!!!</li>
            <li> Great selection of images. Shipped quickly. Unfortunately the very last plate in this collection (I do believe is Plate 225) one of the images was barely visible/not completely etched.</li>
            <li> I love Bundle Monster, they have wonderful customer service. The new image plates are wonderful larger designs as well as a back covering to protect against cuts. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love nail stamping disks.  But 1 of the discs I received didn&#x27;t get etched on to the disk properly.  2 of the paterns on 1 disk are anusable.  I have beenable to use all other disk designs successfully.</li>
            <li> Hi.  This item has some amazing stamps! And the size of the \\&quot;full nail stamp\\&quot; is large enought to cover all my finger&#x27;s nails.  This item have a cover on it&#x27;s back that avoid you to ger harmed with the border of the plate.  this is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; item for those who likes nail art.  Seller offers low cost shipping.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that my nail art skills are nothing much better then being able to change colors.  That being said this system is so easy and so addicting, I find myself changing polish twice as much as I used to.  I found that the plates I liked the most were not available in the smaller bundle.  I would recommend looking at the closeups of all the discs and determining what you think you might use.  I also found I liked more of the designs on this pack then I saw on the Konad plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest piece of advice is to do a top coat after you put your base coat on so that if you make a mistake when stamping you can take it off and it wont ruin your polish job. The top coat I use, [[ASIN:B00150LT40 Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat]] I love for a million reasons including the quickest drying and longest lasting I have ever used (pinky is dry by the time you get to your thumb- that&#x27;s fast) but in this case it works really well with the stamping polish, when some of the reviews said putting on their top coat took off their stamp job, Seche Vite killed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived about 5 days quicker then estimated</li>
            <li> O produto √© de uma qualidade impressionante, eu me surpreendo a cada nova arte que vou realizar, s√£o pe√ßas com bom acabamento e de otima precis√£o, super aconselh√°vel, quem adquirir vai querer mais, estou muito satisfeita com produto.</li>
            <li> These were nice.They don&#x27;t print as well as other ones but I will work with it.Still glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> Awesome set of plates!  Great designs and price!</li>
            <li> I am starting my journey into nail stamping and have ordered BM 2011 and 2012 collection based on such a high number of reviews.  The image etchings transfer very clearly with Konad nail polish.  With just a little bit of practice,  I did a perfect french manicure using BM 310 as a delicate netting and toped it with Konad M19 solid white french tips.  Love the results!  My only complaint (thus 3 stars) is that the images from 2011 collection for the full nail are not big enough.  This is something that should be mentioned with in the product description.  I have natural, short/medium length nails that are of average width and some of the images do not fully cover the nail surface for my middle and thumb fingers.  I am now researching the blogs and postings about sizes of various nail stamping plates and am finding that  MoYou XL plates may be a way to go for me.  Nevertheless,  I like the designs and plan to have a lot of fun experimenting.  If you have petite hands, you will have the use of the entire collection and it is of high quality as other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to receive these nail stamping plates.. now i can&#x27;t wait to get the new set.. they work perfectly..</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before buying. The pads are worthless even after filing. I really think ALL the positive reviews for this product are written by the manufacturer. I bought another from a retail store and guess what, SAME PROBLEM. I&#x27;m sorry I bought it, and even worse, paid as much for shipping as I paid for the product.</li>
            <li> All images are really pretty and precise, only one has a minor flaw in it.I am well aware of their excellent service when it comes to replacements, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to even process a claim. Shipping was relatively quick, within the expected period. I recommend to try BM image plates before Konad, BM images are fun, unique and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Darf in einer guten Sammlung von Stamp-Schablonen nicht fehlen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bestellung wurde schneller geliefert als angek√ºndigt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sowohl die fl√§chendeckenden Muster als auch die kleinen Einzelmuster funktionieren mit Stampinglack UND mit vielen normalen Lacken (gerade von Catrice) wunderbar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Der Bundle-Preis ist meiner Meinung nach zudem unschlagbar.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these plates. My children &amp; I tested a few designs as soon as I opened the package. As noted in other reviews some designs are not etched deep enough but all in all we are happy with this set.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because I could not get it to work properly. This was a waste of my money and I will not buy anything like this again</li>
            <li> Efficacy of stamp patterns is inconsistent and most do not pick up regardless of the stamper or polish used, which the Konad I also ordered @ the same time did well. $ thrown away. This seller doesn&#x27;t offer the option of contacting them either. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I like this stamp set, although there are quite a few that don&#x27;t work or come out looking sloppy. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the imprint isn&#x27;t deep enough, but I use the same technique every time and there are just a few that don&#x27;t come out looking right. For the price, though, I can definitely live with that.</li>
            <li> So, when I got these plates and I was super excited. I immediately went and tested them all. The majority of the plates were good, but 5 of the plates didn&#x27;t work. One of them had a scratch through it and the other had some rust (I think). So I contacted Bundle Monster, and the customer service was awesome. They replaced all 5 plates with fast shipping and no cost to me. The unfortunate part...is that the plates that were replaced weren&#x27;t much different. Like, the one didn&#x27;t have any rust on it and the other wasn&#x27;t scratched anymore, but some of the smaller designs still aren&#x27;t deep enough. But oh well. All of the plates are still a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Not good using regular polish, need special stamping polish</li>
            <li> The delays of delivery are long (about ten days) because this product is sent from Hawa√Ø !! but all the plates are very nice and good quality, and the price is ok ! I recommand it (sorry for my bad english because I&#x27;m french)</li>
            <li> One of the best pack of Stamping for nail art !&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a must have to create nice custom nail art ;)&lt;br /&gt;i recommend</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get into image stamping this is a great affordable option. I love the variety you get in these bundles.</li>
            <li> nice plates some are hard to transfer but if you have patience they are pretty cool. planning on buying more</li>
            <li> Some of the images are too small for my nails which I consider to be medium in length. And there are way too many tip plates!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK DO NOT BUY. I only get smudges on my nails The designs suck so now im stuck with a s***y prduct.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use these yet but I look very forward to using them. I cannot wait!</li>
            <li> i love that there are so many designs and i bought this separate from the stamper and scraper and it was so worth it and affordable, you can make so many combinations and they are easy to find on youtube to practice. it does take some time to learn how to do it correctly but overall the product works great it cleans easy. if children are going to use these just supervise them because the edges are a little sharp. i was so exited when i got them because there are so many, and shipping was quick and none of them got damaged. just remember to pull the blue plastic off before use and practice, practice, practice!!! :)</li>
            <li> The set included many plates, and had alot of interesting images. Definately a set I would recommend to friends. Just make sure you remove plastic from the individual plaes before using....</li>
            <li> I bought this bundle and the Konad double sided stamper.  Arrived today and I opened immediately to try my first-ever attempt at nail stamping.  I used Wet &#x27;n Wild Wild Shine nail polish in silver metalic, black creme, and french white creme over my existing Shellac manicure.  I am sold!  The designs picked up and transfered perfectly, looks like a professional did my nails, the plate and scraper were very easy to clean up.  I had read in some reviews that the Konad scraper scratched these plates, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> Some designs work really well, others don&#x27;t lift off as beautifully.  Additionally, you need a special polish for them to come out with any kind of &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; or vibrancy.  Only black polish seems to stamp ok. Regular polish doesn&#x27;t cut it.  Scraping off seems to be an art in itself.  If you scrape too hard, no polish is left for the design.  If you don&#x27;t scrape enough, the design is a mess.</li>
            <li> Amazing fast delivery, was much more earlier to arrive to singapore than expected time frame! Im so excited to try it out my new \\&quot;toys\\&quot; haha. Its definitely worth the grab, as it is so much cheaper than others brand!!! $21 for 25 stamping plates!!! What a great deal! As mention, i have not try any of my plates yet cant comment much about the product but just looking at all my plates design im totally falling in love with it ‚ô•</li>
            <li> Cute set! If love to get creative with your nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, and all work great. I love their desings and ho easy are to use. Shipping was pretty low and it got to me in less than a week &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> When I purchased these plates I was so excited to recieve them, I was extremely surprised to recieve them 3 days before the expected arrival date! Though one of the plates were scratched I e-mailed them and they said they would send me out a replacement. Very nice customer service, I only wish the stamper would get here now so I could use my new plates!</li>
            <li> Some of the images are very deep and really good but some don&#x27;t stamp well !! But overall quality is good. I wish it had some more interesting images!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d buy Konad if I were you.  These have cute designs but the etching isn&#x27;t deep enough so the print doesn&#x27;t show up well on nails.</li>
            <li> Nice design, easy to use, it is good deal. Bundle monster is my favorite. I can enjoy different style and I like it.</li>
            <li> Great selection high quality</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use these plates with their great images. I thought they were good quality having seem designs from them on the Internet and most people rating it 5 stars. I have used konad and mash brands and they worked perfectly. None of the designs came out because they weren&#x27;t etched in deep enough. I hope I can call to receive replacements because none of them work and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other review about this product, but I didn&#x27;t. Waste of money for they don&#x27;t transfer good at all. And yes i peeled off the protective layer and followed the directions to a T and they just don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> 25 plates with so many different designs it&#x27;s very hard to decide which one to use :) they all came in perfect shape</li>
            <li> Ainda n√£o recebi o produto!!!! Era pra chegar dia 03/12 e hoje j√° √© dia 20/01/2013 e ainda n√£o chegou!@!!!!</li>
            <li> Regular and gel nail polish don&#x27;t make good imprints.</li>
            <li> Most of the images are for full nail coverage, but many have such small intricate designs &amp; you have to file your stamper with a nail file to make it grab the images. The use of an XL stamper, also works better to pick up the tiny details. I recomend using special stamping polishes for the plates, but you can experiment with other polishes, to see what works for you. It can be very frustrating to get some of the images to work.</li>
            <li> What people are always wondering about: Is it as good as the Konad ones.&lt;br /&gt;For me it is. Yes, Not every design works as good BUT most of them do and it&#x27;s way LESS EXPENSIVE.&lt;br /&gt;GO, GO Bundle monster!</li>
            <li> These plates are not as detailed as the more expensive Konad plates, but they are wonderful nonetheless.  They are easy to work with and have a wide range of designs.  I particularly like this collection because it includes mostly full-nail designs instead of a smattering of single images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;The full images are small if you have deep nail beds, long nails, or bigger nails.&lt;br /&gt;There are too many French tip designs.  I like the way Cheeky has put a curved end on full nail design to give you either option.</li>
            <li> i have purchaced i think 3 sets of bundle monster stamping plates and i&#x27;m super happy with all sets!! images are great and they come out super clear i would absolutely purchace more plates from them for the great quality they are the price is fantastic!!! i also purchaced their plate storage zip up case and it is a must have qualitry is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> received very quickly. Thanks LP speed. quality is not bad. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are great designs however some don&#x27;t always work which is a bummer... im still trying them all out and I hope the majority of them work well...</li>
            <li> Bought a while ago and have used frequently.  All the images stamp well even using inexpensive wet n wild or Sally Hanson quick dry polish.  If you have longer nails some of the images will be too small, but could be made larger by making a decal.  Ala in all a great little set!</li>
            <li> They are 25 beautiful plates. I have just used 2 of them. There are a lot of and differents plates. All of then are marvellous.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how many years it&#x27;s been since I ordered these, but with all the other plates I have I keep going back to them.  They are my &amp;#34;old stand-by&amp;#34;. The images are classics: flowers, lace, geometrics, nothing incredibly trendy. I would most assuredly recommend these to all nail stamping enthusiasts, especially beginners.</li>
            <li> Ok so i bought this thinking I would become a pro nail stamper. Well either im &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; or these darn things just dont work. SOME of the patterns work but only the ones with the bigger creases/indents.&lt;br /&gt;Its really cute when you can get it to work! I even watched youtube tutorials to try to get it to work... The patterns are darling... if only i could get them all to work!</li>
            <li> The plates are not much different than the konad ones in quality. Like the halloween themed plates~! it might take a bit of effort to take oy the portection layer tho.</li>
            <li> magnifiques plaques bundle monster tr√®s bonne qualit√©&lt;br /&gt;recues le 12 d√©cembre alors qu&#x27;elles √©taient pr√©vues √† partir du 20 d√©cembre. Super contente</li>
            <li> Quality has majorly improved compared to the 2010 Bundle Monster set! Very pleased! The size of the designs is now big enough for normal sized nails :)</li>
            <li> Too much time to receive it, was for Papa Noel or Reyes magos i Europe (6 January) and arrived on 08 january, too much later.</li>
            <li> These plates were a great value, all of the images i have used so far have been etched well enough for use. What i like best is that the designs actually fit on most of my nail. I have a friend who bought another set of plates and the images weren&#x27;t as large, so its harder for her to get a whole design to fit on her nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for nail stamping lovers--way better than buying the Konad brand plates that are wayyy too pricey!</li>
            <li> So many to choose from and inexpensive too! Great purchase! I recommend purchasing from Bundle Monster.  I&#x27;ve ordered from them before and I was very happy with their product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> plates are awesome, some great designs especially for the whole nail stamping. easy clean up and easy to use, just takes some practice. lots of variety for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great set. The designs are super fun and most of them stamp great. Also the size of the designs is big enough so that it covers my entire nails. Only the thumbs are missing a little bit on the sides, but nothing major. I am looking forward to buying the 2012 set!</li>
            <li> Good, but polish doesn&#x27;t always stick to my stamper when using them. I ended up having to use a nail file on my stamper to get the polish to stick. Works, just a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stamp very well, most of mines are not imprinted right at all.</li>
            <li> I love Bundle Monster stamping plates. They&#x27;re so easy to use and the manicure possibilities are endless, really. I&#x27;m a big fan of nail art and stamping is an easy way for anyone to really get involved.</li>
            <li> I love nail art and have to say that this set was a big improvement from the original set of plates. The designs are larger than the first set, which is a major plus. I reccomend these to everyone I know who loves giving themselves a manicure. The designs are pretty. Great job bundlemonster!!!</li>
            <li> The designs on these plates are beautiful. Most of them are full nail designs but there are many options to choose from. Some cover  more of the base color than others. You get 25 plates for the price which is not that bad. That is less than a dollar per plate, whereas Konad is $5 per plate. I also have the 2012 ones. They are beautiful as well.&lt;br /&gt;  The design will transfer better if you use stamping polish. The key is the the polish has to be thick and dry slowly. Also, you have to be quick with the process or the nail polish will dry in the plate or on the stamper, and will not go on  to the nail. It takes a little practice to get it right. Don&#x27;t forget to peel off the blue covering film before using!!!!</li>
            <li> These are terrible the engravings aren&#x27;t deep enough to work I guess I should have paid for the name brand that works not a knock off I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I purchased this bundle after learning about nail stamping from a nail blog. At first I was a little skeptical to buy, but now I LOVE stamping my nails. I always get compliments. I do nails for my friends and family. Overall, these are a great investment. It&#x27;s much better than buying plates individually from Konad. I haven&#x27;t tried every single design, but I&#x27;ve always been successful with the ones I have tried. I have had trouble some days with images transferring but usualy it&#x27;s user error (either my plates aren&#x27;t clean or I&#x27;m not stamping on a good surface, etc.) Only downside I have (and it&#x27;s probably once again user error) is the tips plates. It is ridiculously hard to stamp those. I just can&#x27;t really figure out how to line it up on my fingers. Overall,  the purchase is worth it. Even if you only use 5 designs it is a great return. You can reuse these over and over and over. I would reccommend this to others and maybe even purchase as a gift if I knew someone who would use them. I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing the 21 plate set soon to get more images.</li>
            <li> i have to admit the quality of these plates are not as good as konad but they do work. i haven&#x27;t tried all of the plates but the ones that i did use... they worked just fine. i had 4 defective plates and bundle monster replaced them RIGHT AWAY. their customer service is awesome. i got a response from them within a couple of hours and received the replacements in 3 days! i am very impressed with bundle monster plates. i hope they come out with new designs soon because i will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> There is a nice variety of designs, and I&#x27;m glad I gave these a try.  I compared the leopard side-by-side with a more expensive plate last week.  The leopard wasn&#x27;t as crisp and detailed, but I decided to try another design tonight and it worked beautifully.  I think it&#x27;s reasonable that I&#x27;m not going to love every single design since there are so many (Really, it was hard to decide which one to use tonight!).  I will definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li> They work great for the price and I had no problem with them not being able to transfer to the stamper.</li>
            <li> I recently got into nail stamping and bought this set due to all the *buzz* I read online about it. The quality is great; the images stamp very nicely and there are a handful of really cool images (the snakeskin on 215 is my favorite). My biggest issue however, is the size of the images. I have longer nails (approx 2cm in length) and the full images are only 1.5cm in length; so I have to stamp each nail twice to fill my entire nail which is a PITA trying to match up perfectly. the images are also only 1.25cm in width so if you have wider nails you&#x27;ll also have to stamp each nail twice for complete coverage. There are other US and European companies making nail stamping plates with larger images for those of us with longer nails so I end up using those instead 99% of the time.</li>
            <li> You could never go wrong with bundle monster they have great products I&#x27;m never disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought these plates to go with the Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper and Scraper I also bought from Amazon and after some experimenting and mess ups, I have gotten some cute nail designs! Fun and easy to use!</li>
