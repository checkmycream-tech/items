    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with Badger Sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t want that, this isn&#x27;t your best choice.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline.</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a redhead with very fair skin</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen with excellent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>My sister works for a dermatologist, and said that this is definitely good stuff!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen worked great during my trip to Cancun where some of the parks require biodegradable lotions.  </li>
            <li>Great sunscreen coverage.  </li>
            <li>Great for the beach...</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t have toxic chemicals and is made with non-nano particles so that it doesn&#x27;t pass the skin barrier.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and protection, but a pain to apply.</li>
            <li>We applied the Badger face stick to our faces and this to our bodies before going out in the mornings and after lunch and had great results.</li>
            <li>Very successfully blocks out the sun, in fact anywhere I missed on my shoulders did get burned, but that was okay for comparisons sake!</li>
            <li>chose this brand because it has a great EWG rating.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great protection.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a great water resistant finish.  </li>
            <li>Great for the beach and lake time.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen with no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen without all the chemicals...works well for my kids</li>
            <li>Works great at preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li>Have purchased this brand several times now, works perfect and scores a rating of 1 on the EWG website which is the best of the best!</li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It rubbed off on EVERYTHING, despite rubbing it in the best we could and waiting 10 minutes before touching anything.  </li>
            <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water.</li>

            <li>To tell the turth here, zinc oxide based sunscreen, like Badger brand is the best to use, if you are going to spend a lot of time being outdoors and sunburn easily like I do.</li>
            <li>I am so bummed, because I am still searching for a good organic sunscreen that can protect me from getting burned.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>I guess good sunscreen</li>
            <li>(I have a fair complexion anyway</li>
            <li>But seriously good coverage.</li>
            <li>So Badger is a really good value AND it performs pretty well, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Used it in Mexico, works great, glad it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and aluminums.</li>
            <li>Great organic and safe sunscreen product just requires allot of rubbing in.  </li>
            <li>We have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with its staying power even after a lot of swimming.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a truly safe, effective sunscreen!</li>
            <li>My son breaks out in a rash from most sunscreens - but not this one!</li>
            <li>So glad I found you.....!  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite sunscreen yet!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>They work by creating a whitish hue to your skin and effectively reflect the suns rays before it hits your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continuing to use it when I mow the lawn and need the absolute best sun protection.  </li>
            <li>Works good and fortunately, I don&#x27;t care if I look &amp;#34;white-faced&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m fishing...</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding more zinc with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li>Most &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; formulations of drugstore sunscreens use minerals to protect your skin.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t notice those things! :-)  </li>
            <li>Sunflower oil protects the skin from bacteria (meaning it can prevent acne) and free radicals, which can damage the cells of your skin and it makes an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Mostly, their differences lie in consistency.</li>
            <li>It probably has the most zinc oxide of the three.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff</li>
            <li>Thank you Badger for keeping us free of poision!</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for in a sunscreen?</li>
            <li>This is a safe suncreen product.</li>
            <li>There is no scent and it is safe.</li>
            <li>I also wanted something with more UVA</li>
            <li>This sunscreen meets my standards AND we love it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of of an ointment consistency.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am ordering two more tubes of it today.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s safe sun protection.</li>
            <li>Love love love this it stays on</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of sunscreens since, being a cyclist, I am often out in the sun during the more punishing parts of the day.  </li>
            <li>it blended in better.</li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>this is my 2nd order , great product !!!</li>
            <li>make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix.</li>
            <li>Great for ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and totally natural protection.</li>
            <li>When I sweat, this product rubs off so easily</li>
            <li>So it also washes off easily when they play in the water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like wearing a mirror suit and that Suits me just fine</li>
            <li>I was able to remove the residue easily, but its worth noting that you may want to apply before you get out in the sunshine</li>
            <li>I received prompt and accurate service, but I don&#x27;t like the sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li>That played a huge role in my trust of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Texture: A+&lt;br /&gt; -goes on smoothly and not oily or greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Scent:</li>
            <li>I found that I have to use t with another lotion or even and oil to really get any kind of coverage on my body.</li>
            <li>Although you have to rub this in much more than a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; sunscreen, I feel better knowing the ingredients are more natural</li>
            <li>A Light complicted lifeguatd told me about badger after I Asked.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product, used sparingly.</li>
            <li>Works well, I trust the fact that it&#x27;s chemical free.</li>
            <li>Smooth, reparative, protective</li>
            <li>BADGER sunscreen is fabulous.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does a great job and does not cause any break outs on my back and chest!</li>
            <li>PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfied they use natural ingredients that work rather than chemicals that have an impact on my child.  </li>
            <li>The higher the ZO, the more SPF.</li>
            <li>THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yours is the only non-pasty sunscreen I know of that is truly the best, all natural and 25% non-nano zinc.</li>
            <li>And the ingredients are clean to boot.</li>
            <li>It really protected my daughter and I very well as we are quite fair.</li>
            <li>means better protection although I will look like a ghost since the white ZO will stay on till I take a bath so for real light days</li>
            <li>Another nice thing about mineral sunblocks is that they are pretty safe to use for people with sensitive skin (mine is not).  </li>
            <li>I spent a great amount of time researching sun protection</li>
            <li>All I have to do is make sure it is rubbed in really well.</li>
            <li>It does come out of the tube kind of pasty and thick, kind of like squeezing clay out of a toothpaste tube!  </li>
            <li>Finally, tocopherol--or in English, Vitamin E oil is GREAT for your skin!</li>
            <li>I bought several different sunblocks recommended on EWG&#x27;s Best Beach &amp; Sport Sunscreens (http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/best-sunscreens/best-beach-sport-sunscreens/)</li>
            <li>I am a guerrilla gardener (neighborhood beautifier, creator of pollinator pathways and biodiversity corridors) in super sunny California.</li>
            <li>I was not so lucky.  </li>
            <li>Arrive quickly</li>
            <li>&gt; -not unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in the PNW, so we mostly use sunscreen from June until September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned strawberry blonde and this does the exact job it was intended for.</li>
            <li>There are better mineral sunscreens out there that go on more smoothly and seem to work better but are more expensive.</li>
            <li>I have used this sunscreen for several years and love it!</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since it is less ingredient with more protection since I control the zinc.</li>
            <li>Aryu-Veda goes on smoothly and moisturizes REALLY</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural sunscreen</li>
            <li>Badger contains non-Nano particle zinc oxide, which cannot be absorbed into the skin, but rather stays on the surface until rubbed off.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more for next summer and would recommend this to anyone looking for a sunscreen with a good EWG rating that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spent 4 hours in a kayak on Lake Superior and didn&#x27;t burn anywhere on my face, neck and arms.</li>
            <li>And all natural ingredients make me feel better about what I&#x27;m putting on myself and my kid.</li>
            <li>SO THE ZO SHOULD STAY ON THE SKIN NOT TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SKIN AND PROCESSED BY LIVER.</li>
            <li>, I make my own sunscreen as well so for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix.</li>
            <li>I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li>I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li>This is old school white zinc, so it is very effective and stays put.</li>
            <li>I used this sunscreen for the first time when I took a quick trip to the beach that lasted about six hours.</li>
            <li>They can even just about jump right into the water as soon as it is applied no need to wait</li>
            <li>WITH THE RIGHT SIZE ZO, YOU WILL HAVE TO WASH YOUR SKIN SINCE EVEN THE OCEAN&#x27;S SALT WATER WILL NOT REMOVE OF YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BADGER</li>
            <li>READ TO GET THE RIGHT MIX INCLUDING THE SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tougher to apply, but not by much, and the results are great... unless you want a tan.</li>
            <li>Pretty thick and visible (don&#x27;t expect it to get absorbed into your skin) but offers great protection!</li>
            <li>I am already naturally somewhat tan and don&#x27;t burn easily.</li>
            <li>I am a strawberry blonde adult with fair skin</li>
            <li>Badger is free from all the toxins in most other products.</li>
            <li>So I think it is safe to assume that only I noticed the whitish hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although there is a notable (apparently to me only) whitish hue, I am willing to accept this because the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I could return the unopened second tube (and, ideally, the first, used only once) and find an all-natural sunscreen that didn&#x27;t nearly stain my skin.</li>
            <li>but I thought others should be aware.</li>
            <li>Great sun protection and gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>Used during our last vacation and was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>and this is the first summer using it on our twins.</li>
            <li>and I used this on our first beach day.</li>
            <li>I might buy it again for my next diving because it is safe for reef.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will definitely be ordering again !</li>
            <li>Love that it is organic, does not contain Titanium and only has 5 ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty cautious as to what I use on his skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for having a healthy low toxicity  sunscreen</li>
            <li>That is exactly what I want from a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>On a recent trip to Florida to visit family, we did not pack sunscreen, since we were taking everything in a carry-on and were bound to use more than the 3 oz.</li>
            <li>The first three days of our trip, we used a chemical-based sunscreen with an SPF of 35.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again next season.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve lasted a whole summer of fun.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to super creamy commercial sunscreens, this texture may be new to you, but it works really well and is such a great option for keeping toxic chemicals off of your body.</li>
            <li>Rubbed it in better on my face and the white tint pretty much disappeared</li>
            <li>I burn pretty easily, so I pretty much bathe in whatever product I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li>It can sometimes require a lot of scrubbing to totally remove it, but again, I don&#x27;t mind some left over residue because it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good for high sun exposure, not a quick dip in the pool.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m always looking for more natural alternatives to chemically produced skin products, this minimal ingredient sunscreen is SUPER DENSE!</li>
            <li>We are VERY particular about what goes in and on our bodies.  </li>
            <li>I do not burn easily, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time my skin was so burned.  </li>
            <li>It does initially make him look like a ghost but, unlike many other natural sunscreens, it rubs in pretty easily and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>It is thick and more noticeable than your average sunscreen, and it&#x27;s advisable to lather it on and have the white tint, but it&#x27;s safe for you to use (good product), and will do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>very thick to apply, but works great.  </li>
            <li>very good sunscrren but white and thick and chalky.</li>
            <li>smells a little funny, but great for long hours at the beach.</li>
            <li>All in all, I really do like it.</li>
            <li>It leaves a whitish hue, but stays put really well.</li>
            <li>works well, but very creamy... takes awhile to rub in the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Just too much effort in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Protected very well and did not posses a threat to the waters or Eco system.</li>
            <li>Works very well.....</li>
            <li>really like the cream,</li>
            <li>My wife did not have the same problem, but she has a light complexion than me.  </li>
            <li>It very well might depend on your skin type.</li>
            <li>Badger stood up to the california sun on the Colorado river and my son did not burn the whole four days</li>
            <li>After a couple of days of use, so much pressure was needed to squeeze it out that the seam on the bottom split and squirt out.  </li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t show up on me much).</li>
            <li>However, I find the texture to be very creamy and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Periodically I like to go through the Environmental Working Group (EWG) list of sunscreens, and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>on very well and doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work well on preventing my skin from feeling any kind of harsh expose from the sun for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li>I spent some of that time in the ocean and some sitting under an umbrella with a 40 SPF rating, so it really should have been able to handle that amount of sun, and yes, I did reapply.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use a more natural, physical sunscreen instead of a chemical one because I was raised by hippies and have bought into the EWG ratings despite my reservations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this natural alternative to chemical laden sunscreens that always make my back break out.</li>
            <li>It works better, but I really cannot compare it to Badger due to price</li>
            <li>Even finding that they have not needed as many reapplications, as they did with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other zinc based products that didn&#x27;t make me look like a ghost like this one.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s it worth to you feels good not messy you look a little white if you use too much</li>
            <li>look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>actually love, love, love Badger&#x27;s face stick version of this product, so this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li>It protects without using chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral sunscreens use white powder like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide (which this product does not contain the latter, which is a good thing in my book because it it potentially harmful to your skin).</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m usually pretty conscious of the chemical makeup of the items I use.  </li>
            <li>Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), Essential Oils of *Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Organic Sweet Orange) and *Citrus Tangerina (Organic Tangerine), Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E), CO2 Extracts of *Hippophae Rhamnoides (Organic Seabuckthorn) and *Vanilla Planifolia (Organic Vanilla).</li>
            <li>More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less</li>
            <li>More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less</li>
            <li>spend hours outside enjoying the short northern summers, no matter what our activity, whether in water or land, this sunscreen has prevented any sunburns.</li>
            <li>I reapplied twice in 2 hours at the beach on a partly cloudy and even rainy day and had a mild burn later that night.</li>
            <li>but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix.</li>
            <li>but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A minimal amount worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>It does not cause skin reactions on my sensitive skin kids and it lasts in the water!!</li>
            <li>But it dries nicely on skin (not oily) and has hardly any odor.</li>
            <li>Great protection, but difficult to spread and get rubbed in</li>

            <li>Great price and the bottle is small, but it&#x27;s so thick that you don&#x27;t need much to cover a large area!</li>
            <li>As a fair-complected female with a history of melanoma, I am pretty particular about sunscreen.  </li>

            <li>A small amount goes a long way... which is good given the price.</li>
            <li>I actually find this very very beneficial, as it acts as a barrier between skin and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>When rubbing it in, it does require effort, but I have noticed that as long as you get a consistent coverage, the white-ness subsides a bit as the oil absorbs into your skin.  </li>

            <li>I have tried many, many different sunscreens because I like being outdoors and live in a hot, sunny climate, and this is one of the worst ones I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> I was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with Badger Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t want that, this isn&#x27;t your best choice.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  </li>
            <li> If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline.</li>

            <li> Great sunscreen with excellent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> My sister works for a dermatologist, and said that this is definitely good stuff!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen worked great during my trip to Cancun where some of the parks require biodegradable lotions.  </li>
            <li> Great sunscreen coverage.  </li>
            <li> Great for the beach...</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t have toxic chemicals and is made with non-nano particles so that it doesn&#x27;t pass the skin barrier.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and protection, but a pain to apply.</li>
            <li> We applied the Badger face stick to our faces and this to our bodies before going out in the mornings and after lunch and had great results.</li>
            <li> Very successfully blocks out the sun, in fact anywhere I missed on my shoulders did get burned, but that was okay for comparisons sake!</li>
            <li> chose this brand because it has a great EWG rating.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>

            <li> I like that it has a great water resistant finish.  </li>

            <li> Great sunscreen with no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen without all the chemicals...works well for my kids</li>
            <li> Works great at preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this brand several times now, works perfect and scores a rating of 1 on the EWG website which is the best of the best!</li>
            <li> Nice product!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It rubbed off on EVERYTHING, despite rubbing it in the best we could and waiting 10 minutes before touching anything.  </li>
            <li> Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water.</li>

            <li> To tell the turth here, zinc oxide based sunscreen, like Badger brand is the best to use, if you are going to spend a lot of time being outdoors and sunburn easily like I do.</li>
            <li> I am so bummed, because I am still searching for a good organic sunscreen that can protect me from getting burned.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> I guess good sunscreen</li>
            <li> (I have a fair complexion anyway</li>
            <li> But seriously good coverage.</li>
            <li> So Badger is a really good value AND it performs pretty well, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Used it in Mexico, works great, glad it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and aluminums.</li>
            <li> Great organic and safe sunscreen product just requires allot of rubbing in.  </li>
            <li> We have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with its staying power even after a lot of swimming.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a truly safe, effective sunscreen!</li>
            <li> My son breaks out in a rash from most sunscreens - but not this one!</li>
            <li> So glad I found you.....!  </li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite sunscreen yet!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> They work by creating a whitish hue to your skin and effectively reflect the suns rays before it hits your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing to use it when I mow the lawn and need the absolute best sun protection.  </li>
            <li> Works good and fortunately, I don&#x27;t care if I look &amp;#34;white-faced&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m fishing...</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding more zinc with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; formulations of drugstore sunscreens use minerals to protect your skin.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t notice those things! :-)  </li>
            <li> Sunflower oil protects the skin from bacteria (meaning it can prevent acne) and free radicals, which can damage the cells of your skin and it makes an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Mostly, their differences lie in consistency.</li>
            <li> It probably has the most zinc oxide of the three.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff</li>
            <li> Thank you Badger for keeping us free of poision!</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for in a sunscreen?</li>
            <li> This is a safe suncreen product.</li>
            <li> There is no scent and it is safe.</li>
            <li> I also wanted something with more UVA</li>
            <li> This sunscreen meets my standards AND we love it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of of an ointment consistency.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I am ordering two more tubes of it today.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s safe sun protection.</li>
            <li> Love love love this it stays on</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of sunscreens since, being a cyclist, I am often out in the sun during the more punishing parts of the day.  </li>
            <li> it blended in better.</li>
            <li> ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd order , great product !!!</li>
            <li> make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix.</li>
            <li> Great for ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and totally natural protection.</li>
            <li> When I sweat, this product rubs off so easily</li>
            <li> So it also washes off easily when they play in the water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like wearing a mirror suit and that Suits me just fine</li>
            <li> I was able to remove the residue easily, but its worth noting that you may want to apply before you get out in the sunshine</li>
            <li> I received prompt and accurate service, but I don&#x27;t like the sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> That played a huge role in my trust of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Texture: A+&lt;br /&gt; -goes on smoothly and not oily or greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Scent:</li>
            <li> I found that I have to use t with another lotion or even and oil to really get any kind of coverage on my body.</li>
            <li> Although you have to rub this in much more than a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; sunscreen, I feel better knowing the ingredients are more natural</li>
            <li> A Light complicted lifeguatd told me about badger after I Asked.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product, used sparingly.</li>
            <li> Works well, I trust the fact that it&#x27;s chemical free.</li>
            <li> Smooth, reparative, protective</li>
            <li> BADGER sunscreen is fabulous.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does a great job and does not cause any break outs on my back and chest!</li>
            <li> PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfied they use natural ingredients that work rather than chemicals that have an impact on my child.  </li>
            <li> The higher the ZO, the more SPF.</li>
            <li> THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yours is the only non-pasty sunscreen I know of that is truly the best, all natural and 25% non-nano zinc.</li>
            <li> And the ingredients are clean to boot.</li>
            <li> It really protected my daughter and I very well as we are quite fair.</li>
            <li> means better protection although I will look like a ghost since the white ZO will stay on till I take a bath so for real light days</li>
            <li> Another nice thing about mineral sunblocks is that they are pretty safe to use for people with sensitive skin (mine is not).  </li>
            <li> I spent a great amount of time researching sun protection</li>
            <li> All I have to do is make sure it is rubbed in really well.</li>
            <li> It does come out of the tube kind of pasty and thick, kind of like squeezing clay out of a toothpaste tube!  </li>
            <li> Finally, tocopherol--or in English, Vitamin E oil is GREAT for your skin!</li>
            <li> I bought several different sunblocks recommended on EWG&#x27;s Best Beach &amp; Sport Sunscreens (http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/best-sunscreens/best-beach-sport-sunscreens/)</li>
            <li> I am a guerrilla gardener (neighborhood beautifier, creator of pollinator pathways and biodiversity corridors) in super sunny California.</li>
            <li> I was not so lucky.  </li>
            <li> Arrive quickly</li>
            <li> &gt; -not unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in the PNW, so we mostly use sunscreen from June until September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned strawberry blonde and this does the exact job it was intended for.</li>
            <li> There are better mineral sunscreens out there that go on more smoothly and seem to work better but are more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used this sunscreen for several years and love it!</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since it is less ingredient with more protection since I control the zinc.</li>
            <li> Aryu-Veda goes on smoothly and moisturizes REALLY</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural sunscreen</li>
            <li> Badger contains non-Nano particle zinc oxide, which cannot be absorbed into the skin, but rather stays on the surface until rubbed off.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more for next summer and would recommend this to anyone looking for a sunscreen with a good EWG rating that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent 4 hours in a kayak on Lake Superior and didn&#x27;t burn anywhere on my face, neck and arms.</li>
            <li> And all natural ingredients make me feel better about what I&#x27;m putting on myself and my kid.</li>
            <li> SO THE ZO SHOULD STAY ON THE SKIN NOT TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SKIN AND PROCESSED BY LIVER.</li>
            <li> , I make my own sunscreen as well so for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix.</li>
            <li> I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li> I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li> This is old school white zinc, so it is very effective and stays put.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen for the first time when I took a quick trip to the beach that lasted about six hours.</li>
            <li> They can even just about jump right into the water as soon as it is applied no need to wait</li>
            <li> WITH THE RIGHT SIZE ZO, YOU WILL HAVE TO WASH YOUR SKIN SINCE EVEN THE OCEAN&#x27;S SALT WATER WILL NOT REMOVE OF YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BADGER</li>
            <li> READ TO GET THE RIGHT MIX INCLUDING THE SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tougher to apply, but not by much, and the results are great... unless you want a tan.</li>
            <li> Pretty thick and visible (don&#x27;t expect it to get absorbed into your skin) but offers great protection!</li>
            <li> I am already naturally somewhat tan and don&#x27;t burn easily.</li>
            <li> I am a strawberry blonde adult with fair skin</li>
            <li> Badger is free from all the toxins in most other products.</li>
            <li> So I think it is safe to assume that only I noticed the whitish hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Although there is a notable (apparently to me only) whitish hue, I am willing to accept this because the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I could return the unopened second tube (and, ideally, the first, used only once) and find an all-natural sunscreen that didn&#x27;t nearly stain my skin.</li>
            <li> but I thought others should be aware.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection and gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> Used during our last vacation and was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> and this is the first summer using it on our twins.</li>
            <li> and I used this on our first beach day.</li>
            <li> I might buy it again for my next diving because it is safe for reef.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will definitely be ordering again !</li>
            <li> Love that it is organic, does not contain Titanium and only has 5 ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty cautious as to what I use on his skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for having a healthy low toxicity  sunscreen</li>
            <li> That is exactly what I want from a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> On a recent trip to Florida to visit family, we did not pack sunscreen, since we were taking everything in a carry-on and were bound to use more than the 3 oz.</li>
            <li> The first three days of our trip, we used a chemical-based sunscreen with an SPF of 35.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will buy it again next season.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve lasted a whole summer of fun.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to super creamy commercial sunscreens, this texture may be new to you, but it works really well and is such a great option for keeping toxic chemicals off of your body.</li>
            <li> Rubbed it in better on my face and the white tint pretty much disappeared</li>
            <li> I burn pretty easily, so I pretty much bathe in whatever product I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> It can sometimes require a lot of scrubbing to totally remove it, but again, I don&#x27;t mind some left over residue because it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s good for high sun exposure, not a quick dip in the pool.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m always looking for more natural alternatives to chemically produced skin products, this minimal ingredient sunscreen is SUPER DENSE!</li>
            <li> We are VERY particular about what goes in and on our bodies.  </li>
            <li> I do not burn easily, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time my skin was so burned.  </li>
            <li> It does initially make him look like a ghost but, unlike many other natural sunscreens, it rubs in pretty easily and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> It is thick and more noticeable than your average sunscreen, and it&#x27;s advisable to lather it on and have the white tint, but it&#x27;s safe for you to use (good product), and will do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> very thick to apply, but works great.  </li>
            <li> very good sunscrren but white and thick and chalky.</li>
            <li> smells a little funny, but great for long hours at the beach.</li>
            <li> All in all, I really do like it.</li>
            <li> It leaves a whitish hue, but stays put really well.</li>
            <li> works well, but very creamy... takes awhile to rub in the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just too much effort in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Protected very well and did not posses a threat to the waters or Eco system.</li>
            <li> Works very well.....</li>
            <li> really like the cream,</li>
            <li> My wife did not have the same problem, but she has a light complexion than me.  </li>
            <li> It very well might depend on your skin type.</li>
            <li> Badger stood up to the california sun on the Colorado river and my son did not burn the whole four days</li>
            <li> After a couple of days of use, so much pressure was needed to squeeze it out that the seam on the bottom split and squirt out.  </li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t show up on me much).</li>
            <li> However, I find the texture to be very creamy and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Periodically I like to go through the Environmental Working Group (EWG) list of sunscreens, and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> on very well and doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> but it seems to work well on preventing my skin from feeling any kind of harsh expose from the sun for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> I spent some of that time in the ocean and some sitting under an umbrella with a 40 SPF rating, so it really should have been able to handle that amount of sun, and yes, I did reapply.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a more natural, physical sunscreen instead of a chemical one because I was raised by hippies and have bought into the EWG ratings despite my reservations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this natural alternative to chemical laden sunscreens that always make my back break out.</li>
            <li> It works better, but I really cannot compare it to Badger due to price</li>
            <li> Even finding that they have not needed as many reapplications, as they did with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other zinc based products that didn&#x27;t make me look like a ghost like this one.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s it worth to you feels good not messy you look a little white if you use too much</li>
            <li> look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> actually love, love, love Badger&#x27;s face stick version of this product, so this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> It protects without using chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral sunscreens use white powder like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide (which this product does not contain the latter, which is a good thing in my book because it it potentially harmful to your skin).</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m usually pretty conscious of the chemical makeup of the items I use.  </li>
            <li> Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), Essential Oils of *Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Organic Sweet Orange) and *Citrus Tangerina (Organic Tangerine), Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E), CO2 Extracts of *Hippophae Rhamnoides (Organic Seabuckthorn) and *Vanilla Planifolia (Organic Vanilla).</li>
            <li> More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less</li>
            <li> More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less</li>
            <li> spend hours outside enjoying the short northern summers, no matter what our activity, whether in water or land, this sunscreen has prevented any sunburns.</li>
            <li> I reapplied twice in 2 hours at the beach on a partly cloudy and even rainy day and had a mild burn later that night.</li>
            <li> but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A minimal amount worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> It does not cause skin reactions on my sensitive skin kids and it lasts in the water!!</li>
            <li> But it dries nicely on skin (not oily) and has hardly any odor.</li>
            <li> Great protection, but difficult to spread and get rubbed in</li>
            <li> We were in the direct FL sunshine for 3 days straight using this and did not burn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for trail rides, when normal sunscreens sweat off and have to be replaced.</li>
            <li> What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>

            <li> Natural ingredients and works so much better than any other sunscreen I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Great price and the bottle is small, but it&#x27;s so thick that you don&#x27;t need much to cover a large area!</li>
            <li> As a fair-complected female with a history of melanoma, I am pretty particular about sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long so reapply more frequently.</li>
            <li> I live on east coast Fl.</li>
            <li> This may become our new go-to sunscreen for vacations.</li>
            <li> but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way... which is good given the price.</li>
            <li> I actually find this very very beneficial, as it acts as a barrier between skin and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Natural sunscreens do come out thicker than normal ones</li>
            <li> you want chamomile, then get Baby Badger exactly with the same formula without vanilla but with chamomile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>

            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to, but it blends in easily with a few rubs.</li>
            <li> Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day.</li>

            <li> goes on smoothly, but has an oily consistency, runs a little, and causes breakouts.</li>
            <li> When rubbing it in, it does require effort, but I have noticed that as long as you get a consistent coverage, the white-ness subsides a bit as the oil absorbs into your skin.  </li>

            <li> Natural oatmeal</li>
            <li> Protects well but be prepared to be coated in a layer of white film if you don&#x27;t scrub really well.</li>
            <li> It is all natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much safer than commercial sun screens.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin, and it works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mostly natural products on her skin.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> It rubs all the way in, does not leave a residue and while in the sun, the product did protect from burns in fact my natural skin tone did not change color at all.</li>

            <li> It is some thick stuff to be sure.</li>
            <li> There is a tremendous amount of reflected sunlight and here in Oakland we&#x27;re far enough away from the equator where the sun creeps into the zone the skin in my sweaty face in the early mornings and evenings after six, which are the only times we&#x27;re allowed to water in this historic drought.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I love that there&#x27;s only a few ingredients in this one!</li>
            <li> There are certainly lots of brands out there that also rate high on the EWG scale, but I have used other Badger products (like their sleepy time rubs) and I knew the brand already.</li>
            <li> The powdery texture of the zinc oxide, though a bit white, tends to give the skin a matte finish, and reflects light, which should make wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others, but this is the only one that works for heavy duty, but non-toxic, protection of especially the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the minimal ingredients used and it has worked very well in full sun for my very pale little boys!</li>
            <li> I want the highest ZO especially when it is priced right since ZO is expensive and more</li>
            <li> Leaves a thin white film, but it&#x27;s easily covered with a little makeup, and it certainly is more protective than any I&#x27;ve ever used before.  </li>
            <li> ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks.</li>

            <li> It did leave white (make sure you have at least 30min to absorb it).</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different sunscreens because I like being outdoors and live in a hot, sunny climate, and this is one of the worst ones I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> very thick and white; hard to apply liberally and not have whiteness; hard to wash off of hands without towels; I realize that &amp;#34;thick &amp; white&amp;#34; may be typical for this type of product at this SPF level; because I can&#x27;t get past these issues, I have no assessment as to whether or not it&#x27;s an effective sunscreen; good tube however -- no problem with &amp;#34;too much product&amp;#34; coming, flowing, or spilling out</li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care too much if it makes my skin a little white.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well for the chemically sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a sunscreen that was safe for my entire family with the least amount of icky chemicals.</li>
            <li> wee bit thick but not difficult</li>
            <li> In about an hour and a half, under a screen that supposedly blocks 20% of the sun&#x27;s rays, my shoulders and back were already visibly red, and they burned badly enough that I peeled several days later.</li>
            <li> My only big qualm with it is that it leaves my skin very dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> but as the old TV commercial said &#x27; a little dab&#x27;ll do us&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Clean sunblock but on the thick side and hard to rub completely in.</li>
            <li> Just the sunscreen&#x27;s texture is a bit thick and you have to rub it very well for the white to disappear.</li>
            <li> But for normal everyday use this stuff is not realistic.</li>
            <li> Very good sports sunscreen, stays on for a very long time (all day protection), not 5 stars just because it is very hard to put on, it is very thick and it needs to be applied slowly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very benign and hard to place.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very waterproof and hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this profit for long</li>
            <li> As long as it is on your skin, you can keep the matte finish and there&#x27;s the added benefit of knowing that it is still working (since you can see the whitish tint to your skin).  </li>
            <li> Anyone want several partially used tubes of this goop?</li>

            <li> I mean so dense that I have some problems trying to really apply and smear it on my skin.</li>
            <li> little more expensive than others but with skin</li>

            <li> but then again, less ZO offers less protection.</li>
            <li> I like this mineral sunscreen because it prevents the sun&#x27;s damaging rays from actually hitting, much less penetrating your skin (where the ionizing radiation can do harm).  </li>
            <li> My problem with it is that you have to spend about half an hour rubbing it in, and even after all that effort there&#x27;s still a bit of the white clown face look.</li>
            <li> It does leave a slight white cast on the skin and it does take a while to rub in.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick, but feels very moisturizing, a little bit like shea butter.</li>
            <li> Works great without all the horrible ingredients.</li>
            <li> It may work well, BUT it took me three showers and a rough scrubber to wash the zinc oxide whiteness off my legs.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s a lot thicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> It is harder to spread.</li>
            <li> and I did apply it a few times in my car where it left residue.</li>
            <li> Minimal ingredients.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t spread thinly, you have the old lifeguard white nose and lips.</li>
            <li> I am fairly pale, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> also like that a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> This stuff provides a lot of protection and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I believe due to the ZInc Oxide</li>
            <li> It works well as sunscreen but other reviews have a point.</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>

            <li> Goes on thick and is white, so if you are self conscious apply with a mirror so you can rub in the thick parts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and can leave an obvious white layer on skin.</li>
            <li> All three have non-nano zinc oxide as the active ingredient and do their job.</li>
            <li> Active ingredient: 22.5% non-nano uncoated zinc oxide, Ingredients (certified organic): sunflower seed oil, beeswax, jojoba seed oil, sunflower vitamin E.</li>
            <li> On my last beach trip where I used a different sunscreen, I started looking a little pink after a few days, but with the Badger one, it only took a few hours to burn much worse.</li>
            <li> but I do spread it on thick especially on my face.</li>
            <li> Actually reminded me of thick diaper rash creams.</li>
            <li> I debated giving the badger sport sunscreen one less star because it&#x27;s expensive and it takes so much effort to blend the lotion into my kids&#x27; skin</li>
            <li> I went out and about too, and no one stopped and pointed at me, and no children broke out in tears due to seeing a ghost!</li>
            <li> I will never buy this again and throwing away the other one we bought!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick so only use a little and spread it well.  </li>
            <li> yes I looked odd</li>
            <li> / use with my previous sunscreen, Kiss My Face</li>
            <li> It can be rubbed in to be less opaque.</li>
            <li> However, it also makes it a little hard to work in and leaves you a little chalky white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so thick as a white paste that is very hard to spread over the face without having a white mask effect on face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to stay out of the sun, but have a very active lifestyle which necessitates its use.  </li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than a typical sunscreen</li>
            <li> My skin got pretty burned and tanned, and my poor blue-eyed husband burned even worse.</li>
            <li> It does contain zinc oxide, so it&#x27;s a little thicker than I am&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let it set for a little bit and rubbed it in again</li>
            <li> It is tough to rub in but that is standard with zinc sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very thick and leaves you looking white.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am a disabled Vietnam vet and have had one issue with skin cancer according to what I can divert some products</li>
            <li> This sunscreen leaves an thin white layer on your skin.</li>
            <li> I disliked using the chemicals, but it worked, and I didn&#x27;t even wind up with tan lines, though we were out in the sun quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen every year since I found it on the internet a few years ago.</li>
            <li> All three seem to limit UV damage and are very natural, without chemical or dangerous ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> I usually apply 2-3 times a day and no one has been burnt at all this summer.</li>
            <li> My sister missed a few spots, but it works wonders!</li>
            <li> We applied several times during the day as well and rubbed it in (really difficult to rub in as well)..</li>
            <li> My family used the neutragena sunscreen we usually use and did not burn- even without reapplying but once.</li>
            <li> might also mention the four ingredients that base this sunscreen; this is a short list of only four ingredients too.  </li>
            <li> Quality sunscreens are not over 30 SPF and if any above 30 SPF, it is a simple marketing, meaning positively worthless.</li>
            <li> Quality sunscreens are not over 30 SPF and if any above 30 SPF, it is a simple marketing, meaning positively worthless.</li>
            <li> If you are very pale it probably isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to rub in, but it protects you from harmful rays without the harmful chemicals in typical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;null&amp;#34; features to me were scent--there is hardly a trace of any discernible scent.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff is just too hard to use.  </li>
            <li> A little annoying to me, and as mentioned earlier, it is a little bothering</li>
            <li> The formula is extremely thick and hard to spread on your skin.</li>
            <li> this contains far fewer nasty chemicals than your standard off-the-shelf sunblock.</li>
            <li> But at least it isn&#x27;t poisoning me.</li>
            <li> and I looked crazy white</li>
            <li> how slowly it comes out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> Badger is thick and pasty going on, and you have to rub it in.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is so thick you need 2 hands to squeeze it out of the tube</li>
            <li> Really thick.</li>
            <li> We usually like Badger brand!</li>
            <li> This is almost impossible to wash off without a lot of soap, which I don&#x27;t want to use in the backcountry.&lt;br /&gt;- on a recent 2-day camping trip with thorough, thick, and re-application, I still got sunburned.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was impossible to rub in completely, especially on squirmy children&lt;</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s hard to rub in (but who doesn&#x27;t like dressing up as a Geisha?), but it works!</li>
            <li> My kids and I got terribly sun burned the first time that I used this product.</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> It is very thick.</li>
            <li> vs. a thin liquid, and it stays on.  </li>
            <li> While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer.</li>
            <li> This said, I&#x27;m also the daughter of someone with skin cancer, and I take skin protection very seriously.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use at an eco park in Mexico since it is &amp;#34;biodegradable&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  I ended up using it at the beach in the carribean and found it very difficult to rub on-- very stiff paste like consistency.</li>
            <li> we were both horribly sunburned despite regular reapplying.</li>
            <li> , is difficult to rub in, and streaks when swimming or sweating.  </li>
            <li> and although the brand should be commended on the ingredients it is difficult to use</li>
            <li> Reapplication is difficult to impossible when you are sweating.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I also abhor chemical sunscreens, which block hormone reception in cells, which is a BAD thing--which can CAUSE cancer.  </li>
            <li> I hate giving bad reviews</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun.</li>
            <li> How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve decided that I hate it:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This is AWFUL sunscreen.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it would leave your skin looking white.</li>
            <li> Effectiveness: A+&lt;br /&gt; -rode bike for 80 miles from 10:30-5:00 last weekend and only applied once before leaving house. Not a bit of redness&lt;br /&gt;Texture: A+&lt;br /&gt; -goes on smoothly and not oily or greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: A+&lt;br /&gt; -not unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this profit for long but it seems to work well on preventing my skin from feeling any kind of harsh expose from the sun for extended periods of time. Though I&#x27;m always looking for more natural alternatives to chemically produced skin products, this minimal ingredient sunscreen is SUPER DENSE! I mean so dense that I have some problems trying to really apply and smear it on my skin. I found that I have to use t with another lotion or even and oil to really get any kind of coverage on my body.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural sunscreen and I think I found it! Although you have to rub this in much more than a &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; sunscreen, I feel better knowing the ingredients are more natural</li>
            <li> Personally, I like the stuff.  As a fair-complected female with a history of melanoma, I am pretty particular about sunscreen.  I try to stay out of the sun, but have a very active lifestyle which necessitates its use.  I also abhor chemical sunscreens, which block hormone reception in cells, which is a BAD thing--which can CAUSE cancer.  This makes no sense to me, which brings me back to my initial point.  I like this mineral sunscreen because it prevents the sun&#x27;s damaging rays from actually hitting, much less penetrating your skin (where the ionizing radiation can do harm).  It protects without using chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral sunscreens use white powder like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide (which this product does not contain the latter, which is a good thing in my book because it it potentially harmful to your skin). These white powders are based in oil, which makes them spreadable and helps nourish and protect the skin.  They work by creating a whitish hue to your skin and effectively reflect the suns rays before it hits your skin.  Badger contains non-Nano particle zinc oxide, which cannot be absorbed into the skin, but rather stays on the surface until rubbed off.  Another nice thing about mineral sunblocks is that they are pretty safe to use for people with sensitive skin (mine is not).  Most &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; formulations of drugstore sunscreens use minerals to protect your skin. So it should not cause any reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this on my face and body. It does come out of the tube kind of pasty and thick, kind of like squeezing clay out of a toothpaste tube!  When rubbing it in, it does require effort, but I have noticed that as long as you get a consistent coverage, the white-ness subsides a bit as the oil absorbs into your skin.  I actually LIKE the white-ness of it for facial use.  The powdery texture of the zinc oxide, though a bit white, tends to give the skin a matte finish, and reflects light, which should make wrinkles less noticeable. As long as it is on your skin, you can keep the matte finish and there&#x27;s the added benefit of knowing that it is still working (since you can see the whitish tint to your skin).  Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t worry much about other people noticing the white, since you are your own worst critic.  My boyfriend did not notice anything unusual about my skin when I switched to this brand--but then again, he is only a guy! They just don&#x27;t notice those things! :-)  I went out and about too, and no one stopped and pointed at me, and no children broke out in tears due to seeing a ghost! So I think it is safe to assume that only I noticed the whitish hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that a little bit goes a long way, so 3 oz will last quite well. I also like that it stays put and does not run into your eyes and make them water, which is my biggest annoyance with any sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might also mention the four ingredients that base this sunscreen; this is a short list of only four ingredients too.  Sunflower oil protects the skin from bacteria (meaning it can prevent acne) and free radicals, which can damage the cells of your skin and it makes an effective moisturizer. Beeswax is a thickening agent--probably to blame for the thickness, but it comes with added benefits such as antibacterial, healing, and moisturizing properties. Jojoba oil is the closest in consistency and pH to our skin&#x27;s natural oils and is noted for its moisturizing capabilities, plus it has some natural sun protective properties. Finally, tocopherol--or in English, Vitamin E oil is GREAT for your skin! I sometimes use it at night as a vegetable (sunflower) based alternative to Retinol (which is animal based), and the results are about the same.  It helps moisture and improves cell turnover. I like how moisturized my skin looks and feels after using it, only without causing a shiny face that oils can cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the drawbacks--which are what prompted me to give it four stars--is that after using it, if you itch your arm or any part that it has been applied to, you will get white dust under your fingernails.  A little annoying to me, and as mentioned earlier, it is a little bothering how slowly it comes out of the tube.  Realistically speaking, however I &amp;#34;normally&amp;#34; use a brand that costs twice the amount of this one. It works better, but I really cannot compare it to Badger due to price difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;null&amp;#34; features to me were scent--there is hardly a trace of any discernible scent.  It&#x27;s very benign and hard to place.  Natural oatmeal I guess? So I doubt the smell would bother anyone. All in all, I really do like it. Although there is a notable (apparently to me only) whitish hue, I am willing to accept this because the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I bought a bottle of Climb On! sunblock, and a bottle of Aryu-veda sunblock. I would rate them as Aryu-veda #1 (of course it costs $28/ 4-oz bottle), Badger #2, and Climb On! #3. All three have non-nano zinc oxide as the active ingredient and do their job. All three seem to limit UV damage and are very natural, without chemical or dangerous ingredients. Mostly, their differences lie in consistency. Aryu-Veda goes on smoothly and moisturizes REALLY WELL all day. Badger is thick and pasty going on, and you have to rub it in. It leaves a whitish hue, but stays put really well. It probably has the most zinc oxide of the three. Climb On! goes on smoothly, but has an oily consistency, runs a little, and causes breakouts. So Badger is a really good value AND it performs pretty well, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingrdients others have...</li>
            <li> Very good sports sunscreen, stays on for a very long time (all day protection), not 5 stars just because it is very hard to put on, it is very thick and it needs to be applied slowly.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen worked great during my trip to Cancun where some of the parks require biodegradable lotions.  Badger sport stayed on and I saw no signs of burned skin.  I also didn&#x27;t have to lather on a lot of product.  A minimal amount worked just fine.  The only day I burnt was the day I forgot to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  organic, biodegradable, protects well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Nothing big.  Just the sunscreen&#x27;s texture is a bit thick and you have to rub it very well for the white to disappear.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen coverage.  It is tough to rub in but that is standard with zinc sunscreens.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Used it in Mexico, works great, glad it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals and aluminums.</li>
            <li> Great for the beach...yes I looked odd but I do spread it on thick especially on my face. But as a result, zero color after an entire day at the beach without a cloud in the sky.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, too!</li>
            <li> I received prompt and accurate service, but I don&#x27;t like the sunscreen at all. It may work well, BUT it took me three showers and a rough scrubber to wash the zinc oxide whiteness off my legs. I wish I could return the unopened second tube (and, ideally, the first, used only once) and find an all-natural sunscreen that didn&#x27;t nearly stain my skin.</li>
            <li> I live on east coast Fl. A Light complicted lifeguatd told me about badger after I Asked.He is in the sun all day and he did not look beet red. Th day after I received badger I was at beach for five days surfing etc.Never did I have that burning feeling.Love the stuff</li>
            <li> I like that this contains far fewer nasty chemicals than your standard off-the-shelf sunblock. This stuff is tenacious. Protects well but be prepared to be coated in a layer of white film if you don&#x27;t scrub really well.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a truly safe, effective sunscreen! Yours is the only non-pasty sunscreen I know of that is truly the best, all natural and 25% non-nano zinc. Thank you Badger for keeping us free of poision!</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t have toxic chemicals and is made with non-nano particles so that it doesn&#x27;t pass the skin barrier. What more could you ask for in a sunscreen?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for trail rides, when normal sunscreens sweat off and have to be replaced. This is old school white zinc, so it is very effective and stays put.</li>
            <li> Badger is my go to for sunscreens and lotions. If I wouldn&#x27;t eat it, it doesn&#x27;t go on our skin. Badger is free from all the toxins in most other products. Goes on thick and is white, so if you are self conscious apply with a mirror so you can rub in the thick parts. Great for ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great natural sunscreen.  Natural sunscreens do come out thicker than normal ones but I love that there&#x27;s only a few ingredients in this one!</li>
            <li> My kids and I got terribly sun burned the first time that I used this product. I am so bummed, because I am still searching for a good organic sunscreen that can protect me from getting burned.</li>
            <li> This is a safe suncreen product. It is a little thicker than a typical sunscreen but it does blend all into skin and there is no sticky residue or anything. There is no scent and it is safe. Doesn&#x27;t contain cancerous chemicals like the major products on the market. I was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great protection, but difficult to spread and get rubbed in or I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> very thick to apply, but works great.  Great organic and safe sunscreen product just requires allot of rubbing in.  I usually apply 2-3 times a day and no one has been burnt at all this summer.</li>
            <li> This stuff provides a lot of protection and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Do not use this on your children or yourelf unless you want to burn.</li>
            <li> My sister missed a few spots, but it works wonders! This is after one application and a day in the sun and in the water.</li>
            <li> Very thick. But at least it isn&#x27;t poisoning me.</li>
            <li> I caked this stuff on and my entire family still got burned!  Followed the directions and reapplied too. I hate giving bad reviews but I thought others should be aware.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d like this sunscreen as it&#x27;s non-toxic and I don&#x27;t care too much if it makes my skin a little white.  I also wanted something with more UVA protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;ve decided that I hate it:&lt;br /&gt;- it makes my skin red and itchy&lt;br /&gt;- I use sunscreen for overnight camping trips.  This is almost impossible to wash off without a lot of soap, which I don&#x27;t want to use in the backcountry.&lt;br /&gt;- on a recent 2-day camping trip with thorough, thick, and re-application, I still got sunburned.  I would not have gotten burned in similar circumstances / use with my previous sunscreen, Kiss My Face Face Factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I&#x27;m going back to Kiss My Face.  Anyone want several partially used tubes of this goop?</li>
            <li> Have purchased this brand several times now, works perfect and scores a rating of 1 on the EWG website which is the best of the best!</li>
            <li> Great coverage and protection, but a pain to apply. It is some thick stuff to be sure.</li>
            <li> My son breaks out in a rash from most sunscreens - but not this one! Great sun protection and gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> Works for MCS and allergy patients.</li>
            <li> Used during our last vacation and was extremely pleased. A small amount goes a long way... which is good given the price. We didn&#x27;t reapply even during all-day snorkeling and none of us got a sunburn. This may become our new go-to sunscreen for vacations. It&#x27;s a little tougher to apply, but not by much, and the results are great... unless you want a tan.</li>
            <li> This is AWFUL sunscreen. We bought it because it is corn-free (allergies!) and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It doesn&#x27;t rub in, so you have streaky white everything, and then you sweat it off instantly. we were both horribly sunburned despite regular reapplying. Never buying again.</li>
            <li> Works good and fortunately, I don&#x27;t care if I look &amp;#34;white-faced&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m fishing... keeps people away if I look at a leper.  Didn&#x27;t run into my eyes whilst sweating either.</li>
            <li> We are VERY particular about what goes in and on our bodies.  This sunscreen meets my standards AND we love it.  One of my sons doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  We were in the direct FL sunshine for 3 days straight using this and did not burn.  We applied the Badger face stick to our faces and this to our bodies before going out in the mornings and after lunch and had great results. If you&#x27;re used to super creamy commercial sunscreens, this texture may be new to you, but it works really well and is such a great option for keeping toxic chemicals off of your body.</li>
            <li> works well, but very creamy... takes awhile to rub in the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This Sunscreen is on the EWG list of approved sunscreens, which is a big part of what made me buy it. I know how well it works because I missed a spot on my back! Everywhere I managed to get the sunscreen on, I was well protected from my 5 hours in the sun. My sister works for a dermatologist, and said that this is definitely good stuff!</li>
            <li> Nice product! Very successfully blocks out the sun, in fact anywhere I missed on my shoulders did get burned, but that was okay for comparisons sake! It does leave on your skin like paste, even on a pasty white nerd like me, but I prefer NOT getting skin cancer over aesthetics. My only big qualm with it is that it leaves my skin very dry afterwards. My arms are flaky after two uses. So wash this product off and apply lotion after use.</li>
            <li> The pros:  It is all natural. No harmful Chemicals. It blocks the sun. No chemical smell. It&#x27;s much safer than commercial sun screens.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s a lot thicker than I expected. It is harder to spread. If you don&#x27;t spread thinly, you have the old lifeguard white nose and lips. Overall, a great product, used sparingly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;We spend hours outside enjoying the short northern summers, no matter what our activity, whether in water or land, this sunscreen has prevented any sunburns.</li>
            <li> Works well, I trust the fact that it&#x27;s chemical free. Leaves a white film  from the zinc for about 30 minutes, but that goes away.</li>
            <li> I spent a great amount of time researching sun protection&lt;br /&gt;I am a disabled Vietnam vet and have had one issue with skin cancer according to what I can divert some products have ingreadiants the MAY promote growth of rumors&lt;br /&gt;I WONT TAKE ANY CHANCES! Badger is MECANICAL PROTECTION that means NO chemicals it&#x27;s like wearing a mirror suit and that Suits me just fine&lt;br /&gt;A little more expensive than others but with skin what&#x27;s it worth to you feels good not messy you look a little white if you use too much but as the old TV commercial said &#x27; a little dab&#x27;ll do us&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Well this product does keep me from getting sunburned.  My problem with it is that you have to spend about half an hour rubbing it in, and even after all that effort there&#x27;s still a bit of the white clown face look. Just too much effort in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Went on vacation to Mexico and used this product . Protected very well and did not posses a threat to the waters or Eco system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased both Badger Sport and Badger for Kids Sunscreen Cream. I live in the PNW, so we mostly use sunscreen from June until September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this brand because it has a great EWG rating. I wanted a sunscreen that was safe for my entire family with the least amount of icky chemicals. There are certainly lots of brands out there that also rate high on the EWG scale, but I have used other Badger products (like their sleepy time rubs) and I knew the brand already. That played a huge role in my trust of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a &amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34; like you would imagine it to be. I believe due to the ZInc Oxide it&#x27;s more of of an ointment consistency. I actually find this very very beneficial, as it acts as a barrier between skin and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have now used it all summer and this is the first summer using it on our twins. We have been very pleased. Even finding that they have not needed as many reapplications, as they did with other sunscreens. I will definitely be buying more for next summer and would recommend this to anyone looking for a sunscreen with a good EWG rating that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing of note is that it is a bit greasy and I did apply it a few times in my car where it left residue. I was able to remove the residue easily, but its worth noting that you may want to apply before you get out in the sunshine or once you get there. I used baby wipes to remove the excess greasy feeling, but it does absorb in and you can continue to rub it in. It&#x27;s never been an issue that bothered me.</li>
            <li> It does a good job. I have a sensitive skin, and it works for me.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen leaves an thin white layer on your skin. I&#x27;ve used many other zinc based products that didn&#x27;t make me look like a ghost like this one.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smooth, reparative, protective</li>
            <li> very thick and white; hard to apply liberally and not have whiteness; hard to wash off of hands without towels; I realize that &amp;#34;thick &amp; white&amp;#34; may be typical for this type of product at this SPF level; because I can&#x27;t get past these issues, I have no assessment as to whether or not it&#x27;s an effective sunscreen; good tube however -- no problem with &amp;#34;too much product&amp;#34; coming, flowing, or spilling out</li>
            <li> Clean sunblock but on the thick side and hard to rub completely in.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen for the first time when I took a quick trip to the beach that lasted about six hours. My skin got pretty burned and tanned, and my poor blue-eyed husband burned even worse. I spent some of that time in the ocean and some sitting under an umbrella with a 40 SPF rating, so it really should have been able to handle that amount of sun, and yes, I did reapply. I do not burn easily, and I can&#x27;t remember the last time my skin was so burned.  On my last beach trip where I used a different sunscreen, I started looking a little pink after a few days, but with the Badger one, it only took a few hours to burn much worse. It is also makes you look very white (my husband said I looked like I had clown makeup on my face), is difficult to rub in, and streaks when swimming or sweating.  I have tried many, many different sunscreens because I like being outdoors and live in a hot, sunny climate, and this is one of the worst ones I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I purchased Badger Sunscreen because it was recommended by EWG.org as one of the sunscreens that&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT contain carcinogens. What a concept. It does contain zinc oxide, so it&#x27;s a little thicker than I am&lt;br /&gt;used to, but it blends in easily with a few rubs. I have not noticed a problem with it staining my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought it in SPF 15 which I use on my face. I am very happy with Badger Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Minimal ingredients.  Great protection. Stays on white -- doesn&#x27;t rub in - so if you don&#x27;t want that, this isn&#x27;t your best choice.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned strawberry blonde and this does the exact job it was intended for. I spent 4 hours in a kayak on Lake Superior and didn&#x27;t burn anywhere on my face, neck and arms.</li>
            <li> I guess good sunscreen but it&#x27;s very thick and leaves you looking white. Takes a while to rub in (which is a problem when your playing a sport)</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using mostly natural products on her skin. I doubted the SPF effectiveness of my homemade sunscreen, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It was terrible.**To note, I only used this on my daughter&#x27;s face** The formula is extremely thick and hard to spread on your skin. Secondly, it gave her skin rashes. The formula was very drying on her skin, and her face was peeling by the next day and still is crusting/peeling 4 days later.  I would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just got back from a cruise to Bermuda and my husband and I used this on our first beach day. It didn&#x27;t work and both of us got really burnt (a week later and we are still peeling). We applied several times during the day as well and rubbed it in (really difficult to rub in as well).. I am SO thankful we didn&#x27;t use this stuff on my daughter (used Think Baby). I will never buy this again and throwing away the other one we bought!</li>
            <li> Works very well.....really like the cream, vs. a thin liquid, and it stays on.  Leaves a thin white film, but it&#x27;s easily covered with a little makeup, and it certainly is more protective than any I&#x27;ve ever used before.  So glad I found you.....!  :)</li>
            <li> I did not get sun born.  Served its function, but did not like that the lotion did not rub in well.  I would look like a vampire anytime i put it in, it would look like I had white make-up on.  My wife did not have the same problem, but she has a light complexion than me.  It very well might depend on your skin type.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my diving course. I took an open water diving course at Tioman Island, Malaysia. It did leave white (make sure you have at least 30min to absorb it). Everybody said I looked like a ghost. And it can not prevent you from tanning. But it won&#x27;t let you get burn. I might buy it again for my next diving because it is safe for reef.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son when he was going fishing.  Badger stood up to the california sun on the Colorado river and my son did not burn the whole four days he was there.  I am ordering two more tubes of it today.</li>
            <li> Being darker complexion, the tint shows on your skin so I would continue to use the non-tint product. Both require massaging well into the skin to walk around with a white film on. But it works!</li>
            <li> This sunblock is so thick you need 2 hands to squeeze it out of the tube and it goes on like paste.  It does not rub in clear but leaves a white residue.  After a couple of days of use, so much pressure was needed to squeeze it out that the seam on the bottom split and squirt out.  I bought several different sunblocks recommended on EWG&#x27;s Best Beach &amp; Sport Sunscreens (http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/best-sunscreens/best-beach-sport-sunscreens/) and although the brand should be commended on the ingredients it is difficult to use and I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will definitely be ordering again !</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen! Natural ingredients and works so much better than any other sunscreen I have ever used! Great price and the bottle is small, but it&#x27;s so thick that you don&#x27;t need much to cover a large area! Only sunscreen I will buy for now on😁</li>
            <li> Did not work at all! We were burnt like lobsters after one day of using this stuff!</li>
            <li> I like that it has a great water resistant finish.  Great for the beach and lake time.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!  Use it on my sons sensitive skin. Never have any problems and he has never got a sunburn!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen with no harmful ingredients. Pretty thick and visible (don&#x27;t expect it to get absorbed into your skin) but offers great protection!</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s hard to rub in (but who doesn&#x27;t like dressing up as a Geisha?), but it works! And the ingredients are clean to boot.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with its staying power even after a lot of swimming. It really protected my daughter and I very well as we are quite fair. It&#x27;s my favorite sunscreen yet!</li>
            <li> Really thick. smells a little funny, but great for long hours at the beach.</li>
            <li> Went to the DR in August, applied it two to three times a day (was outside in the sun ALL day, swimming in pools/ocean/sweating/walking around/went jogging), and didn&#x27;t burn once. It is thick and more noticeable than your average sunscreen, and it&#x27;s advisable to lather it on and have the white tint, but it&#x27;s safe for you to use (good product), and will do it&#x27;s job. Rubbed it in better on my face and the white tint pretty much disappeared (I have a fair complexion anyway so it didn&#x27;t show up on me much). Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love that it is organic, does not contain Titanium and only has 5 ingredients. It does go on white which is what you experience when you avoid chemicals!!! It can be rubbed in to be less opaque.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a 6 month old baby and I&#x27;m pretty cautious as to what I use on his skin. I&#x27;ve tried several different natural sunscreens and this is by far my fav.  It does initially make him look like a ghost but, unlike many other natural sunscreens, it rubs in pretty easily and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well for the chemically sensitive.  It&#x27;s thick so only use a little and spread it well.  It does turn skin white at times.  Very satisfied they use natural ingredients that work rather than chemicals that have an impact on my child.  I switched for me too and haven&#x27;t been burnt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to rub in, but it protects you from harmful rays without the harmful chemicals in typical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter would break out into rashes when I used regular over the counter sunscreen. After some self online research I figured she was allergic. We use Badger and haven&#x27;t had any problems! It doesn&#x27;t last as long so reapply more frequently. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy either. Smells like sunflowers. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works well as sunscreen but other reviews have a point. It is very thick. Actually reminded me of thick diaper rash creams. It&#x27;s very thick and can leave an obvious white layer on skin. If you are very pale it probably isn&#x27;t an issue. I had a tan when I put it on and I looked crazy white and I tried to rub it in for about 20 minutes. I didn&#x27;t worry at all about sunburn though. I think it&#x27;s good for high sun exposure, not a quick dip in the pool.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen without all the chemicals...works well for my kids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for having a healthy low toxicity  sunscreen but this stuff is just too hard to use.  Imagine trying to spread cream cheese on your face.  This stuff just won&#x27;t blend in.  I&#x27;m continuing to use it when I mow the lawn and need the absolute best sun protection.  But for normal everyday use this stuff is not realistic.</li>
            <li> This itches my face. I was disappointed</li>
            <li> You have to use a LOT for it to work! We usually like Badger brand!</li>
            <li> this is listed as 4 oz., but reads 2.9 oz. in the picture...seller please correct</li>
            <li> I have used this sunscreen for several years and love it! It does leave a slight white cast on the skin and it does take a while to rub in. However, I find the texture to be very creamy and not greasy. It does not cause skin reactions on my sensitive skin kids and it lasts in the water!!</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s safe sun protection. Works great without all the horrible ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am a guerrilla gardener (neighborhood beautifier, creator of pollinator pathways and biodiversity corridors) in super sunny California. One of my gardens is on a hill and the zone I work is stretched out over the equivalent of 5 city blocks. There is a tremendous amount of reflected sunlight and here in Oakland we&#x27;re far enough away from the equator where the sun creeps into the zone the skin in my sweaty face in the early mornings and evenings after six, which are the only times we&#x27;re allowed to water in this historic drought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a redhead with very fair skin and I sweat on my face a lot. BADGER sunscreen is fabulous. It is the only sunscreen that I have ever used that does not require frequent re-application. If you are doing hard work or going for a long hike or have any reason to be outdoors in strong sunlight for hours, this is your product. I have to wash it off after hours of doing heavy physical work in a hot summer sun. That is exactly what I want from a sunscreen. I have tried many others, but this is the only one that works for heavy duty, but non-toxic, protection of especially the skin on my face. Thank you for making this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this it stays on and the kids don&#x27;t get burned. They can even just about jump right into the water as soon as it is applied no need to wait</li>
            <li> very good sunscrren but white and thick and chalky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the mother of two young children, and I work for an environmental nonprofit.  So I&#x27;m usually pretty conscious of the chemical makeup of the items I use.  This said, I&#x27;m also the daughter of someone with skin cancer, and I take skin protection very seriously.  On a recent trip to Florida to visit family, we did not pack sunscreen, since we were taking everything in a carry-on and were bound to use more than the 3 oz. limit while swimming in their pool every day.  So we used what our family had when we got there.  The first three days of our trip, we used a chemical-based sunscreen with an SPF of 35.  I disliked using the chemicals, but it worked, and I didn&#x27;t even wind up with tan lines, though we were out in the sun quite a bit.  On the fourth day, we ran out of the chemical based sunscreen, and my brother-in-law brought this cream over for us to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;It used non-nano zinc oxide instead of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I disliked:&lt;br /&gt;It was impossible to rub in completely, especially on squirmy children&lt;br /&gt;It rubbed off on EVERYTHING, despite rubbing it in the best we could and waiting 10 minutes before touching anything.  The snorkeling masks were practically ruined with the stuff, and all of the wording rubbed off of them.&lt;br /&gt;We still burned.  Thankfully, my children didn&#x27;t burn badly enough to peel - but then they were wearing rash guards covering their torsos and shoulders.  I was not so lucky.  In about an hour and a half, under a screen that supposedly blocks 20% of the sun&#x27;s rays, my shoulders and back were already visibly red, and they burned badly enough that I peeled several days later.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  wee bit thick but not difficult</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in. But seriously good coverage. And all natural ingredients make me feel better about what I&#x27;m putting on myself and my kid. I love it and will buy it again next season. Definitely. Also - a tiny tube, so I bought 2 and they&#x27;ve lasted a whole summer of fun.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use at an eco park in Mexico since it is &amp;#34;biodegradable&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34;  I ended up using it at the beach in the carribean and found it very difficult to rub on-- very stiff paste like consistency. I did not care for the whitish look but I can live with that. I am already naturally somewhat tan and don&#x27;t burn easily. I reapplied twice in 2 hours at the beach on a partly cloudy and even rainy day and had a mild burn later that night. My family used the neutragena sunscreen we usually use and did not burn- even without reapplying but once. I would not buy it again. There are better mineral sunscreens out there that go on more smoothly and seem to work better but are more expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It rubs all the way in, does not leave a residue and while in the sun, the product did protect from burns in fact my natural skin tone did not change color at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of sunscreens since, being a cyclist, I am often out in the sun during the more punishing parts of the day.  I burn pretty easily, so I pretty much bathe in whatever product I&#x27;m using.  I wanted to use a more natural, physical sunscreen instead of a chemical one because I was raised by hippies and have bought into the EWG ratings despite my reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked:&lt;br /&gt;* Lack of scent&lt;br /&gt;* Non-zano zinc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disliked:&lt;br /&gt;* It may be waterproof, but it&#x27;s not sweat-proof.  When I sweat, this product rubs off so easily and I burn baby burn.&lt;br /&gt;* Reapplication is difficult to impossible when you are sweating.&lt;br /&gt;* The white rubs off on EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;* It is the consistency of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually love, love, love Badger&#x27;s face stick version of this product, so this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Works wells. Uses wax to make it water resistant, which works well. However, it also makes it a little hard to work in and leaves you a little chalky white. I am fairly pale, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me. I let it set for a little bit and rubbed it in again (actually the direction on the tube) and it blended in better. Held up well to sweating and swimming in the ocean.</li>
            <li> I love this natural alternative to chemical laden sunscreens that always make my back break out. This sunscreen does a great job and does not cause any break outs on my back and chest!</li>
            <li> left to much of white residue on skin and ultimately clothing</li>
            <li> Works, but doesn&#x27;t rub in all the way and leaves a greasy white coating on skin. So it also washes off easily when they play in the water.</li>
            <li> Periodically I like to go through the Environmental Working Group (EWG) list of sunscreens, and I really like this one. It goes on thick, but feels very moisturizing, a little bit like shea butter. It can sometimes require a lot of scrubbing to totally remove it, but again, I don&#x27;t mind some left over residue because it feels good on my skin. Works great at preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen with excellent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on very well and doesn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> I debated giving the badger sport sunscreen one less star because it&#x27;s expensive and it takes so much effort to blend the lotion into my kids&#x27; skin it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m going to rub their skin off! But it dries nicely on skin (not oily) and has hardly any odor. I love the minimal ingredients used and it has worked very well in full sun for my very pale little boys! Active ingredient: 22.5% non-nano uncoated zinc oxide, Ingredients (certified organic): sunflower seed oil, beeswax, jojoba seed oil, sunflower vitamin E. And that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and totally natural protection. However, it&#x27;s not for daily usage.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so thick as a white paste that is very hard to spread over the face without having a white mask effect on face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very waterproof and hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> SUNSCREENS ARE NOT BEAUTY PRODUCTS. I USE TO PROTECT MY SKIN SO THE ZO SHOULD STAY ON THE SKIN NOT TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SKIN AND PROCESSED BY LIVER. WITH THE RIGHT SIZE ZO, YOU WILL HAVE TO WASH YOUR SKIN SINCE EVEN THE OCEAN&#x27;S SALT WATER WILL NOT REMOVE OF YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BADGER offers different ZOs so 22.5%, 18%, 10%... The higher the ZO, the more SPF. I want the highest ZO especially when it is priced right since ZO is expensive and more means better protection although I will look like a ghost since the white ZO will stay on till I take a bath so for real light days the low ZO works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;22.5% ZO MIX FORMULA:&lt;br /&gt;Active Sport Sunscreen Ingredient: Non-Nano Uncoated Zinc Oxide 22.5%&lt;br /&gt;Other Sport Sunscreen Ingredients: *Helianthus Annuus (Organic Sunflower) Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), *Simmondsia Chinensis (Organic Jojoba) Oil, Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;100% Certified Natural by NPA, 98% Certified Organic by NSF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18.7% ZO MIX FORMULA:&lt;br /&gt;Active Sunscreen Ingredient: Non-Nano, Uncoated Zinc Oxide 18.75%&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Sunscreen Ingredients: *Helianthus Annus (Organic Sunflower) Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E), and CO2 Extract of *Hippophae Rhamnoides (Organic Seabuckthorn).&lt;br /&gt;100% Certified Natural by NPA, 98% Certified Organic by NSF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ INGREDIENTS. THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I make my own sunscreen as well so for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix. If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since it is less ingredient with more protection since I control the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want vanilla then it is the same Badger but get the Kids Sunscreen which comes with Vanilla. BADGER KIDS FORMULA: Inactive Sunscreen Ingredients: *Helianthus Annuus (Organic Sunflower) Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), Essential Oils of *Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Organic Sweet Orange) and *Citrus Tangerina (Organic Tangerine), Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E), CO2 Extracts of *Hippophae Rhamnoides (Organic Seabuckthorn) and *Vanilla Planifolia (Organic Vanilla). * &#x3D; Certified Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want chamomile, then get Baby Badger exactly with the same formula without vanilla but with chamomile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAY ATTENTION TO THE CIRCLES ON THE FACE OF LABELING. READ TO GET THE RIGHT MIX INCLUDING THE SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix. If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding more zinc with fewer ingredients. ZO is what surfers put on their nose for protection, the white looking chalk. If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline. Majority of sun screens with ZOs are creams. Creams are more difficult to apply than lotions. Producers of sunscreens sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen, especially the percentage of the ZO varies by different production. More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less but then again, less ZO offers less protection. Producers write whatever they want to push a mix and it is up to consumers to read ingredients and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by the skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix. Quality sunscreens are not over 30 SPF and if any above 30 SPF, it is a simple marketing, meaning positively worthless. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1. ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks. Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;2. Must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s annual Sunscreen Guide.&lt;br /&gt;3. I do not pay attention to water proof or water resistant. How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun. Unless I put a deck coating or a roof on my head, it will not last. Anyone looking for those wordings should avoid sun and ocean. Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. Chemical is a chemical regardless.&lt;br /&gt;4. Majority have fragrance which I avoid. After all, I am going in the ocean not on a date. Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day. If I want any perfume, I will apply the perfume I purchase separately.&lt;br /&gt;5. I never leave the sunscreen in the sun. I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time so I never worry about few months old mix. Freshness is a priority in any mix especially when it comes to oil. I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6. I always apply 30 minutes before any exposure to the sun since it needs to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;7. BROAD SPECTRUM; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br /&gt;8. PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br /&gt;9. I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system.&lt;br /&gt;10. I avoid vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) which seems to boost skin cancer risk.t surfers put on their nose for protection, the white looking chalk. If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline. Majority of sun screens with ZOs are creams. Creams are more difficult to apply than lotions.

For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1. ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks. Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;2. Must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s annual Sunscreen Guide.&lt;br /&gt;3. I do not pay attention to water proof or water resistant. How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun. Unless I put a deck coating or a roof on my head, it will not last. Anyone looking for those wordings should avoid sun and ocean. Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. Chemical is a chemical regardless.&lt;br /&gt;4. Majority have fragrance which I avoid. After all, I am going in the ocean not on a date. Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day. If I want any perfume, I will apply the perfume I purchase separately.&lt;br /&gt;5. I never leave the sunscreen in the sun. I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time so I never worry about few months old mix. Freshness is a priority in any mix especially when it comes to oil. I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6. I always apply 30 minutes before any exposure to the sun since it needs to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;7. BROAD SPECTRUM; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br /&gt;8. PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br /&gt;9. I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system.&lt;br /&gt;10. I avoid vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) which seems to boost skin cancer risk.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd order , great product !!! Arrive quickly</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen every year since I found it on the internet a few years ago. I am a strawberry blonde adult with fair skin and I also have sensitive skin. When I forget to apply this sunscreen to my face, neck, ears and arms and I end up spending a lot of time outside any day of the week, I end up getting sunburned. One day I forgot to apply this sunscreen under my eyes, I ended up getting sunburned. I also do not mine that it causes my skin to turn white at all. All I have to do is make sure it is rubbed in really well. To tell the turth here, zinc oxide based sunscreen, like Badger brand is the best to use, if you are going to spend a lot of time being outdoors and sunburn easily like I do. I finally hope Badger keeps making this sunscreen forever.</li>
