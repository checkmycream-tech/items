            <li>Attempted to return but Amazon will not accept hazardous materials for return.  </li>
            <li>So a hazardous material is being sold to place on your head.  </li>

            <li>and it is like magic.  </li>

            <li>Very pleased with the results covers great and would recommend for anyone experiencing mild to moderate hair loss.</li>
            <li>Works great to go between the spray nozzle and back to the shaker top.</li>
            <li>Maybe a fine mist spray?</li>
            <li>Will not bring back a complete bald spot, but if you need some volume and don&#x27;t want to see your scalp through your hair, you have the perfect product.</li>
            <li>I use a volumizing shampoo, Living Proof full thickening cream and after blow drying and styling I sprinkle Toppik where needed then hairspray</li>
            <li>quality is not as good and a smaller amount in the container than before.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>, I was lucky my sister shared it with</li>
            <li>This is the best secret you will keep.  </li>
            <li>The medium brown color gives me a much more natural look.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t smear or stain anything if you touch your hair, which I would have expected.  </li>
            <li>This is by the far my favorite bathroom product and I can&#x27;t go anywhere without it.</li>
            <li>i feel confident with this product and by now is part of my daily life.</li>
            <li>Covers up the scalp and makes my hair look full and normal.  </li>
            <li>style your hair first...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more and will not leave the house with out my toppik on.</li>
            <li>, I am satisfied and will keep using it as long as I have some hair on my head.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my dermatologist over certain meds prescribed for hair loss.</li>
            <li>so Toppik hair fabric is important part of my daily hairdressing, unless I find another product I will forever use Toppik</li>
            <li>it really work, I should take picture of before and after..</li>
            <li>This stuff really works but it leaves the brown fiber (power) all over the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Was not expecting much when I bought this product &amp;#34;was</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely undetectable when looking in the mirror</li>
            <li>I really would like to see it cheaper though.</li>
            <li>It really covers naturally and comes in many different colors.</li>
            <li>This container you shake it on your head, but I prefer the air nozzle one which is more direct where you can target specific areas.  </li>
            <li>One other thing, I wish there was better way of applying Toppik instead of the salt shaker method.  </li>
            <li>It does the job as long as you have some hair on your head in which Toppik can make it look full.  </li>
            <li>If you have thinning hair, do yourself a huge favor and buy this, I can&#x27;t imagine what mental state I&#x27;d be in without it!</li>
            <li>I want this fixed.</li>
            <li>Yet, nearly 40% cheaper than the toppik website.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s main job is to hide thin spots, it also makes my hair look a shade darker which I love.</li>
            <li>Overall I would highly recommend this product if you have thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>the previous reviewer who said he doesn&#x27;t know how much is left in container, I recommend put it up against the light bulb</li>
            <li>Since my hair has been thinning, I have been self conscious about it and was looking for something to help with the bare spots.  </li>
            <li>It really covers up the normally visible bald spots that show due to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Same old reliable product.</li>
            <li>Other than the high price</li>

            <li> have not use it no instruction on how, so that one is waste</li>
            <li> A few shakes and the thinning area is gone.</li>
            <li> I usually put a towel over the sink when I apply, but it still gets on floor, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the small spray rubber thing</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this container does not open where you can pour the contents into the air nozzle one.  </li>
            <li> Please note that although I have very dark brown hair; I use medium brown because dark brown turns extremely dark on my scalp (due to perspiration) and it appears very artificial.  </li>
            <li> The bad thing is you don&#x27;t know when you are running low because of the dark bottle, and I don&#x27;t want to ever go without this product and once you try it you will agree.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thin and not abundant</li>

            <li> This is the best secret you will keep.  Toppik is amazing.  Since my hair has been thinning, I have been self conscious about it and was looking for something to help with the bare spots.  Voila Toppik.  I use a volumizing shampoo, Living Proof full thickening cream and after blow drying and styling I sprinkle Toppik where needed then hairspray and I look like I have more hair.  The bad thing is you don&#x27;t know when you are running low because of the dark bottle, and I don&#x27;t want to ever go without this product and once you try it you will agree.</li>
            <li> i always use Toppik hair building fibers every day. i feel confident with this product and by now is part of my daily life. great product</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years to improve thinning hair</li>
            <li> Just a little &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; with the applicator and it is like magic.  Covers up the scalp and makes my hair look full and normal.  Love it</li>
            <li> This stuff does a wonerful job on my hair. My only problem is that it basically gets everywhere in bathroom.  I usually put a towel over the sink when I apply, but it still gets on floor, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the previous reviewer who said he doesn&#x27;t know how much is left in container, I recommend put it up against the light bulb and you can actually see.</li>
            <li> Please note that although I have very dark brown hair; I use medium brown because dark brown turns extremely dark on my scalp (due to perspiration) and it appears very artificial.  The medium brown color gives me a much more natural look.</li>
            <li> works great...  style your hair first... then sprinkle on little by little and gently pat top of hair till it looks good to you!</li>
            <li> at covering thinning areas of hair. I&#x27;ve never tried any other brand of hair building fibers but this one covers and blends well. Looks like your hair if you match the color properly. I have yet to find a way to keep it from spreading all over the sink and countertop in the bathroom though</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  The shaker top does come off. You will need one of those rubber jar openers and just twist the shaker portion to remove.  After that it just snaps on and off. Works great to go between the spray nozzle and back to the shaker top.</li>
            <li> I only buy this on Amazon. Greta price!</li>
            <li> Became ill after using.... headaches and vomiting.  Attempted to return but Amazon will not accept hazardous materials for return.  So a hazardous material is being sold to place on your head.  Contains Ammonium Chloride which can cause headaches, vomiting, even coma.  Made me sick and cannot return.</li>
            <li> messy it gets all over the place, it ruined my carpet in dressing room.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning so Toppik hair fabric is important part of my daily hairdressing, unless I find another product I will forever use Toppik it really work, I should take picture of before and after..I even convinced my sister to use it. She said she is also using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand I bought the small spray rubber thing have not use it no instruction on how, so that one is waste can I return it? Or I&#x27;ll just throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Virginia</li>
            <li> This stuff really works but it leaves the brown fiber (power) all over the bathroom.  My wife hates if for that reason, but hey...my hair looks GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found. I probably won&#x27;t order it from Amazon again because delivery time for my orders from them just keeps getting longer.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job filling in thinning hair so it looks thicker and fuller so you don&#x27;t see your scalp.  Surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t smear or stain anything if you touch your hair, which I would have expected.  This container you shake it on your head, but I prefer the air nozzle one which is more direct where you can target specific areas.  Unfortunately this container does not open where you can pour the contents into the air nozzle one.  I&#x27;m thinking to drill a hole in the top though.  Suggestion would be that the lid screw off.  Overall I would highly recommend this product if you have thinning hair.  No problems with it, absolutey love it.</li>
            <li> I use this product since 2 years ago and now I can not live without it.  My hair is too thin and not abundant so when I use it, is like having instant blower</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and now I just shake it on and look awesome I just wish I had found this years ago</li>
            <li> I ordered medium brown, I paid for rush delivery and I got the wrong product. I want this fixed.</li>
            <li> Was not expecting much when I bought this product &amp;#34;was I ever wrong.&amp;#34;  As advertised, product is amazing. A few shakes and the thinning area is gone. Will not bring back a complete bald spot, but if you need some volume and don&#x27;t want to see your scalp through your hair, you have the perfect product. It&#x27;s absolutely undetectable when looking in the mirror I can&#x27;t even tell I have applied anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Toppik now for several years and I don&#x27;t leave the house without it.  It does the job as long as you have some hair on your head in which Toppik can make it look full.  Other than the high price, I am satisfied and will keep using it as long as I have some hair on my head.  One other thing, I wish there was better way of applying Toppik instead of the salt shaker method.  Maybe a fine mist spray?</li>

            <li> This product is excellent for thinning hair. It gave me my confidents back. Looks just like my hair. The only thing is you have to be careful when putting it on it gets all over the place. Other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Same old reliable product. Yet, nearly 40% cheaper than the toppik website. Cheers.</li>
