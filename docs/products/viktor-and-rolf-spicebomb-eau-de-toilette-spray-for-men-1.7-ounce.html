            <li>What&#x27;s not to like about smelling good?</li>

            <li>believe most people will be happy with this product.</li>
            <li>So happy with this purchase and glad I saved about 40 bucks.</li>
            <li>This cologne is super excellent, if you think that Cuba Gold is good, Spicebomb by Viktor and Rolf is even better.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>And it appears that the ladies LOVE it too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments for this cologne and is now one of my go to scents!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Just wanted to try it at first as it smelled superb...</li>
            <li>If going through a fragrance section in a department store be sure to give this a sniff!</li>
            <li>and I love the smell on him!</li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t wait to get closer to him,what ever happens after the closeness is pure Joy!</li>
            <li>This cologne is seriously amazing.  </li>
            <li>… Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
            <li>Amazing signature scent.</li>
            <li>thanks perfect</li>
            <li>I liked and recommend.</li>
            <li>I have never heard of Spicebomb before but really liked it from the begining.</li>
            <li>Now I can say that for me, but to each their own, because I feel it depends on the body chemistry of each person.</li>
            <li>I cant even tell you one note that dominates the fragrance because its blended so nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Should be a nice addition for winter.</li>
            <li>The absolute best smelling cologne period.</li>
            <li>It is warm, had a tobacco like smell and gets warmer as time passes on you.</li>
            <li>My staff liked it too.</li>
            <li>This morning I was reminded of the beautiful opening of cinnamon and tobacco notes followed by an extraordinary drydown of leather, pepper and vetiver notes of Viktor and Rolf’s, Spicebomb.  </li>
            <li>Great scent for a night out, perfect for that first date to impress someone with a sexy clean scent</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree more, and with a $30 cost savings by purchasing on Amazon, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best smelling scents in my collection and is does last a good 12 hours on my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, I really love it!</li>
            <li>still give the item 5 STARS because I love the scent, and I honestly think Amazon was scammed by whoever sold them the product (my purchase was stocked and sold by Amazon).  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly the bottle i ordered on Amazon smells better to me and is not as strong.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something not too strong and will wear well all day this is the BOMB!</li>
            <li>The box is high quality, it had a working code for the secret-service website, the bottle had the &amp;#34;pull pin&amp;#34; and it smells just as wonderful and as strong as it should.</li>
            <li>I tried this product at the mall and thought it was very strong cologne, but smelt pretty good.</li>
            <li>My opinion, probably the sexiest cologne since Eternity. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This product surely seems authentic to me.</li>
            <li>If this sale is being fulfilled by yours truly, e.g. Amazon LLC, you&#x27;d better think twice about whether or not you are getting an authentic item.</li>
            <li>none of them even convincing.  </li>
            <li>you get this from a legitimate seller and the product is authentic</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the best and very addictive.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be,ore potent</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love it when my boyfriend wears it, which is all the time.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am most definetaly sure it</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it, I love it, and everyone always asks what he&#x27;s wearing.</li>
            <li>’s length or better.  </li>
            <li>I love smelling this fragrance on my man...</li>
            <li>I received my product, and feeling concerned the cologne might not be authentic</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic fragrance for men!</li>
            <li>my favorite cologne, lots of compliments with it..</li>
            <li>I bought for my husband and i love how he smells.</li>
            <li>Gotta love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff, but around the time I started wearing it, my boyfriend started getting sinus problems..</li>
            <li>This is my son-in-laws&#x27; favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>so I assume it is authentic.</li>
            <li>I ordered this SKU and then tried to cancel after reading about how so many people seemed to get not legit fulfillment on their orders.</li>
            <li>Went into Nordstrom and noticed that they had it in there and tried it and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s in my top 3.  </li>
            <li>and it was not only the best price I could find</li>
            <li>This scent is all of the lovely scents you&#x27;d smell in a moroccan bazaar...</li>
            <li>I searched the top 10 perfumes 2013, and this proved to be one of them.</li>
            <li>I am sure by the time you return to your vehicle, smell it after its been a while, you will order it as soon as you get home.</li>
            <li>Someone sure went to a lot of effort to rip us off.  </li>
            <li>This is my ol mans favorite.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance on my husband.</li>
            <li>I love the spicy accent from this cologne.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have it on for more than two hours</li>
            <li>you will love this scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, this product was 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that the seller is Amazon and there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li>Will buy more when Amazon is selling again.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>They love it</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>This is my newest favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I have never had so many people ask me what type of fragrance I am wearing.</li>
            <li>I love every bit of this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have gotten too many compliments about this fragrance and my luck in women have increased exponentially.</li>
            <li>I feel much better and confident when I wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li>love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the way Spicebomb smells.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Flower Bomb for a friend and absolutley love it</li>
            <li>This cologne is def in my top 5.</li>
            <li>Ofcourse, I love the bottle too.</li>
            <li>and i love the compliments.</li>
            <li>It is not my favorite scent as of now.</li>
            <li>Very sexy and very hot.</li>
            <li>At first, the scent is awesome, but after a few minutes, its a spicy tobacco scent, but to me its a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did however cancel my free prime trial membership in an attempt to recover the upcoming $79.99 charge I was scheduled to pay, which more than covered the $71.00 purchase price of the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I loved this scent so much that I purchased a bottle for my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>Its like my black panther except it smells good lol.</li>
            <li>Trust me guys, your significant others will love this on you.</li>
            <li>Fades very quickly.  </li>
            <li>id go easy on the trigger about 3 sprays max.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and it is not too strong to wear to work.  </li>
            <li>Not overpowering or strong at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly sweet scent so many may not like it</li>
            <li>and I had several beautiful ladies ask what I was wearing and ask to get a bit closer.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll do the next best thing and buy it for my man - Viktor &amp; Rolf has done it again - extremely sexy, classy and memorable scent.</li>
            <li>Since I fell in love with this one, and don&#x27;t like having stuff all over the place, I quickly disposed of the others.</li>
            <li>Absolutely unequivocally my favorite cologne!</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this, and I love the way it smells on him!</li>
            <li>Purchased through Amazon.com., arrived on time, and received the real deal/100% authentic Spicebomb!</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>After all, there is a reason that the price is this cheap.</li>
            <li>The description of the fragrance filled the expectations created by advertising.</li>
            <li>He wore it proudly the same day.  </li>
            <li>cinnamon, clove, cardamom, nutmeg, cedar and sandalwood, with a hint of citrus peel and vanilla to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>..not a cheap knock off....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes me wonder if I got a genuine version of it, or wether it was a knockoff.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it when I have it on all the compliments I get.</li>
            <li>Great product, reasonable price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this scent!!!  </li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling and gets lighter throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Ths cologne has a very distinct smell, it is spicy yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Designer Fragrances is committed to selling our products, including Viktor &amp; Rolf Spice Bomb Eau De Toilette Spray, through major department and specialty stores, accompanied by expert professional advice to best meet the consumer&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>but he loved it and it shipped fast as well;)</li>
            <li>Stays on strong all day and every one notices how good it smells, especially me!</li>
            <li>When you wear an original fragrance people notice and compliment you.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is unique and will be a conversation piece in your collection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a unique scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a unique smell.</li>
            <li>SMELLS SO HOT AND SEXY.  </li>
            <li>I can say pretty confidently that you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
            <li>the ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li>It smells great and also lasts long, 3 sprays</li>
            <li>Seemed to be in original packaging.</li>
            <li>If you like scents in the vein of Gucci (original pour homme), Burberry London, John Varvatos original, etc</li>
            <li>/&gt;This truly is a unique smell.</li>
            <li>But.. WHOA.. I love it ;)</li>
            <li>Also its a light sweet smell but not so sweet that it smells like a womans perfume.</li>
            <li>I first took Victor &amp; Rolf seriously about a month ago when my best friend had a birthday and was talking about how much she loved Flowerbomb.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get the box our without ripping the cellophane and able to replace the box afterwords, which proves someone else was able to do the same.  </li>
            <li>I certainly have no suspicions that it is authentic.</li>
            <li>If you like it get on Amazon and order it because the price is right!</li>
            <li>Amazing fragrance ...very classy and  </li>
            <li>importantly my wife loves the smell, it has good staying power even after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>So the price was on point and the cologne is still amazing, but the package was clearly opened and pieces removed.</li>
            <li>The cool packaging is a bonus with the spicebomb as well.</li>
            <li>They loved the scent and the lasting ability.</li>
            <li>and now I will use it to my full advantage.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells extremely good, and the bottle has lasted me almost an entire year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda earthy, not overly sweet.  </li>
            <li>If you like the smell of sweet spice, this is the fragrance for you.  </li>
            <li>You have to remove the plastic wrapper, the product was boxed appropriately, and the product looked like the real deal.  </li>
            <li>It was so good that I had to rub it all over my arm until there was nothing left on the paper.  </li>
            <li>read some reviews about the scent changing after it dries, which is true.</li>
            <li>As I said with Cuba Gold, they definitely need to continue making this item as good as it is now.</li>
            <li>Ideal fragrance for someone that can&#x27;t tolerate heavy smells.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x60;t able to finf this locally, but Amazon always have everthing i need or the most part.</li>
            <li>The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>It has a moderate spicy smell at the mid note which is awesome.</li>
            <li>It’s this complex subtleness that makes this fragrance very pleasant to wear indeed.</li>
            <li>It appears to have been cut off, taking only the very top layer of the box material with it.  </li>
            <li>Well, as a woman, I have to say that my FAVORITE perfume of all time is officially Flowerbomb (I KNEW it was a hit when a very handsome gay man had his head down my shirt asking me what amaazzing scent I was wearing and called his boyfriend over to also smell my perfume, haha).  </li>
            <li>I smelled this cologne at Sephora while on a trip in New York and immediately fell in love with the robust spice scent.</li>
            <li>It is very classy and a sexy.  </li>
            <li>Sexy, spicy and very masculine.</li>
            <li>Smells great and does not wear off fast as many other high end product often do.  </li>
            <li>Given the spicy composition, Spicebomb may be geared more for cooler climates and settings, but I would make a pitch that it is such an intriguing, yet easy fragrance, it offers flexibility to be worn across seasons and for most events.  </li>
            <li>Great year round scent.</li>
            <li>I constantly get compliments and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I still love Amazon, but I will be more careful about purchasing when returns might be an issue.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely fabulous and I&#x27;m so glad I peeled back the sample and tried it.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s distinctive and masculine and I really love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I currently own the same cologne, which has been bought through a Sephora Retail Store.</li>
            <li>In addition to being a great scent, performance is better than average – lasting 7+ hours on me and longer on clothing with a projection of arm</li>
            <li>Also, this is probably the coolest looking bottle on the market, you have to pull the pin off like a real grenade to work the sprayer which is kinda cool.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the scent, but I&#x27;ve experienced the same missing promo and barcode that many have reported.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, Customer Service says that they will do the right thing and send us a new one.  </li>
            <li>it is a good cologne for late dinner and a date night.projection is good initially for the first 3hrs.after that it stays close to the skin.i like it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since cant smell anything after a few hours, so not sure how long it lasts, but from my experience, this is a great cologne, perfect for night time use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have hot chicks all over me with this product.</li>
            <li>Smells great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I WILL be ordering ANOTHER bottle VERY soon!</li>
            <li>I saw this at a local department store and I fell in love with this as soon as I smelled it.  </li>
            <li>A bit overpowering at first</li>
            <li>higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most Definitely an all-day scent.</li>
            <li>Was not fake.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this scent in a magazine advertisement.  </li>
            <li>Does not smell the same as authentic cologne.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I have women following me around in hoards wanting to know what the magical smell is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, and I have had several people (mostly women)</li>
            <li>ought to be aware of before making a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very different which I like and have received many compliments.</li>
            <li>I first heard of this product while reading a Chicago magazine.</li>
            <li>I love it can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>Such a great smell, stands out just enough when people get real close</li>
            <li>Sober, classic and great for the mature man today, you can use it as an everyday fragrance, combined with everything from sporting occasions to elegant occasions.</li>
            <li>The fact this item was shipped for free to me using a free trial Prime membership, I saved not only shipping but tax as well, so I can live with the fact someone tampered with the box itself.  </li>
            <li>Wife surprised me with and was more surprised by the price as compared to the retail stores.</li>
            <li>a very merry christmas to a fine young man who knows what he wants...</li>
            <li>sure brought compliments lasts  a long time and sooo refreshed</li>
            <li>The scent is super masculine.  </li>
            <li>Masculine and bold.</li>
            <li>The smell is good musky, and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>As a 25 year old woman, I&#x27;m very picky about my perfumes, I simply cannot have them too floral or sweet or strong.  </li>
            <li>Certainly a fall, winter scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that the original products were tampered with and either watered down or the original drained and the majority substituted with some type of alcohol mixture.</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a gift and very well recieved.</li>
            <li>The code was cut out from inside the box, but it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I do think that the one I bought is real.</li>
            <li>I followed the provided tracking details thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my boyfriend, who really likes it as well.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>The real thing blows my expectations away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li>when it comes to fragrances you really can&#x27;t take someone elses word for it because each persons body chemistry differs.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne, really didn&#x27;t care for it smell was to pepper.</li>
            <li>Hey, at least my wife love it , and to be honest it smell way different than what everybody wear.</li>
            <li>My wife was rushing through her favorite shopping center and was stopped by an employee at the men&#x27;s fragrance department.</li>
            <li>I smelled this in a magazine, and was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I order so much off of Amazon, that I didn&#x27;t realize that there was a problem with returning perfume/cologne.  </li>
            <li>We know that we really like the product, if we can get the correct one sent to us.  </li>
            <li>Being that I am very fussy with scents, it takes alot for me to being sold on one.  </li>
            <li>I do not apply too much</li>
            <li>Seeing as how I absolutely loathed</li>
            <li>Hahaha.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Viktor &amp; Rolf Spicebomb, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item because I knew it was the real deal</li>
            <li>and it is much stronger than the creed aventus i just bought</li>
            <li>I called Amazon immediately once I was absolutely unsatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Very firs minutes after using i start getting compliments.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Was concerned about authenticity after reading reviews and watching a YouTube video comparing counterfeit product with the real one.</li>
            <li>, I went to Nordstrom&#x27;s and purchased the exact same size (just at full price).  </li>
            <li>Plenty of compliments, good staying power and projection (on my skin at least).</li>
            <li>The two products significantly smelled different from one another.</li>
            <li>Highly irritated that amazon would not check more carefully at counterfeits.</li>
            <li>It is recorded on your account and in the future, your purchases will qualify you for discounts and special items.  </li>
            <li>It smells softer than what I remember and no where near as robust (the first time I smelled caught me off guard, which I loved.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been trying and using different types of cologne for years, and I think I have finally found a favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells great the first 5 minutes but after the drydown it just smells like some cheap annoying discount aftershave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if your like something earthy with a kick.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended for men who loves being an ladies attention.</li>
            <li>Only giving this product a 3 star review due to the fact that the product smells and looks like the original but does not wear like the original.  </li>
            <li>This scent really steps up to deliver it&#x27;s name i.e. a mix of spices that makes women want to follow you around and let the aroma transport them to the far East.</li>
            <li>Long lasting scent that just gets better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>Inside the box, the Viktor &amp; Rolf &amp;#34;secret service&amp;#34; code was missing from inside the top flap.  </li>
            <li>Although not cheap, I found a much better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above this would be for casual dress and is as pleasant as Polo Red, Hugo Boss Red or even Gucci in my opinion as I own and use them all.</li>
            <li>BY VIKTOR&amp;ROLF NEW IN A BOX]].</li>
            <li>The product smells great, and came with the proper unmolested secret service code on the box</li>
            <li>I was totally shocked -- so spicy sweet and warm and mmmmmm!  </li>
            <li>They also thought it was very masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>is the exact same thing</li>
            <li>Just something a bit different than most of the other colognes out there.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every time my husband wears this, I can&#x27;t keep my face far from his neck, which he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind!</li>
            <li>When she told the clerk she didn&#x27;t have time and her husband already has his favorite colognes, the young lady gave her a small handful of samples.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of the current designer fragrances, and many are quite generic or overdone, with numerous versions of the same fragrance like sport, intense, noir, etc.  </li>
            <li>too strong when you spray it but lightens up after few hours of wearing the cologne</li>
            <li>I prefer it in the winter months because of its strong smell but could be worn year round.</li>
            <li>Tampered with and either watered down or the original drained and the majority substituted with some type of alcohol mixture.</li>
            <li>Pure fire in a bottle, Spicebomb smells like something James Bond would wear it has a woodsy smell mixed with a punch.</li>
            <li>Once I get them side by side with some coffee grounds to clear my nasal passages the review will be updated to reflect my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 11/26/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a result, I will never buy a fragrance directly from Amazon but will if it&#x27;s a third-party seller who will guarantee authenticity.</li>
            <li>but of course I always order directly from Amazon anyways</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ve had no issues thus far.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old DKNY men fragrance they used to sell with the bottle that looked like a gun out of Star Trek or something.</li>
            <li>This shipped directly from Amazon on their Prime program.  </li>
            <li>a masculine yet not too musky fragrance.</li>
            <li>Make no mistake about it, this is definitely a masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Long long time ago there used to be a scent called Harley Davidson Original.</li>
            <li>Try a sample prior to purchasing and see how long it lasts - I am very happy with the fragrance, unhappy with the length of time it lasted.</li>
            <li>I was kind of hesitant of buying this because I thought it was going to be fake, but it totally smells just like real deal!</li>
            <li>The smell is diffrent not typical colone smells.</li>
            <li>It usually will last well throughout the day and all the women at my job love it</li>
            <li>Started off as a woodsy scent that was a little spicy and then tapers off into an addicting sweet scent on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat of a cologne guru as of lately and I own scents from the higher end, I.E. Bond No. 9 &amp; Creed down to the low end, I.E. Cuba Gold.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasing masculine smell that lasts a very long time and would be overpowering if too much was sprayed</li>
            <li>Helps you pull major ass!</li>
            <li>It is masculine and musky like Double Black but clean and citrus-y like Acqua di Gio.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell of this stuff, but my only gripe is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is a cologne smell or chemical smell that you get when you open a brand new iPad or Apple products.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the cologne at least a try, and it only led to greater doubts about the authenticity of the cologne.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Instant - Conversation - Piece!\\&quot; WOW!</li>
            <li>I have had three (3) instances of purchases direct from Amazon, e.g. Prada Amber, Eternity Summer 2011 and Polo Red that were all fakes and</li>
            <li>Deep, spicy masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; scent type of cat, but this blend of woods, and a touch of the sweet, is in fact a \\&quot;fragrant pleasure dome.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This is not for the shy wallflower kind of bloke.  </li>
            <li>after this experience, if I was in the market for another cologne purchase, and could not pass up the price Amazon offers, I would still only purchase the item actually stocked and sold by Amazon.d their return/refund policy to cover fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after this experience, if I was in the market for another cologne purchase, and could not pass up the price Amazon offers, I would still only purchase the item actually stocked and sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li>The saleswoman at Sephora, actually suggested this masculine cologne as one that she wears regularly, with the scent even improving over hours of wear.</li>
            <li>I like that this is a little harder to find in the stores, so is a little more unique, and you&#x27;re less likely to be standing in an elevator with someone else wearing the same fragrance; if that bothers</li>
            <li>Spicy, masculine, and it lasts a long time (10+ hours).</li>
            <li>When my package arrived it was in a beat up box look like it belong to some else,the secret code that they put in to get special offers</li>
            <li>Not sure if i am crazy, or this bottle is different (some inconsistencies), but i am more pleased with the scent</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have never heard of Spicebomb before but really liked it from the begining.</li>
            <li> Now I can say that for me, but to each their own, because I feel it depends on the body chemistry of each person.</li>
            <li> I cant even tell you one note that dominates the fragrance because its blended so nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Should be a nice addition for winter.</li>
            <li> The absolute best smelling cologne period.</li>
            <li> It is warm, had a tobacco like smell and gets warmer as time passes on you.</li>
            <li> My staff liked it too.</li>
            <li> This morning I was reminded of the beautiful opening of cinnamon and tobacco notes followed by an extraordinary drydown of leather, pepper and vetiver notes of Viktor and Rolf’s, Spicebomb.  </li>
            <li> Great scent for a night out, perfect for that first date to impress someone with a sexy clean scent</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t agree more, and with a $30 cost savings by purchasing on Amazon, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best smelling scents in my collection and is does last a good 12 hours on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, I really love it!</li>
            <li> still give the item 5 STARS because I love the scent, and I honestly think Amazon was scammed by whoever sold them the product (my purchase was stocked and sold by Amazon).  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly the bottle i ordered on Amazon smells better to me and is not as strong.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something not too strong and will wear well all day this is the BOMB!</li>
            <li> The box is high quality, it had a working code for the secret-service website, the bottle had the &amp;#34;pull pin&amp;#34; and it smells just as wonderful and as strong as it should.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at the mall and thought it was very strong cologne, but smelt pretty good.</li>
            <li> My opinion, probably the sexiest cologne since Eternity. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This product surely seems authentic to me.</li>
            <li> If this sale is being fulfilled by yours truly, e.g. Amazon LLC, you&#x27;d better think twice about whether or not you are getting an authentic item.</li>
            <li> none of them even convincing.  </li>
            <li> you get this from a legitimate seller and the product is authentic</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the best and very addictive.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be,ore potent</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love it when my boyfriend wears it, which is all the time.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am most definetaly sure it</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it, I love it, and everyone always asks what he&#x27;s wearing.</li>
            <li> ’s length or better.  </li>
            <li> I love smelling this fragrance on my man...</li>
            <li> I received my product, and feeling concerned the cologne might not be authentic</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic fragrance for men!</li>
            <li> my favorite cologne, lots of compliments with it..</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband and i love how he smells.</li>
            <li> Gotta love it.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, but around the time I started wearing it, my boyfriend started getting sinus problems..</li>
            <li> This is my son-in-laws&#x27; favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> so I assume it is authentic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this SKU and then tried to cancel after reading about how so many people seemed to get not legit fulfillment on their orders.</li>
            <li> Went into Nordstrom and noticed that they had it in there and tried it and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s in my top 3.  </li>
            <li> and it was not only the best price I could find</li>
            <li> This scent is all of the lovely scents you&#x27;d smell in a moroccan bazaar...</li>
            <li> I searched the top 10 perfumes 2013, and this proved to be one of them.</li>
            <li> I am sure by the time you return to your vehicle, smell it after its been a while, you will order it as soon as you get home.</li>
            <li> Someone sure went to a lot of effort to rip us off.  </li>
            <li> This is my ol mans favorite.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance on my husband.</li>
            <li> I love the spicy accent from this cologne.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have it on for more than two hours</li>
            <li> you will love this scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, this product was 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that the seller is Amazon and there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> Will buy more when Amazon is selling again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> They love it</li>
            <li> so I was glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> This is my newest favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I have never had so many people ask me what type of fragrance I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I love every bit of this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have gotten too many compliments about this fragrance and my luck in women have increased exponentially.</li>
            <li> I feel much better and confident when I wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li> love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I love the way Spicebomb smells.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Flower Bomb for a friend and absolutley love it</li>
            <li> This cologne is def in my top 5.</li>
            <li> Ofcourse, I love the bottle too.</li>
            <li> and i love the compliments.</li>
            <li> It is not my favorite scent as of now.</li>
            <li> Very sexy and very hot.</li>
            <li> At first, the scent is awesome, but after a few minutes, its a spicy tobacco scent, but to me its a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did however cancel my free prime trial membership in an attempt to recover the upcoming $79.99 charge I was scheduled to pay, which more than covered the $71.00 purchase price of the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I loved this scent so much that I purchased a bottle for my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li> Its like my black panther except it smells good lol.</li>
            <li> Trust me guys, your significant others will love this on you.</li>
            <li> Fades very quickly.  </li>
            <li> id go easy on the trigger about 3 sprays max.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and it is not too strong to wear to work.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering or strong at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly sweet scent so many may not like it</li>
            <li> and I had several beautiful ladies ask what I was wearing and ask to get a bit closer.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll do the next best thing and buy it for my man - Viktor &amp; Rolf has done it again - extremely sexy, classy and memorable scent.</li>
            <li> Since I fell in love with this one, and don&#x27;t like having stuff all over the place, I quickly disposed of the others.</li>
            <li> Absolutely unequivocally my favorite cologne!</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this, and I love the way it smells on him!</li>
            <li> Purchased through Amazon.com., arrived on time, and received the real deal/100% authentic Spicebomb!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> After all, there is a reason that the price is this cheap.</li>
            <li> The description of the fragrance filled the expectations created by advertising.</li>
            <li> He wore it proudly the same day.  </li>
            <li> cinnamon, clove, cardamom, nutmeg, cedar and sandalwood, with a hint of citrus peel and vanilla to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> ..not a cheap knock off....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes me wonder if I got a genuine version of it, or wether it was a knockoff.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it when I have it on all the compliments I get.</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonable price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this scent!!!  </li>
            <li> Very fresh smelling and gets lighter throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Ths cologne has a very distinct smell, it is spicy yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Designer Fragrances is committed to selling our products, including Viktor &amp; Rolf Spice Bomb Eau De Toilette Spray, through major department and specialty stores, accompanied by expert professional advice to best meet the consumer&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> but he loved it and it shipped fast as well;)</li>
            <li> Stays on strong all day and every one notices how good it smells, especially me!</li>
            <li> When you wear an original fragrance people notice and compliment you.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is unique and will be a conversation piece in your collection.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a unique scent.  </li>
            <li> It is a unique smell.</li>
            <li> SMELLS SO HOT AND SEXY.  </li>
            <li> I can say pretty confidently that you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
            <li> the ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> It smells great and also lasts long, 3 sprays</li>
            <li> Seemed to be in original packaging.</li>
            <li> If you like scents in the vein of Gucci (original pour homme), Burberry London, John Varvatos original, etc</li>
            <li> /&gt;This truly is a unique smell.</li>
            <li> But.. WHOA.. I love it ;)</li>
            <li> Also its a light sweet smell but not so sweet that it smells like a womans perfume.</li>
            <li> I first took Victor &amp; Rolf seriously about a month ago when my best friend had a birthday and was talking about how much she loved Flowerbomb.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get the box our without ripping the cellophane and able to replace the box afterwords, which proves someone else was able to do the same.  </li>
            <li> I certainly have no suspicions that it is authentic.</li>
            <li> If you like it get on Amazon and order it because the price is right!</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance ...very classy and  </li>
            <li> importantly my wife loves the smell, it has good staying power even after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> So the price was on point and the cologne is still amazing, but the package was clearly opened and pieces removed.</li>
            <li> The cool packaging is a bonus with the spicebomb as well.</li>
            <li> They loved the scent and the lasting ability.</li>
            <li> and now I will use it to my full advantage.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells extremely good, and the bottle has lasted me almost an entire year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda earthy, not overly sweet.  </li>
            <li> If you like the smell of sweet spice, this is the fragrance for you.  </li>
            <li> You have to remove the plastic wrapper, the product was boxed appropriately, and the product looked like the real deal.  </li>
            <li> It was so good that I had to rub it all over my arm until there was nothing left on the paper.  </li>
            <li> read some reviews about the scent changing after it dries, which is true.</li>
            <li> As I said with Cuba Gold, they definitely need to continue making this item as good as it is now.</li>
            <li> Ideal fragrance for someone that can&#x27;t tolerate heavy smells.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x60;t able to finf this locally, but Amazon always have everthing i need or the most part.</li>
            <li> The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> It has a moderate spicy smell at the mid note which is awesome.</li>
            <li> It’s this complex subtleness that makes this fragrance very pleasant to wear indeed.</li>
            <li> It appears to have been cut off, taking only the very top layer of the box material with it.  </li>
            <li> Well, as a woman, I have to say that my FAVORITE perfume of all time is officially Flowerbomb (I KNEW it was a hit when a very handsome gay man had his head down my shirt asking me what amaazzing scent I was wearing and called his boyfriend over to also smell my perfume, haha).  </li>
            <li> I smelled this cologne at Sephora while on a trip in New York and immediately fell in love with the robust spice scent.</li>
            <li> It is very classy and a sexy.  </li>
            <li> Sexy, spicy and very masculine.</li>
            <li> Smells great and does not wear off fast as many other high end product often do.  </li>
            <li> Given the spicy composition, Spicebomb may be geared more for cooler climates and settings, but I would make a pitch that it is such an intriguing, yet easy fragrance, it offers flexibility to be worn across seasons and for most events.  </li>
            <li> Great year round scent.</li>
            <li> I constantly get compliments and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I still love Amazon, but I will be more careful about purchasing when returns might be an issue.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely fabulous and I&#x27;m so glad I peeled back the sample and tried it.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s distinctive and masculine and I really love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I currently own the same cologne, which has been bought through a Sephora Retail Store.</li>
            <li> In addition to being a great scent, performance is better than average – lasting 7+ hours on me and longer on clothing with a projection of arm</li>
            <li> Also, this is probably the coolest looking bottle on the market, you have to pull the pin off like a real grenade to work the sprayer which is kinda cool.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the scent, but I&#x27;ve experienced the same missing promo and barcode that many have reported.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, Customer Service says that they will do the right thing and send us a new one.  </li>
            <li> it is a good cologne for late dinner and a date night.projection is good initially for the first 3hrs.after that it stays close to the skin.i like it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since cant smell anything after a few hours, so not sure how long it lasts, but from my experience, this is a great cologne, perfect for night time use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have hot chicks all over me with this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I WILL be ordering ANOTHER bottle VERY soon!</li>
            <li> I saw this at a local department store and I fell in love with this as soon as I smelled it.  </li>
            <li> A bit overpowering at first</li>
            <li> higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most Definitely an all-day scent.</li>
            <li> Was not fake.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this scent in a magazine advertisement.  </li>
            <li> Does not smell the same as authentic cologne.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I have women following me around in hoards wanting to know what the magical smell is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, and I have had several people (mostly women)</li>
            <li> ought to be aware of before making a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very different which I like and have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this product while reading a Chicago magazine.</li>
            <li> I love it can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> Such a great smell, stands out just enough when people get real close</li>
            <li> Sober, classic and great for the mature man today, you can use it as an everyday fragrance, combined with everything from sporting occasions to elegant occasions.</li>
            <li> The fact this item was shipped for free to me using a free trial Prime membership, I saved not only shipping but tax as well, so I can live with the fact someone tampered with the box itself.  </li>
            <li> Wife surprised me with and was more surprised by the price as compared to the retail stores.</li>
            <li> a very merry christmas to a fine young man who knows what he wants...</li>
            <li> sure brought compliments lasts  a long time and sooo refreshed</li>
            <li> The scent is super masculine.  </li>
            <li> Masculine and bold.</li>
            <li> The smell is good musky, and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> As a 25 year old woman, I&#x27;m very picky about my perfumes, I simply cannot have them too floral or sweet or strong.  </li>
            <li> Certainly a fall, winter scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that the original products were tampered with and either watered down or the original drained and the majority substituted with some type of alcohol mixture.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift and very well recieved.</li>
            <li> The code was cut out from inside the box, but it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I do think that the one I bought is real.</li>
            <li> I followed the provided tracking details thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend, who really likes it as well.  </li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> The real thing blows my expectations away.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really like the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li> when it comes to fragrances you really can&#x27;t take someone elses word for it because each persons body chemistry differs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne, really didn&#x27;t care for it smell was to pepper.</li>
            <li> Hey, at least my wife love it , and to be honest it smell way different than what everybody wear.</li>
            <li> My wife was rushing through her favorite shopping center and was stopped by an employee at the men&#x27;s fragrance department.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine, and was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I order so much off of Amazon, that I didn&#x27;t realize that there was a problem with returning perfume/cologne.  </li>
            <li> We know that we really like the product, if we can get the correct one sent to us.  </li>
            <li> Being that I am very fussy with scents, it takes alot for me to being sold on one.  </li>
            <li> I do not apply too much</li>
            <li> Seeing as how I absolutely loathed</li>
            <li> Hahaha.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Viktor &amp; Rolf Spicebomb, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item because I knew it was the real deal</li>
            <li> and it is much stronger than the creed aventus i just bought</li>
            <li> I called Amazon immediately once I was absolutely unsatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Very firs minutes after using i start getting compliments.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Was concerned about authenticity after reading reviews and watching a YouTube video comparing counterfeit product with the real one.</li>
            <li> , I went to Nordstrom&#x27;s and purchased the exact same size (just at full price).  </li>
            <li> Plenty of compliments, good staying power and projection (on my skin at least).</li>
            <li> The two products significantly smelled different from one another.</li>
            <li> Highly irritated that amazon would not check more carefully at counterfeits.</li>
            <li> It is recorded on your account and in the future, your purchases will qualify you for discounts and special items.  </li>
            <li> It smells softer than what I remember and no where near as robust (the first time I smelled caught me off guard, which I loved.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been trying and using different types of cologne for years, and I think I have finally found a favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells great the first 5 minutes but after the drydown it just smells like some cheap annoying discount aftershave.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if your like something earthy with a kick.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomended for men who loves being an ladies attention.</li>
            <li> Only giving this product a 3 star review due to the fact that the product smells and looks like the original but does not wear like the original.  </li>
            <li> This scent really steps up to deliver it&#x27;s name i.e. a mix of spices that makes women want to follow you around and let the aroma transport them to the far East.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent that just gets better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Inside the box, the Viktor &amp; Rolf &amp;#34;secret service&amp;#34; code was missing from inside the top flap.  </li>
            <li> Although not cheap, I found a much better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above this would be for casual dress and is as pleasant as Polo Red, Hugo Boss Red or even Gucci in my opinion as I own and use them all.</li>
            <li> BY VIKTOR&amp;ROLF NEW IN A BOX]].</li>
            <li> The product smells great, and came with the proper unmolested secret service code on the box</li>
            <li> I was totally shocked -- so spicy sweet and warm and mmmmmm!  </li>
            <li> They also thought it was very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> is the exact same thing</li>
            <li> Just something a bit different than most of the other colognes out there.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time my husband wears this, I can&#x27;t keep my face far from his neck, which he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind!</li>
            <li> When she told the clerk she didn&#x27;t have time and her husband already has his favorite colognes, the young lady gave her a small handful of samples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of the current designer fragrances, and many are quite generic or overdone, with numerous versions of the same fragrance like sport, intense, noir, etc.  </li>
            <li> too strong when you spray it but lightens up after few hours of wearing the cologne</li>
            <li> I prefer it in the winter months because of its strong smell but could be worn year round.</li>
            <li> Tampered with and either watered down or the original drained and the majority substituted with some type of alcohol mixture.</li>
            <li> Pure fire in a bottle, Spicebomb smells like something James Bond would wear it has a woodsy smell mixed with a punch.</li>
            <li> Once I get them side by side with some coffee grounds to clear my nasal passages the review will be updated to reflect my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 11/26/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, I will never buy a fragrance directly from Amazon but will if it&#x27;s a third-party seller who will guarantee authenticity.</li>
            <li> but of course I always order directly from Amazon anyways</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve had no issues thus far.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old DKNY men fragrance they used to sell with the bottle that looked like a gun out of Star Trek or something.</li>
            <li> This shipped directly from Amazon on their Prime program.  </li>
            <li> a masculine yet not too musky fragrance.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake about it, this is definitely a masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Long long time ago there used to be a scent called Harley Davidson Original.</li>
            <li> Try a sample prior to purchasing and see how long it lasts - I am very happy with the fragrance, unhappy with the length of time it lasted.</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant of buying this because I thought it was going to be fake, but it totally smells just like real deal!</li>
            <li> The smell is diffrent not typical colone smells.</li>
            <li> It usually will last well throughout the day and all the women at my job love it</li>
            <li> Started off as a woodsy scent that was a little spicy and then tapers off into an addicting sweet scent on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a cologne guru as of lately and I own scents from the higher end, I.E. Bond No. 9 &amp; Creed down to the low end, I.E. Cuba Gold.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasing masculine smell that lasts a very long time and would be overpowering if too much was sprayed</li>
            <li> Helps you pull major ass!</li>
            <li> It is masculine and musky like Double Black but clean and citrus-y like Acqua di Gio.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this stuff, but my only gripe is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is a cologne smell or chemical smell that you get when you open a brand new iPad or Apple products.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the cologne at least a try, and it only led to greater doubts about the authenticity of the cologne.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Instant - Conversation - Piece!\\&quot; WOW!</li>
            <li> I have had three (3) instances of purchases direct from Amazon, e.g. Prada Amber, Eternity Summer 2011 and Polo Red that were all fakes and</li>
            <li> Deep, spicy masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; scent type of cat, but this blend of woods, and a touch of the sweet, is in fact a \\&quot;fragrant pleasure dome.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is not for the shy wallflower kind of bloke.  </li>
            <li> after this experience, if I was in the market for another cologne purchase, and could not pass up the price Amazon offers, I would still only purchase the item actually stocked and sold by Amazon.d their return/refund policy to cover fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after this experience, if I was in the market for another cologne purchase, and could not pass up the price Amazon offers, I would still only purchase the item actually stocked and sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> The saleswoman at Sephora, actually suggested this masculine cologne as one that she wears regularly, with the scent even improving over hours of wear.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a little harder to find in the stores, so is a little more unique, and you&#x27;re less likely to be standing in an elevator with someone else wearing the same fragrance; if that bothers</li>
            <li> Spicy, masculine, and it lasts a long time (10+ hours).</li>
            <li> When my package arrived it was in a beat up box look like it belong to some else,the secret code that they put in to get special offers</li>
            <li> Not sure if i am crazy, or this bottle is different (some inconsistencies), but i am more pleased with the scent</li>
            <li> I would stir clear from any other seller.</li>
            <li> First night I wore Spicebomb, I answered the \\&quot;question\\&quot; at least 5 times - \\&quot;what is that fragrance</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t a long lasting perfume</li>
            <li> Amazon has been plenty gracious about it--they even sent me a second bottle when the first showed up with the missing promo and barcode (which was also missing the promo and barcode).  </li>
            <li> I thought that was strange.</li>
            <li> and I will keep purchasing this for him for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had in a long time</li>
            <li> To me it smells like Romeo Gigli + a touch of Grey Flannel and Joop.</li>
            <li> It makes me mad because he smells better than me, and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> Plus, there were obvious cuts on the inside of the box as if someone had tampered with the product before use, which is extremely suspicious.</li>
            <li> The cologne purchased through the dealer has a weaker scent and a different smell, which I had other people confirm as well.</li>
            <li> , seriously, this stuff really is DA BOMB.</li>
            <li> Watered down, received open package.</li>
            <li> This arrived within three days and was significantly less costly than the department store item of same size.  </li>
            <li> Also the cost is $35 less than the same item at Nordstroms.</li>
            <li> BUT BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> I picked up a sample of this a few years back for my youngest son and he LOVES it.</li>
            <li> It was carefully packaged just as you would expect to see it in the store.  </li>
            <li> Got here as quickly as expected and my boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Catherine&lt;br /&gt;Advocate, Consumer Care Center</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find in stores (at least at the time they first released it)...</li>
            <li> a little goes a long</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not going to talk about bass notes, dry down, hints of patchouli or all that nonsense.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t describe how it smells other than unlike anything else and people took notice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you smell this fragrance you will sometimes get the earthy ‘spicey’ almost peppery tones, and other times you can pick out slightly lighter fragrances such as subtle grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I finally opened it up yesterday as a gift only to find the inside &#x27;secret service&#x27; code was missing, cut out.</li>
            <li> One of the other reviews mentioned she wished she could wear it -- it IS marketed as unisex, so yay!  </li>
            <li> I blind bought this in search of a new fall fragrance.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s  a little weaker as its not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he has had it on for a few hours</li>
            <li> Had no idea about this cologne until a few months ago when I saw someone mention it on a cologne forum.  </li>
            <li> Then the smell was not genuine.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to describe the scent or compare it to other colognes-</li>
            <li> I am concerned that this is not authentic.  </li>
            <li> No more spice bomb for me :&#x27;[</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually get &amp;#34;blown away&amp;#34; by men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m moving from my usual Bulgari&#x27;s to this one...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if people will like it or not.</li>
            <li> This would be a casual scent which lasts for hours depending on what activities you&#x27;re involved in, obviously.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding colegne that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The only thing that stinks about it is that my wife didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too late to cancel so I waited and lo and behold my cologne</li>
            <li> The inside &#x27;secret service&#x27; code was missing.  </li>
            <li> am extremely dissapointed and i will never buy cologne from amazon again after this extremely expensive purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I planned on buying a second bottle anyway, I&#x27;m going to the Sephora tomorrow and buying a bottle at retail :(.</li>
            <li> This frag is very complex.</li>
            <li> I buy almost everything from amazon, I didnt want to believe the negative comments below about some colognes being fake.</li>
            <li> Like others the packaging showed that it was opened before as a number on the inside of the box was removed (its for the Viktor and Rolf Secret Service).</li>
            <li> had been ripped out not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Everything is legit with this product including the secret service code.</li>
            <li> I emailed the dealer, who responded with an unclear and ambiguous reason behind the defects.</li>
            <li> Comparing the two scents side by side (on each arm), I was unable to distinguish between the two.  </li>
            <li> sorry for lacking the olfactory language to describe it</li>
            <li> This item is fake</li>
            <li> I feel guilty spraying it</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a scent that i&#x27;d advise blind buying though.  </li>
            <li> noticed that another review raised a flag about fake product.  </li>
            <li> I received the cologne unwrapped, and I was immediately suspicious about it being a fake product.</li>
            <li> maybe sometimes that&#x27;s a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I know I will never get sick of - EVER.  </li>
            <li> I came across this video on Youtube that talks about real vs fake Spicebomb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally purchased a bottle and am disappointed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s feminine counterpart, I was all set to hate it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i went to Sephora and paid the outrageous price of $105  for the 3oz bottle.</li>
            <li> A perfumist would probably think I was horrible incorrect</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only thing that stinks about it is that my wife didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;I did, though, so I&#x27;ll rate it at 4.  It has what I look for in a cologne... a good scent and lasts a while.  The cool packaging is a bonus with the spicebomb as well.</li>
            <li> Girls.... HALLELUJAH!  This cologne is seriously amazing.  Smells soooo good.  My boyfriend and I had smelled it at Sephora one day and I decided to surprise him with it... BEST PURCHASE EVER. No joke- he has had it on for a few hours and I literally can&#x27;t stop smelling him... not to mention I want to rip the clothes off of him. lol  The scent is super masculine.  Guys, if you want to grab a female&#x27;s attention, this will def do the trick. My opinion, probably the sexiest cologne since Eternity. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. This product surely seems authentic to me.</li>
            <li> Try a sample prior to purchasing and see how long it lasts - I am very happy with the fragrance, unhappy with the length of time it lasted.</li>
            <li> I have my cologne here ... thanks perfect</li>
            <li> If this sale is being fulfilled by yours truly, e.g. Amazon LLC, you&#x27;d better think twice about whether or not you are getting an authentic item. I have had three (3) instances of purchases direct from Amazon, e.g. Prada Amber, Eternity Summer 2011 and Polo Red that were all fakes and none of them even convincing.  I&#x27;m certain that the original products were tampered with and either watered down or the original drained and the majority substituted with some type of alcohol mixture. As a result, I will never buy a fragrance directly from Amazon but will if it&#x27;s a third-party seller who will guarantee authenticity. After all, there is a reason that the price is this cheap. Comparison shop with the rest of the Internet and you will see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get this from a legitimate seller and the product is authentic, it&#x27;s the best and very addictive. In fact, it&#x27;s one of my all-time favorites for fall/winter.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be,ore potent</li>
            <li> Product is good. My five loves it</li>
            <li> Deep, spicy masculine scent. Love it. Only 4 stars because of expense.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell...love it when my boyfriend wears it, which is all the time.</li>
            <li> Helps you pull major ass! I have hot chicks all over me with this product.</li>
            <li> I always get people asking the name of this cologne. Always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell .My husband smells great. I love the way it smells. I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
            <li> awesome is all I can say......</li>
            <li> This is the greatest smelling cologne! It arrived on time. Good product.</li>
            <li> Gift from my wife. Love it.</li>
            <li> I buy almost everything from amazon, I didnt want to believe the negative comments below about some colognes being fake. But after using the cologne for a week. I am most definetaly sure it is.&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of this cologne from Nordstrom and if i sprayed the sampler the smell would stick about 24 hours and not go away.&lt;br /&gt;with this bottle the smell goes away after 2-3 hours after spraying it.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely dissapointed and i will never buy cologne from amazon again after this extremely expensive purchase.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift and very well recieved. They loved the scent and the lasting ability.They also thought it was very masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it, I love it, and everyone always asks what he&#x27;s wearing. Long lasting scent that just gets better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and have tried it before in the mall. I told myself I had to have it and now I will use it to my full advantage. Hands off this is mine lol!</li>
            <li> Only giving this product a 3 star review due to the fact that the product smells and looks like the original but does not wear like the original.  Fades very quickly.  When you wear an original fragrance people notice and compliment you.  When it fades like alcohol there is nothing to make an impression on people.</li>
            <li> This morning I was reminded of the beautiful opening of cinnamon and tobacco notes followed by an extraordinary drydown of leather, pepper and vetiver notes of Viktor and Rolf’s, Spicebomb.  In addition to being a great scent, performance is better than average – lasting 7+ hours on me and longer on clothing with a projection of arm’s length or better.  Given the spicy composition, Spicebomb may be geared more for cooler climates and settings, but I would make a pitch that it is such an intriguing, yet easy fragrance, it offers flexibility to be worn across seasons and for most events.  The bottle is unique and will be a conversation piece in your collection.  Adding to the appeal of Spicebomb is that a recent check of on-line pricing shows that it can be purchased for affordable prices.  At the end of the day, my final tally is 4.2 stars out of 5 stars with a solid recommendation to add to any collection.  It is a beautiful fragrance, crowd pleaser, compliment getter, and truly a rock-star fragrance… Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
            <li> I love smelling this fragrance on my man...therefore it will always be 5 stars for me...I&#x27;m biased (lol)&lt;br /&gt;The package was delivered in the estimated time.</li>
            <li> This smells delicious on my husband.  It makes me mad because he smells better than me, and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> No what i was especting but in time at home</li>
            <li> My box arrived with the bottom cellophane popped open at the folds.  I was able to get the box our without ripping the cellophane and able to replace the box afterwords, which proves someone else was able to do the same.  Inside the box, the Viktor &amp; Rolf &amp;#34;secret service&amp;#34; code was missing from inside the top flap.  It appears to have been cut off, taking only the very top layer of the box material with it.  This technique prevented the damage from being seen from the outside of the box.  For those not knowing the significance of this code, Viktor &amp; Rolf operate what is called the &amp;#34;secret service&amp;#34; on their website.  On this site, you enter this code from each Viktor &amp; Rolf product you purchase.  It is recorded on your account and in the future, your purchases will qualify you for discounts and special items.  This code is also found on the &amp;#34;after-shave balm&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;shower gel&amp;#34; Spice-Bomb products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I received my product, and feeling concerned the cologne might not be authentic, I went to Nordstrom&#x27;s and purchased the exact same size (just at full price).  Comparing the two scents side by side (on each arm), I was unable to distinguish between the two.  Because Amazon has a no refund or return policy for items such as cologne, I have no choice but to keep both purchases.  The fact this item was shipped for free to me using a free trial Prime membership, I saved not only shipping but tax as well, so I can live with the fact someone tampered with the box itself.  I did however cancel my free prime trial membership in an attempt to recover the upcoming $79.99 charge I was scheduled to pay, which more than covered the $71.00 purchase price of the cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give the item 5 STARS because I love the scent, and I honestly think Amazon was scammed by whoever sold them the product (my purchase was stocked and sold by Amazon).  Perhaps their buyers should be instructed to learn how to detect package tampering, or expand their return/refund policy to cover fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after this experience, if I was in the market for another cologne purchase, and could not pass up the price Amazon offers, I would still only purchase the item actually stocked and sold by Amazon.d their return/refund policy to cover fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after this experience, if I was in the market for another cologne purchase, and could not pass up the price Amazon offers, I would still only purchase the item actually stocked and sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff. He says it smells legit. Win!</li>
            <li> Love the scent on the skin is perfect. Woody/Spicy. Great for winter. I always get ask which perfume am I wearing. If you like spicy scents this is the one. for reference I use CH Sport, Bottega Veneta and Terre de Hermes; so if you like any of this, you would like this one.</li>
            <li> After placing my order, it was delivered the next day. The code was cut out from inside the box, but it is the real deal. It is one of the best smelling scents in my collection and is does last a good 12 hours on my skin &amp; I always get compliments. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i brought this cologne for my husband birthday and everyone loves the smell. i wasn&#x60;t able to finf this locally, but Amazon always have everthing i need or the most part.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last a long time. I did have something cut out of the inside of the box. I thought that was strange. I came across this video on Youtube that talks about real vs fake Spicebomb. This is the link  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ITMzeZLlJ40 or just look it up yourself. I do think that the one I bought is real. It did pass the search on checkcosmetic.net as well. Having said that, the next time I buy this will be at a brick and mortar.</li>
            <li> Love this! I get compliments all day! Lasts all day. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Box was tampered with and packaging has portions of inside labeling cut away.  I am concerned that this is not authentic.  Box obviously resealed.  I have read some reports on internet that indicate lab samples of counterfeit perfume &amp;#34;might&amp;#34; contain contaminants.  I&#x27;m not taking a change. I am requesting a refund from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> if you want a lot of compliments you have to buy this.  i absolutely love it!!!!! i have a bottle from nordstroms and the bottle from amazon is the exact same thing</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Instant - Conversation - Piece!\\&quot; WOW! What a fragrance. I&#x27;m usually a \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; scent type of cat, but this blend of woods, and a touch of the sweet, is in fact a \\&quot;fragrant pleasure dome.\\&quot; And it appears that the ladies LOVE it too! First night I wore Spicebomb, I answered the \\&quot;question\\&quot; at least 5 times - \\&quot;what is that fragrance you&#x27;re wearing?\\&quot; BTW - why hasn&#x27;t a man&#x27;s fragrance maker named a cologne \\&quot;Conversation Piece\\&quot; yet? Hmmm? Packaging was the \\&quot;BOMB.\\&quot; Shipped on time &#x27;cause I followed the provided tracking details thanks to the seller. I WILL be ordering ANOTHER bottle VERY soon!</li>
            <li> I saw this at a local department store and I fell in love with this as soon as I smelled it.  It is very classy and a sexy.  I purchased this for my boyfriend, who really likes it as well.  It&#x27;s a unique scent.  I love this and I will keep purchasing this for him for a long time.  It&#x27;s become his signature scent.  :)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic fragrance for men! Makes you want to snuggle in closer! Just something a bit different than most of the other colognes out there.....</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  Both my husband &amp; I are reaching for it.  We have been stopped on the street asking what scent we are wearing</li>
            <li> my favorite cologne, lots of compliments with it.. A MUST HAVE...</li>
            <li> My wife found this product in a magazine advertisement and thought the sample smelled wonderful.  It is hard to describe the scent or compare it to other colognes- sorry for lacking the olfactory language to describe it but I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragance. The description of the fragrance filled the expectations created by advertising. Very sexy and very hot. I bought for my husband and i love how he smells.</li>
            <li> It is a unique smell. Long lasting. A bit overpowering at first but once it mellows out it is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, good quantity and my wife loves it.  It lasts all day and it is not too strong to wear to work.  Great year round scent.</li>
            <li> I smelled this cologne at Sephora while on a trip in New York and immediately fell in love with the robust spice scent. i ordered it on amazon as I have prime and it had a lower price point. Like others the packaging showed that it was opened before as a number on the inside of the box was removed (its for the Viktor and Rolf Secret Service). It smells softer than what I remember and no where near as robust (the first time I smelled caught me off guard, which I loved.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I planned on buying a second bottle anyway, I&#x27;m going to the Sephora tomorrow and buying a bottle at retail :(. Once I get them side by side with some coffee grounds to clear my nasal passages the review will be updated to reflect my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 11/26/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i went to Sephora and paid the outrageous price of $105  for the 3oz bottle. In the process I also bought a bottle of Him by Hanei Mori (Eau de Parfum) which is definitely on par with Spicebomb, albeit more expensive as its a higher quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the version I bought from Amazon to the one I bought from Sephora and they are indeed the same. What I found is that the robustness of the cologne settles into a sweeter scent after being applied, which is why I&#x27;m upgrading it from 3 stars to 4. Its only 4 because the packaging comes with cut marks on it.</li>
            <li> Sexy, spicy and very masculine. Most Definitely an all-day scent. It&#x27;s a must-have for anybody&#x27;s collection. Gotta love it. Yes!</li>
            <li> This item is fake DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Sober, classic and great for the mature man today, you can use it as an everyday fragrance, combined with everything from sporting occasions to elegant occasions.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Flowerbomb for years and it is literally her signature scent. So when the men&#x27;s version came out I had to try it. And like her...people comment on it constantly when they hug me. Very masculine scent but not overpowering. Highly recommend if your like something earthy with a kick.</li>
            <li> I liked and recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It was a must buy from me. Started off as a woodsy scent that was a little spicy and then tapers off into an addicting sweet scent on me.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my brother in the states as I couldn&#x27;t buy it in England and he says it smells nice!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, but around the time I started wearing it, my boyfriend started getting sinus problems.. Knowing he was allergic to lavender, I googled. This wonderful product contains lavender. No more spice bomb for me :&#x27;[</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a fall or winter scent.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t describe how it smells other than unlike anything else and people took notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe sometimes that&#x27;s a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to think back to see if those were backhanded compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, seriously, this stuff really is DA BOMB.</li>
            <li> This is my son-in-laws&#x27; favorite cologne.  It was a hit at Christmas.  He wore it proudly the same day.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> When we opened it, the code label inside the flap was taken off.&lt;br /&gt;Then we noticed that the outer plastic wrap was scotch taped on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;El codigo dentro de la caja del perfume fue retirado</li>
            <li> The product smells great, and came with the proper unmolested secret service code on the box so I assume it is authentic.</li>
            <li> I feel guilty spraying it it smells Soo good</li>
            <li> It was great smelled exactly how I wanted it to, best smell I&#x27;ve had in a long time wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything or sell it!</li>
            <li> When my package arrived it was in a beat up box look like it belong to some else,the secret code that they put in to get special offers had been ripped out not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this even though at the time it said &amp;#34;This item is under review&amp;#34; because of some of the reports of fakes I guess.  I bought the 3.04 Oz bottle and what I got is 100% legit Spicebomb.  The box is high quality, it had a working code for the secret-service website, the bottle had the &amp;#34;pull pin&amp;#34; and it smells just as wonderful and as strong as it should.</li>
            <li> I ordered this SKU and then tried to cancel after reading about how so many people seemed to get not legit fulfillment on their orders. Too late to cancel so I waited and lo and behold my cologne came shrink wrapped, no weirdness, like a cologne should. And it smells INSANELY FANTASTIC!!! Bought this based on a &amp;#34;scratch and sniff&amp;#34; ad in a mag. The real thing blows my expectations away. Amazing signature scent. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells extremely good, and the bottle has lasted me almost an entire year. I haven&#x27;t been using it every day or anything, but definitely a great value. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> SMELLS SO HOT AND SEXY.  BUT BE CAREFUL EVEN THE OPPOSITE SEX WILL BE TRYING TO GIVE YOU SOME.  ECHHH!</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t a long lasting perfume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a cologne guru as of lately and I own scents from the higher end, I.E. Bond No. 9 &amp; Creed down to the low end, I.E. Cuba Gold.  Had no idea about this cologne until a few months ago when I saw someone mention it on a cologne forum.  Went into Nordstrom and noticed that they had it in there and tried it and fell in love with it.  Of course, I didn&#x27;t want to pay what they were charging for it and knew I could get it cheaper here so I did.  It&#x27;s a fairly sweet scent so many may not like it but it&#x27;s in my top 3.  It was a legit order, no fakes or anything of that nature but of course I always order directly from Amazon anyways so i&#x27;ve had no issues thus far.  This isn&#x27;t a scent that i&#x27;d advise blind buying though.  If you like the YSL L&#x27;Nuit and/OR YSL L&#x27;Homme I can say pretty confidently that you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve receive a lot of complements when I wear this cologne. I have the tendency to be a snob when it comes to scents but this one is definitely stayin.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and it was not only the best price I could find but he loved it and it shipped fast as well;)</li>
            <li> Spice Bomb is the Bomb.  It smells soooooooo good. It&#x27;s kinda earthy, not overly sweet.  My husband where&#x27;s it all the time now</li>
            <li> This scent is all of the lovely scents you&#x27;d smell in a moroccan bazaar... cinnamon, clove, cardamom, nutmeg, cedar and sandalwood, with a hint of citrus peel and vanilla to smooth it out. It doesn&#x27;t have the standard man&#x27;s cologne musky or &amp;#34;cheap gin&amp;#34; smell to it, which I find overly abrasive and eye-watering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time my husband wears this, I can&#x27;t keep my face far from his neck, which he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something not too strong and will wear well all day this is the BOMB! It makes a statement and stays with you just enough to bring smiles to faces throughout the day.</li>
            <li> On time and as advertised</li>
            <li> Women are always complementing me and asking &amp;#34;what is that&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great sruff...the ORIGINAL. ..not a cheap knock off....very satisfied</li>
            <li> Really like the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li> BEWARE!  It was repackaged.  It did come in a plastic covering but it had been opened before.  The inside of the box there was a code that had been ripped out for some reward program.  AND IT CANNOT BE RETURNED!</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance ...very classy and  sure brought compliments lasts  a long time and sooo refreshed&lt;br /&gt;will order another soon....the supplier was awesome&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob A</li>
            <li> I searched the top 10 perfumes 2013, and this proved to be one of them. I really had never smelled, but I&#x27;m very happy with the result, a very nice perfume.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome. when it comes to fragrances you really can&#x27;t take someone elses word for it because each persons body chemistry differs. Go to Macy&#x27;s put it on your skin and see for yourself. If you like it get on Amazon and order it because the price is right! I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments for this cologne and is now one of my go to scents!</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of sweet spice, this is the fragrance for you.  This has replace Gucci Guilty and Polo Red as my all time favorite fragrance.  You don&#x27;t need to overdo it as the fragrance has great staying power.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne, really didn&#x27;t care for it smell was to pepper. The smell was overpowering and I do not recommend buying.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this stuff, but my only gripe is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;Makes me wonder if I got a genuine version of it, or wether it was a knockoff.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this scent!!!  Was a great value as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely unequivocally my favorite cologne! My fiance loves it and so does everyone that smells it on me throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Hey, at least my wife love it , and to be honest it smell way different than what everybody wear. buy it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazeballs! It reminds me of the old DKNY men fragrance they used to sell with the bottle that looked like a gun out of Star Trek or something. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Pure fire in a bottle, Spicebomb smells like something James Bond would wear it has a woodsy smell mixed with a punch. It smells great and also lasts long, 3 sprays and ive got the attention of all noses in the room!</li>
            <li> My wife was rushing through her favorite shopping center and was stopped by an employee at the men&#x27;s fragrance department. When she told the clerk she didn&#x27;t have time and her husband already has his favorite colognes, the young lady gave her a small handful of samples. I decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try them on different days. This was the second one I tried. Since I fell in love with this one, and don&#x27;t like having stuff all over the place, I quickly disposed of the others. I have never heard of Spicebomb before but really liked it from the begining. Of course, if you never smelled or tried it on, it is recommended that you find it at a local store and try it there. I am sure by the time you return to your vehicle, smell it after its been a while, you will order it as soon as you get home. I did!!</li>
            <li> I picked up a sample of this a few years back for my youngest son and he LOVES it. A bit pricy but a little goes a long was so it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> Received a sample today. To me it smells like Romeo Gigli + a touch of Grey Flannel and Joop. I like it. Will definitely get a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally purchased a bottle and am disappointed. Maybe the sample was from a different batch. Smells great the first 5 minutes but after the drydown it just smells like some cheap annoying discount aftershave.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in a magazine, and was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fragrance expert so I&#x27;m not going to talk about bass notes, dry down, hints of patchouli or all that nonsense.  It has a pleasing masculine smell that lasts a very long time and would be overpowering if too much was sprayed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of the current designer fragrances, and many are quite generic or overdone, with numerous versions of the same fragrance like sport, intense, noir, etc.  I like that this is a little harder to find in the stores, so is a little more unique, and you&#x27;re less likely to be standing in an elevator with someone else wearing the same fragrance; if that bothers you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this would make a good fragrance for evening wear, and is going to be good for the fall or winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that another review raised a flag about fake product.  This shipped directly from Amazon on their Prime program.  It was carefully packaged just as you would expect to see it in the store.  You have to remove the plastic wrapper, the product was boxed appropriately, and the product looked like the real deal.  I certainly have no suspicions that it is authentic.</li>
            <li> I order so much off of Amazon, that I didn&#x27;t realize that there was a problem with returning perfume/cologne.  Ours turned out to be a counterfeit too.  When we opened it, the code label inside the flap was taken off.  Then the smell was not genuine.  Then we noticed that the outer plastic wrap was scotch taped on the bottom.  Someone sure went to a lot of effort to rip us off.  Fortunately, Customer Service says that they will do the right thing and send us a new one.  We know that we really like the product, if we can get the correct one sent to us.  Hopefully on Friday we will get the product we payed for. I still love Amazon, but I will be more careful about purchasing when returns might be an issue.</li>
            <li> This is every bit as wonderful as V&amp;R Flowerbomb for women. I don&#x27;t usually get &amp;#34;blown away&amp;#34; by men&#x27;s cologne but this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> This is my ol mans favorite. Stays on strong all day and every one notices how good it smells, especially me!</li>
            <li> Smells great  good price</li>
            <li> Was not fake. Seemed to be in original packaging. May have been opened though because inner box seemed torn. Was in plastic though.</li>
            <li> i bought this after i smelled a product sampler from one of my online perfume orders way back. Just wanted to try it at first as it smelled superb... i love it and i&#x27;m moving from my usual Bulgari&#x27;s to this one...</li>
            <li> Really great scent, price is better than any store, also quality is wonderful, longevity and projection exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this scent in a magazine advertisement.  It was so good that I had to rub it all over my arm until there was nothing left on the paper.  Being that I am very fussy with scents, it takes alot for me to being sold on one.  I loved this scent so much that I purchased a bottle for my boyfriend.  It is absolutely fabulous and I&#x27;m so glad I peeled back the sample and tried it.....</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne out there period.  Nothing comes close to this.  I always receive comments from women about how great I smell.</li>
            <li> This would be a casual scent which lasts for hours depending on what activities you&#x27;re involved in, obviously. As I mentioned above this would be for casual dress and is as pleasant as Polo Red, Hugo Boss Red or even Gucci in my opinion as I own and use them all.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Viktor &amp; Rolf Spicebomb for just over a year now and it’s without doubt both mine and my wife’s favourite Eau de Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a masculine yet not too musky fragrance. When you smell this fragrance you will sometimes get the earthy ‘spicey’ almost peppery tones, and other times you can pick out slightly lighter fragrances such as subtle grapefruit. It’s this complex subtleness that makes this fragrance very pleasant to wear indeed. I do not apply too much but I have had a couple of acquaintances ask what I am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is also a visually pleasing addition to my bathroom cabinet; if considering giving this as a gift your recipient will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly my wife loves the smell, it has good staying power even after a long day at work. If going through a fragrance section in a department store be sure to give this a sniff! Fantastic. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent smell. Shipped fast, great size, packaged well and excellent price.</li>
            <li> No issues on my end. Product is as requested and was delivered promptly. I would happily make another purchase when needed.</li>
            <li> The inside &#x27;secret service&#x27; code was missing.  Tampered with and either watered down or the original drained and the majority substituted with some type of alcohol mixture.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell!</li>
            <li> Does not smell the same as authentic cologne. Watered down, received open package. This is not the cologne sold in stores</li>
            <li> I tried this product at the mall and thought it was very strong cologne, but smelt pretty good. Surprisingly the bottle i ordered on Amazon smells better to me and is not as strong. Not sure if i am crazy, or this bottle is different (some inconsistencies), but i am more pleased with the scent that&#x27;s  a little weaker as its not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some reviews about the scent changing after it dries, which is true. At first, the scent is awesome, but after a few minutes, its a spicy tobacco scent, but to me its a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since cant smell anything after a few hours, so not sure how long it lasts, but from my experience, this is a great cologne, perfect for night time use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe most people will be happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is good musky, and is long lasting. But its not the best out there for price tag. The bottle is awesome, like a grenade. overall 4 on 5.</li>
            <li> I first took Victor &amp; Rolf seriously about a month ago when my best friend had a birthday and was talking about how much she loved Flowerbomb.  I went into Sephora and smelled Flowerbomb -- waaaay too floral for me but I did get it for her.  A couple weeks later I came across reviews for Spicebomb.  Seeing as how I absolutely loathed it&#x27;s feminine counterpart, I was all set to hate it.  I went into the store and sprayed some on myself.  I was totally shocked -- so spicy sweet and warm and mmmmmm!  I just wanted to take a bath in the stuff!  They should make a linen spray in this scent, I would so be all over that!  Hahaha.  One of the other reviews mentioned she wished she could wear it -- it IS marketed as unisex, so yay!  As a 25 year old woman, I&#x27;m very picky about my perfumes, I simply cannot have them too floral or sweet or strong.  Spicebomb is the perfect mix for me!</li>
            <li> This cologne is super excellent, if you think that Cuba Gold is good, Spicebomb by Viktor and Rolf is even better. Now I can say that for me, but to each their own, because I feel it depends on the body chemistry of each person. As I said with Cuba Gold, they definitely need to continue making this item as good as it is now.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my fianc&amp;eacute; for valentines day and he loved it and I love the smell on him!</li>
            <li> This arrived within three days and was significantly less costly than the department store item of same size.  Love the fragrance on my husband.</li>
            <li> I love the spicy accent from this cologne. I constantly get compliments and it smells amazing. It lasts for about 5 hours but I can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> Great quality product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This smells great!! It sticks on me all day and my wife loves when i wear it. Its like my black panther except it smells good lol. Also its a light sweet smell but not so sweet that it smells like a womans perfume.</li>
            <li> Got here as quickly as expected and my boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves the smell</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant of buying this because I thought it was going to be fake, but it totally smells just like real deal! So happy with this purchase and glad I saved about 40 bucks.</li>
            <li> Well, as a woman, I have to say that my FAVORITE perfume of all time is officially Flowerbomb (I KNEW it was a hit when a very handsome gay man had his head down my shirt asking me what amaazzing scent I was wearing and called his boyfriend over to also smell my perfume, haha).  It&#x27;s taken me years to find a fragrance I know I will never get sick of - EVER.  Even though it costs a fortune (and I swear, the prices have gone up).  However, I recently smelled this male V&amp;R scent and I have to say I&#x27;m JEALOUS and wish I had the guts to wear this one myself, or that it was marketed as \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; - but I&#x27;m a big coward ;)  So I&#x27;ll do the next best thing and buy it for my man - Viktor &amp; Rolf has done it again - extremely sexy, classy and memorable scent.</li>
            <li> I blind bought this in search of a new fall fragrance. Make no mistake about it, this is definitely a masculine scent. I didn&#x27;t have it on for more than two hours and I had several beautiful ladies ask what I was wearing and ask to get a bit closer.</li>
            <li> This is a great frag. Plenty of compliments, good staying power and projection (on my skin at least). If you like scents in the vein of Gucci (original pour homme), Burberry London, John Varvatos original, etc you will love this scent. Certainly a fall, winter scent.</li>
            <li> I have women following me around in hoards wanting to know what the magical smell is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly is a unique smell. I have been trying and using different types of cologne for years, and I think I have finally found a favorite. My wife loves it, and I have had several people (mostly women) ask what I am wearing or comment on how great I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this product was 100% authentic. Just make sure that the seller is Amazon and there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. I would stir clear from any other seller. Also the cost is $35 less than the same item at Nordstroms. Will buy more when Amazon is selling again.</li>
            <li> This frag is very complex. I cant even tell you one note that dominates the fragrance because its blended so nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Should be a nice addition for winter. id go easy on the trigger about 3 sprays max. Shipped in 1 day aswell lol amazing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance.  Very fresh smelling and gets lighter throughout the day.  Ideal fragrance for someone that can&#x27;t tolerate heavy smells.</li>
            <li> Great scent for a night out, perfect for that first date to impress someone with a sexy clean scent</li>
            <li> I bought it for myself and I&#x27;m a woman. Love the smell. My hubby shares it with me.</li>
            <li> Smells great and does not wear off fast as many other high end product often do.  Lots of thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This scent really steps up to deliver it&#x27;s name i.e. a mix of spices that makes women want to follow you around and let the aroma transport them to the far East. Brilliant!  :)</li>
            <li> This is not for the shy wallflower kind of bloke.  This is in your face Alpha male cologne.  I put this on and walk intona bar and all the broads can smell it.  They love it</li>
            <li> It seems like every female in my husband&#x27;s vicinity notices when he wears this. It&#x27;s distinctive and masculine and I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find in stores (at least at the time they first released it)... so I was glad to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. Masculine and bold.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful on my hubby, great deal!</li>
            <li> A good perfume is original, excellent, I recommend it. From Mexico. Thank yo[[ASIN:B007D1VGSY SPICEBOMB 3.0 OZ EDT SPRAY FOR MEN BY VIKTOR&amp;ROLF NEW IN A BOX]].</li>
            <li> This is my newest favorite scent. Spicy, masculine, and it lasts a long time (10+ hours). Also, this is probably the coolest looking bottle on the market, you have to pull the pin off like a real grenade to work the sprayer which is kinda cool.</li>
            <li> The absolute best smelling cologne period. I have never had so many people ask me what type of fragrance I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Smelles awesome! Got it for my husband and he loved it! I have the women&#x27;s version and smells great to!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you. The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Great product ! As described!</li>
            <li> I had some time to kill in an airport, so started smelling some men&#x27;s cologne. I really like the Viktor &amp; Rolf Spicebomb, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price.  Although not cheap, I found a much better deal on Amazon. Merry Christmas to my husband! What&#x27;s not to like about smelling good?</li>
            <li> I love every bit of this fragrance. I have tried fragrances by Gucci, Versace, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Lacoste and Burberry and I have to say Viktor &amp; Rolf is the best of em lots. I have gotten too many compliments about this fragrance and my luck in women have increased exponentially. I feel much better and confident when I wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li> No problem!! No delay!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Arrived on time! Got it for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He started wearing it immediately. We joke that he smells like a Forrest and I smell like a meadow when I wear Flower Bomb.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the scent, but I&#x27;ve experienced the same missing promo and barcode that many have reported.  Amazon has been plenty gracious about it--they even sent me a second bottle when the first showed up with the missing promo and barcode (which was also missing the promo and barcode).  I contacted Viktor &amp; Rolf, and they sent me the below message, which I thought anyone looking to buy the cologne ought to be aware of before making a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 7, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for contacting European Designer Fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;European Designer Fragrances is committed to selling our products, including Viktor &amp; Rolf Spice Bomb Eau De Toilette Spray, through major department and specialty stores, accompanied by expert professional advice to best meet the consumer&#x27;s needs.

            <li> Awesome price and even better fragrance.  Wife surprised me with and was more surprised by the price as compared to the retail stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I knew it was the real deal no copy off of ebay so now I am happy.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this, and I love the way it smells on him!</li>
            <li> Ths cologne has a very distinct smell, it is spicy yet not overpowering. Very different which I like and have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells terrific!  I found it in a magazine, went to the store and they didn&#x27;t have it so ordered it online.  I&#x27;m glad I did, I really love it!</li>
            <li> love this scent.  too strong when you spray it but lightens up after few hours of wearing the cologne</li>
            <li> this stuff is da bomb!!</li>
            <li> My mother had bought me this back in December. I finally opened it up yesterday as a gift only to find the inside &#x27;secret service&#x27; code was missing, cut out. The scent was also way off from what I smelled at Sephora. Highly irritated that amazon would not check more carefully at counterfeits.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this product while reading a Chicago magazine. it stated that one could order it through Amazone. I tried it and it works for me</li>
            <li> This scent is AWESOME! Long long time ago there used to be a scent called Harley Davidson Original. It flopped and was discontinued. I loved it but could never find one until I found this. Smelt it at Sephora when I went shopping with the wife. Trust me guys, your significant others will love this on you. It is warm, had a tobacco like smell and gets warmer as time passes on you. It has a moderate spicy smell at the mid note which is awesome. BUY THIS and you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> a very merry christmas to a fine young man who knows what he wants...smell is different you have to be a fan of it. He loved it!</li>
            <li> buy this and you&#x27;ll get a lot of complements! Definitely a head turner if your skin is receptive to spicy fragrances</li>
            <li> Purchased through Amazon.com., arrived on time, and received the real deal/100% authentic Spicebomb! It&#x27;s always tricky with purchasing fragrances online, that&#x27;s why I chose to go with Amazon. As for the fragrance, easily the best!</li>
            <li> I love it can&#x27;t get enough of it. Best smell ever spice bomb It can&#x27;t get anymore spicER. The smell is diffrent not typical colone smells. This is what I would always use for now on. I enjoy it when I have it on all the compliments I get. When you smell good you feel good.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Everything is legit with this product including the secret service code.</li>
            <li> Insanely great smell, everywhere I go ladies ALWAYS point it out and want to know what it is. Such a great smell, stands out just enough when people get real close they smell it. Not overpowering or strong at all.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful..</li>
            <li> This scent is explosive,it smells pleasure, you can&#x27;t wait to get closer to him,what ever happens after the closeness is pure Joy!</li>
            <li> Guys if you are wearing this cologne I might not be able to control myself!!  I find the smell intoxicating.</li>
            <li> Fragrance felt to be &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;- barbershop like.&lt;br /&gt;My son likes it so I gave it to him.My staff liked it too.Just not me.</li>
            <li> I love the way Spicebomb smells. It is masculine and musky like Double Black but clean and citrus-y like Acqua di Gio.A perfumist would probably think I was horrible incorrect but I thought it was a happy medium between the two colognes.</li>
            <li> it is a good cologne for late dinner and a date night.projection is good initially for the first 3hrs.after that it stays close to the skin.i like it and it is much stronger than the creed aventus i just bought</li>
            <li> I received the cologne unwrapped, and I was immediately suspicious about it being a fake product. I do not expect a purchased product to be &#x27;already opened&#x27; when I get it in the mail. Plus, there were obvious cuts on the inside of the box as if someone had tampered with the product before use, which is extremely suspicious. I emailed the dealer, who responded with an unclear and ambiguous reason behind the defects. I decided to give the cologne at least a try, and it only led to greater doubts about the authenticity of the cologne. I currently own the same cologne, which has been bought through a Sephora Retail Store. I tested the cologne that I had purchased through Sephora against the one bought through the dealer. The two products significantly smelled different from one another. The cologne purchased through the dealer has a weaker scent and a different smell, which I had other people confirm as well. I called Amazon immediately once I was absolutely unsatisfied with the product. Hence, my numerous phone calls to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Well,after reading reviews i decided to buy Spicebomb. Very firs minutes after using i start getting compliments. Highly reccomended for men who loves being an ladies attention.Thank you,you rock!</li>
            <li> Somehow this smells like cedar wood to me.  I really like it and it&#x27;s become my current scent.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding colegne that didn&#x27;t bother me. I have purchased Flower Bomb for a friend and absolutley love it so I thought I needed to try Spice Bomb and I am sooooo happy with it! Love the smell and everyone notices it and loves it too!! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonable price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> As a lady that deplores floral scents, I was in the market for a darker/spicier scent. The saleswoman at Sephora, actually suggested this masculine cologne as one that she wears regularly, with the scent even improving over hours of wear. I couldn&#x27;t agree more, and with a $30 cost savings by purchasing on Amazon, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This cologne is def in my top 5. It isnt too musky at all, not feminine or overpowering. Ofcourse, I love the bottle too. It usually will last well throughout the day and all the women at my job love it and i love the compliments.</li>
            <li> Was concerned about authenticity after reading reviews and watching a YouTube video comparing counterfeit product with the real one. Was relieved when this arrived and it was the read deal. &amp;#34;Sold by and ships from Amazon dot com&amp;#34; 3.04 oz was what I purchased. Yeah, it smells great too but you already know that.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne. I prefer it in the winter months because of its strong smell but could be worn year round. Definitely will get you some compliments!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my guy.. and I won&#x27;t go into details. But.. WHOA.. I love it ;)</li>
            <li> So the price was on point and the cologne is still amazing, but the package was clearly opened and pieces removed.</li>
            <li> I just received the cologne. I don&#x27;t know what to make of the scent. Is a cologne smell or chemical smell that you get when you open a brand new iPad or Apple products. I have not tested my cologne outside. I&#x27;m not sure if people will like it or not. It is not my favorite scent as of now. I&#x27;m still hoping that people like the scent when I wear it. I&#x27;ll write a follow-up review later.</li>
