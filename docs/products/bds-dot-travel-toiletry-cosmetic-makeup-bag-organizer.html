            <li>Great buy!!!</li>
            <li>The size and shape of this makeup bag is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Very good for our application of the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would make a perfect makeup bag, but I use it to keep my medications in.  </li>
            <li>Over all worked out good for me.</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t started yet, but it&#x27;s a good idea to be prepared.</li>
            <li>very cute &amp; I like the shape and size.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and get better Quality products!</li>
            <li>This BDS makeup bag is adorable!</li>
            <li>but nice for traveling</li>
            <li>If you do not need pockets for brushes then this would be a nice makeup bag, however it does not meet my needs.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that inside the top flap of the bag it has slots to put your makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>The bags material is nice and is shiny, but that&#x27;s my taste.</li>
            <li>The glass is enclosed in a very cheap plastic lining that feels like it can fall apart easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have given a 5 star if the interior lining were better quality.  </li>
            <li>Whoever made this bag could have used better material.  </li>
            <li>Meh, you can do better.</li>
            <li>The bag has five slots on the flap of the bag to store brushes, and that is mostly what it is.</li>
            <li>This case is really cute and made well.</li>
            <li>it could be better. :)</li>
            <li>Way cuter in person and has many slots to keep your lipsticks, mascara, etc.</li>
            <li>I would purchase more from this line.</li>
            <li>and i can fit everything i need to do my face every day very easily.  </li>
            <li>This bag is very cheap looking and coming apart easily.  </li>
            <li>I think it would make a great gift for a young girl or teenager.</li>
            <li>i keep the products (aside from eye shadow) in one easy to grab container.  </li>
            <li>suffices the need although, product is made cheaply.</li>
            <li>Cheap material.</li>
            <li>material is cheap and shiny/plastic.</li>
            <li>this is nothing special and verryyyyyyyyy</li>
            <li>it ripped right when I put it in!</li>
            <li>The color and pattern of the bag is true to what you see in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a whole lot on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I admit that the appearance of the bag on the outside was very cute.</li>
            <li>Even after unwrapping the packaging and leaving the bag unzipped to air out for over a month, the chemical odor was so strong that it was very off-putting.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li>You could store a good amount of makeup in there if you really wanted to, but it feels like all the makeup would go everywhere every time you open</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>The style is cute, the size was right for me, but it&#x27;s too cheaply made to last.</li>
            <li>It shipped right on time and the inside seems to have all the compartments she needs for her cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the stitching was loose and coming apart already.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good size a for a young female to store a couple pads in when going to school or something.</li>
            <li>The finish was more slick than anticipated, but otherwise the assembly and the final product was attractive.</li>
            <li>Bought it for a gift, which is pretty embarrassing to admit.</li>
            <li>You have to hold the top open or else</li>
            <li>It is made pretty well for the price.</li>
            <li>Gave it as a present to my sister and it is really cute.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for someone looking for an affordable cosmetics bag with a peppy personality :)</li>
            <li>I honestly feel a little deceived by the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and wouldnt recommend to ANYONE.</li>
            <li>She really likes it, and so do her friends.</li>
            <li>The cheery pink and black polkadots make me smile.  </li>
            <li>Also, the top flap part that zips shut is really wide from front to back, so if you leave the zip top open, everything will fall out the backside.</li>
            <li>I could fit tiny brushes, tweezers, etc., in the slots, but when you open and close the lid they fall right out all over the place.</li>
            <li>The polka dot design is cute, but the bag is both poorly designed (not functional) and cheaply made (tore apart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a cute little tote.  </li>
            <li>The material is not the strongest and the seam inside pulled away in one place right away, but not enough that it interferes with the function nor makes me want to go through the hassle of returning it.  </li>
            <li>Also the inside holders on the underside of the lid is only good for long items or really wide items, otherwise the items fall off (like eye and lip liners).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s washable or can wiped with a wet cloth to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The slots for brushes on the top are NOT long enough to hold a standard brush.</li>
            <li>Not sure how many more times I&#x27;ll be able to use it. :(</li>
            <li>and it almost unzips completely, so everything keeps falling out when I unzip it all the way when I am trying to dig around for something.</li>
            <li>The seam to the cover goes past the top edge and doesn&#x27;t just flip back when opened.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used it for one 4-day trip, and one of the zippers is pretty much permanently stuck, after getting that way a few times before.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be high quality, but this was especially cheap-looking.  </li>
            <li>I barely touched it and the fabric frayed and tore away like tissue paper!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is actually a little smaller than I anticipated but still adequate for makeup.  </li>
            <li>Cute little bag, a bit small..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Cute little bag, a bit small..</li>
            <li> the last one i had didn&#x27;t work to well and stuff was always getting jammed inside.</li>
            <li> The bag isn&#x27;t quite as big as I&#x27;d expected, given the measurements listed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little mirror attached to the inside of the bag, and there&#x27;s just enough room for travel sized items and also extra makeup.</li>
            <li> it falls back down.</li>
            <li> Defintely not work the $14 I spent.  </li>
            <li> It pulled away from the bag after zipping/unzipping only a few times.</li>
            <li> i needed something that was small but roomy for all my blushes, big brushes, bronzers, and two spray bottles of makeup setter.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly the highest quality bag, but certainly not cheap-looking by any means!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bags, one ended up having a broken zipper the same day, and the other had loose stitching ...</li>
            <li> The actual body of the bag is very small and restrictive in size.</li>
            <li> are little bands that hold things like brushes, concealer, eyeliner, etc.  </li>
            <li> I tried to get a little use out of it buy using it to hold my brushes</li>
            <li> It is hard to open and hard to unzip.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used this TWICE and the entire plastic ripped off where the pockets were, rendering it useless for storage.  </li>
            <li> I searched through dozens of travel make-up bags before choosing this one, so you cam imagine my disappointment whe, on the third use, the brush pockets began coming unstitched.</li>
            <li> The bag is poorly made and very small.</li>
            <li> I hate to leave a bad review, but this little bag was a very big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> This is a weird bag to put it bluntly.</li>
            <li> What made matters worse was the terrible smell!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing because the bag is super-cute!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The mirror came in terrible shape.</li>

            <li> Cute little bag, a bit small.. but nice for traveling</li>
            <li> very cute &amp; I like the shape and size.  I would have given a 5 star if the interior lining were better quality.  Over all worked out good for me.</li>
            <li> Whoever made this bag could have used better material.  This bag is very cheap looking and coming apart easily.  Looks like something I could have bought at a dollar store.  Defintely not work the $14 I spent.  Save your money and get better Quality products!</li>
            <li> reviews led me to think it was a makeup size bag. I got it in the mail &amp; I was disappointed.  Its too small.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size a for a young female to store a couple pads in when going to school or something. I am going to give it too my daughter, and have her do just that. It&#x27;ll be discrete in her back pack. She hasn&#x27;t started yet, but it&#x27;s a good idea to be prepared. She&#x27;s around that age.</li>
            <li> Meh, you can do better. Cheaply-made, has permanent wrinkles. Bought it for a gift, which is pretty embarrassing to admit.</li>
            <li> i keep the products (aside from eye shadow) in one easy to grab container.  the last one i had didn&#x27;t work to well and stuff was always getting jammed inside. i needed something that was small but roomy for all my blushes, big brushes, bronzers, and two spray bottles of makeup setter.  it unzips almost all the way back and on the inside of the flap are little bands that hold things like brushes, concealer, eyeliner, etc.  this means they&#x27;re not taking up room at the bottom of the bag.  the bottom fills out and i can fit everything i need to do my face every day very easily.  i would buy this bag!</li>
            <li> I was so dissapointed when I received this item. The bag is poorly made and very small. Most importantly, the stitching was loose and coming apart already. I could see the threading on the outside and inside. What a waste of money. Very flimsy and wouldnt recommend to ANYONE.</li>
            <li> This is a cute little tote.  It is actually a little smaller than I anticipated but still adequate for makeup.  The material is not the strongest and the seam inside pulled away in one place right away, but not enough that it interferes with the function nor makes me want to go through the hassle of returning it.  I think it would make a great gift for a young girl or teenager.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel a little deceived by the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I admit that the appearance of the bag on the outside was very cute. The color and pattern of the bag is true to what you see in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;-The feel of the bag is plasticey and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;-The biggest issue for me was the dimensions. Although, it was a bit of my fault as I didn&#x27;t refer to the dimension description beforehand. This bag smaller than what I was expecting. The bag has five slots on the flap of the bag to store brushes, and that is mostly what it is. The actual body of the bag is very small and restrictive in size. You could store a good amount of makeup in there if you really wanted to, but it feels like all the makeup would go everywhere every time you open it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The mirror came in terrible shape. There are lines of sticky dust particles that was obscuring it. The glass is enclosed in a very cheap plastic lining that feels like it can fall apart easily.&lt;br /&gt;-When I tried to get a little use out of it buy using it to hold my brushes it ripped right when I put it in! I barely touched it and the fabric frayed and tore away like tissue paper!&lt;br /&gt;-Quality over all feels like something you could buy at a dollar store. The price is outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zipper broke after a week of use. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Very good for our application of the product.  The finish was more slick than anticipated, but otherwise the assembly and the final product was attractive.</li>
            <li> suffices the need although, product is made cheaply. I ordered 2 bags, one ended up having a broken zipper the same day, and the other had loose stitching ... you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This case is really cute and made well. However, I do not like the way it opens. It is hard to open and hard to unzip. This happens because of the design. The seam to the cover goes past the top edge and doesn&#x27;t just flip back when opened. You have to hold the top open or else it falls back down. Also the inside holders on the underside of the lid is only good for long items or really wide items, otherwise the items fall off (like eye and lip liners). This issues may not bother someone else. It is made pretty well for the price.</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought. It s medium quality. it could be better. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this bag for my girlfriend so she can carry make-up and things when we go out. It fits all her things perfectly without being too bulky. She really likes it, and so do her friends. Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the highest quality bag, but certainly not cheap-looking by any means! Gave it as a present to my sister and it is really cute. It shipped right on time and the inside seems to have all the compartments she needs for her cosmetics. I would definitely recommend for someone looking for an affordable cosmetics bag with a peppy personality :)</li>
            <li> The zipper broke soon after I bought it.  The style is cute, the size was right for me, but it&#x27;s too cheaply made to last.</li>
            <li> I hate to leave a bad review, but this little bag was a very big disappointment.  Considering the price, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be high quality, but this was especially cheap-looking.  What made matters worse was the terrible smell!  Even after unwrapping the packaging and leaving the bag unzipped to air out for over a month, the chemical odor was so strong that it was very off-putting.  My assumption is that the odor is from the synthetic fabrics, etc used to make the bag, which probably means that no amount of airing or scrubbing will make the odor dissipate.  Very disappointing because the bag is super-cute!</li>
            <li> this is nothing special and verryyyyyyyyy smalll bag beware thats all i have to say donttttttttt buy it go to ross</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would make a perfect makeup bag, but I use it to keep my medications in.  The cheery pink and black polkadots make me smile.  The inside is roomy, and there is a mirror attached inside.</li>
            <li> Faded color, one of the cheapest items I&#x27;ve seen. Too embarrassed to give it as a gift. Amazon gave me my money back.</li>
            <li> This BDS makeup bag is adorable! Way cuter in person and has many slots to keep your lipsticks, mascara, etc. organized. It also came with a mirror inside. It&#x27;s washable or can wiped with a wet cloth to keep clean. Very happy with this purchase. I also ordered different color for one for my friends who owns a bunch of MAC brushes and the roll-up bag. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap material. Not durable.</li>
            <li> I searched through dozens of travel make-up bags before choosing this one, so you cam imagine my disappointment whe, on the third use, the brush pockets began coming unstitched.</li>
            <li> The size and shape of this makeup bag is perfect for me.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of makeup.  However, I purchased this because it had pockets on the flap to hold brushes.  I used this TWICE and the entire plastic ripped off where the pockets were, rendering it useless for storage.  If you do not need pockets for brushes then this would be a nice makeup bag, however it does not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that inside the top flap of the bag it has slots to put your makeup brushes. There&#x27;s a little mirror attached to the inside of the bag, and there&#x27;s just enough room for travel sized items and also extra makeup. I would purchase more from this line. The bags material is nice and is shiny, but that&#x27;s my taste. Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> The polka dot design is cute, but the bag is both poorly designed (not functional) and cheaply made (tore apart).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is cheap and shiny/plastic. The zipper fell apart immediately. It pulled away from the bag after zipping/unzipping only a few times. Also, the top flap part that zips shut is really wide from front to back, so if you leave the zip top open, everything will fall out the backside. The slots for brushes on the top are NOT long enough to hold a standard brush. I could fit tiny brushes, tweezers, etc., in the slots, but when you open and close the lid they fall right out all over the place.</li>
            <li> The bag isn&#x27;t quite as big as I&#x27;d expected, given the measurements listed. It did hold all my makeup, though. But I&#x27;ve used it for one 4-day trip, and one of the zippers is pretty much permanently stuck, after getting that way a few times before. Not sure how many more times I&#x27;ll be able to use it. :( Since it&#x27;s a zipper, this is possibly a user problem.</li>
            <li> This is a weird bag to put it bluntly. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a whole lot on it. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than what I was thinking it would be and it almost unzips completely, so everything keeps falling out when I unzip it all the way when I am trying to dig around for something. Will just use it for storage, I guess.</li>
