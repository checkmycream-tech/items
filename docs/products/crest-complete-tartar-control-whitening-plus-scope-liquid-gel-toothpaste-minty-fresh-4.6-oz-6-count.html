            <li>I have used Crest for over forty years and nothing seems to be as good.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good in theory, but the execution is somewhat lacking.  </li>

            <li>it works great and the price is right with prime shipping.  </li>
            <li>the packaging on this is handy -- stands up in the medicine cabinet, and easy to get all the paste out</li>

            <li>Love this toothpaste.....</li>
            <li>This is ok and it does the job</li>
            <li>Crest Whitening Toothpaste is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The packaging necessitates that it be more of a tooth syrup than a tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>but I love that.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the more pastey brands.</li>
            <li>Most convenient design I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>product is top notch, it cleans and brightens your teeth while refreshing your breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the taste.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in great condition and I love the fresh taste and how clean my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>After brushing , I swish the remainder in my mouth with some warm water and get the cleanest teeth I&#x27;ve ever had AND a clean tasting mouth-all from this one product.</li>
            <li>Like the convenience of not rolling up a tube, and like the taste - plus my teeth feel squeeky clean!</li>
            <li>The bottle makes it easy to control the amount of product.  </li>
            <li>It was fine for a paste I was just expecting a gel</li>
            <li>It is a fine product in which I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with how fast these dry</li>
            <li>feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Great taste, works as advertised, keeps breath fresh, and teeth white.</li>
            <li>I like this toothpaste as it helps keep breath clean.</li>
            <li>When I wasn&#x27;t awoken by the varmints, I was dreaming about both my loving wife and my Crest Complete Tartar Control</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just toothpaste - who really knows if it&#x27;s better than the competition.  </li>
            <li>(and that&#x27;s really the most important thing - right?)</li>
            <li>Besides that, the toothpaste seems to work in making my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and it is super convienent.  </li>
            <li>Arrives quickly...</li>
            <li>This is much thinner, but at the same time very effective at cleaning our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Finally, a toothpaste I love with an easy to use bottle.</li>
            <li>It works ok but it works like the old crest tooth paste.</li>
            <li>Whitening Plus Scope Liquid Gel - Minty Fresh 4.6 Oz.</li>
            <li>For my own personal use I find this toothpaste</li>
            <li>We hug and renew our vows right then and there.  </li>
            <li>One neat squeeze and just the right amount</li>
            <li>Great package and takes up very little space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>Logistically, it&#x27;s a nice small size, perfect for our small sized sink.</li>
            <li>I really like the minty fresh taste.  </li>
            <li>this is the paste, so be aware of what they tell you...</li>
            <li>After thrying this product for the first time, I felt  the difference in how it deals with tarter.  </li>
            <li>Crest toothpaste does good job as usual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough for his travel kit and a very good price in groups of four.  </li>
            <li>I just look at her like the very first time I saw her from across that bingo hall, completely smitten.  </li>
            <li>toothpaste does have a nice, crisp flavor, but we&#x27;ll go back to arguing about squeezing from the middle or the bottom of the tube.</li>
            <li>I take them all out of the fridge, open them all up, &amp; pop the top of my new tartar-fighting gel.</li>
            <li>I squeeze a healthy amount of this new gel into each tartar sauce container, mix it up, put them back in the fridge, and</li>
            <li>I will say, I LOVE it in my (elementary aged) kids&#x27; bathroom because it&#x27;s easier to clean up because it&#x27;s not as thick and gooey as most kinds of paste.</li>
            <li>I also really like the packaging.  </li>
            <li>It is just really convenient to get it on Amazon --- I keep staple items like this in my wish list.  </li>
            <li>When I want to order something that doesn&#x27;t come up to the $35 qualifying price for free shipping I add in one of the staples such as this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always ready to squirt out.  </li>
            <li>This container makes dispensing toothpaste so much easier than the tubes.  </li>
            <li>really worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Showed up fast as always</li>
            <li>And the container stays clean and keeps its shape until the last squeeze is delivered.</li>
            <li>I love how this toothpaste can fit in such a small footprint inside my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a thick substance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She looks at me with a confusing love in her eyes for the first time in a decade and says, &amp;#34;honey</li>
            <li>The new crest complete in a tube keeps my teeth and mouth</li>
            <li>Not very thick or minty felt like dollar store toothpaste</li>
            <li>No long tubes taking up too much space.</li>
            <li>He loves this dispenser as it&#x27;s always clean and he can store it upside down</li>
            <li>I decided to give the liquid gel a try since it was considerably cheaper per ounce on Amazon than the tube.</li>
            <li>So many toothpastes on the market are so thick and goopy</li>
            <li>so there is no mess</li>
            <li>She sits down, dips that first fish stick in, chews it for a bit and BLOOH, she spits it out!  </li>
            <li>clean but small quantity for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get excited about toothpase, but I like that</li>
            <li>Bought this first from a pharmacy on a whim whilst traveling in MA, and had run out of my little tubes from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Takes up less room and past is  easy to apply to toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> wife comes home and does the usual, goes straight to the freezer to grab some fish sticks.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste seems to taste and work the same but has a much thinner consistency than the thick tube paste I am used to.</li>
            <li> Less mess and much easier to dispense than a regular tube!</li>
            <li> It worked so well, and lasted so long I had to order the six-pack from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it dispenses a little bit at a time which is probably going to make the containers last longer.</li>
            <li> Much less mess that the traditional tube.</li>
            <li> It is thinner than other pastes</li>
            <li> (just store i upside down when nearing the end).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to keep it upside down on the counter and have it seep all over the lid.  </li>
            <li> Less mess.</li>
            <li> I believe it is designed to stand on its &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; so the toothpaste feeds the little nozzle immediately (little squeeze does it)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s runny and can be a little bit messy.  </li>
            <li> I tried every gadget to solve the messy toothpaste tube problem.</li>
            <li> No more struggling with squeezing a tube and takes up little counter space.</li>
            <li> Keeps the family from making a mess!</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to overexert  yourself by squeezing as hard as you can to get a little drop.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s actually hard getting it out of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It has a really thin consistency.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed it was not a gel but not worth return.  </li>
            <li> but it is very thin</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve always used Crest, but my husband hated tubes of toothpaste - too messy.  </li>
            <li> it can be very difficult to get the product from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Have tried others every now and then and always start having bad breath after a week of using brand X.</li>
            <li> Upright container does away with ugly toothpaste tube.  </li>
            <li> and I hate it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  I have been using it for years.  I really like the minty fresh taste.  It is not overpowering but still does the job.  I also really like the packaging.  It is very easy to get the toothpaste out and you don&#x27;t have to overexert  yourself by squeezing as hard as you can to get a little drop.  The whitening part is also nice.  It doesn&#x27;t whiten like the white strips or anything but it definitely whitens by a shade or two.  I buy the six pack and it is super convienent.  Saves me a trip to the store, how much better can it get?  I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.....clean but small quantity for the price</li>
            <li> My husband loves it when I buy in bulk, shortens time at the grocery store so with that said great product (in bulk)</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years - nice taste, works well.</li>
            <li> Great pricing and delivery was quick. Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased the six pack.  Toothpaste is toothpaste but the packaging on this is handy -- stands up in the medicine cabinet, and easy to get all the paste out (just store i upside down when nearing the end).  The six-pack lasts about a year in my household of two.  It is just really convenient to get it on Amazon --- I keep staple items like this in my wish list.  When I want to order something that doesn&#x27;t come up to the $35 qualifying price for free shipping I add in one of the staples such as this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste and easy to squeeze</li>
            <li> I only use Crest Scope in the tube. I&#x27;ve used it for years. I decided to give the liquid gel a try since it was considerably cheaper per ounce on Amazon than the tube. The toothpaste seems to taste and work the same but has a much thinner consistency than the thick tube paste I am used to. It&#x27;s almost a runny egg consistency. I will finish out the five pack I had to buy on Amazon but will go back to the more expensive tube packs once that runs out.</li>
            <li> It works ok but it works like the old crest tooth paste. The new crest complete in a tube keeps my teeth and mouth feeling clean. This is ok and it does the job but I am looking for something else...</li>
            <li> Upright container does away with ugly toothpaste tube.  Takes up less room and past is  easy to apply to toothbrush.  Crest toothpaste does good job as usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about toothpase, but I like that it dispenses a little bit at a time which is probably going to make the containers last longer.</li>
            <li> Great taste, works as advertised, keeps breath fresh, and teeth white. Great package and takes up very little space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed it was not a gel but not worth return.  It was fine for a paste I was just expecting a gel</li>
            <li> Like the convenience of not rolling up a tube, and like the taste - plus my teeth feel squeeky clean!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years.  Handy packaging.  Subtracting one star as Proctor and Gamble test their products on animals.</li>
            <li> This is all about the packaging.  I can&#x27;t stand to have toothpaste caps rolling around the bathroom counter and this style eliminates that problem.  Much less mess that the traditional tube.</li>
            <li> Using  bottles as a toothpaste delivery-system is the nicest development in years.  Crest Whitening Toothpaste is refreshing.  The bottle makes it easy to control the amount of product.  The cap/closure does not allow the product to become gunky and wasteful.  It is neat on the counter or in the toiletry bag.  Buying by the 6-pack is cost-efficient.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years but cannot find it in stores anymore in this package. Thank you for having it online. It is a handy package and is easily carried in my travel kit as well. I like this toothpaste as it helps keep breath clean. Have tried others every now and then and always start having bad breath after a week of using brand X. I have used Crest for over forty years and nothing seems to be as good.</li>
            <li> I prefer the gel, instead of the paste...this is the paste, so be aware of what they tell you...&lt;br /&gt;Where can I find the gel...???</li>
            <li> I saw that this stuff fights tartar build-up and I just knew that I had to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves tartar sauce and I hate it.  It&#x27;s gross.  She always makes different recipes and has it fully stocked in the fridge.  So, I bought some of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came in the mail, I grabbed it and opened the fridge door.  What do you know, there&#x27;s 8 different containers of tartar sauce in there.  I take them all out of the fridge, open them all up, &amp; pop the top of my new tartar-fighting gel. I squeeze a healthy amount of this new gel into each tartar sauce container, mix it up, put them back in the fridge, and wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife comes home and does the usual, goes straight to the freezer to grab some fish sticks. She tosses them in the microwave and opens the fridge.  She stares at the tartar sauce collection and contemplates which one she&#x27;ll choose tonight.  15 minutes later, she&#x27;s made up her mind.  She goes with the white one.  She sits down, dips that first fish stick in, chews it for a bit and BLOOH, she spits it out!  My heart flutters.  She goes in for another, BLOOH, she spits that out too!  She goes to the fridge to try tartar sauce #2, BLOOH, spits that one out also!  I pull the tartar-fighting gel out of my pocket and kiss it; it may save my marriage after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She looks at me with a confusing love in her eyes for the first time in a decade and says, &amp;#34;honey, I don&#x27;t think I like tartar sauce anymore.&amp;#34;  I don&#x27;t know what to say.  I just look at her like the very first time I saw her from across that bingo hall, completely smitten.  She tosses each and every tartar sauce container in the trash.  We hug and renew our vows right then and there.  Going to sleep that night, I was constantly woken up by rodents knocking things over in hopes to get to that arsenal of tartar sauce in the trash can.  But you know what?  When I wasn&#x27;t awoken by the varmints, I was dreaming about both my loving wife and my Crest Complete Tartar Control Whitening Plus Scope Liquid Gel - Minty Fresh 4.6 Oz.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve always used Crest, but my husband hated tubes of toothpaste - too messy.  He loves this dispenser as it&#x27;s always clean and he can store it upside down so it&#x27;s always ready to squirt out.  It&#x27;s small enough for his travel kit and a very good price in groups of four.  He likes to peel off the label so it looks even cleaner.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews boast that bottled tooth paste is a great idea.  I think it&#x27;s good in theory, but the execution is somewhat lacking.  The packaging necessitates that it be more of a tooth syrup than a tooth paste.  It&#x27;s runny and can be a little bit messy.  it can be very difficult to get the product from the bottle.  I feel that there&#x27;s a lot wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste does have a nice, crisp flavor, but we&#x27;ll go back to arguing about squeezing from the middle or the bottom of the tube.</li>
            <li> Finally, a toothpaste I love with an easy to use bottle.</li>
            <li> They fit well, they feel good, nothing to catch/scratch/annoy, and the build and material seem to be of good quality.  I&#x27;m impressed with how fast these dry once damp/wet with sweat.  I bought this for travel in hot/humid locales like Thailand and the middle east.. and now I wear them all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It arrived in great condition and I love the fresh taste and how clean my teeth feel.  It is thinner than other pastes but I love that.  I don&#x27;t have to keep it upside down on the counter and have it seep all over the lid.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste.no complain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been compelled to write a review on toothpaste before. I love how this toothpaste can fit in such a small footprint inside my medicine cabinet. The nozzle also stays cleaner than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used because of the design. Besides that, the toothpaste seems to work in making my mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This container makes dispensing toothpaste so much easier than the tubes.  Less mess.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family uses this toothpaste exclusively for multiple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When moving our kids away from children&#x27;s toothpaste, we wanted something they could open themselves and the cap wouldn&#x27;t get lost.  This fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s not a thick substance.  So many toothpastes on the market are so thick and goopy, it&#x27;s actually hard getting it out of my teeth.  This is much thinner, but at the same time very effective at cleaning our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Logistically, it&#x27;s a nice small size, perfect for our small sized sink. No long tubes taking up too much space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just toothpaste - who really knows if it&#x27;s better than the competition.  But i don&#x27;t get cavities and my wife says my breath smells great (and that&#x27;s really the most important thing - right?)</li>
            <li> I order this product regularly...Less mess and much easier to dispense than a regular tube! Arrives quickly...Great item!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes good but it is very thin so I feel like it&#x27;s not doing the best job cleaning - I&#x27;ll stick to the more pastey brands.</li>
            <li> Most convenient design I&#x27;ve used.  No more struggling with squeezing a tube and takes up little counter space.</li>
            <li> Bought this first from a pharmacy on a whim whilst traveling in MA, and had run out of my little tubes from the dentist. It worked so well, and lasted so long I had to order the six-pack from Amazon. I believe it is designed to stand on its &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; so the toothpaste feeds the little nozzle immediately (little squeeze does it) so there is no mess and you can see how much is left, too. After brushing , I swish the remainder in my mouth with some warm water and get the cleanest teeth I&#x27;ve ever had AND a clean tasting mouth-all from this one product. A top-notch product in every respect.</li>
            <li> After thrying this product for the first time, I felt  the difference in how it deals with tarter.  It is a fine product in which I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Love it! Keeps the family from making a mess!</li>
            <li> Not very thick or minty felt like dollar store toothpaste</li>
            <li> For my own personal use I find this toothpaste just okay. It has a really thin consistency. I will say, I LOVE it in my (elementary aged) kids&#x27; bathroom because it&#x27;s easier to clean up because it&#x27;s not as thick and gooey as most kinds of paste.</li>
            <li> I tried every gadget to solve the messy toothpaste tube problem. Nothing really worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is top notch, it cleans and brightens your teeth while refreshing your breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the delivery system is great! One neat squeeze and just the right amount Crest Gel gets on your toothbrush. And the container stays clean and keeps its shape until the last squeeze is delivered.</li>
            <li> it works great and the price is right with prime shipping.  Showed up fast as always and I love the taste.  The bottle that stands up keeps my counter nice too :)</li>
