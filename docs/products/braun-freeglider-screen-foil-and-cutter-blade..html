            <li> Ok product when you need one but this last time I picked up a kit that supposedly sharpens your old blade setup. Its just a cream that goes on and does seem to work.But as far as these new units they are also A-OK</li>
            <li> Saw dramatic increase of shaving power. I reccommend changing yours out every 2 years. Mine was going on 4 years of use and was slacking off on neck grooves i read you need to switch out every year. i say go two years.. Anyways, its back to its old self.</li>
            <li> This is the second replacement we have ordered for this razor in the last 20+ years. So glad it is still available. Some things can be fixed instead of replaced!  Thank you Braun for the great service.</li>

            <li> My husband loves his free glider and was delighted that I was able to find a replacement foil and cutter blade for it. The product fits the razor and gives him a satisfyingly smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The Freeglider parts arrived on time as seller instructed they would and the parts worked perfectly in my old electric razor.

            <li> Great delivery time &amp; date, will NOT use ______ again, costs have become extortionate!</li>
            <li> I am a traditional Braun Customer and I need this for my shaver that I&#x27;m using. It&#x27;s a great product but again, you need to replace it every three or 4 months. More you use, it&#x27;ll get old.</li>
            <li> Beats making a special trip to the big box store and trying to find the right one.  My Braun shaves like new!</li>

            <li> Exactly what I was looking for with quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Mine was packaged in Japanese or Korean and mfc around 1999. That being said, it works flasslessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now know you supposed to replace this every 18 months. I think my last one lasted over 72 months ... oh well.</li>
