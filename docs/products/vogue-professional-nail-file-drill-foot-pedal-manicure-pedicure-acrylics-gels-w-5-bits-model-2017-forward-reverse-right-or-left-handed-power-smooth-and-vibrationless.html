            <li>That means it did not work smooth</li>
            <li>To start off I wasn&#x27;t impressed to find my package sitting on the steps in plain site!</li>
            <li>My wife is a nail tech and had bought this about a year ago and used it maybe 2 times a month as she was pregnant and then had a newborn to take care of.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment</li>

            <li>So far it is ok, but as the previous one that I got, it has inside the machine lose piece.</li>
            <li>I love it , I bought it for my toe nails as I cut mine real short and was unable to reach my two little one so this works out great.  </li>
            <li>I really love this small professional drill.</li>

            <li> I was looking for a heavy duty professional nail drill and after much research I chose this product.</li>
            <li> but then again it is not powerful and cannot be used as a professional machine.</li>
            <li> The pedal can not control the speed from slow to fast.</li>
            <li> It was suppose to be light weight hand piece, but it was very heavy too heavy for my little hand.</li>
            <li> But at least it have extra stuff for you to use</li>
            <li> Not good for techs that work ten hours a day.</li>
            <li> Not fun filing nails by hand!</li>
            <li> I got another one the motor burned up after just a few months.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for it because the drill I had purchased previously had already quit me!</li>
            <li> Machine sucks.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time but when I&#x27;d used it, it feel shaky</li>
            <li> not good.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with product.</li>
            <li> Product came in with broken case.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> this  was  very bad  work only 1 week</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m unable to return it.</li>
            <li> Warranty was disappointing had to pay $30 plus shipping just to send off product to get the machine covered.  </li>
            <li> would not recommend this product to anyone and feel bad for anyone who did purchase it because we paid $130 when we bought it and feel we got ripped off for the price to performance!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> My first one the opening where the cord goes came apart and so it kept shorting out.  I had to fight to get a replacement and Amazon did it not the dealer.  I got another one the motor burned up after just a few months.  These drills are garbage.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> not good. Some problem</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that drill gets extremely hot to the touch and just cool off frequently</li>
            <li> i havent even had it for a month and its already not working!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far it is ok, but as the previous one that I got, it has inside the machine lose piece. So far it is working.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my nail technician and it is the best drill she has ever used on me. She was very happy.</li>
            <li> To start off I wasn&#x27;t impressed to find my package sitting on the steps in plain site! I walked out the door to almost trip on it. Then I open the package to find it did not work! I was waiting for it because the drill I had purchased previously had already quit me! Now I&#x27;m out a drill for another week! Not fun filing nails by hand! So disappointed!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife is a nail tech and had bought this about a year ago and used it maybe 2 times a month as she was pregnant and then had a newborn to take care of. out of no where the machine got really hot even the handle like to hot to touch and now it won&#x27;t start at all!!!! it can&#x27;t be exchanged or replace because we no longer have the box! would not recommend this product to anyone and feel bad for anyone who did purchase it because we paid $130 when we bought it and feel we got ripped off for the price to performance!</li>
            <li> Was not happy with product. It was suppose to be light weight hand piece, but it was very heavy too heavy for my little hand. This hand piece will give you carpal tunnel in a heartbeat. Not good for techs that work ten hours a day.</li>
            <li> I love it I would buy another style and possibly a sleeker one. But for it to do what it does and the use it will get I am definitely getting another one.</li>
            <li> Product came in with broken case.  Machine only lasted a month.  Warranty was disappointing had to pay $30 plus shipping just to send off product to get the machine covered.  Poor quality. Machine sucks. DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this back in November 2014, I was so excited to try it. How embarrassing to say that I was at work when I tried this product out and it did not work. I won&#x27;t buy from here again. The box itself worked but the drill would not turn over.. Defected. Please try the product before selling it.</li>
            <li> Nooo good!!!! I😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡</li>
            <li> It was good and working fine when I first got it, after five weeks it just stop working. I taught I was getting a good product but this what happened to me and it made me shame. I wish I could get a refund but I have third party shipping and for that it&#x27;s not possible because it&#x27;s to costly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail machine in Feb but didn&#x27;t open it until last week. I plugged it in and the light comes on but the machine doesn&#x27;t work. The file doesn&#x27;t turn. Apparently I&#x27;m unable to return it. If anyone knows a trick to make it work, I would love to know.</li>
            <li> Great little machine....for normal and acrylic!!</li>
            <li> I like it.  I use for a dental lab.  Perfect to work on it can fit in my hand job holds with a padel control speeds.</li>
            <li> Ladies... This machine is hands down the BEST. Easy to use, quite, adjustable speed, worth every penny! Will always use Vogue Professional products.....</li>
            <li> This one is so so. That means it did not work smooth o my customer&#x27;s nails. Can I  give it back?</li>
            <li> I love this nai drill for the price its a goody!!</li>
            <li> I really love this small professional drill.</li>
            <li> Works really great. Really a must have if you like having your nails looking great. Highly recommend this product for professional or personal use.</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed,. I could not get it open to change the bits.And of course, there is no phone number to call to get support.&lt;br /&gt;Will be sending this back.</li>
            <li> this  was  very bad  work only 1 week</li>
            <li> The hand piece breaks from the back</li>
            <li> The pedal can not control the speed from slow to fast. But it is great for the price.</li>
            <li> did not operate at all. had to take extra time out of my busy day to return it.</li>
            <li> Does what I want, but had to buy seperate drill bits.</li>
            <li> I received the vogue professional nail drill and was so excited to start using it. I was looking for a heavy duty professional nail drill and after much research I chose this product. I opened the package and gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;First off the sander does not stay on the bit when filing. So that already is an issue. Second the machine has no power even at the highest speed. It does not do the job on acrylic nails. Than I attempted to use the bit the cleans under the acrylic nail and it did NADA because the machine has no power. Oh and I even took the sander off the bit and filed without it but still nothing. My hand filer that costed me $2did a better job.&lt;br /&gt;Now the plus part is that the machine does not vibrate nor is it loud but then again it is not powerful and cannot be used as a professional machine.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for what I needed! Now I&#x27;m able to do my nails at home and don&#x27;t need to spend the $$ by going to a nail salon every two weeks!</li>
            <li> The hand piece did not work! Had to send it back. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend</li>
            <li> When I got the machine it did not work at all. Was a big surprice for me.</li>
            <li> So far seems like a great product. hope all the reviews that said it stopped working after 4/5 weeks were inactuate.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product today, fun to use and very nice having the foot pedal.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!!!! Quick shipment</li>
            <li> I love it , I bought it for my toe nails as I cut mine real short and was unable to reach my two little one so this works out great.  I rate it a five star.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time but when I&#x27;d used it, it feel shaky and I have to turn almost to full maximize to actually to run it. But at least it have extra stuff for you to use</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It works just as i thought it would.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail file last week and it&#x27;s AMAZING!! I have a file I bought from my local professional nail supply store and it blew up twice! Wish I would have known about this one first! I highly recommend this to everyone! It also came super fast too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank, Nikki :)</li>
            <li> I love it so far. .. the color and everything. It works great. This is a good product. And the price is great</li>
            <li> This nail drill was very nice the only complaint I had was said the cord that connects the drill itself to the main body was loose when I received it this item  4 stars.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Never worked once. Shipped it back.</li>
            <li> it broke after a month of use</li>
            <li> Great for many things</li>
