            <li>This is a wonderful toothpaste without the fluoride is a big plus.  </li>

            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>; - Thank you :)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s all natural and good for your gums supposedly, but PerioBrite just doesn&#x27;t work to clean your teeth at all.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and are whiter!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great natural tooth paste ,since I have tried it I don&#x27;t use anything else ..</li>
            <li>This ttooh paste is very effective since it is made of natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very quick shopping.</li>
            <li>and I am told you are so easy</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste, makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>My gums are strong and mouth stay sfresh for longer time when used with perio mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>So far, so good :)  </li>
            <li>VERY fresh breath, strong flavor, their mouthwash is even stronger so watch out.</li>
            <li>otherwise i enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Great product I use in addition to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I originally started using Periobrite toothpaste at the request of my dentist .</li>
            <li>Mouth feels clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes my teeth feel really clean and has helped to brighten them as well.</li>
            <li>Wow, best nontoxic natural toothpaste I ever used - gets rid of plaque more effectively than any other.</li>
            <li>It leaves a clean mild taste.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the healthy ingredients, but I really don&#x27;t like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I must say the dentist and his deep cleaning probably had more to do with #3, but he told that I had very, very clean teeth.</li>
            <li>At my last dental appointment the dentist said my gums looked very healthy</li>
            <li>I have had dental issues and this product has made a huge impact  positively for me.  </li>
            <li>Great price, cheaper than my Health store, and received in a few days.</li>
            <li>I love this natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients  are good for tissues and antibacterial, and xylitol naturally busts biofilms created by pathogens.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Clean, refreshing, healthier alternative to corporate produced toothpaste loaded with stuff you don&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels cleaner and my breath stays pleasant much longer than any conventional tooth paste I have purchased.</li>
            <li>It is accurate that you only need a pea sized amount to clean well</li>
            <li>I recently started using this, and i like it more than Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me that I needed fluoride to fix decalcification spots on my teeth, last visit he told me they are getting better.  </li>
            <li>First toothpaste I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t cause my gums to get inflamed or cause allergy breakouts in my mouth, so</li>
            <li>so that helps counter the higher cost.</li>
            <li>My kids use it regularly and their mouth is healthy.</li>
            <li>Hubby and I are on our first tubes.</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted to try a new flouride free paste.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful about additives in most products that are labeled &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34; because I am highly reactive to so many additives.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums and have had good results with other brands, but didn&#x27;t like all of the chemicals listed on the ingredient label.</li>
            <li>Tastes weird but that feels like natural - a kind of feeling it does something good to your dental health.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many toothpaste and mouthwash products that promise to help dry mouth</li>
            <li>The price is quite reasonable, too.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much - a drop will do.</li>
            <li>and it goes straight into the trash can</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost 2 years and really like it.</li>
            <li>They really like it</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist yet, I do feel as though it&#x27;s better than traditional chemically loaded toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>At my parents house, they have soft well water, and it foams up very well.</li>
            <li>it really does whiten your teeth naturally</li>
            <li>Whitening seems gentle, no strong taste or flavor, seems more natural.</li>
            <li>These products are great for receding and sensitive gums &amp; teeth--better than any other sensitive brand toothpastes/ rinses that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see any direct benefit using it, though, compared to normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural toothpaste for a long time that worked and tasted just right, and this is it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for natural products for me and my home</li>
            <li>and it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>This paste is working very well in the short time I have been using it.</li>
            <li>store brand whitening a products including tooth pastes and mouth washes always make my teeth sensitive but Periobrite never does that</li>
            <li>I also use it on my 3yr old&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>, there is hardly anything to clean!</li>
            <li>A TV news anchor, when asked about her white teeth, said this is the toothpaste she uses and highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>The price is way too high for only 1 tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Am being asked to rate this product rather early since I have only had it for 9 days</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend people with sensitive teeth and gums to use this paste</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients were a selling point for me--specially since I have extensive allergies.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I originally started using Periobrite toothpaste at the request of my dentist . I purchased the toothpaste from my dentist ,with good results. When I ran out I ordered it from Amazon. I gave this product 4 stars because my dentist is seeing  an improvement in my dental health. I had to return the Periobrite back to Amazon because the toothpaste I ordered was defective , it was so hard it could not be squeezed out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I have been battling gum disease for quite some time and wanted something more holistic to treat my condition.  While I haven&#x27;t been back to the dentist yet, I do feel as though it&#x27;s better than traditional chemically loaded toothpastes.  My only grip is that it doesn&#x27;t foam that well, but that&#x27;s to be expected as there are no foaming agents in the product.  Overall I like this and will buy again.</li>
            <li> It is the best toothpaste I have found .</li>
            <li> I wish this was in every grocery store! Fluoride free! I recently started using this, and i like it more than Tom&#x27;s. I was having teeth issues, and with this, and their oral rinse [[ASIN:B000I4C22C Nature&#x27;s Answer Periowash Alcohol-free Mouthwash, Cool Mint, 16-Ounce]], it has definitely cleared up:&lt;br /&gt;1- bad breath&lt;br /&gt;2- dark lines just under the gum&lt;br /&gt;3- no more infection in my jaw&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I must say the dentist and his deep cleaning probably had more to do with #3, but he told that I had very, very clean teeth. Twice. just the gum line and below was the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can tell you that this definitely helped afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side, I have very hard water, so it doesn&#x27;t foam up very well. At my parents house, they have soft well water, and it foams up very well. Just something to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the up side, there is NO warning label cautioning you to call poison control if you swallow any. So just think about that.... It is safe!!!</li>
            <li> Great!  One f the few toothpastes on the market with trustable ingredients</li>
            <li> I love this natural toothpaste. It is definitely curative. I also use the Perio Rub which is almost miraculous as an herbal remedy for toothache. It&#x27;s well worth the investment to purchase both products. The price is quite reasonable, too.  I have to be careful about additives in most products that are labeled &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34; because I am highly reactive to so many additives. But I&#x27;ve had no allergic reaction/problems with PerioBrite toothpaste or PerioRub.  Bonus is that my order arrived quickly so service from this company is excellent. Thank you for these great products.</li>
            <li> Well, out of the many, many brands I have tried.  I have been looking for a natural toothpaste for a long time that worked and tasted just right, and this is it.  My dentist told me that I needed fluoride to fix decalcification spots on my teeth, last visit he told me they are getting better.  Here is the thing, I use nothing with fluoride in it anymore.  None in my toothpaste, none in my water, yet my teeth and gums are healthier than have been in the past.  I would like to attribute it to this toothpaste, but it would be hard to say for 100% it is because of the toothpaste.  Dry mouth at night has improved as well.  So in conclusion, this is the best toothpaste I have tried, and I have tried many, including the big brands.</li>
            <li> Seems to have helped breath problem.  Doesn&#x27;t whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> Ordered a two pack of the product and received a single tube.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement order was also incorrect. Returning both incorrect orders and buying product from WholeFoods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for natural products for me and my home and this is a toothpaste that I feel good about. A TV news anchor, when asked about her white teeth, said this is the toothpaste she uses and highly recommends it. I love the minty flavor and will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> VERY fresh breath, strong flavor, their mouthwash is even stronger so watch out. First toothpaste I&#x27;ve used that didn&#x27;t cause my gums to get inflamed or cause allergy breakouts in my mouth, so yay!</li>
            <li> I have been using this tooth paste for several years now, trying out the different flavors as well. And it took a little bit to get used to the taste, it quite as minty or powerful as conventional toothe paste. But it doesnt bother me at all. And yes it is brown, it does not bother me one bit. My mouth feels cleaner and my breath stays pleasant much longer than any conventional tooth paste I have purchased. I have recommended this to several people.</li>
            <li> Wow, best nontoxic natural toothpaste I ever used - gets rid of plaque more effectively than any other. No SLS, no flouride (flouride doesnt help enamel, bone broth does), no foaming or preservative agents, etc. The natural ingredients  are good for tissues and antibacterial, and xylitol naturally busts biofilms created by pathogens. My teeth are cleaner using this than with other conventional and organic toothpastes. (Use this only on humans... Not on your dog because xylitol is toxic to dogs but not humans.) Tastes nice too.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a pack of 2, but I only received 1. The price is way too high for only 1 tube of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste. Mouth feels clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s great to have a toothpaste free of chemicals and fluoride.  It cleans every bit as good as store brand toothpastes.  Win!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my teeth feel really clean and has helped to brighten them as well.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than Tom&#x27;s. It leaves a clean mild taste. I have only been using 8 days but my teeth are brighter which I did not expect. I mainly wanted to try a new flouride free paste. It is accurate that you only need a pea sized amount to clean well so that helps counter the higher cost. Great service from the seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Found the product by looking at a you tube make-up session.  Love the toothpaste and it is all natural.  I plan to purchase the mouthwash next.</li>
            <li> Am being asked to rate this product rather early since I have only had it for 9 days but it has, at this point, eliminated most of the discomfort I had previously experienced with my gums.</li>
            <li> My dentist was very happy that I had purchased this product to use between cleanings. It is definitely making a difference, and I will continue using it. Don&#x27;t use too much - a drop will do. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This paste is working very well in the short time I have been using it. Whitening seems gentle, no strong taste or flavor, seems more natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great natural tooth paste ,since I have tried it I don&#x27;t use anything else ..it really does whiten your teeth naturally it&#x27;s helped me with my gum issues too ..I love it but please remember you have to use More to get the desired result ..I buy from here or Swanson vitamins for a good price&lt;br /&gt;Other store brand whitening a products including tooth pastes and mouth washes always make my teeth sensitive but Periobrite never does that</li>
            <li> very quick shopping. Excellent toothpaste, we love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this toothpaste, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Clean, refreshing, healthier alternative to corporate produced toothpaste loaded with stuff you don&#x27;t need.  Nature&#x27;s Answer is the answer to my oral hygiene needs.  Brush happy!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  My holistic dentist recommends it.  It is great for your gums.  Glad to find it online.</li>
            <li> This remains my favorite toothpaste and I cannot think of a reason for changing to another product. Is this the best? Is this even an effective cleaner of teeth? How would I know? We are told [my cousin] John Brown did some particularly evil things. I believe those stories but I cannot &amp;#34;prove them&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Love the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this toothpaste.  I have had dental issues and this product has made a huge impact  positively for me.  My Dentist wanted to know what i&#x27;ve been using and I took the literature to him to review. He himself is now using this product and is also advising his patients to do the same.  I will never use anything else.  It is the best!!</li>
            <li> my favorite toothpaste. tastes good and is good for you, and your gums.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the healthy ingredients, but I really don&#x27;t like it a lot.  It&#x27;s kind of runny.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful toothpaste without the fluoride is a big plus.  I have been using this product for several years and every year my dentist praises the condition of my mouth.  There is no need trying to tell him that it is due to PerioBrite that does not contain fluoride because he will not listen.  Twice a year I get that sample toothpaste with fluoride and it goes straight into the trash can, I guess he thinks my teeth are in perfect condition based on the stuff he peddles, but not the case; all of my improvements came from using PerioBrite!!!!  I use all of their products and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I go in twice a year for cleanings and I am told you are so easy, there is hardly anything to clean!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to those of us wanting a natural, but effective toothpaste. I have sensitive teeth and gums and have had good results with other brands, but didn&#x27;t like all of the chemicals listed on the ingredient label. Nature&#x27;s Answer Periobrite Natural Toothpaste is truly an all natural product without those harsh toxic and chemicals. The taste is great also.</li>
            <li> Great product for improving the strength of your gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste, makes my mouth feel clean. The mint is &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; but not overpowering. It is VERY hard to squeeze it out of the tube, luckily you only need a pea sized amount. Hoping the next tube is a little easier to get out</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste. My kids use it regularly and their mouth is healthy.</li>
            <li> This ttooh paste is very effective since it is made of natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I could observe the difference since switching over. My gums are strong and mouth stay sfresh for longer time when used with perio mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;It does its job and doesnt lather as much as other chemical based toothpastes. I would definitely recommend people with sensitive teeth and gums to use this paste</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste for years.  Good for cleaning and gum care.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients were a selling point for me--specially since I have extensive allergies. I also use the PerioBrite mouthwash and am very pleased with that product also.  These products are great for receding and sensitive gums &amp; teeth--better than any other sensitive brand toothpastes/ rinses that I have tried in the past. At my last dental appointment the dentist said my gums looked very healthy and I had hardly any plaque build-up. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love it! My teeth feel clean and are whiter!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years and really like it. It helps a lot with periodontal disease. Will order again from here. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I love to use this herbal toothpaste. It cleans really well without all the nasty chemicals of conventional toothpaste. I also use it on my 3yr old&#x27;s teeth. I don&#x27;t feel bad when he swallows it because I know there is nothing in there that will harm him.</li>
            <li> i liked this. if you want your toothpaste to foam up like my wife; get something else. otherwise i enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Great product I use in addition to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this.  I even tried it 3 times thinking maybe my dislike was all in my head.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s a disgusting green-brown color, and I could get over that.  But, the thing is there&#x27;s no abrasive quality at all to it.  It&#x27;s like rubbing your teeth with slime.  It&#x27;s not removing tartar or any buildup from your teeth because it&#x27;s just a basic gel.  I promptly went back to Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil paste, and won&#x27;t be going back.  That&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s all natural and good for your gums supposedly, but PerioBrite just doesn&#x27;t work to clean your teeth at all.  Not impressed!</li>
            <li> Very good good combination of healthy ingredients ,( no fluoride of course,) I like the soft consistency, have tried other brands some too runny and some very thick. Great price, cheaper than my Health store, and received in a few days.</li>
            <li> I got this toothpaste for my grandchildren.  They really like it and I like what is not in it.  It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Tastes weird but that feels like natural - a kind of feeling it does something good to your dental health. I can&#x27;t see any direct benefit using it, though, compared to normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Over the years due to medications I have suffered from dry mouth. I&#x27;ve tried many toothpaste and mouthwash products that promise to help dry mouth but they were usually too expensive and more times than not didn&#x27;t work. Until I tried PerioBrite toothpaste and mouthwash and it is excellent. It doesn&#x27;t stop working like some dry mouth products and it seems the longer I use it the more effective it becomes. Once I ran out of PerioBrite and used another dry mouth toothpaste which immediately &#x27;dried out my mouth &#x27; and I was left with that terrible aftertaste. I&#x27;ve use PerioBrite for about 9 months now - I&#x27;m Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t know how, but it makes my teeth feel cleaner than any other natural toothpaste.  It has a great flavor too.</li>
            <li> So far, so good :)  There&#x27;s nothing not to like. Hubby and I are on our first tubes. I will update review if we see big changes. My teeth do seem a bit whiter! Nice not to have all the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; - Thank you :)</li>
