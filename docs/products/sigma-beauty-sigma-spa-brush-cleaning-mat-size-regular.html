            <li>Nothing special honestly.</li>
            <li>i love it... quicker clean.</li>
            <li>this mat is huge it barely fit in my bathroom sink</li>
            <li>This thing is huge and didn&#x27;t even fit into my sink.</li>
            <li>Never have I  been able to clean my brushes so quickly and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>There are easier and cheaper ways to clean makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Do you want to clean your brushes in a couple of seconds?  </li>
            <li>Clean brushes, no residue</li>
            <li>It is fast, easy, and my brushes have never been this clean!  </li>
            <li>Purchase this right now!</li>
            <li>but it was worth it</li>
            <li>Definitly recommend to everyone, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It cleans my brushes super fast!</li>
            <li>So much easier than using your hands to clean brushes.</li>
            <li>this is amazing, it took a long time to ship</li>
            <li>really does help clean the heck out of your brushes, I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to try it out.</li>
            <li>in all this is a great product to clean your brushes with, just not worth the price tag when compared to similar items on the market.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no messy clean up and does deep clean brushes.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even find a place to logically store it.</li>
            <li>I own about 36-40 brushes and this cuts my cleaning time down</li>
            <li>and my brushes are visibly much cleaner.</li>
            <li>could really just use one of those silicone baking gloves.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>It has similar textures, does pretty much the same job &amp; is like a huge fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>and it gets my brushes extra clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mat.</li>

            <li>She loves it and it&#x27;s the exact same as the one I got from the sigma website!</li>
            <li>product is a bit to large for my bathroom sink, which is standard size.</li>
            <li>What I do not like about this brush mat is the fact that you constantly have to rinse the mat off with a cup while cleaning it since it is so large and suctioned to the sink -- unless maybe you used this in the kitchen sink</li>
            <li>It helped deep clean my brushes once they dried they were like brand new.  </li>
            <li>And then when I really got to thinking about it, it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>

            <li> I recently purchased this brush mat directly from sigma&#x27;s website due to all the hype around it lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, I&#x27;m not as impressed with it as I was hoping to be. This is a great product, don&#x27;t get me wrong. It cleans wonderfully. However, I just think for the price point of this item compared to others that are similar it is not worth the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a bit to large for my bathroom sink, which is standard size. It does suction to the sink and stay in place the entire time you are cleaning. What I do not like about this brush mat is the fact that you constantly have to rinse the mat off with a cup while cleaning it since it is so large and suctioned to the sink -- unless maybe you used this in the kitchen sink were you have the little hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great product to clean your brushes with, just not worth the price tag when compared to similar items on the market.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE.  Can&#x27;t say it enough!</li>
            <li> This may is amazing! It cleans my brushes super fast!</li>
            <li> Update: In hindsight, this is not so great compared to the much easier use of Japonesque that uses the jar it comes in. I stopped using this mat after 3 uses and it just takes up space in a drawer.  Dropping stars.&lt;br /&gt;—</li>
            <li> this is amazing, it took a long time to ship but it was worth it, i use this once a week and it gets my brushes extra clean.</li>
            <li> Its ok for what it is. I didn&#x27;t find that it washes my brushes faster. Nothing special honestly.</li>
            <li> i love it... quicker clean.</li>
            <li> a Must for my makeup brushes!! absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Love my Sigma Spa Brush Cleaning Mat. It does actually what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> Sucks.Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> this mat is huge it barely fit in my bathroom sink but i made it work really does help clean the heck out of your brushes, I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to try it out.</li>
            <li> Best cleaning idea for brushes ever</li>
            <li> This has been the best thing ever for my make up brushes!! As soon as I began cleaning them they snapped right back into shape. I highly recommend this mat.</li>
            <li> This mat makes cleaning makeup brushes easier!</li>
            <li> havent usd it but seems like a excellent product.  I had ordered it from the website Sigma, but it took ten days to even get a &amp;#34;we are working on your order&amp;#34;.  I got it in two days through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This thing is huge and didn&#x27;t even fit into my sink. I couldn&#x27;t even find a place to logically store it. And then when I really got to thinking about it, it&#x27;s not worth the price. There are easier and cheaper ways to clean makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Ordered one for my mom from Amazon. She loves it and it&#x27;s the exact same as the one I got from the sigma website! Great product, makes cleaning brushes extremely easy and saves time.</li>
            <li> Love it! So much easier than using your hands to clean brushes. Works good at getting even the dirtiest brushes clean.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Beyond expectations!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Amazon because it was sold out on the Sigma website. I immediately cleaned all my brushed using this mat and the beauty blender cleaner. They look renewed!</li>
            <li> This is really nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Do you want to clean your brushes in a couple of seconds?  Purchase this right now! It&#x27;s efficient and gets all the gunk out of your brushes.  Especially the foundation kabuki brushes.  I will not use anything else but this!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no messy clean up and does deep clean brushes.</li>
            <li> Clean brushes, no residue</li>
            <li> Great product!  It helped deep clean my brushes once they dried they were like brand new.  Definitly recommend to everyone, it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I own about 36-40 brushes and this cuts my cleaning time down and my brushes are visibly much cleaner. I am in love with all my sigma products and this one is no exception</li>
            <li> Just as described. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Never have I  been able to clean my brushes so quickly and efficiently.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> A gift to estitician. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Really expensive for what you get!&lt;br /&gt;I like this for what it is, but definitely not worth the hefty price point.&lt;br /&gt;You could really just use one of those silicone baking gloves. It has similar textures, does pretty much the same job &amp; is like a huge fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I am sure there are probably cheaper products out there for cleaning make up brushes, but I am so happy with this one that I don&#x27;t even really care.  It is fast, easy, and my brushes have never been this clean!  The time it takes to clean my brushes has to have been reduced by at least half.  I&#x27;ve never actually timed it so don&#x27;t hold me to that.  All I know is that I am finishing faster and getting my brushes cleaner than just using my fingers. I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Not the quality I expected, and I  ought 2 of them.</li>
