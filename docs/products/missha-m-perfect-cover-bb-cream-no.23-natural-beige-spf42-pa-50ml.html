            <li>Nice coverage.  </li>
            <li>but i do have to go over my imperfections with a concealer if i really want to look flawless</li>

            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>It sits better on the face as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more...</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>combination skin and the Perfect Cover is the only BB that doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my thirties and most products irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even need to wear any foundation or powder on top of it.</li>
            <li>i totally love this bb 1st</li>
            <li>and im not talking about the healthy dewy look</li>
            <li>Currently satisfied.</li>
            <li>more - please don&#x27;t add more.  </li>
            <li>this is one of the more perfumed products I&#x27;ve used,  so bear that in mind.&lt;br</li>
            <li>makes my face more oily.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use this daily &amp; re order when I need more!</li>
            <li>first time ever get a good foundation with spa 42</li>
            <li>At first the application seemed too light on my skin but after a while it really did match my skin tone perfectly so</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell that good, has a strong perfume scent that I don&#x27;t prefer but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>To help other people, I&#x27;m an nw 20 at Mac, and the number 23 was perfect.</li>
            <li>Has this really strong smell.</li>
            <li>Looks slightly greyish going on, but adapts to a medium-light skintone perfectly.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a really great BB cream because it lasts literally all day and comes with quite a lot</li>
            <li>While it is light, it still evens out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Provides good coverage and leaves a natural look, it does have a bit of grayish undertone.</li>
            <li>I originally tried number 21 and was too light.</li>
            <li>I am fair with blue eyes but tan easily.</li>
            <li>Great product, I prefer it over the hot pink BB cream, because it&#x27;s more my shade.</li>
            <li>It is a nice consistency, more like makeup than the other bb creams I have used and the best part is it doesn&#x27;t have that odd sun screen smell to it.</li>
            <li>the color is perfect for my skin tone it looks so natural in all type of light (sun, room, camera) is lightweight, i have proacne skin and also dry patches around my nose and mouth</li>
            <li>Just like real foundation, but better feeling.</li>
            <li>but if I waith a little it blend in to my skin color realy good Irecomend this produnt!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so quick to apply</li>
            <li>Its strengths are the high spf &amp; the cream makes your skin look better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re oily you should get a good 5-6 hours,  if you&#x27;re dry or combo,  you&#x27;ll get a lot longer if you&#x27;ve primed</li>
            <li>Anyway Missha has no annoying smell and covers very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not oily and it covers very well.</li>
            <li>Good product, fast delivery, just like last purchase!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll set it with a powder, but most days, I don&#x27;t for a more natural, bare faced look.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s right price ..</li>
            <li>Best to use a little as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I use my fingers for application and a bit of blending (I&#x27;m such a rebel),  and a concealer brush to just to make sure I&#x27;m not streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>important point for sensitive folk:  </li>
            <li>gotten compliments from the first day.&lt;br /&gt;Dot</li>
            <li>Ofcourse at first, I cannot seem to adjust on the greyish color but as days goes by I learned that it needed some time to settle on your face before you can see the real effect.  </li>
            <li>Have used for a few weeks and am still very satisfied.</li>
            <li>but nothing had really worked for me.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I really noticed is that it stays a lot longer if you prime your face before your application.</li>
            <li>How well the spf works... dont really know.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tested it yet.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t prep your skin too much.  </li>
            <li>This product exceeded my expectations just because other bb creams have made me more oily/shiny throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This is my very first Asian BB cream</li>
            <li>I also like how it has a high spf</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horribly noticeable but it does make my skin look a little lighter and grayer than the rest of my body for about 3 hours</li>
            <li>Package arrived in time so no complaint there.</li>
            <li>Doesnt feel thick or cakey, and it blends nice with my skin.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is a true beige with no pink or yellow tones.</li>
            <li>It gives you a very natural look</li>
            <li>Also at first, I tried using a beauty blender to apply but later on</li>
            <li>It look so natural as well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive,</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of the cream and overall like the product!</li>
            <li>It is the best liquid base I&#x27;ve used in years.</li>
            <li>and I did have some issues at first;  even with moisturizer and primer,  it still dried very cakey.  </li>
            <li>Finally found the right color after three tries.</li>
            <li>It improves my skin tone by covering blotches, controls the oily parts of my skin, and has improved the condition of my skin in general.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea why other bb creams have a strange ( not necessarily unpleasant</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like other products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I&#x27;ve tried. Looks slightly greyish going on, but adapts to a medium-light skintone perfectly. Awesome coverage makes needing foundation optional. Lasts a very long time. It is the best liquid base I&#x27;ve used in years.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.  great shade of color and blends in well.</li>
            <li> Has this really strong smell. And the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Best BB cream out there.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  I don&#x27;t want them to go out of stock.</li>
            <li> I like the product itself, but one thing which prevents me from using as often as I&#x27;d like to is that there&#x27;s a grey-ish outcome once it&#x27;s all set which puts me off. If you don&#x27;t mind a slightly grey face then i&#x27;d definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect match for my skin. Feels great. Doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin. Nice healthy look.</li>
            <li> Best make up I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> This is my very first Asian BB cream and I love it!. I had tried western BB cream but nothing had really worked for me. As a lot of people say on their reviews, western BB creams are just tinted moisturizer. Ofcourse at first, I cannot seem to adjust on the greyish color but as days goes by I learned that it needed some time to settle on your face before you can see the real effect.  Also at first, I tried using a beauty blender to apply but later on I realized I didn&#x27;t need it since it blends well with your fingers better. The one thing that I really noticed is that it stays a lot longer if you prime your face before your application. I have combination skin although very dry in the winter. And ladies, on  the side note, whatever you put on your face, it all boils down to skin care/cleaning your face after all day wearing make up.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage and not patchy. Best to use a little as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Finally found the right color after three tries.</li>
            <li> Love love love it it&#x27;s perfect I&#x27;m gonna order again and tell to my friends about this product first time ever get a good foundation with spa 42 and it&#x27;s right price ..</li>
            <li> loved it, will reorder</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often wear foundation but someone on FB posted about it so I ordered it. I like it a lot. Doesnt feel thick or cakey, and it blends nice with my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use this daily &amp; re order when I need more! Very happy with this foundation!</li>
            <li> Bought this based on the reviews and am very pleased with the bb cream. It is a nice consistency, more like makeup than the other bb creams I have used and the best part is it doesn&#x27;t have that odd sun screen smell to it. I have no idea why other bb creams have a strange ( not necessarily unpleasant) smell that come about when you are outdoors wearing it..?? Anyway Missha has no annoying smell and covers very well. I also like that it is a true beige with no pink or yellow tones. I am fair with blue eyes but tan easily. Number 23 is perfect for me for the winter months and have bought #27 for the summer. I bought the samples offered on Amazon and that helped greatly. Have used for a few weeks and am still very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Really nice BB cream. It&#x27;s light but has good coverage and settles nicely onto your skin. I also like how it has a high spf so I can just put this on and not worry about applying sunscreen on my face as well and it&#x27;s so quick to apply, it takes me one minute to apply with my fingers if I&#x27;m in a hurry. The only con about it is that it tends to give a slight grey cast. It&#x27;s not horribly noticeable but it does make my skin look a little lighter and grayer than the rest of my body for about 3 hours and then it goes away. Overall, it&#x27;s a really great BB cream because it lasts literally all day and comes with quite a lot so I will be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
            <li> Just like real foundation, but better feeling. It sits better on the face as well. I don&#x27;t feel it there.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing .. will be purchasing this stuff again</li>
            <li> Amazing product, delivered on time. Prefect for day time. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more...</li>
            <li> Great product, I prefer it over the hot pink BB cream, because it&#x27;s more my shade. It&#x27;s also less thick and pigmented than the lioele beyond the solution creams.</li>
            <li> Love this bb cream! Gives great ceverage and lasts all day.  Will order this again.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage.  I bought it for the spf.  How well the spf works... dont really know. I haven&#x27;t really tested it yet. Doesnt cause my face to break out.</li>
            <li> Love this. After 6 hours, the application still looks good on my face. It look so natural as well.</li>
            <li> Very good coverage, feels great on face. Good for use if you don&#x27;t plan on sweating. My face is combo leaning towards oily. This is a bit too moisturizing for my face. If you were to use a  setting powder you probably won&#x27;t have a problem. I work in a very warm environment and this does clog my pores whenever I sweat so it&#x27;s more of a great go to makeup for weekends.</li>
            <li> Love this product ! :) Best BB cream ever!</li>
            <li> This has become the only BB cream I use.  I have sensitive, combination skin and the Perfect Cover is the only BB that doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout.  I&#x27;m in my thirties and most products irritate my skin.  Missha is wonderful.  It improves my skin tone by covering blotches, controls the oily parts of my skin, and has improved the condition of my skin in general.  It is now the only product I use on my face during the day.  No foundation for me.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll set it with a powder, but most days, I don&#x27;t for a more natural, bare faced look.  I&#x27;ve tried many BB creams and Missha Perfect cover is the one for me!  I&#x27;ve used it daily for the past year and have no intention of switching to anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s light, not oily and it covers very well. It gives you a very natural look and I don&#x27;t even need to wear any foundation or powder on top of it.</li>
            <li> i totally love this bb 1st the color is perfect for my skin tone it looks so natural in all type of light (sun, room, camera) is lightweight, i have proacne skin and also dry patches around my nose and mouth and this didnt break me out at all i tried out several bb creams a lot of korean ones were too light for me and leaves a white cast that looks awful in pictures and american bbs were super oily that makes look so shine and im not talking about the healthy dewy look</li>
            <li> this caused an allergic reaction and I got a rash on my face, the product was very thick for a cc cream, color was strange, it also has a whitning agent in it, do we want white skin or glowing natural color???  I am sending back, hope I don&#x27;t get hassled.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that good, has a strong perfume scent that I don&#x27;t prefer but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. The coverage is good, but for my combination skin, it can get oily throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t settle into my pores, which I like. For the cost, it is a good product!</li>
            <li> Wrong color have to daughter</li>
            <li> Package arrived in time so no complaint there. Product was well taken care of inside the package. Found a little note from the senders which I thought was neat. Now to the product... At first the application seemed too light on my skin but after a while it really did match my skin tone perfectly so don&#x27;t worry if it looks a little grey-ish or pink-ish. I really like the smell of the cream and overall like the product! Currently satisfied.</li>
            <li> glides on the skin perfectly, moisturizing, has a nice smell (if you don&#x27;t like fragrance, i do keep smelling it when i have it on for 10-15 minutes), i would say medium coverage but i do have to go over my imperfections with a concealer if i really want to look flawless</li>
            <li> While it is light, it still evens out my skin tone.  I need no foundation or powder when I use this.  However, I do still need to use under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a month now and I did have some issues at first;  even with moisturizer and primer,  it still dried very cakey.  Now that I&#x27;ve perfected my skincare routine for this product,  #23 is just a great product for me.  I know others have had issues with dryness and/or cakeyness and/or &amp;#34;grey&amp;#34; toned skin,  so I figured I&#x27;d give a couple of hints.  As a reference point,  I&#x27;m NW20 and NC25 in MAC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re oily:  don&#x27;t prep your skin too much.  This formula moisturizes on its own.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re dry:  moisturize!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re normal or combination:  common sense tells us to moisturize the dry bits alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pump some out,  and apply it to your skin.  I use my fingers for application and a bit of blending (I&#x27;m such a rebel),  and a concealer brush to just to make sure I&#x27;m not streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the shade looks grey,  give it 10 minutes or so.  It will adapt.  Don&#x27;t add more - please don&#x27;t add more.  If you&#x27;re still not happy with it,  wash it off and try again the next day.  The truth is that this cream is just not going to work for some people unless they use a bunch of other products and that sort of defeats the object.  If this includes you,  call it a lesson learned - at least you know that you won&#x27;t use it,  right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you&#x27;re good with the final-ish shade,  set it with translucent powder (or not at all - it&#x27;s up to you).  If you&#x27;re oily you should get a good 5-6 hours,  if you&#x27;re dry or combo,  you&#x27;ll get a lot longer if you&#x27;ve primed first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important point for sensitive folk:  this is one of the more perfumed products I&#x27;ve used,  so bear that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately this is an excellent product for some people (I&#x27;m one),  but it&#x27;s not going to be a &amp;#34;everyone can wear it&amp;#34;  product.  I&#x27;m going to keep buying and buying though - it has become one of my Holy Grails.</li>
            <li> I like the cover for a bb cream I have the #23 is a little t dark for me but if I waith a little it blend in to my skin color realy good Irecomend this produnt!</li>
            <li> makes my face more oily. and it has like gray undertone and feels heavy on my face</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations just because other bb creams have made me more oily/shiny throughout the day. Does apply on a bit gray initially but smooths out the complexion and hides pores well!</li>

            <li> I love this stuff. To help other people, I&#x27;m an nw 20 at Mac, and the number 23 was perfect. I originally tried number 21 and was too light. So yeah, hope that helps!</li>
            <li> I bought this BB cream monthes before, i acctually just used it 3 or 4 times, i don&#x27;t like it at all!  my skin tone looks terrible when i put it on and also it made me break out! i tried to return, but the owner in Korea didn&#x27;t accept return, now it&#x27;s been sitting in my drawer for monthes, someday it would go into my trash bag i&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> Good product, fast delivery, just like last purchase!</li>
            <li> Provides good coverage and leaves a natural look, it does have a bit of grayish undertone.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 years now and nothing compares. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy like other products. Will continue to purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> Do not waste time or money on any other BB cream.  My face/make-up has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;Have gotten compliments from the first day.&lt;br /&gt;Dot it on....blend.  (it will look grayish...dont worry...blend well)&lt;br /&gt;Wait about 5 minutes to let it settle.&lt;br /&gt;Continue with the rest of your routine.</li>
            <li> This product is nice but not my favorite BB cream. It&#x27;s def a good quality item &amp; prob good for those of fairer skin. Its strengths are the high spf &amp; the cream makes your skin look better as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Perfect match for skin tone. A little thick.</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller.</li>
