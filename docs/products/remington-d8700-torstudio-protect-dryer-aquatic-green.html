            <li>Honestly, when I finished using this dryer, my hair had zero frizz</li>
            <li>The free brush is very nice, so says my spouse.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice blow dryer and if it holds up as well as an older Remington model we&#x27;ve had for years, we&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li>has a nice sleek design, and the attachments are large, so this is great if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>far we are pleased with the product and recommend it highly as an excellent value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight which is an added bonus when you&#x27;re blow drying your hair.</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t snag hair and has a large bristle pad for great coverage.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend it any more.  </li>
            <li>The Remington D8700 fits great in my hands and feels like a solid dryer with good material (it&#x27;s still mostly plastic).</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Remington has been getting better with their hair styling products</li>
            <li>We have used the hair concentrator which makes this even more efficient in straightening out hair and taking out the frizzies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where the lower heat settings are really enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>and if I can handle the blow dryer, I think most adults would have no difficulty.  </li>
            <li>Love the hairbrush that came with it too..</li>
            <li>I love the brush that was included.</li>
            <li>It works great with the medium and high heat.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair more quickly than most hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>This 1875 Watt hair dryer dries my medium length (and medium texture) hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be a very good dryer, and one we will use for a long time.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer has an Advanced Motor of 1875 watts, 3 Heat and Cool settings, plus 2 Speed, and an Exclusive - conditioning ring, to promote strong and healthy hair.</li>
            <li>The design makes it light weight, easy to use and handle for the layperson.</li>
            <li>The review is accurate and honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the rest of it she is very well pleased; it is the most advanced hair dryer she has ever tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this blow dryer a few times now and am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>It also includes interchangeable nozzles that are very useful and convenient for styling and straightening.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a nice general brush and a couple attachments to allow more control of the styling process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unique to it are the conditioning rings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the relatively large size in comparison to most blow dryers, this one is surprisingly light.  </li>
            <li>Nothing fancy here, but it&#x27;s a good little dryer with a handy conditioning option.</li>
            <li>special Bonus is that a Micro-Conditioning Hairbrush is also included.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This hair dryer has two speed settings, three heat settings, and a cool blast button.</li>
            <li>I like the cool shot feature but</li>
            <li>It has two speeds and three heat settings, along with a cool shot.  </li>
            <li>Conditioning ring does seem to help keep frizz and static at bay while drying my hair fast.  </li>
            <li>Three heat settings, a cool blast, and two speed settings.</li>
            <li>Another cool thing -</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and very straight, so this is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>I like the concentrator attachment since it dries my hair to quickly.</li>
            <li>Two speeds and two heat settings are adequate for us.</li>
            <li>As such, I was pleased to be able to try the Remington</li>
            <li>I love the results of the conditioning ring and highly recommend indulging in it.</li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be honest and say I only use one and that is the highest setting.</li>
            <li>This one comes with a conditioning ring (don&#x27;t know if that made a difference at all) and a nice big diffuser that also screwed onto the front nozzle of the dryer (has a neat interlocking screw mechanism).</li>
            <li>The features are consistent with any other good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It comes with a diffuser, brush (a very nice heavy one!), and concentrator.</li>
            <li>I am able to dry my full head in 12min.</li>
            <li>This Remmington dryer dries my hair very fast.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I don&#x27;t use these attachments often so the fact that they fall off rather easily doesn&#x27;t really impact my daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I already have the T studio ionic flat iron and of course ionic round brush:)&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is great!</li>
            <li>There are multiple settings on the dryer giving you more options for styling.</li>
            <li>It is pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair frizz free and soft.  </li>
            <li>We love to have a smaller blower</li>
            <li>The hair dryer by itself is pretty well designed and leaves hair shiny and sleek, with no breakage.  </li>
            <li>We cannot completely say that the presence of ceramic has made a significant difference in the efficiency of drying and styling time.  </li>
            <li>I was able to dry my hair very fast using the higher heat setting, something I would have never attempted before.</li>
            <li>Even at the highest setting, my scalp doesn&#x27;t get too hot, but I really like the cooler settings.</li>
            <li>I found that the large mouth on the dryer is good for round brush styling, not so much for straight directed style, but this is what I was looking for in it.</li>
            <li>It is of professional quality - but, very easy to use and understand how to do various things with it.</li>
            <li>I use the bulky 3M removable clips on my wall and the hanging loop is wide enough to accommodate this hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser and concentrator are made of a light green plastic - this color isn&#x27;t very attractive.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry brittle hair â€“ maybe your results will be more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another convenience is that the back of the dryer pops off for easy cleaning of the filter.  </li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t be deterred by the large size unless storage space is an issue.  </li>
            <li>Even in the lower heat settings, my hair seemed to dry fairly fast, but more importantly, it seemed softer and more easily styled with a round brush than with my other blow dryers.  </li>
            <li>I know this is a free Vines item, but I&#x27;ve been as objective as I can.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking very silky and shiny like a salon style.  </li>
            <li>I really like the color and sleek design to this.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t notice any difference with the &amp;#34;Conditioning Technology.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>We really like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The Ionic Ceramic Technology dries hair fast while protecting it from damage.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight, but made well.  </li>
            <li>and my waves were still intact thanks to the diffuser.</li>
            <li>There is a conditioning ring that is included but time will tell how much that helps....</li>
            <li>When the weather gets this hot and humid in the summer, it seems I get warm and sweaty when blowing my hair dry, even in central air.  </li>
            <li>I was told this one is to stay in our bathroom and not go into the kids or main bathroom because my wife likes it that much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a better than average hair dryer despite the issues with the attachments.  </li>
            <li>You simply twist this ring onto the nozzle where the hot air blows out (you could easily take this on and off â€“ I choose to simply leave mine on all the time</li>
            <li>Does a good job as quickly drying my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer has a 3-heat setting (high, medium, and cool) and 2 speed setting (high and low).  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair smoother and less frizzy and what is interesting is that this dryer comes with a ring infused with argan oil and macadamia oil that attaches to the blower.  </li>
            <li>I was replacing an older hairdryer</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m mainly fond of its size and handle.</li>
            <li>I should also note that the High heat setting doesn&#x27;t feel like it is scorching your scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is rather large but not heavy.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see much effect at this time compared to directly applying the oil with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am not one for the add on tools-I wish I had hair that could benefit from the &amp;#34;conditioning ring&amp;#34; my hair is naturally curly and my hair dryer helps me to slay the curls into straight submission!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>so I donâ€™t lose it) and use your dryer like normal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Blower looks nice, a complete departure from our usual purple rounded blower that we have been using for 2 years now.  </li>
            <li>I could not find any replacements for sale, perhaps because this is still a fairly new product and the replacements are just not yet on the market.</li>
            <li>The diffuser helps her dry quickly...</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this dryer!</li>
            <li>Although Iâ€™m not noticing a huge positive with this technology â€“ of equal importance, Iâ€™m also not achieving a hair style that is too soft (due to OVER conditioning).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Remington hair dryers over the course of my life and while this isn&#x27;t my favorite, it&#x27;s still a quite decent little hair dryer</li>
            <li>Our Old dryer only has 2 settings and I don&#x27;t want to use the hot setting for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Usually use the hottest of the three heat level the most and the cool down set for a minute.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s much smaller and started to put out very high heat without any cooler options.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the professional hair dryers used in salons.</li>
            <li>I will say that it is quieter than our old one</li>
            <li>So far, it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li>The hanging loop is much appreciated, and I hope it doesn&#x27;t break like the last one did.</li>
            <li>really like the product overall.</li>
            <li>(my prior hair brushes merely snapped into place - this option seemed a lot more secure).  </li>
            <li>It is not too loud and I like the color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>daughter is almost 14 years old and has curly----very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>but it is early to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; shot (and cool setting) is not quite as cool as some of my prior hair dryers and it also takes a few seconds longer to actually produce the cooler temperature.  </li>
            <li>Having different options makes it easy for multiple household members to use the same hair dryer for different styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color of the dryer is silver and metallic green - it&#x27;s sleek looking and light weight (only weighs in around 20-21 ounces).  </li>
            <li>what I love is that it&#x27;s instant true cold air.</li>
            <li>The volume when in operation is fairly moderate - nothing as loud as you might think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For regular usage she likes the ability to adjust speeds and heat settings...in other words, less heat regularly and more</li>
            <li>I use it without any attachments and it dries my thick hair fairly quickly, three minutes -- maybe?</li>

            <li> We cannot completely say that the presence of ceramic has made a significant difference in the efficiency of drying and styling time.  </li>
            <li> I was able to dry my hair very fast using the higher heat setting, something I would have never attempted before.</li>
            <li> Even at the highest setting, my scalp doesn&#x27;t get too hot, but I really like the cooler settings.</li>
            <li> I found that the large mouth on the dryer is good for round brush styling, not so much for straight directed style, but this is what I was looking for in it.</li>
            <li> It is of professional quality - but, very easy to use and understand how to do various things with it.</li>
            <li> I use the bulky 3M removable clips on my wall and the hanging loop is wide enough to accommodate this hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser and concentrator are made of a light green plastic - this color isn&#x27;t very attractive.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry brittle hair â€“ maybe your results will be more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another convenience is that the back of the dryer pops off for easy cleaning of the filter.  </li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t be deterred by the large size unless storage space is an issue.  </li>
            <li> Even in the lower heat settings, my hair seemed to dry fairly fast, but more importantly, it seemed softer and more easily styled with a round brush than with my other blow dryers.  </li>
            <li> I know this is a free Vines item, but I&#x27;ve been as objective as I can.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking very silky and shiny like a salon style.  </li>
            <li> I really like the color and sleek design to this.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t notice any difference with the &amp;#34;Conditioning Technology.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> We really like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The Ionic Ceramic Technology dries hair fast while protecting it from damage.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight, but made well.  </li>
            <li> and my waves were still intact thanks to the diffuser.</li>
            <li> There is a conditioning ring that is included but time will tell how much that helps....</li>
            <li> When the weather gets this hot and humid in the summer, it seems I get warm and sweaty when blowing my hair dry, even in central air.  </li>
            <li> I was told this one is to stay in our bathroom and not go into the kids or main bathroom because my wife likes it that much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a better than average hair dryer despite the issues with the attachments.  </li>
            <li> You simply twist this ring onto the nozzle where the hot air blows out (you could easily take this on and off â€“ I choose to simply leave mine on all the time</li>
            <li> Does a good job as quickly drying my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer has a 3-heat setting (high, medium, and cool) and 2 speed setting (high and low).  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair smoother and less frizzy and what is interesting is that this dryer comes with a ring infused with argan oil and macadamia oil that attaches to the blower.  </li>
            <li> I was replacing an older hairdryer</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m mainly fond of its size and handle.</li>
            <li> I should also note that the High heat setting doesn&#x27;t feel like it is scorching your scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is rather large but not heavy.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see much effect at this time compared to directly applying the oil with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am not one for the add on tools-I wish I had hair that could benefit from the &amp;#34;conditioning ring&amp;#34; my hair is naturally curly and my hair dryer helps me to slay the curls into straight submission!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> so I donâ€™t lose it) and use your dryer like normal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Blower looks nice, a complete departure from our usual purple rounded blower that we have been using for 2 years now.  </li>
            <li> I could not find any replacements for sale, perhaps because this is still a fairly new product and the replacements are just not yet on the market.</li>
            <li> The diffuser helps her dry quickly...</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this dryer!</li>
            <li> Although Iâ€™m not noticing a huge positive with this technology â€“ of equal importance, Iâ€™m also not achieving a hair style that is too soft (due to OVER conditioning).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Remington hair dryers over the course of my life and while this isn&#x27;t my favorite, it&#x27;s still a quite decent little hair dryer</li>
            <li> Our Old dryer only has 2 settings and I don&#x27;t want to use the hot setting for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually use the hottest of the three heat level the most and the cool down set for a minute.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s much smaller and started to put out very high heat without any cooler options.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the professional hair dryers used in salons.</li>
            <li> I will say that it is quieter than our old one</li>
            <li> So far, it hasn&#x27;t been an issue.</li>
            <li> The hanging loop is much appreciated, and I hope it doesn&#x27;t break like the last one did.</li>
            <li> really like the product overall.</li>
            <li> (my prior hair brushes merely snapped into place - this option seemed a lot more secure).  </li>
            <li> It is not too loud and I like the color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> daughter is almost 14 years old and has curly----very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> but it is early to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; shot (and cool setting) is not quite as cool as some of my prior hair dryers and it also takes a few seconds longer to actually produce the cooler temperature.  </li>
            <li> Having different options makes it easy for multiple household members to use the same hair dryer for different styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color of the dryer is silver and metallic green - it&#x27;s sleek looking and light weight (only weighs in around 20-21 ounces).  </li>
            <li> what I love is that it&#x27;s instant true cold air.</li>
            <li> The volume when in operation is fairly moderate - nothing as loud as you might think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For regular usage she likes the ability to adjust speeds and heat settings...in other words, less heat regularly and more</li>
            <li> I use it without any attachments and it dries my thick hair fairly quickly, three minutes -- maybe?</li>
            <li> The conditioning ring contains oils that are apparently designed to be released as micro-conditioners to keep your hair conditioned as you dry it, i.e., to reduce dryness and frizziness.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how much help it is</li>
            <li> is my new everyday dryer</li>
            <li> Those, according to their promotional material, \\&quot;are infused with macadamia oil, releasing micro-conditioners through the dryer air to penetrate and moisturize your hair.\\&quot; What this means essentially is it dries your hair yet doesn&#x27;t dry it</li>
            <li> My prior Remingtons have lasted at least 4-years (with daily use) before I selected a new one.  </li>
            <li> At least the middle setting feels fine - not too hot and not to cold.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it for anyone not sure what to get, it meets all of the basic needs and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to release &amp;#34;micro-conditioners&amp;#34; as you blow dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter than my wife&#x27;s previous Remington but makes about the same amount of noise.  </li>
            <li> little feature that I find handy is the little hook at the base of the handle near the cord, which allows you to hang it on a hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> I see absolutely no effect from that and can&#x27;t imagine that there is one.  </li>
            <li> I think it must be the ceramic technology because my other dryers don&#x27;t compare when it comes to style and shine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Remington hair dryers and I consider them to be reliable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the other features, so</li>
            <li> The conditioning ring is interesting, but after washing and conditioning my hair, I hate to blow additional stuff on it.</li>
            <li> especially because she has thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> one downside is that it runs a little louder than my other dryers have.</li>
            <li> and I can tell it uses less power.</li>
            <li> No matter what I did it seemed like my hair came out a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick hair and this dryer dries it in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> There are a few level selections and heat options.</li>
            <li> Comes with a hanging cord and a few accessories which work well.</li>
            <li> Having said that, it does still lock in my style with use of a round brush.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> She tends to spend a lot of time swimming in the summer months and that leads her hair down a path which makes it hard for her to manage.  </li>
            <li> Feels very expensive in your hands like you are at a high class salon.</li>
            <li> Between having small hands</li>
            <li> Often my reason for upgrading to a new one is mainly due to the cruddy appearance the hair dryer begins to take on through the years due to</li>
            <li> I have (Caucasian) thin, color treated (due to gray) shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only two settings, which is somewhat of a downer for me, but at least the basics are covered rather than a mere on/off</li>
            <li> This is rather inconvenient and is the major drawback with this product.  </li>
            <li> It does dry well, and I like the cold shot button.</li>
            <li> The diffuser and concentrator have to be twisted onto the nozzle and neither stays on very tightly</li>
            <li> If I accidentally bump the nozzle when the diffuser or concentrator is in use, it&#x27;s not uncommon that the attachments disengage from the nozzle -</li>
            <li> Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with the conditioning ring, it is just that my sister, who is handling the testing for me, found no benefit from it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This hair dryer has two speed settings, three heat settings, and a cool blast button. Having different options makes it easy for multiple household members to use the same hair dryer for different styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice sleek design, and the attachments are large, so this is great if you have a lot of hair. It reminds me of the professional hair dryers used in salons. I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t reiterate all the features of this dryer. I will say that it is quieter than our old one and I can tell it uses less power. It does dry well, and I like the cold shot button. My hair is short and my wife&#x27;s is shorter now, as she regrows her hair after chemo. We will set aside the gigantic diffuser attachment. I like the concentrator attachment since it dries my hair to quickly. Two speeds and two heat settings are adequate for us. The conditioning ring is interesting, but after washing and conditioning my hair, I hate to blow additional stuff on it. So far, it hasn&#x27;t been an issue. The hanging loop is much appreciated, and I hope it doesn&#x27;t break like the last one did. The free brush is very nice, so says my spouse. She likes the rounded ends and flexibility of the bristles. I know this is a free Vines item, but I&#x27;ve been as objective as I can. This seems to be a very good dryer, and one we will use for a long time.</li>
            <li> This Remmington dryer dries my hair very fast.  It is easy to handle and is very attractive.  Everything about it is great.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend it any more.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I really like the great sleek shape and functional design of this dryer! Handles of both the dryer and the brush (which is included!) are just big enough for a sturdy grip while styling. And I love the colors! There are multiple settings on the dryer giving you more options for styling. The brush doesn&#x27;t snag hair and has a large bristle pad for great coverage. I found that the large mouth on the dryer is good for round brush styling, not so much for straight directed style, but this is what I was looking for in it. Overall, I really like this dryer!</li>
            <li> I was replacing an older hairdryer that&#x27;s much smaller and started to put out very high heat without any cooler options. The Remington D8700 fits great in my hands and feels like a solid dryer with good material (it&#x27;s still mostly plastic). It comes with a diffuser, brush (a very nice heavy one!), and concentrator. I use it without any attachments and it dries my thick hair fairly quickly, three minutes -- maybe? There are a few level selections and heat options. I definitely recommend it for anyone not sure what to get, it meets all of the basic needs and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This super-attractive dryer with ionic ceramic technology compares to high-end salon ceramic dryers but at a fraction of the cost.  This has become my new favorite.  It is rather large but not heavy.  It leaves my hair looking very silky and shiny like a salon style.  I think it must be the ceramic technology because my other dryers don&#x27;t compare when it comes to style and shine.  This device has three heat settings and two speed settings. It also comes with brush and style attachments.  I love the color too!</li>
            <li> Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with the conditioning ring, it is just that my sister, who is handling the testing for me, found no benefit from it.  (I don&#x27;t have enough hair to need a hair dryer.)  As for the rest of it she is very well pleased; it is the most advanced hair dryer she has ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer for the price. Does a good job as quickly drying my long, thick hair. Three setting but I&#x27;ll be honest and say I only use one and that is the highest setting. It is pretty to look at. Love the color. Comes with a hanging cord and a few accessories which work well. Love the dryer and hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Remington hair dryers over the course of my life and while this isn&#x27;t my favorite, it&#x27;s still a quite decent little hair dryer and I&#x27;m mainly fond of its size and handle. It fits well in my hand and isn&#x27;t bulky, rather has a compact feel. There&#x27;s only two settings, which is somewhat of a downer for me, but at least the basics are covered rather than a mere on/off setting. I love the results of the conditioning ring and highly recommend indulging in it. The heat is good, the power is good. Nothing fancy here, but it&#x27;s a good little dryer with a handy conditioning option. I also like the brush that comes with this, so that&#x27;s a nice perk.</li>
            <li> Remington has been getting better with their hair styling products so I was eager to try this out. I really like the color and sleek design to this. It&#x27;s very light weight which is an added bonus when you&#x27;re blow drying your hair. I like the cool shot feature but what I love is that it&#x27;s instant true cold air. This comes in so handy when I&#x27;m styling my hair! It sets my waves perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the product overall. This has restored my faith in Remington hair styling products for sure!</li>
            <li> A good, efficient hair dryer.  It has three heat settings and 2 speed settings to accommodate different hair textures.  My wife uses the medium heat and my daughter who has finer hair uses the lower heat setting.  It comes with two attachments as stated in the description.  We have used the hair concentrator which makes this even more efficient in straightening out hair and taking out the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;  It is lighter than my wife&#x27;s previous Remington but makes about the same amount of noise.  We cannot completely say that the presence of ceramic has made a significant difference in the efficiency of drying and styling time.  If this is anything like my wife&#x27;s current Remington, this would last for years.</li>
            <li> This dryer has a 3-heat setting (high, medium, and cool) and 2 speed setting (high and low).  It works great with the medium and high heat.  The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; shot (and cool setting) is not quite as cool as some of my prior hair dryers and it also takes a few seconds longer to actually produce the cooler temperature.  Having said that, it does still lock in my style with use of a round brush.  This 1875 Watt hair dryer dries my medium length (and medium texture) hair very quickly.  I should also note that the High heat setting doesn&#x27;t feel like it is scorching your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference with the &amp;#34;Conditioning Technology.&amp;#34;  This is a ring attachment that is the circumference of the nozzle.  You simply twist this ring onto the nozzle where the hot air blows out (you could easily take this on and off â€“ I choose to simply leave mine on all the time so I donâ€™t lose it) and use your dryer like normal.  It is supposed to release &amp;#34;micro-conditioners&amp;#34; as you blow dry your hair.  Ingredients for the condition ring includes Macadamina Nut Oil and Argan Oil (Argan Oil is expressed from the seeds of the Argan tree what is native to Southwestern Morocco).  Although Iâ€™m not noticing a huge positive with this technology â€“ of equal importance, Iâ€™m also not achieving a hair style that is too soft (due to OVER conditioning).  So overall, Iâ€™m neutral with the conditioning technology that is incorporated into this dryer.  If you have dry brittle hair â€“ maybe your results will be more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll receive a complementary hair brush with this dryer.  It has plastic bristles with plastic tips - nothing fancy but I like the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I included a picture of what you receive with your dryer.  The color of the dryer is silver and metallic green - it&#x27;s sleek looking and light weight (only weighs in around 20-21 ounces).  This dryer feels of lighter weight than my last one which is a bonus.  I use the bulky 3M removable clips on my wall and the hanging loop is wide enough to accommodate this hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser and concentrator are made of a light green plastic - this color isn&#x27;t very attractive.  The diffuser and concentrator have to be twisted onto the nozzle and neither stays on very tightly (my prior hair brushes merely snapped into place - this option seemed a lot more secure).  If I accidentally bump the nozzle when the diffuser or concentrator is in use, it&#x27;s not uncommon that the attachments disengage from the nozzle - This is rather inconvenient and is the major drawback with this product.  Fortunately, I don&#x27;t use these attachments often so the fact that they fall off rather easily doesn&#x27;t really impact my daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a better than average hair dryer despite the issues with the attachments.  I&#x27;ve owned other Remington hair dryers and I consider them to be reliable. My prior Remingtons have lasted at least 4-years (with daily use) before I selected a new one.  Often my reason for upgrading to a new one is mainly due to the cruddy appearance the hair dryer begins to take on through the years due to dust build up in vents and hair spray residue that I can no longer wipe off rather than a decrease in performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this blow dryer a few times now and am very impressed.  It has two speeds and three heat settings, along with a cool shot.  When the weather gets this hot and humid in the summer, it seems I get warm and sweaty when blowing my hair dry, even in central air.  That&#x27;s where the lower heat settings are really enjoyed.  Even at the highest setting, my scalp doesn&#x27;t get too hot, but I really like the cooler settings. Even in the lower heat settings, my hair seemed to dry fairly fast, but more importantly, it seemed softer and more easily styled with a round brush than with my other blow dryers.  My hair is fine and very straight, so this is a bonus.  I haven&#x27;t used the other features, so I can&#x27;t review those at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the relatively large size in comparison to most blow dryers, this one is surprisingly light.  Between having small hands and my hand strength having declined from both age and the way I was affected by Lyme Disease before detection, I notice this and if I can handle the blow dryer, I think most adults would have no difficulty.  The volume when in operation is fairly moderate - nothing as loud as you might think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little feature that I find handy is the little hook at the base of the handle near the cord, which allows you to hang it on a hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, don&#x27;t be deterred by the large size unless storage space is an issue.  This is a really nice blow dryer and if it holds up as well as an older Remington model we&#x27;ve had for years, we&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li> We really like this hairdryer. This Remington hairdryer is the best we ever had. It is of professional quality - but, very easy to use and understand how to do various things with it. The Ionic Ceramic Technology dries hair fast while protecting it from damage. The design makes it light weight, easy to use and handle for the layperson. This hairdryer has an Advanced Motor of 1875 watts, 3 Heat and Cool settings, plus 2 Speed, and an Exclusive - conditioning ring, to promote strong and healthy hair. Besides all the above, a 2 year warranty is given on the hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;A special Bonus is that a Micro-Conditioning Hairbrush is also included.&lt;br /&gt;The REMINGTON T STUDIO HAIRDRYER protects, styles, and shines!</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick hair and this dryer dries it in about 5 minutes.  It is very lightweight, but made well.  Conditioning ring does seem to help keep frizz and static at bay while drying my hair fast.  Love the hairbrush that came with it too.. leaves my hair frizz free and soft.  Very nice set for the price!</li>
            <li> Very stylish hair dryer!  Feels very expensive in your hands like you are at a high class salon. Usually use the hottest of the three heat level the most and the cool down set for a minute. This set is nice because it has a matching brush that goes with the hair dryer set. Feels great in your hair to handle my wife&#x27;s kinky curls. I was told this one is to stay in our bathroom and not go into the kids or main bathroom because my wife likes it that much. Yes Ma&#x27;am!  Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hit in our house!</li>
            <li> This Remington hairdryer comes with a bonus medium size brush.  We have been using argan oil from some time.  It makes your hair smoother and less frizzy and what is interesting is that this dryer comes with a ring infused with argan oil and macadamia oil that attaches to the blower.  I am not sure how much help it is but I don&#x27;t see much effect at this time compared to directly applying the oil with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blower looks nice, a complete departure from our usual purple rounded blower that we have been using for 2 years now.  We love to have a smaller blower but the D8700 is still a handfull to work with.  It has 3 heat settings and ionic tech for faster drying.  Our Old dryer only has 2 settings and I don&#x27;t want to use the hot setting for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  At least the middle setting feels fine - not too hot and not to cold.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer.  Not too heavy.  Simple but ample controls.  The snap on attachments are great except the conditioning ring.  I see absolutely no effect from that and can&#x27;t imagine that there is one.  I think it is a gimmick.  I love the brush that was included.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dryer.  Dries hair more quickly than most hair dryers.  Convenient in that it has three heat settings and two speed settings. It also includes interchangeable nozzles that are very useful and convenient for styling and straightening.  It includes a conditioning ring that you thread onto the dryer.  The conditioning ring contains oils that are apparently designed to be released as micro-conditioners to keep your hair conditioned as you dry it, i.e., to reduce dryness and frizziness.  Use of the conditioning ring, however, did not seem to make any noticeable difference.  The hair dryer by itself is pretty well designed and leaves hair shiny and sleek, with no breakage.  If you do use the conditioning ring then the oils will eventually run out and it will need to be replaced.  Replacement is recommended every three months.  I could not find any replacements for sale, perhaps because this is still a fairly new product and the replacements are just not yet on the market. Another convenience is that the back of the dryer pops off for easy cleaning of the filter.  Overall, a well designed product.</li>
            <li> I have (Caucasian) thin, color treated (due to gray) shoulder length hair. I use virtually no product in my hair, save for a leave in conditioner after I wash. I switched to &amp;#34;ion&amp;#34; styling tools when they came to market to try and preserve what hair I have. I already have the T studio ionic flat iron and of course ionic round brush:)&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is great! I am able to dry my full head in 12min. 3temps and a cold shot! Winner! My hair doesn&#x27;t look frizzy. It is not too loud and I like the color.&lt;br /&gt;I am not one for the add on tools-I wish I had hair that could benefit from the &amp;#34;conditioning ring&amp;#34; my hair is naturally curly and my hair dryer helps me to slay the curls into straight submission!&lt;br /&gt;My only wish would be a retractable cord...on the wish list for the next version!</li>
            <li> Hair dryers seem to be something I go through. Eventually, they burn out. As such, I was pleased to be able to try the Remington D8700 T|Studio PROtect Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it is a basic hair dryer. The features are consistent with any other good hair dryer. Three heat settings, a cool blast, and two speed settings. Unique to it are the conditioning rings. Those, according to their promotional material, \\&quot;are infused with macadamia oil, releasing micro-conditioners through the dryer air to penetrate and moisturize your hair.\\&quot; What this means essentially is it dries your hair yet doesn&#x27;t dry it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice general brush and a couple attachments to allow more control of the styling process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is that it runs a little louder than my other dryers have. It wouldn&#x27;t stop from purchasing or using it, but that&#x27;s something you should know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new everyday dryer so I&#x27;m happy. You will be too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Brockeim</li>
            <li> My blow dryer and I were not friends. No matter what I did it seemed like my hair came out a frizzy mess. That changed with this blow dryer. I have wavy hair that tends to frizz up if I use a blow dryer. This one comes with a conditioning ring (don&#x27;t know if that made a difference at all) and a nice big diffuser that also screwed onto the front nozzle of the dryer (has a neat interlocking screw mechanism). Honestly, when I finished using this dryer, my hair had zero frizz and my waves were still intact thanks to the diffuser. Another cool thing - I was able to dry my hair very fast using the higher heat setting, something I would have never attempted before. This is an awesome blow dryer.</li>
            <li> We got this for review as a part of the vine program.  The review is accurate and honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter is almost 14 years old and has curly----very curly hair.  She tends to spend a lot of time swimming in the summer months and that leads her hair down a path which makes it hard for her to manage.  For regular usage she likes the ability to adjust speeds and heat settings...in other words, less heat regularly and more when styling.  The diffuser helps her dry quickly...especially because she has thick curly hair.  There is a conditioning ring that is included but time will tell how much that helps....she does use it 2-3 times a week and is only seeing moderate improvement...but it is early to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far we are pleased with the product and recommend it highly as an excellent value.</li>
