            <li>Does smell good.</li>
            <li>Good product .</li>

            <li>Honestly an amazing product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not here to sell this amazing product...</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully twice a day and apply with a warm blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I got laughed at by many for ordering this product</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I fill out my bra&#x27;s better, and having gone from a D cup before I had my daughter, to an A cup after breastfeeding, I&#x27;m so glad to start getting a chest again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been told that applying some kind if warming cream/oil beforehand helps even more.</li>
            <li>I know that sounds too good to be true, but I kid you not.</li>
            <li>If you seek going up 2-3 or more cup</li>

            <li>pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s pleased, and so am I.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident.</li>
            <li>and I can notably tell it has made a difference.</li>
            <li>On top of that I also used Pueraria Mirfica tablets.</li>
            <li>My boobs didn&#x27;t deflate any more</li>
            <li>they have never felt more healthy and rounded.</li>
            <li>and ordering more.</li>
            <li>i bleieve IF MORE PEOPLE WOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS</li>
            <li>THEY WOULD SEE BETTER RESULTS FOR THIER MONEY</li>
            <li>For all these reasons I am glad that I found Naturaful.  </li>
            <li>What more can a customer ask for these days???</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased to find that it continued to encourage breast development once I had stopped using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not gonna make your breasts just magically appear in a day or so.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was satisfied I would recommend it to anyone looking for fuller breasts</li>
            <li>I reorder 5 more jars she does not want to run out love the product</li>
            <li>have read many reviews about how it has worked wonders for them.</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s hoping* :)</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>but they are much more perky.</li>
            <li>Safe and easy cream to use once or twice a day.</li>
            <li>Been using this for 5 months now &amp; breasts appear fuller &amp; have gained an inch &amp; now fit into my bras better.</li>
            <li>It worked surprisingly quick!</li>
            <li>I could barely fit it</li>
            <li>, I also find Naturaful a company genuinely cares about its customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heat is important.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase it did take quite a long time to arrive because after using my first jar I felt a difference</li>
            <li>So far so good with this cream.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>This REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li>, thank you guys so much!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very excited right now...</li>
            <li>but when it was finished, I could no longer see whether I still had the same effect,  I very happy to have received two jars when order arrived, I&#x27;m now two weeks into using my first jar but still waiting to see whether there&#x27;s gonna be a difference after using the first jar..</li>
            <li>Just used the first jar and see results love it .</li>
            <li>I wont go on and on about how yummy my breast are and how excited I am...</li>
            <li>I am very excited about this product and love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>I promise you, if you use it right!</li>
            <li>Im super excited to see how they come out by the end if the month.</li>
            <li>months, I have gained a full cup size.</li>
            <li>So I did give it a full 6 months but did not experience any changes with my breasts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely am a full round pleasant C and am my breasts are not lopsided any more.</li>
            <li>#34;true mass&amp;#34; development in my chest and NOT water retention as I have experienced with other products.</li>
            <li>and I reached over 41/2 more inches around my breast that isn&#x27;t budging in only one month and even more after that.</li>
            <li>and I do not take any form of birth control, nor am I pregnant.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and will be ordering more</li>
            <li>but now i can fit it exactly.</li>
            <li>About half a cup size to be honest, but I am going to keep using this product for better results.</li>
            <li>As of right now though I am still a 30a and am not one of the lucky girls that grew a cup size in 5 weeks or even grown at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a safe natural product to increase my breast.</li>
            <li>It was super embarrassing that the first thing all my friends from Highschool noticed about me after they saw me with my kids was my boobs were gone.</li>
            <li>the end of the month they were aching and tender most days, which I&#x27;m told is not a common side effect, but I didn&#x27;t mind anyway because they were obviously bigger, rounder, and stuck out more.</li>
            <li>but right when I finished it my breast started feeling sore... called the company</li>
            <li>But...&lt;br /&gt;By the second month I was up from an A to a B and my breast feel more full</li>
            <li>My breasts went down to an a cup after a good amount of weight loss.</li>
            <li>On top of this, I use Ainterol&#x27;s Pueraria Mirifica Ultimate Breast Growth Spray ($56) and Natureday&#x27;s Breast Enhancement Cream ($35).</li>
            <li>First I spray 2 sprays of Ainterol PM spray onto each breast and massage them in thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I now have cleavage for the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Breasts are larger, firmer, more</li>
            <li>Stellar results!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed firmness within the first week.</li>
            <li>Now my bra fits better and I cannot wait to see the results that I will get with the next jar!</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 weeks I started noticing firmness and plumping of my breast.</li>
            <li>Until that, implants are our only sure thing.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>my partner noticing that they are gretting bigger :) I have measured and have grown an inch within 7 weeks.</li>
            <li>If anyone is interested in gaining mass in the rear end, please contact me for the name of the product.  </li>
            <li>First I am 21 years, I put the product on in the morning and sometimes in the evening (but not all the time in the evening.)</li>
            <li>and they said if u see results within the first three months is</li>
            <li>or it doesnt give it a try be like me try the first month</li>
            <li>but once I got it and not only myself but others could see results many have said they were going to order this</li>
            <li>They are saying results takes more than 3 to 6 months, then how would one know if their return policy is only for two months.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product I procrastinated with staying consistent</li>
            <li>WELL your choice....;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only my first month of using naturaful, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but I&#x27;m not giving up and will continue my journey :)</li>
            <li>I am happy to recommend Naturaful to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;After having three babies, my breasts were seriously sagging.</li>
            <li>I am very hopeful to see increase in size in the next couple of months, and did buy 3 more jars.</li>
            <li>, my breast are much fuller, rounder and my nipples are more in the middle rather than off to the sides.</li>
            <li>I ordered directly from the site I recieved an emailed discount, I bought the 3 months package for about $118, not bad.</li>
            <li>women are bigger some are smaller, but if this really works and i can get to a size I am most comfortable with, why not give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The cream does work more efficiently of you dry with a hairdryer while rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>I rub the cream in circular motion around the breast while using the blow dryer to dry the cream more into the skin.</li>
            <li>i read alot before i tried any thing i&#x27;m 50 yrs old and just wanted some help with mother nature wanting to be funny!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I think blow-drying REALLY helps all the products absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li>Using it with a blow dryer tends to help with the stickiness and gets it to absorb fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to women of all ages to enhance your breasts!</li>
            <li>Naturaful really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks to naturaful</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I wont bother you guys buy how this stuff put a complete smile on my face...</li>
            <li>I used it for about 6 months and it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this not having high hopes!</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I did this for three months straight.</li>
            <li>I noticed after the three months I went up almost a whole cup size and breast</li>
            <li>were much firmer.</li>
            <li>My initial goal was a FULL 34B, but due to the recent developments I may try for a nice 34C!  </li>
            <li>And the staff is very consistent with checking on my progress and willing to help in anyway possible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t the only product I&#x27;m using, which might be why my results are coming along so quickly.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that would work in 3 days no product will do that lets be realistic.</li>
            <li>I started out on Naturaful a flat 34A &amp; now I am a FULL 34A.  </li>
            <li>i used natural for only a month to try and seen my breasts becoming more firm and fitted!</li>
            <li>within first few days of using the cream I had aching in my breasts and pretty much the whole first month and still now which I think means its working.  </li>
            <li>im actually trying to get some on amazon right now.....</li>
            <li>In fact this morning I realized that I might have to look into getting new bras</li>
            <li>&gt; A 2005 safety assessment of parabens concluded that cosmetics containing parabens do not, on the basis of currently available evidence, pose a health risk; because of the low doses involved and the low probability that parabens will penetrate into the tissue, remain intact, and accumulate there -  Wikipedia</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my body did not react successfully with this.  </li>
            <li>I hope my breast grow more within the two more months ill report back with results.</li>
            <li>All 3 products total to around $140, which is a really good deal in my opinion because they actually give REAL results--at least from what I&#x27;ve seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Third, I apply the Natureday cream (in the same way) and blow dry it as well for better absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlined bras made my chest look like a 9 year old boy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>From my personal experience this product really works.</li>
            <li>Getting to know some of these ladies most of them have a complaint about breast size.  </li>
            <li>So far this product is working.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product it contains parabins that can cause breast cancer , and it doesnt even work.</li>
            <li>The lid of the jar is relatively smaller than the real ones I&#x27;ve seen online..as well as the packing in general.</li>
            <li>Back in high school</li>
            <li>As a skeptic of breast growing creams and pills, I saw this product on groupon for half the price and decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>the original marks still on the band (one for my band, and the other for my bust) to my surprise the bust was about five inches further from the last measurement.</li>
            <li>In addition my progress is slow &amp; steady which proves that it works and not some overnight balloon blow up job which will deflate after time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 18-years-old, Asian, and wear a 32B/34A bra naturally.</li>
            <li>Before I&#x27;d used creams and such but never blow-dried it, and sometimes I think the product would just wipe off onto my clothing and not absorb completely.</li>
            <li>I did not expect to have soreness so soon, so I am very hopeful that my results will be sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>Their 60 days money back guarantee is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>I take a hot shower dry of, apply a tooth paste amount of cream to my smaller boob, and the residual goes on my bigger boob.</li>
            <li>I have already referred 5 other women to naturaful that are planning to buy very soon.</li>
            <li>8 months of use in conjunction with daily message, breast size has increased from a small A cup to a full B cup.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I am no long so self-conscious.</li>
            <li>Yes, I am guilty of probably overuse in the first month, but have been able to level out the use to average 1 jar a month.</li>
            <li>supply &amp; WILL put in another order of at least 5 more months supply because after almost 2 years of trying out other brands &amp; regiments I have finally found one</li>
            <li>Then I take a blow dryer and, holding it an arm&#x27;s length away, literally blow dry my breasts until the spray has dried and absorbed into my skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just used the first jar and see results love it .</li>
            <li> I wont go on and on about how yummy my breast are and how excited I am...</li>
            <li> I am very excited about this product and love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> I promise you, if you use it right!</li>
            <li> Im super excited to see how they come out by the end if the month.</li>
            <li> months, I have gained a full cup size.</li>
            <li> So I did give it a full 6 months but did not experience any changes with my breasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely am a full round pleasant C and am my breasts are not lopsided any more.</li>
            <li> #34;true mass&amp;#34; development in my chest and NOT water retention as I have experienced with other products.</li>
            <li> and I reached over 41/2 more inches around my breast that isn&#x27;t budging in only one month and even more after that.</li>
            <li> and I do not take any form of birth control, nor am I pregnant.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it and will be ordering more</li>
            <li> but now i can fit it exactly.</li>
            <li> About half a cup size to be honest, but I am going to keep using this product for better results.</li>
            <li> As of right now though I am still a 30a and am not one of the lucky girls that grew a cup size in 5 weeks or even grown at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a safe natural product to increase my breast.</li>
            <li> It was super embarrassing that the first thing all my friends from Highschool noticed about me after they saw me with my kids was my boobs were gone.</li>
            <li> the end of the month they were aching and tender most days, which I&#x27;m told is not a common side effect, but I didn&#x27;t mind anyway because they were obviously bigger, rounder, and stuck out more.</li>
            <li> but right when I finished it my breast started feeling sore... called the company</li>
            <li> But...&lt;br /&gt;By the second month I was up from an A to a B and my breast feel more full</li>
            <li> My breasts went down to an a cup after a good amount of weight loss.</li>
            <li> On top of this, I use Ainterol&#x27;s Pueraria Mirifica Ultimate Breast Growth Spray ($56) and Natureday&#x27;s Breast Enhancement Cream ($35).</li>
            <li> First I spray 2 sprays of Ainterol PM spray onto each breast and massage them in thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I now have cleavage for the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Breasts are larger, firmer, more</li>
            <li> Stellar results!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed firmness within the first week.</li>
            <li> Now my bra fits better and I cannot wait to see the results that I will get with the next jar!</li>
            <li> Within the first 2 weeks I started noticing firmness and plumping of my breast.</li>
            <li> Until that, implants are our only sure thing.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> my partner noticing that they are gretting bigger :) I have measured and have grown an inch within 7 weeks.</li>
            <li> If anyone is interested in gaining mass in the rear end, please contact me for the name of the product.  </li>
            <li> First I am 21 years, I put the product on in the morning and sometimes in the evening (but not all the time in the evening.)</li>
            <li> and they said if u see results within the first three months is</li>
            <li> or it doesnt give it a try be like me try the first month</li>
            <li> but once I got it and not only myself but others could see results many have said they were going to order this</li>
            <li> They are saying results takes more than 3 to 6 months, then how would one know if their return policy is only for two months.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product I procrastinated with staying consistent</li>
            <li> WELL your choice....;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only my first month of using naturaful, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but I&#x27;m not giving up and will continue my journey :)</li>
            <li> I am happy to recommend Naturaful to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;After having three babies, my breasts were seriously sagging.</li>
            <li> I am very hopeful to see increase in size in the next couple of months, and did buy 3 more jars.</li>
            <li> , my breast are much fuller, rounder and my nipples are more in the middle rather than off to the sides.</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from the site I recieved an emailed discount, I bought the 3 months package for about $118, not bad.</li>
            <li> women are bigger some are smaller, but if this really works and i can get to a size I am most comfortable with, why not give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cream does work more efficiently of you dry with a hairdryer while rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I rub the cream in circular motion around the breast while using the blow dryer to dry the cream more into the skin.</li>
            <li> i read alot before i tried any thing i&#x27;m 50 yrs old and just wanted some help with mother nature wanting to be funny!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I think blow-drying REALLY helps all the products absorb into your skin.</li>
            <li> Using it with a blow dryer tends to help with the stickiness and gets it to absorb fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to women of all ages to enhance your breasts!</li>
            <li> Naturaful really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks to naturaful</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I wont bother you guys buy how this stuff put a complete smile on my face...</li>
            <li> I used it for about 6 months and it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this not having high hopes!</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I did this for three months straight.</li>
            <li> I noticed after the three months I went up almost a whole cup size and breast</li>
            <li> were much firmer.</li>
            <li> My initial goal was a FULL 34B, but due to the recent developments I may try for a nice 34C!  </li>
            <li> And the staff is very consistent with checking on my progress and willing to help in anyway possible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the only product I&#x27;m using, which might be why my results are coming along so quickly.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that would work in 3 days no product will do that lets be realistic.</li>
            <li> I started out on Naturaful a flat 34A &amp; now I am a FULL 34A.  </li>
            <li> i used natural for only a month to try and seen my breasts becoming more firm and fitted!</li>
            <li> within first few days of using the cream I had aching in my breasts and pretty much the whole first month and still now which I think means its working.  </li>
            <li> im actually trying to get some on amazon right now.....</li>
            <li> In fact this morning I realized that I might have to look into getting new bras</li>
            <li> &gt; A 2005 safety assessment of parabens concluded that cosmetics containing parabens do not, on the basis of currently available evidence, pose a health risk; because of the low doses involved and the low probability that parabens will penetrate into the tissue, remain intact, and accumulate there -  Wikipedia</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my body did not react successfully with this.  </li>
            <li> I hope my breast grow more within the two more months ill report back with results.</li>
            <li> All 3 products total to around $140, which is a really good deal in my opinion because they actually give REAL results--at least from what I&#x27;ve seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Third, I apply the Natureday cream (in the same way) and blow dry it as well for better absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlined bras made my chest look like a 9 year old boy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> From my personal experience this product really works.</li>
            <li> Getting to know some of these ladies most of them have a complaint about breast size.  </li>
            <li> So far this product is working.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product it contains parabins that can cause breast cancer , and it doesnt even work.</li>
            <li> The lid of the jar is relatively smaller than the real ones I&#x27;ve seen online..as well as the packing in general.</li>
            <li> Back in high school</li>
            <li> As a skeptic of breast growing creams and pills, I saw this product on groupon for half the price and decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> the original marks still on the band (one for my band, and the other for my bust) to my surprise the bust was about five inches further from the last measurement.</li>
            <li> In addition my progress is slow &amp; steady which proves that it works and not some overnight balloon blow up job which will deflate after time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18-years-old, Asian, and wear a 32B/34A bra naturally.</li>
            <li> Before I&#x27;d used creams and such but never blow-dried it, and sometimes I think the product would just wipe off onto my clothing and not absorb completely.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to have soreness so soon, so I am very hopeful that my results will be sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> Their 60 days money back guarantee is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> I take a hot shower dry of, apply a tooth paste amount of cream to my smaller boob, and the residual goes on my bigger boob.</li>
            <li> I have already referred 5 other women to naturaful that are planning to buy very soon.</li>
            <li> 8 months of use in conjunction with daily message, breast size has increased from a small A cup to a full B cup.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I am no long so self-conscious.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am guilty of probably overuse in the first month, but have been able to level out the use to average 1 jar a month.</li>
            <li> supply &amp; WILL put in another order of at least 5 more months supply because after almost 2 years of trying out other brands &amp; regiments I have finally found one</li>
            <li> Then I take a blow dryer and, holding it an arm&#x27;s length away, literally blow dry my breasts until the spray has dried and absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> If that was really the case we would definitely hear about it in the media constantly and the breast augmentation would be the thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Well the results were either weight gain due to water retention or a nice round behind which I am not complaining, but was not my goal.  </li>
            <li> I know that is unfair, but other rwveiws had me more hopeful.</li>
            <li> but how long I have no idea...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products like breastful and they would get bigger</li>
            <li> I do admit I have always felt my breasts were a bit smaller than other</li>
            <li> The only result I got was achey breast ,and I mean EXTREMELY sensitive</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 months - twice a day, after a shower and with a hair dryer every single time.  </li>
            <li> I am 19 years old, Ive always had small breast.</li>
            <li> A little over a week into my purchase of this cream, my breasts have soreness especially around my nipple.  </li>
            <li> I am on my fourth jar (a little over 3 months use) and I see and fell &amp;</li>
            <li> no change yet except my breast are really soft and my nipples stay hard and alert all the time will continue and keep you updated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Naturaful for a few weeks, and I&#x27;ve already begun to see changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it a 4star instead of five because I am impatient to see results.</li>
            <li> Before using this product  my breast were little flat pancakes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews and I feel like some people either don&#x27;t use it right or have unrealistic expectations.</li>
            <li> So I do ask other women to try it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I do feel some soreness when I have my period but other than that</li>
            <li> In fact due to this development</li>
            <li> Naturaful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously on other regiments that required oral ingestion of a pill, either once or up to 3 times a day, in addition to cream application.  </li>
            <li> then u can figure out other options</li>
            <li> I did not gain weight, as I am very physically active</li>
            <li> There is a slow gradual change, but it is actually working.</li>
            <li> I have been using naturaful for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I had previously.</li>
            <li> I am a size B34, but after breastfeeding my daughter I noticed my breast were not full and sagged.</li>
            <li> I was a 36c but not a full c cup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I went down to a very small B cup and could pull off an A.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to try this product because I have always had small breast</li>
            <li> This usually takes no more than 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I usually use two small dabs per breast and massage it into my breasts in circular motions, going clockwise and counter-clockwise, for about a minute or two.</li>
            <li> And it is so small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 months</li>
            <li> but they are still the same measurement and still fill out my bra the same way. :(</li>
            <li> Waste your money!</li>
            <li> and if u dont see a difference then at least u tried it....</li>
            <li> Believe it or not sexy sells!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my secret only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any bad reviews, then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s due to user error!</li>
            <li> I had issues with getting the product initially which frustrated me to the point of giving it a bad review.</li>
            <li> Also useless.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I haven&#x27;t seen any results.  </li>
            <li> and I was very skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> Im am very skeptical but after I funish the 1 month supply I gave up</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I hate having mix matched boobs</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and unhappy!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes ☺ this is what i want</li>
            <li> Honestly an amazing product</li>
            <li> I used two containers already. Breast have been enlarging. I am starting on a Breast enhancement pill now bc my sister tried it and had faster results. The cream does work more efficiently of you dry with a hairdryer while rubbing it in. I am going to buy another container anyway and use both the pill and lotion together to see if it boosts the growth faster. My boobs are fuller. Not too much bigger but definitely fuller.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this product because I have always had small breast and I&#x27;m 18. I always felt like eventually they&#x27;d grow eventually but they didn&#x27;t. So its been a week since i got the product and i can already see a change. Im super excited to see how they come out by the end if the month. My bra size is a 36 a. I could barely fit it but now i can fit it exactly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Naturaful for a few weeks, and I&#x27;ve already begun to see changes. I fill out my bra&#x27;s better, and having gone from a D cup before I had my daughter, to an A cup after breastfeeding, I&#x27;m so glad to start getting a chest again! The product smells great, and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it a 4star instead of five because I am impatient to see results. I know that is unfair, but other rwveiws had me more hopeful. I&#x27;ve now been using Natraful for five weeks. I have noticed some firmness. I am very hopeful to see increase in size in the next couple of months, and did buy 3 more jars. As of right now though I am still a 30a and am not one of the lucky girls that grew a cup size in 5 weeks or even grown at all. So that&#x27;s the reason for the 4. I&#x27;ll repost a review upon the 3 month mark. Thanks.</li>
            <li> 8/4/13&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s only been 3 days since I&#x27;ve been using this product and I feel like my breasts have already gotten fuller. I know that sounds too good to be true, but I kid you not. I&#x27;m 18-years-old, Asian, and wear a 32B/34A bra naturally. Since it&#x27;s only been 3 days, I can&#x27;t wait to see my results after a month or two! I will continue to update my results for those interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the only product I&#x27;m using, which might be why my results are coming along so quickly. On top of this, I use Ainterol&#x27;s Pueraria Mirifica Ultimate Breast Growth Spray ($56) and Natureday&#x27;s Breast Enhancement Cream ($35). All 3 products total to around $140, which is a really good deal in my opinion because they actually give REAL results--at least from what I&#x27;ve seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my routine, I try to apply religiously every morning and night (after I shower). I apply it like so:&lt;br /&gt;1) First I spray 2 sprays of Ainterol PM spray onto each breast and massage them in thoroughly. Then I take a blow dryer and, holding it an arm&#x27;s length away, literally blow dry my breasts until the spray has dried and absorbed into my skin. This usually takes no more than 20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;2) Second, I apply this Naturaful cream! I usually use two small dabs per breast and massage it into my breasts in circular motions, going clockwise and counter-clockwise, for about a minute or two. Then I blow-dry it just like the previous.&lt;br /&gt;3) Third, I apply the Natureday cream (in the same way) and blow dry it as well for better absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I think blow-drying REALLY helps all the products absorb into your skin. Before I&#x27;d used creams and such but never blow-dried it, and sometimes I think the product would just wipe off onto my clothing and not absorb completely. So if you&#x27;re having problems, definitely try that. I hope I helped you guys with this review!</li>
            <li> I had issues with getting the product initially which frustrated me to the point of giving it a bad review. However within an hour they contacted me and shipped the product out, which was a life saver. Reallygood customer service</li>
            <li> My breasts went down to an a cup after a good amount of weight loss. Unlined bras made my chest look like a 9 year old boy&#x27;s. As a skeptic of breast growing creams and pills, I saw this product on groupon for half the price and decided it was worth a try. I applied it as directed, twice a day once after I got out of the shower in the morning and again at night with a blow dryer. Within two weeks I experienced a tingling sensation in my breasts and I started to notice they were firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the month they were aching and tender most days, which I&#x27;m told is not a common side effect, but I didn&#x27;t mind anyway because they were obviously bigger, rounder, and stuck out more. My boyfriend saw them one day around this time and is defiantly a fan. I now have cleavage for the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued to use naturaful in a daily basis on the same schedule and my breasts are achy, but they continue to grow. In fact this morning I realized that I might have to look into getting new bras soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews and I feel like some people either don&#x27;t use it right or have unrealistic expectations. This is not an overnight thing. It is not an equivalent to surgery. However, if you just want fuller, rounder, cleavage this is a good option for that. If you seek going up 2-3 or more cup then I would just consider surgery instead. I have been using naturaful for about a month and a half. I&#x27;m hoping this product goes back on groupon when it comes time for more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- it is sticky and can take a bit to rub in. Using it with a blow dryer tends to help with the stickiness and gets it to absorb fast. I&#x27;ve also been told that applying some kind if warming cream/oil beforehand helps even more.</li>
            <li> I am happy to recommend Naturaful to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;After having three babies, my breasts were seriously sagging. I stumble&lt;br /&gt;across this product while surfing and thought I should give it a try. After&lt;br /&gt;4 months, I have gained a full cup size. Breasts are larger, firmer, more lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very good product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I also find Naturaful a company genuinely cares about its customers.&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I a very happy experience in using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still continuing with the product. Hopefully, will get further improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy anonymous NZ customer</li>
            <li> I have not bought the cream yet but have just been doing a bit of research into it and found in regards to the PARABEN statement:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A 2005 safety assessment of parabens concluded that cosmetics containing parabens do not, on the basis of currently available evidence, pose a health risk; because of the low doses involved and the low probability that parabens will penetrate into the tissue, remain intact, and accumulate there -  Wikipedia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading up on it I think I will give it a go.</li>
            <li> this product contains parabens, and for anyone who hasn&#x27;t done their research, parabens are known to cause breast cancer! brilliant people, brilliant. -_-</li>
            <li> Like any product, it does not have instant results. But overall I see a difference so I plan to keep using this.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 5 months now &amp; breasts appear fuller &amp; have gained an inch &amp; now fit into my bras better.</li>
            <li> From my personal experience this product really works. You will see the effects after 3 or 4 weeks. Love it. If you are looking for something that would work in 3 days no product will do that lets be realistic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  Safe and easy cream to use once or twice a day. I highly recommend it to women of all ages to enhance your breasts!</li>
            <li> Naturaful really works. In approx. 8 months of use in conjunction with daily message, breast size has increased from a small A cup to a full B cup.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase it did take quite a long time to arrive because after using my first jar I felt a difference but when it was finished, I could no longer see whether I still had the same effect,  I very happy to have received two jars when order arrived, I&#x27;m now two weeks into using my first jar but still waiting to see whether there&#x27;s gonna be a difference after using the first jar..</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  Would not buy again. It&#x27;s a waste of money.  And it is so small. Does smell good.</li>
            <li> Good product . Just used the first jar and see results love it . So I do ask other women to try it.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make a change .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a safe natural product to increase my breast. I&#x27;ve considered going under the knife but it&#x27;s too risky. I noticed results with 2 jars. My husband noticed a fullness in my breast and he&#x27;s pleased, and so am I. I will continue to use this product until I reach the results I&#x27;m looking for. Thanks to naturaful I feel more confident.</li>
            <li> I bought the jar of Naturaful and I was very skeptical about it. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 months and I can notably tell it has made a difference. I do feel some soreness when I have my period but other than that, I think it&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not here to sell this amazing product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not here to persuade anyone into buying it because it works only after 1 week of use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to twist anyone&#x27;s arm into believing that I went through a jar in 2 weeks and just ordered my second... and I have Stellar results!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m not going to push anyone into believing that my results will be the same for you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wont go on and on about how yummy my breast are and how excited I am...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont go over how all I had to do was follow the directions to the T. &amp; I don&#x27;t put any caffeine into my body and I drink a lot of water... I also stay away from salt and I don&#x27;t stress out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wont bother you guys buy how this stuff put a complete smile on my face... 2 days before my Birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I hope I don&#x27;t make anyone feel that they should buy this off the my opinion...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; but my &amp;#34;Mate&amp;#34; was starting to get a lil suspicious about why they were looking bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I saw him staring at them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him that I stuffed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s my secret only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am here to say that I am doing this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not male attention because if you put something shiny in front of them they will stare at that too... Ahahahaha~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am here to say that this stuff is doing something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even started leaking. I&#x27;m not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I want to know are they going to stay like this after the 3 months? That&#x27;s my question?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will come back and tell everyone here if they stayed the same or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited right now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering about this jar... It worked for me. ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; but how long I have no idea... only time will tell... Hope this helped someone...</li>
            <li> RESULTS WITH THE 1ST JAR! ....It worked surprisingly quick! I noticed firmness within the first week. I am no long so self-conscious. I breastfed my son for 1 1/2 yrs and once my milk disappeared so did my breast and any muscle I had previously. Before using this product  my breast were little flat pancakes. Now my bra fits better and I cannot wait to see the results that I will get with the next jar! I am in love! This REALLY WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I will not advise anyone to use this product because it doesn&#x27;t work is like throwing your money away. Nothing changed after using it for three months so please don&#x27;t allow yourself to be fooled like I was.</li>
            <li> I have been using Naturaful for almost a month. I am a size B34, but after breastfeeding my daughter I noticed my breast were not full and sagged. Within the first 2 weeks I started noticing firmness and plumping of my breast. I take a hot shower dry of, apply a tooth paste amount of cream to my smaller boob, and the residual goes on my bigger boob. I rub the cream in circular motion around the breast while using the blow dryer to dry the cream more into the skin. Heat is important.  Use blow dryer while rubbing in cream!!!!!</li>
            <li> Male here, product did not work after to months of use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your breath, time and money. I used it for about 6 months and it did absolutely nothing for me. The company sales person told me that it takes about 3-6 months just to see some fullness and tenderness in breasts and 6-9 months to see some growth in breast tissue. So I did give it a full 6 months but did not experience any changes with my breasts. On top of that I also used Pueraria Mirfica tablets. Also useless. I don&#x27;t believe that you can enlarge your breasts by taking herbs. If that was really the case we would definitely hear about it in the media constantly and the breast augmentation would be the thing of the past. Until that, implants are our only sure thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this not having high hopes! And omg!! It really works! My breasts are noticeably larger and firmer. I&#x27;ve only been using it a month and wow! I&#x27;m usually a pessimist, don&#x27;t put much stock in the quality of a product! If there&#x27;s any bad reviews, then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s due to user error! Use it after your shower, and use the blow dryer for faster absorption. Ladies I promise you, if you use it right! You&#x27;ll get results you love!! Customer for life!</li>
            <li> So far so good with this cream.  A little over a week into my purchase of this cream, my breasts have soreness especially around my nipple.  I used it faithfully twice a day and apply with a warm blow dryer.  I did not expect to have soreness so soon, so I am very hopeful that my results will be sooner than expected.  I will continue to update my results!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream twice a day now for 2 months and my cup size hasn&#x27;t increased at all!</li>
            <li> Did not seem to work at all</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two months and I have noticed an increase in my breast size! About half a cup size to be honest, but I am going to keep using this product for better results.</li>
            <li> i read alot before i tried any thing i&#x27;m 50 yrs old and just wanted some help with mother nature wanting to be funny! all though a size are two would be awesome, no change yet except my breast are really soft and my nipples stay hard and alert all the time will continue and keep you updated. the one thing that i complain about is for me the price gonea try to save for the 3 mth supply.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 months - twice a day, after a shower and with a hair dryer every single time.  Sadly, I haven&#x27;t seen any results.  :(  I realize that every body is different and will react differently.  Unfortunately, my body did not react successfully with this.  My boobs didn&#x27;t deflate any more but they are still the same measurement and still fill out my bra the same way. :(</li>
            <li> This product really works. Its two weeks and my boobs are not the size they were. They have become abit big. Am happy thx</li>
            <li> so far so good. on my second jar have got one week left till start jar 3. I am 32 A bra size but dont fill it out well. within first few days of using the cream I had aching in my breasts and pretty much the whole first month and still now which I think means its working.  also get itchy skin on my breast where must be stretching and getting bigger. I have noticed they look different slighly bigger. my partner noticing that they are gretting bigger :) I have measured and have grown an inch within 7 weeks.</li>
            <li> I started using naturaful two months ago and I am amazed with results. I have already referred 5 other women to naturaful that are planning to buy very soon. I work in a sales place where women need to look their best at all times. Believe it or not sexy sells!! Getting to know some of these ladies most of them have a complaint about breast size.  Back in high school I was a size C cup and then having my children and breastfeeding totally took that away from me. I went down to a very small B cup and could pull off an A.  It was super embarrassing that the first thing all my friends from Highschool noticed about me after they saw me with my kids was my boobs were gone. .. I am now back to a C cup. I tape once a week and I reached over 41/2 more inches around my breast that isn&#x27;t budging in only one month and even more after that. I&#x27;ve tried other products like breastful and they would get bigger but they would not stay bigger. But how I know naturaful works is that I sometimes forget to put some on in the mornings or at night and I am not losing my breast size.&lt;br /&gt;So, thank you guys so much!!!</li>
            <li> i used natural for only a month to try and seen my breasts becoming more firm and fitted! they have never felt more healthy and rounded. and ordering more. i bleieve IF MORE PEOPLE WOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THAT BACK THEY WOULD SEE BETTER RESULTS FOR THIER MONEY</li>
            <li> I am on my fourth jar (a little over 3 months use) and I see and fell &amp;#34;true mass&amp;#34; development in my chest and NOT water retention as I have experienced with other products. Yes, I am guilty of probably overuse in the first month, but have been able to level out the use to average 1 jar a month. If it makes any difference I am Asian, petite (5&#x27;3&amp;#34; &amp; 103 lbs), almost 40, &amp; have kids.  I started out on Naturaful a flat 34A &amp; now I am a FULL 34A.  In fact due to this development I purchased a 34B bra and it fits!  My initial goal was a FULL 34B, but due to the recent developments I may try for a nice 34C!  I purchased the 5 month  supply &amp; WILL put in another order of at least 5 more months supply because after almost 2 years of trying out other brands &amp; regiments I have finally found one that well...WORKS, Naturaful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously on other regiments that required oral ingestion of a pill, either once or up to 3 times a day, in addition to cream application.  Well the results were either weight gain due to water retention or a nice round behind which I am not complaining, but was not my goal.  If anyone is interested in gaining mass in the rear end, please contact me for the name of the product.  For all these reasons I am glad that I found Naturaful.  There are NO oral ingestion of a pill and the application fits into my daily life, like putting on lotion mornings &amp; nights.  In addition my progress is slow &amp; steady which proves that it works and not some overnight balloon blow up job which will deflate after time. Also in addition the support team is WONDERFUL!  What more can a customer ask for these days???</li>
            <li> I, like every female, am ashamed of my breast size. I used this product according to the directions every morning and every night. I did this for three months straight. I noticed after the three months I went up almost a whole cup size and breast were much firmer. I stopped using the product because i felt that it had stopped working because I had achieved that cup size before the three months were up. Well I remeasured myself out of curiosity about eight months later. the original marks still on the band (one for my band, and the other for my bust) to my surprise the bust was about five inches further from the last measurement. I was quite pleased to find that it continued to encourage breast development once I had stopped using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Note: I did not gain weight, as I am very physically active and I do not take any form of birth control, nor am I pregnant.</li>
            <li> First I am 21 years, I put the product on in the morning and sometimes in the evening (but not all the time in the evening.) Also it&#x27;s not a boob job and it&#x27;s not gonna make your breasts just magically appear in a day or so. It takes time also, I know it helps to stimulate them before you a apply the cream. You can look up different ways to massage and do so. But...&lt;br /&gt;By the second month I was up from an A to a B and my breast feel more full&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was satisfied I would recommend it to anyone looking for fuller breasts</li>
            <li> my wife has use the product for 2 1/2 month they are getting fuller I reorder 5 more jars she does not want to run out love the product</li>
            <li> Im am very skeptical but after I funish the 1 month supply I gave up but right when I finished it my breast started feeling sore... called the company and they said if u see results within the first three months is great cause it tske time for your breast to sart woking she sounded like a doctor she was so intelligent abiut the product and sold me im actually trying to get some on amazon right now..... listen if your not hsppy with the size what do u have to lose it either eirks or it doesnt give it a try be like me try the first month and if u dont see a difference then at least u tried it....then u can figure out other options</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but after 2 months my breasts are definitely fuller.  I was a 36c but not a full c cup. I&#x27;ve definitely am a full round pleasant C and am my breasts are not lopsided any more.</li>
            <li> This makes me skeptical for whether the product is authentic, and I am hesitant on trying the product. The product packaging looks different from the pictures that I&#x27;ve seen all around the Internet. The lid of the jar is relatively smaller than the real ones I&#x27;ve seen online..as well as the packing in general.</li>
            <li> I do admit I have always felt my breasts were a bit smaller than other women.&lt;br /&gt;Some women are bigger some are smaller, but if this really works and i can get to a size I am most comfortable with, why not give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;I have read many reviews about how it has worked wonders for them. I have used this for a month - started Feb 13th - and as I didn&#x27;t see a BIG change I am still hopeful that in the next month i start to see the change. *here&#x27;s hoping* :)</li>
            <li> I had no results from this. I used one jar and didn&#x27;t notice a change. I don&#x27;t think any of these creams work.</li>
            <li> I got laughed at by many for ordering this product but once I got it and not only myself but others could see results many have said they were going to order this I would highly recommend it and will be ordering more</li>
            <li> This product has no effect for me after 4 month. Maybe  for someone the product works in three month but not for me</li>
            <li> So far this product is working. There is a slow gradual change, but it is actually working. Will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> DO NOT!!!! Waste your money! I used 5 jars, applying twice a day and my breast size DID NOT change at all. Contains paraben that causes cancer. Their good reviews must be biased or paid. Their 60 days money back guarantee is a complete joke. You cannot return any open jars and need to be before 60 days which contradicts everything. They are saying results takes more than 3 to 6 months, then how would one know if their return policy is only for two months. Very disappointed and unhappy! Stop scamming people Naturalful!!!!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product I procrastinated with staying consistent but once I committed after about 2 weeks I noticed growth in my left breast...I hate having mix matched boobs but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s working. And the staff is very consistent with checking on my progress and willing to help in anyway possible.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work for me, i have been using it for 6 months and i see no changes at all...theres no treatment for boobs growing i guess no creams n no pills could make them bigger , i spend my money on something that gave me no results,well i tried!!!!! I DONT RECOMMEND THAT PRODUCT,WELL your choice....;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only my first month of using naturaful, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but I&#x27;m not giving up and will continue my journey :)</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome , meaning my progesterone ans estrogen were almost non exist and until put on birth control for hormonal treatment , I tried this product about 2 years before finally getting treatment and nothing happened. The only result I got was achey breast ,and I mean EXTREMELY sensitive I couldn&#x27;t even take deep breathes without pain. Do not waste your money on this product it contains parabins that can cause breast cancer , and it doesnt even work.</li>
            <li> After breastfeeding my boobs started sagging. I started using Naturaful and I&#x27;ve seen a drastic chance. My breast are firmer and fuller. I am very excited about this product and love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> I am 19 years old, Ive always had small breast. 32A cup size. I ordered directly from the site I recieved an emailed discount, I bought the 3 months package for about $118, not bad. Ive been using this product for a month and ive seen results, my breast are much fuller, rounder and my nipples are more in the middle rather than off to the sides. I always thought my breast were perky but they are much more perky. Ive been using it as told blow dryer then massage the cream in till its all obsorbed. Morning and night.ive noticed if u firget to do it the results dwindle. So keep up with breast management. I hope my breast grow more within the two more months ill report back with results. :) good luck everyone !</li>
