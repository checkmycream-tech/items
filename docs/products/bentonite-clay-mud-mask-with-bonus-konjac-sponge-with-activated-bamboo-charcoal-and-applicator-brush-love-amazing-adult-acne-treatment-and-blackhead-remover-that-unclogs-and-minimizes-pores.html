            <li>Still good.    </li>
            <li>I used this after a chemical peel and my skin felt SO good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for helping out with oily skin, though.</li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll have to have your own mixing bowl, that&#x27;s not metal, and you can&#x27;t use a metal spoon for some reason.</li>

            <li>It is really nice.</li>
            <li>A warm wash cloth can also be used.</li>
            <li>Leave on for 20-25 minutes and thoroughly wash out with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>As I age, I am looking into more products to keep me &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; looking and this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li>Love the brush for mixing up the powder and water together as well as for applying the clay to my face or body.</li>
            <li>Love using it for my knees when they are in pain.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>

            <li>I recieved my product two days after shipping and everything came as described I really love the brush it also includes</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth, and the smell is pretty good too</li>

            <li>a quality of the item is good, thanks to you!</li>
            <li>I had the GREAT IDEA to try my clay for a soak and WOW!</li>
            <li>Plus, the brush is really really cheap and comes misshapen so you won&#x27;t be able to use it for makeup either.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the free gifts that were included.</li>
            <li>Bentonite clay is absorbent, which makes it a great natural skin care tool.</li>

            <li>and so far it’s working great.  </li>
            <li>Used this a couple of times - so far I love it - makes my skin feel amazing!</li>

            <li>Adorable packaging and a sweet free gift.</li>
            <li>I can see some change in the fine lines that come with age.</li>
            <li>I think 10 minutes would be fine.            </li>
            <li>Its a really fine powder, mix with water or apple cider vinegar and apply to your face.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and does what it says it will do, PULL OUT THOSE TOXINS!</li>
            <li>The konjac sponge is gentle yet effective and the brush makes it easy to apply the mask in a smooth layer.</li>

            <li>I am excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference using this clay once a week on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>and I was extremely excited about the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to try this on my hair this weekend.</li>
            <li>I use the sponge to clean off the clay, it acts like as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>but I do like how clean my face feels after.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I tried this mask and it made my skin feel so clean I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>It makes my face supper clean.  </li>
            <li>I don’t think I have ever felt my hair so clean.  </li>
            <li>and I like it because I feel that it does clean my clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I thought that was pretty awesome anyways down to the product you do have to wash your face before applying a mask as any mask before doing you should.</li>
            <li>Choose the right !&lt;</li>
            <li>Really cool.  </li>
            <li>I also loved the facial brush and sponge it came with as gifts !</li>
            <li>My face felt super clean after and I have also noticed my face does not get as oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face felt smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great facial.</li>
            <li>last thing that I would like to note is that I had a question and Amaki responded very promptly and was very courteous in their response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please</li>
            <li>I would recommend using  baby wipes or warm baby wipes to remove as it can clog the drain a bit if not careful.  </li>
            <li>I used for the first time and felt my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this clay mask...make my skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li>I was terrified when I first used it and removed to see my skin was bright red</li>
            <li>This mask is pretty good but the only thing I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>I really like how this works!!</li>
            <li>Smaller pores, more even complexion and so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to be a return customer!</li>
            <li>It came so fast and the manufacturer was helpful and attentive.</li>
            <li>I add some lavender essential oils to the mixture and it makes it smell amazing and helps make me sleepy</li>
            <li>sponge is great for rinsing off the clay or for washing your face everyday.</li>
            <li>Amazing at how much better I feel just in a few months time.  </li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>I love the way that it feels going on with the soft brush.</li>
            <li>I love the way that it feels going on with the soft brush.</li>
            <li>They did however send a replacement, but when I submitted a second order because I loved this stuff so much, they again, didn&#x27;t send the brush and sponge, and said they would issue a replacement and never did.</li>
            <li>The brush it comes with is so soft as well :)</li>
            <li>I love my Bentonite clay, leaves skin baby butt soft</li>

            <li>It came together in a cute clear bag with a silver tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love how clear my skin looks as soon as take the mask off.</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>but this is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before using, I clean my face with the sponge that is included in this package to clear my face of any particles or residue that might prevent the mask from being completely smooth.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>When I first opened this product, I was a bit surprised to find that it was a powder, but I guess I should have read the description better.</li>
            <li>What a great little kit!</li>
            <li>I made my mask with the instructions on the label, which were very clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>I made my mask with the instructions on the label, which were very clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously used another brand of Bentonite Clay and felt that the Amaki Skincare clay was of equal quality, which is to say great!</li>
            <li>I used this last weekend for the first time,  First I used it as a face mask, my skin felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>I’ve used several different masks and this one has been the best by far.  </li>
            <li>It has given my skin new light.</li>
            <li>Pure as Bentonite clay gets!</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it was a powder, but it was easy to make the paste.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast</li>
            <li>This is a great clay mask however you need to get the consistency correct or will lump up but wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out.  </li>
            <li>that let you know exactly how to use this.</li>
            <li>but the cab product comes in is very generous !</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This mask really works and worth buying.</li>
            <li>after rinse off the skin is smooth &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>I first used this about a week ago</li>
            <li>thank you so much!</li>
            <li>MESSY AT FIRST BUT PRETTY GOOD STUFF</li>
            <li>Overall,  I&#x27;m glad that I purchased the product.</li>
            <li>Mask goes on smooth and leaves you soft and cuddly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling rejuvenated, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it arrives in a celophane package, ready to gift - if you don&#x27;t tear into it and start using it yourself!</li>
            <li>I have used many facial masks and clays in my life but have never seen one that came with a brush and sponge before.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so smooth, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Something clicked with me last December, in one more year I hit 60, since then I have been changing my life style, detox, healthier foods, and exercise.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin feel so clean and soft!</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this product and definitely recommend this product for someone who is looking for the perfect facial mask.</li>
            <li>Love the free little gift that came with it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an option to use directly in your bath that I&#x27;m excited to try.</li>

            <li>make my skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li>Love this mask, my skin is super soft after 2nd used.</li>
            <li>The seller even sends different &#x27;recipes&#x27; and ways to use their clay, which I enjoyed and thought very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It mixed fine and there was more than enough to cover my face.</li>
            <li>really love how it comes with a brush - definitely a unique feature that I haven&#x27;t seen before in my previous purchases of face masks, and the brush really helps to efficiently mix the clay powder with water before using.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>and I have had sensitivity to other facial cleansers/masks so this is great.</li>
            <li>my hair felt super soft and touchable afterwards.</li>
            <li>Metal bowls and utensils are not recommended since the clay absorbs metals and become less effective.</li>
            <li>I mixed this powder with Apple cider vinegar as instructed, and found it easy to apply to the face.  </li>
            <li>, I have facial dermatitis and it leaves my skin smooth and super soft!</li>

            <li>i love bentonite clay to deep clean my pores and make my skin feel so smooth and firm.  </li>
            <li>After I rinsed the mask off with warm water, I noticed my face was a little red, like a very mild sunburn</li>
            <li>The clay leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh and not as dry.</li>
            <li>I also liked the little sponge that was included.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a huge improvement in the overall quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>My problem is I always seem to mix up to much and wasting some of the product.</li>

            <li>It is very versatile.</li>
            <li>The package came fast but the product was tampered with.</li>
            <li>thank you so much~</li>
            <li>I spoke to customer service and she was very helpful.</li>

            <li>and she absolutely  loves it.</li>
            <li>felt like it really worked.</li>
            <li>I put in a tablespoon of Water and clay and had way too much.</li>
            <li>I use the sponge to remove the mask and I find that works very well.</li>
            <li>It really helped to gently remove the mask when I was finished.</li>
            <li>My skin and hair feel and look so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and nothing has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mask for anyone with skin like myself!</li>
            <li>Better than I expected</li>
            <li>really want to try using clay for a detox bath.</li>
            <li>I really like the immediate results from using the clay mask.</li>
            <li>I really like the immediate results from using the clay mask.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Amaki Skincare Bentonite Clay Mask!</li>
            <li>that didn&#x27;t seem to help too much at all.</li>
            <li>It really helps to get the product on my face and not all over my counter.</li>
            <li>I really like the healing benefits that it provides, even when I&#x27;m not mixing it with bentonite clay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to my wife she highly recommends Amaki Skincare Bentonite Clay Mask!</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I think it works best when you only apply a thin layer.</li>
            <li>I used this clay mask twice so far, and right now I like this clay mask a lot.</li>
            <li>We only left it on for the 10 mins and after removing it, my face was extremely smooth and felt so clean and detoxified.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product itself (clay) may be ok, but getting it on your face is not time friendly and clean up is kinda hard</li>
            <li>If you have stubborn skin conditions that have not responded to other treatments I would recommend you give this a shot as it helped me a lot even more than dermatologist visit .</li>
            <li>I noticed that this mask worked right away bringing to surface things that needed to come out of my clogged pores within the first 24 hours of using, I used extraction facial tools to clear them out right away</li>
            <li>When I was using this product for first time I had no idea how much water I should add which resulted in forming of lumps but second time I made right consistency and applied with the given brush.</li>
            <li>It left my skin refreshed, clean and glowing when I washed my face.</li>
            <li>It left my face refreshed and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This jar is HUGE and substantially heavy, and considering you don&#x27;t need to use that much each time, this jar is sure to last you months.</li>
            <li>So far I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Anxious to have another &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; bath in the comfort of my own bath.</li>
            <li>face always feels incredibly soft and smooth upon cleaning off the mask since this mask helps to exfoliate the dead skin cells and thoroughly clean out pores.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, without being too drippy or too dry</li>
            <li>I decided to use on my face, especially around the hairline, forehead, and corners of my nose area where I receive the most issues with flaking mixed with apple cider vineger and spring water.</li>
            <li>I received the product quick with no problems and simple directions on how to apply.</li>
            <li>It made her skin feel very soft and really helped with her Acne.</li>
            <li>it does get a little warm from the acid in the vinegar as it tightens, but it feels like a really good/expensive  facial treatment and it really really cleans your skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone looking to improve their skin texture to try this.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>---&amp;#62; HIGHLY recommend).</li>
            <li>so I made a huge mess the first time I opened it.</li>
            <li>Love this clay and the little extras that came with it.</li>
            <li>but it scrubs nicely without being too hard on the face.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how much it is.</li>
            <li>However, I still noticed my skin feeling tighened as it dried and regardless of how good/bad you are at mixing this, it&#x27;s amazing and works very well, especially when you add exfoliating to the process.  </li>
            <li>It was gentle on my sensitive skin that is recovering from using dr prescribed epiduo for hormonal jaw line acne.</li>
            <li>but needless to say, I am a happy customer</li>
            <li>so I used it right after I mixed it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always cautious about trying new products because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the size of the product.</li>
            <li>The jar is pretty big</li>
            <li>When I use it on my hair, I do not need to use any conditioner because it literally strips away ALL gunk from my hair, leaving it ridiculously soft!</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because the first time I ordered this product, they didn&#x27;t send the brush and sponge.</li>
            <li>It does make your face pretty red, so use it before bed.</li>
            <li>I totally messed up this mask the first two times I tried to mix it.</li>
            <li>I went to use this facial mud mask the first time and the accompanying brush broke.</li>
            <li>Be careful and don&#x27;t add too much liquid, which I did the first time, but the second time I was more careful</li>
            <li>I like this, but definitely do a skin test first.</li>
            <li>The time it takes is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>I have only done 2 treatments and even with the first treatment I could feel and see a difference.  </li>
            <li>and I have not seen any new breakouts, so it seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>The sponge is interesting and works nice on your face, but stinks!</li>
            <li>This clay is amazing, not only has the blemishes started to diminish, but I have no more blackheads at all.</li>
            <li>But this stuff just cakes up and makes a huge mess.</li>
            <li>my skin felt tight and refreshed and I was left with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I usually wipe as much of it off with my hands as I can, then use a washcloth to clean off any remaining parts of the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are other higher quality bentonite clays available on Amazon which can be used internally as well as externally and at a comparable price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised nobody has had this experience.</li>
            <li>She told me since I have sensitive skin, I should put it on for 10 mins.    </li>
            <li>My face felt so soft after I removed the mask</li>
            <li>It looked as though it was all ready open.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my skin feeling smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>as to purchase frequently in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you.</li>
            <li>So far I can see the changed of my face since I started used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far I see the change of my face since I started used this product.</li>
            <li>My acne is almost non existant now, but I also switched to all natural skin and body care regimen.</li>
            <li>but it can be used to make an all natural tooth paste.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, leave the clay for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wanted to use this for the amount of time I should have, (I have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased the product and so far I&#x27;ve used it 3 times.</li>
            <li>Like the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>my skin is sooo soft after using this and it feels tighter.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me, use water instead of vinegar.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft and radiant after one use</li>
            <li>The addition of the facial mask brush &amp; a Konjac facial sponge is a bonus that is worth buying just for these tools.</li>
            <li>It would have been too thick if I had not of added more liquid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to try actually using sparkling water the next time I use this product, but overall I am very pleased, especially since this product didn&#x27;t dry my face out.</li>
            <li>A little practice is needed to get the proper consistency with this mask, however, it is well worth it!!</li>
            <li>I let it sit on my face for 20 minutes and it felt funny when it started to dry.</li>
            <li>like my skin super sensitive so it stay for about an hour sometimes an hour and a half</li>
            <li>it clean skin without using harsh soap.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth and soft and I’ve noticed less oil and my pores look smaller as well.  </li>
            <li>She said its exactly like paying for a $100 facial at the local spa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The skin felt moisturized, though I still applied some of my usual light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, though I still applied some of my usual light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Washing it off with my fingers in the shower took a few minutes, so next time I will likely use a wash cloth to make sure to get it all off.</li>
            <li>Just be careful when opening the first time.</li>
            <li>She said she&#x27;s never found a product before that has made her skin feel so soft she&#x27;s seen a huge improvement in the overall quality of her skin and less breakouts too!</li>
            <li>At first it feels weird, then it feels nice and soothing, and then it gets annoying lol.</li>
            <li>A little messy on my first try, but once I got the hang of it, it was fine.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>I only tried couple of times that I have not seen clear result yet.  </li>
            <li>I was back to clear skin.</li>
            <li>The plastic wrapping was probably for either the jar or the mask brush and the natural konjac facial sponge.</li>
            <li>and it left my face feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>The following day, my skin will still be amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>Not only did my hair and scalp get cleansed but my hair is so soft and lustrous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the mask three times so far</li>
            <li>The product did begin tingling a bit while it was on my face, so I would advise people with extra sensitive skin to take caution.</li>
            <li>I used the clay as a mask when I mixed it with water and apple cider and my skin felt so soft after.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a natural and simple way to pamper myself, as well as to pass on to others!</li>
            <li>I did not really care for the texture too much for the facial, but it did leave my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this twice so far and already see my pores smaller and skin is clearer!!</li>
            <li>Just mixed this with aloe juice, an oil blend, co-wash base, glycerin, added peppermint oil and eucalyptus essential oil, and a preservative to make an awesome conditioning detox mask for my hair.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a pure Sodium Bentonite Clay for a clay mask or other homemade cosmetic uses, I would recommend Amaki Bentonite Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>

            <li>The brush is a joke and is not even strong enough in the least to put this clay on your face.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a super deep cleaning, removes all blackheads, dead skin, ect.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that my skin is very sensitive and  I can only leave it on my face for 10 minutes otherwise I feel like my face is burning.</li>
            <li>I normally have dry skin</li>
            <li>I purchased this a few weeks ago and have not stopped using it since I first started.  </li>
            <li>I would have given this product 5 stars, but it was pretty messy.</li>
            <li>I had very little flaking and no itching for a little more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>but my moms skin is a little bit more resilient so her irritation is literally not more than 10 minutes, and all it is is a bit of redness I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how my skin looks radiant and i use this mask about once ever 10 days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will enjoy this product when it gets much colder outside because that&#x27;s when my skin is the worst.</li>
            <li>My skin is a combination of oily and dry, it&#x27;s also sensitive (eczema prone).</li>
            <li>The most difficult part about this process in my opinion is cleaning off the mask, only because it can get pretty messy.</li>

            <li> I mix the product with water from the faucet, apply the mixture to my face once it comes to a good consistency, and leave it on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Good product prices.</li>
            <li> Still good.    </li>
            <li> I used this after a chemical peel and my skin felt SO good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for helping out with oily skin, though.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good Value&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> but I did notice a fair amount of difference in my complexion, pore reduction and skin tightness, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved that it came with the applicator brush and sponge.  </li>

            <li> So, I went on youtube to learn about bentonite since it&#x27;s suppose to be good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It feels so good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Product looks good.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I was offered to try this product at a discounted rate for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I keep hearing about how good it makes your hair and scalp feel.</li>
            <li> For the best results its best to follow the directions by using the equal amount of powder and vinegar (or water).</li>
            <li> The sponge and brush make it a great gift for a friend or family member :)</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> (I knew better lol).</li>

            <li> - it&#x27;s kind of like a spa getaway within the comforts of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> So, I tried it with the vinegar, as was suggested, and it comes out nicely now.</li>
            <li> Really a pain to get a good consistancy!!</li>
            <li> I really loved that it came with the free gifts!</li>
            <li> I just put some in a bowl and used warm water</li>
            <li> The brush is nice because it evenly distributes the clay all over.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to have your own mixing bowl, that&#x27;s not metal, and you can&#x27;t use a metal spoon for some reason.</li>
            <li> This was nice..</li>
            <li> I have tried so many masks from all price ranges and before this I loved glam glo</li>
            <li> thayers rose</li>
            <li> I received this at a promotional rate to try and then to review with my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> this was kind of an impulse purchase for me, but I say-</li>
            <li> Have your facials in the convenience of your own home.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t do it more than once a week, however, I have suffered with blemishes for a good 5 years</li>
            <li> The tools that came with it do comes in handy.</li>
            <li> It is really nice.</li>
            <li> A warm wash cloth can also be used.</li>
            <li> Leave on for 20-25 minutes and thoroughly wash out with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the konjac sponge included with the product yet since I already have another one open, but I do love that it is included and think that this product would truly make an excellent gift as noted in the title.</li>

            <li> I had the GREAT IDEA to try my clay for a soak and WOW!</li>
            <li> Plus, the brush is really really cheap and comes misshapen so you won&#x27;t be able to use it for makeup either.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the free gifts that were included.</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay is absorbent, which makes it a great natural skin care tool.</li>

            <li> and so far it’s working great.  </li>

            <li> I can see some change in the fine lines that come with age.</li>
            <li> I think 10 minutes would be fine.            </li>
            <li> Its a really fine powder, mix with water or apple cider vinegar and apply to your face.</li>

            <li> I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> and I was extremely excited about the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to try this on my hair this weekend.</li>
            <li> I use the sponge to clean off the clay, it acts like as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> but I do like how clean my face feels after.</li>

            <li> last thing that I would like to note is that I had a question and Amaki responded very promptly and was very courteous in their response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please</li>
            <li> I would recommend using  baby wipes or warm baby wipes to remove as it can clog the drain a bit if not careful.  </li>

            <li> This mask is pretty good but the only thing I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I really like how this works!!</li>
            <li> Smaller pores, more even complexion and so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to be a return customer!</li>
            <li> It came so fast and the manufacturer was helpful and attentive.</li>
            <li> I add some lavender essential oils to the mixture and it makes it smell amazing and helps make me sleepy</li>
            <li> sponge is great for rinsing off the clay or for washing your face everyday.</li>
            <li> Amazing at how much better I feel just in a few months time.  </li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>

            <li> I love the way that it feels going on with the soft brush.</li>
            <li> They did however send a replacement, but when I submitted a second order because I loved this stuff so much, they again, didn&#x27;t send the brush and sponge, and said they would issue a replacement and never did.</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with is so soft as well :)</li>

            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> but this is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before using, I clean my face with the sponge that is included in this package to clear my face of any particles or residue that might prevent the mask from being completely smooth.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> When I first opened this product, I was a bit surprised to find that it was a powder, but I guess I should have read the description better.</li>
            <li> What a great little kit!</li>
            <li> I made my mask with the instructions on the label, which were very clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> I made my mask with the instructions on the label, which were very clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used another brand of Bentonite Clay and felt that the Amaki Skincare clay was of equal quality, which is to say great!</li>
            <li> I used this last weekend for the first time,  First I used it as a face mask, my skin felt amazing.  </li>
            <li> I’ve used several different masks and this one has been the best by far.  </li>
            <li> It has given my skin new light.</li>
            <li> Pure as Bentonite clay gets!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was a powder, but it was easy to make the paste.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast</li>
            <li> This is a great clay mask however you need to get the consistency correct or will lump up but wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out.  </li>
            <li> that let you know exactly how to use this.</li>
            <li> but the cab product comes in is very generous !</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This mask really works and worth buying.</li>
            <li> after rinse off the skin is smooth &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li> I first used this about a week ago</li>
            <li> thank you so much!</li>
            <li> MESSY AT FIRST BUT PRETTY GOOD STUFF</li>
            <li> Overall,  I&#x27;m glad that I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> Mask goes on smooth and leaves you soft and cuddly.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling rejuvenated, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it arrives in a celophane package, ready to gift - if you don&#x27;t tear into it and start using it yourself!</li>
            <li> I have used many facial masks and clays in my life but have never seen one that came with a brush and sponge before.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so smooth, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Something clicked with me last December, in one more year I hit 60, since then I have been changing my life style, detox, healthier foods, and exercise.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so clean and soft!</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this product and definitely recommend this product for someone who is looking for the perfect facial mask.</li>
            <li> Love the free little gift that came with it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an option to use directly in your bath that I&#x27;m excited to try.</li>
            <li> originally bought this for my 16yrs old son, has acne.  </li>

            <li> make my skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li> Love this mask, my skin is super soft after 2nd used.</li>
            <li> The seller even sends different &#x27;recipes&#x27; and ways to use their clay, which I enjoyed and thought very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It mixed fine and there was more than enough to cover my face.</li>
            <li> really love how it comes with a brush - definitely a unique feature that I haven&#x27;t seen before in my previous purchases of face masks, and the brush really helps to efficiently mix the clay powder with water before using.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> and I have had sensitivity to other facial cleansers/masks so this is great.</li>
            <li> my hair felt super soft and touchable afterwards.</li>
            <li> Metal bowls and utensils are not recommended since the clay absorbs metals and become less effective.</li>
            <li> I mixed this powder with Apple cider vinegar as instructed, and found it easy to apply to the face.  </li>
            <li> , I have facial dermatitis and it leaves my skin smooth and super soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients: 100% pure Sodium Bentonite Clay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love bentonite clay to deep clean my pores and make my skin feel so smooth and firm.  </li>
            <li> After I rinsed the mask off with warm water, I noticed my face was a little red, like a very mild sunburn</li>
            <li> The clay leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh and not as dry.</li>
            <li> I also liked the little sponge that was included.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a huge improvement in the overall quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> My problem is I always seem to mix up to much and wasting some of the product.</li>
            <li> I thank you fast shipping</li>

            <li> It is very versatile.</li>

            <li> and she absolutely  loves it.</li>
            <li> felt like it really worked.</li>
            <li> I put in a tablespoon of Water and clay and had way too much.</li>
            <li> I use the sponge to remove the mask and I find that works very well.</li>
            <li> It really helped to gently remove the mask when I was finished.</li>
            <li> My skin and hair feel and look so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and nothing has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mask for anyone with skin like myself!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected</li>
            <li> really want to try using clay for a detox bath.</li>
            <li> I really like the immediate results from using the clay mask.</li>
            <li> I really like the immediate results from using the clay mask.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Amaki Skincare Bentonite Clay Mask!</li>
            <li> that didn&#x27;t seem to help too much at all.</li>
            <li> It really helps to get the product on my face and not all over my counter.</li>
            <li> I really like the healing benefits that it provides, even when I&#x27;m not mixing it with bentonite clay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to my wife she highly recommends Amaki Skincare Bentonite Clay Mask!</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I think it works best when you only apply a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I used this clay mask twice so far, and right now I like this clay mask a lot.</li>
            <li> We only left it on for the 10 mins and after removing it, my face was extremely smooth and felt so clean and detoxified.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product itself (clay) may be ok, but getting it on your face is not time friendly and clean up is kinda hard</li>
            <li> If you have stubborn skin conditions that have not responded to other treatments I would recommend you give this a shot as it helped me a lot even more than dermatologist visit .</li>
            <li> I noticed that this mask worked right away bringing to surface things that needed to come out of my clogged pores within the first 24 hours of using, I used extraction facial tools to clear them out right away</li>
            <li> When I was using this product for first time I had no idea how much water I should add which resulted in forming of lumps but second time I made right consistency and applied with the given brush.</li>
            <li> It left my skin refreshed, clean and glowing when I washed my face.</li>
            <li> It left my face refreshed and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This jar is HUGE and substantially heavy, and considering you don&#x27;t need to use that much each time, this jar is sure to last you months.</li>
            <li> So far I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Anxious to have another &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; bath in the comfort of my own bath.</li>
            <li> face always feels incredibly soft and smooth upon cleaning off the mask since this mask helps to exfoliate the dead skin cells and thoroughly clean out pores.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, without being too drippy or too dry</li>
            <li> I decided to use on my face, especially around the hairline, forehead, and corners of my nose area where I receive the most issues with flaking mixed with apple cider vineger and spring water.</li>
            <li> I received the product quick with no problems and simple directions on how to apply.</li>
            <li> It made her skin feel very soft and really helped with her Acne.</li>
            <li> it does get a little warm from the acid in the vinegar as it tightens, but it feels like a really good/expensive  facial treatment and it really really cleans your skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone looking to improve their skin texture to try this.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ---&amp;#62; HIGHLY recommend).</li>
            <li> so I made a huge mess the first time I opened it.</li>
            <li> Love this clay and the little extras that came with it.</li>
            <li> but it scrubs nicely without being too hard on the face.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how much it is.</li>
            <li> However, I still noticed my skin feeling tighened as it dried and regardless of how good/bad you are at mixing this, it&#x27;s amazing and works very well, especially when you add exfoliating to the process.  </li>
            <li> It was gentle on my sensitive skin that is recovering from using dr prescribed epiduo for hormonal jaw line acne.</li>
            <li> but needless to say, I am a happy customer</li>
            <li> so I used it right after I mixed it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always cautious about trying new products because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the size of the product.</li>
            <li> The jar is pretty big</li>
            <li> When I use it on my hair, I do not need to use any conditioner because it literally strips away ALL gunk from my hair, leaving it ridiculously soft!</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because the first time I ordered this product, they didn&#x27;t send the brush and sponge.</li>
            <li> It does make your face pretty red, so use it before bed.</li>
            <li> I totally messed up this mask the first two times I tried to mix it.</li>
            <li> I went to use this facial mud mask the first time and the accompanying brush broke.</li>
            <li> Be careful and don&#x27;t add too much liquid, which I did the first time, but the second time I was more careful</li>
            <li> I like this, but definitely do a skin test first.</li>
            <li> The time it takes is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> I have only done 2 treatments and even with the first treatment I could feel and see a difference.  </li>
            <li> and I have not seen any new breakouts, so it seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> The sponge is interesting and works nice on your face, but stinks!</li>
            <li> This clay is amazing, not only has the blemishes started to diminish, but I have no more blackheads at all.</li>
            <li> But this stuff just cakes up and makes a huge mess.</li>
            <li> my skin felt tight and refreshed and I was left with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I usually wipe as much of it off with my hands as I can, then use a washcloth to clean off any remaining parts of the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are other higher quality bentonite clays available on Amazon which can be used internally as well as externally and at a comparable price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised nobody has had this experience.</li>
            <li> She told me since I have sensitive skin, I should put it on for 10 mins.    </li>
            <li> My face felt so soft after I removed the mask</li>
            <li> It looked as though it was all ready open.</li>
            <li> It always leaves my skin feeling smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> as to purchase frequently in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you.</li>
            <li> So far I can see the changed of my face since I started used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far I see the change of my face since I started used this product.</li>
            <li> My acne is almost non existant now, but I also switched to all natural skin and body care regimen.</li>
            <li> but it can be used to make an all natural tooth paste.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, leave the clay for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this for the amount of time I should have, (I have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product and so far I&#x27;ve used it 3 times.</li>
            <li> Like the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> my skin is sooo soft after using this and it feels tighter.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, use water instead of vinegar.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft and radiant after one use</li>
            <li> The addition of the facial mask brush &amp; a Konjac facial sponge is a bonus that is worth buying just for these tools.</li>
            <li> It would have been too thick if I had not of added more liquid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably going to try actually using sparkling water the next time I use this product, but overall I am very pleased, especially since this product didn&#x27;t dry my face out.</li>
            <li> A little practice is needed to get the proper consistency with this mask, however, it is well worth it!!</li>
            <li> I let it sit on my face for 20 minutes and it felt funny when it started to dry.</li>
            <li> like my skin super sensitive so it stay for about an hour sometimes an hour and a half</li>
            <li> it clean skin without using harsh soap.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth and soft and I’ve noticed less oil and my pores look smaller as well.  </li>
            <li> She said its exactly like paying for a $100 facial at the local spa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin felt moisturized, though I still applied some of my usual light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , though I still applied some of my usual light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Washing it off with my fingers in the shower took a few minutes, so next time I will likely use a wash cloth to make sure to get it all off.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when opening the first time.</li>
            <li> She said she&#x27;s never found a product before that has made her skin feel so soft she&#x27;s seen a huge improvement in the overall quality of her skin and less breakouts too!</li>
            <li> At first it feels weird, then it feels nice and soothing, and then it gets annoying lol.</li>
            <li> A little messy on my first try, but once I got the hang of it, it was fine.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> I only tried couple of times that I have not seen clear result yet.  </li>
            <li> I was back to clear skin.</li>
            <li> The plastic wrapping was probably for either the jar or the mask brush and the natural konjac facial sponge.</li>
            <li> and it left my face feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> The following day, my skin will still be amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> Not only did my hair and scalp get cleansed but my hair is so soft and lustrous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the mask three times so far</li>
            <li> The product did begin tingling a bit while it was on my face, so I would advise people with extra sensitive skin to take caution.</li>
            <li> I used the clay as a mask when I mixed it with water and apple cider and my skin felt so soft after.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a natural and simple way to pamper myself, as well as to pass on to others!</li>
            <li> I did not really care for the texture too much for the facial, but it did leave my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice so far and already see my pores smaller and skin is clearer!!</li>
            <li> Just mixed this with aloe juice, an oil blend, co-wash base, glycerin, added peppermint oil and eucalyptus essential oil, and a preservative to make an awesome conditioning detox mask for my hair.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a pure Sodium Bentonite Clay for a clay mask or other homemade cosmetic uses, I would recommend Amaki Bentonite Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>

            <li> The brush is a joke and is not even strong enough in the least to put this clay on your face.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a super deep cleaning, removes all blackheads, dead skin, ect.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that my skin is very sensitive and  I can only leave it on my face for 10 minutes otherwise I feel like my face is burning.</li>
            <li> I normally have dry skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago and have not stopped using it since I first started.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars, but it was pretty messy.</li>
            <li> I had very little flaking and no itching for a little more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> but my moms skin is a little bit more resilient so her irritation is literally not more than 10 minutes, and all it is is a bit of redness I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how my skin looks radiant and i use this mask about once ever 10 days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will enjoy this product when it gets much colder outside because that&#x27;s when my skin is the worst.</li>
            <li> My skin is a combination of oily and dry, it&#x27;s also sensitive (eczema prone).</li>
            <li> The most difficult part about this process in my opinion is cleaning off the mask, only because it can get pretty messy.</li>
            <li> This is made of 100% pure sodium Bentonite clay powder that you mix with raw apple cider vinegar or water and works well for detoxifying your skin.</li>
            <li> Even gentle enough to use on my little ones arm without irritation!</li>
            <li> I also used it as a hair mask on my natural kinky, coily hair and it cleaned my scalp extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman and after just one application you can see and feel a major difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Being that I&#x27;m not one to go to the spa like a lot of others, I found a major benefit in using this for my middle aged, country woman with some sun</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way!</li>
            <li> and it will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> and it will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> and it will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> In the morning my face was so clear and soft and tight !!</li>
            <li> leaves my skin very soft, stings a little and redness after but it goes away....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as bad with her using a more natural product</li>
            <li> It will dry your face out so you will definitely need to moisturize after you wash it off your face.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 20 minutes and washed it off when it was dry.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would use a wooden coffee stirring stick that I have in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the clay mixture to my face and let it dry for about 15-20 minutes before getting in the shower.</li>
            <li> However if you have dry skin,you don&#x27;t want to over do it with applications especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> The mask brush and the natural konjac facial sponge were missing.</li>
            <li> One jar of this will last a VERY long time!</li>
            <li> A little messy on my first once you figure it out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a pain and something you&#x27;ll find you will only drag out on a Saturday when you have no plans.</li>
            <li> will keep for long time use.</li>
            <li> It was much larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve used it just a few times so far</li>
            <li> Have used it serval times and same result , my skin has finally calmed down since finding this miracle mask.</li>
            <li> Sodium Bentonite expands when wet and absorbs as much as several times its dry mass in water.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes you could feel the clay absorbing into your pores and pulling them tight.  </li>
            <li> I could definitely feel a difference on how tight my pores was, especially on my chin and around my nose.  </li>
            <li> other than equal parts clay and water.</li>
            <li> I mixed the clay and water in my palm with the index finger of the other hand.</li>
            <li> Can use several other ingredients to customize your mask.</li>
            <li> Decided it was time to add some other personal habits in my routine.  </li>
            <li> it gives a tighten feeling when getting dry.  </li>
            <li> Helps dry out skin irritations</li>
            <li> My skin is combination dry around jawline and cheeks/oily in the &#x27;T&#x27; zone.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before because I thought they were too messy and inconvenient, but I was surprised at how easy this was.</li>
            <li> The only thing I need to mention is a little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I did have 1 small acne breakout on one side of my face after my second use, however by the 3rd use (7 day intervals)</li>
            <li> You use such a small amount of the powder to make a paste that one jar used every 3 days will last for MONTHS.</li>
            <li> I also found the texture of this powder to be strange and unlike other bentonite clay I have used before.</li>
            <li> I mixed about 1 teaspoon of the clay with some water and kept adding a little of the clay/water until it reached the consistency.</li>
            <li> little difficult to mix up smoothly, so expect some lumps.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the lid was partially opened.</li>
            <li> Some of the toxins it draws out comes from toxins we come into contact with everyday such as substances in buildings, cleaning supplies, paint, car pollution, heavy metal such as lead, mercury,etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s composed of aged volcanic ash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cautious when it comes to putting anything on my face since I had broken out and been burned from products before.</li>
            <li> This mask dried up acne but left a rash on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> My order actually came with a few bonus items- face brush and cloth.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend to apply this mask before taking bath or just remove it with wet wipes or wet cloth.</li>
            <li> and it still made my face pink but was gone by the time I woke up.</li>
            <li> since the title says its organic, I expected the packaging to say organic or have an organic seal somewhere on it</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I usually straighten daily and after a lot of straightening my curls turned into waves after washes and often looks really dry but</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I used this just once the other night after I got it</li>
            <li> I use for my son&#x27;s scarring due to his cystic acne.</li>
            <li> The second time around I started with the desired amount of liquid in a bowl, and little by little added the clay until it was the desired consistency.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I used this product the other night</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try at first</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cold feeling when 1st applied, then in 15-20 minutes super tightening.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s hard to mix, especially it</li>
            <li> It was difficult to mix the two together and the result was very clumpy, having almost a jelly like consistenty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having constant breakouts for the past few years.</li>
            <li> Previously, my skincare routine consisted of an exfoliator followed by a mask, but this product has allowed me to combine those two steps into one.</li>
            <li> It says on the directions to allow the mix to sit for about half an hour before using it, but I was in a hurry</li>
            <li> The smell of apple cider vinegar is unpleasant to add, but the benefits of it are worth adding to the clay.</li>
            <li> Dang thing turned into a clumpy mess that was in no way a pasty consistency that could be spread on any surface.</li>
            <li> The sponge it comes with feels a bit &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; while holding it when wet (not sure how to describe it)</li>
            <li> : When clay dries on your skin, it makes the skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel really tight while it dries and hardens on your face.</li>
            <li> Lately my skin has been so dry and nothing has worked until this.</li>
            <li> I did add about 4 drops of water to thin down the mid, it bursh on my face like silk.  </li>
            <li> kinda leaves a little bit of irritation for about 30mins-hour depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li> it burned my face a little.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions but still had a little trouble getting the consistency of the mask</li>
            <li> I used vinegar this time and it was a little harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> I will update after I have used this a few times</li>
            <li> There was plastic wrapping that was left behind.</li>
            <li> The clay harden after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my breakouts.</li>

            <li> She used it a few times with vinegar and a few times with just water.</li>
            <li> then some of the harsh chemicals with had been using on her face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now</li>
            <li> , someone from their team send a few uses for the cream, one of them was as a hair mask.</li>
            <li> Ordered less than three days ago and it is already here!</li>
            <li> less the liquid you add) as a kit!</li>
            <li> I used the clay with raw apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> My wife used the clay with raw apple cider vinegar once every 3 days</li>
            <li> (¾ cup Bentonite Clay + 1cup of water + cup raw apple cider vinegar +</li>
            <li> Not very impressed that I spent that money and can&#x27;t use it on my face for fear of burning it.</li>
            <li> I tested a small area for 5 mins, and no redness or burn.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, usually Sunday night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have horrible skin, but I always seem to have one more two pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> After getting out of the shower, I applied my usual moisturizer (organic Argan Oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite</li>
            <li> No more digging the clay out from under my finger nails.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and the odor isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40, I&#x27;ve had bad skin since I was a teenager, to have some form of clear skin has brought up my confidence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a common ingredient in cleansing products.</li>
            <li> I use it once or twice a week and and have never had a negative reaction.</li>
            <li> Even with 3 parts liquid to 1 part clay, it was way too thick for the brush to spread.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try guys, it&#x27;s hard to goof this one up!</li>
            <li> I used the included brush and applied a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and am obsessed!</li>
            <li> Not in a bad way, just tickled a little.</li>
            <li> I had tried Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow pomade and it made me breakout horribly and this is helping clear my skin.</li>
            <li> Way less expensive too!!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a weird funky smell that I can&#x27;t even describe.</li>
            <li> the fan brush is useless.</li>
            <li> it absorbs the dirty from my pore.</li>
            <li> I put it into my cold process soaps, melt &amp; pour soaps, and masks.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why it worked so terribly with water by itself.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product. My skin is Noticeably softer and smoother</li>
            <li> I think it works best when you only apply a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I just love this one! It makes my skin very smooth, and the smell is pretty good too</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it on my face, my hair and I even put it in my bath to detox.. My skin feels great afterwards. My problem is I always seem to mix up to much and wasting some of the product. A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing!  There&#x27;s an option to use directly in your bath that I&#x27;m excited to try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for at home facials. Even comes with application brush.</li>
            <li> Amazing purchase at a great price! I&#x27;m a huge beauty junkie so my drawers are filled with products, but I have to say this clay mask is the best one I have tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love how it comes with a brush - definitely a unique feature that I haven&#x27;t seen before in my previous purchases of face masks, and the brush really helps to efficiently mix the clay powder with water before using. This jar is HUGE and substantially heavy, and considering you don&#x27;t need to use that much each time, this jar is sure to last you months. I look forward to using this each week - it&#x27;s kind of like a spa getaway within the comforts of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using, I clean my face with the sponge that is included in this package to clear my face of any particles or residue that might prevent the mask from being completely smooth. I mix the product with water from the faucet, apply the mixture to my face once it comes to a good consistency, and leave it on for 20 minutes. The most difficult part about this process in my opinion is cleaning off the mask, only because it can get pretty messy. I usually wipe as much of it off with my hands as I can, then use a washcloth to clean off any remaining parts of the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face always feels incredibly soft and smooth upon cleaning off the mask since this mask helps to exfoliate the dead skin cells and thoroughly clean out pores. Previously, my skincare routine consisted of an exfoliator followed by a mask, but this product has allowed me to combine those two steps into one. I have acne-prone skin and I definitely feel like this has cleaned out my pores to aid in reducing acne breakouts. Love this product - have already recommended to my sister and aunts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> Good product prices. I thank you fast shipping</li>
            <li> I felt smoother skin after using the product&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very good</li>
            <li> Well, I mixed one part clay to 4 parts water. Dang thing turned into a clumpy mess that was in no way a pasty consistency that could be spread on any surface. It&#x27;s almost like it coagulated. I&#x27;m surprised nobody has had this experience. I&#x27;ll purchase some vinegar to see if that helps keep the mixture from clumping up. Will change review if I can make this stuff work.  UPDATE: So, I tried it with the vinegar, as was suggested, and it comes out nicely now. Not sure why it worked so terribly with water by itself. Anyway, the product is great--you can&#x27;t beat the price, either!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something natural and organic to clean my face with and I think I found it. The jar is pretty big so you are getting plenty to work with. There are detailed instructions that come included that let you know exactly how to use this. I am excited to try this out. I will update after I have used this a few times</li>
            <li> The konjac sponge is gentle yet effective and the brush makes it easy to apply the mask in a smooth layer. I love the way that it feels going on with the soft brush. It really helps to get the product on my face and not all over my counter. The jar is huge, a whopping 16 ounces and it will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this -- used it on my face, but going to do a body mask! Feels great!</li>
            <li> great quality! good price!!</li>
            <li> Really a pain to get a good consistancy!! But good product!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this Organic Bentonite Clay Mask from Amaki Skincare! I really loved that it came with the free gifts! The konjac sponge is gentle yet effective and the brush makes it easy to apply the mask in a smooth layer. I love the way that it feels going on with the soft brush. It really helps to get the product on my face and not all over my counter. The jar is huge, a whopping 16 ounces and it will definitely last a long time. I made my mask with the instructions on the label, which were very clear and easy to understand. I opted for the apple cider vinegar mask over the one made with water. I really like the healing benefits that it provides, even when I&#x27;m not mixing it with bentonite clay. Overall I really like this product and definitely recommend this product for someone who is looking for the perfect facial mask.</li>
            <li> This clay is absolutely AMAZING!!! It is very versatile. You can use it on your hair, face, and body! My favorite is on my fave. I just put some in a bowl and used warm water and  I made a face mask. It will dry your face out so you will definitely need to moisturize after you wash it off your face. But I love it!!</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so clean and soft! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> The package came fast but the product was tampered with. When I opened the package, the lid was partially opened. The mask brush and the natural konjac facial sponge were missing. There was plastic wrapping that was left behind. The plastic wrapping was probably for either the jar or the mask brush and the natural konjac facial sponge.</li>
            <li> Bentonite Clay is a great way to detox your skin and hair. For skin use 1-2 times a week and for hair 1-2 times a month. I love the feel of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> it smells kinda funky with the apple cider vinegar but its making my skin super fresh :). kinda leaves a little bit of irritation for about 30mins-hour depending on your skin type. like my skin super sensitive so it stay for about an hour sometimes an hour and a half but my moms skin is a little bit more resilient so her irritation is literally not more than 10 minutes, and all it is is a bit of redness I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how my skin looks radiant and i use this mask about once ever 10 days or so i also use Halyuronic acid afterwards. so i don&#x27;t know if the credit goes to the acid i kinda believe its the clay my skin always feels great afterwards</li>
            <li> I used this in my bath and I&#x27;m still not too sure how I feel about it. My skin was a bit softer when I got out of the tub</li>
            <li> I love it. thank you so much~</li>
            <li> it is a clay powder, so you will need to mix with spring water or apple vinegar.  i have tried all over my face, hair and scalp.  it gives a tighten feeling when getting dry.  After wash off, skin shows a whiter shade.&lt;br /&gt;also came with a facial sponge.  it clean skin without using harsh soap.</li>
            <li> My skin is a combination of oily and dry, it&#x27;s also sensitive (eczema prone). I was introduced by a friend to Bentonite Clay who swears by Amaki&#x27;s Clay Mask . So I researched and this is what I found: It detoxifier and considered one of the most effective clays.  The bentonite clay helps by adsorption of the toxins while increasing immunity and reduces inflammation. Some of the toxins it draws out comes from toxins we come into contact with everyday such as substances in buildings, cleaning supplies, paint, car pollution, heavy metal such as lead, mercury,etc. It&#x27;s composed of aged volcanic ash. It&#x27;s also a common ingredient in cleansing products. It&#x27;s used as a hair care product, face and body skin care.    I&#x27;m very cautious when it comes to putting anything on my face since I had broken out and been burned from products before. When I received Amaki&#x27;s bentonite clay mask product, I did a test on my arm for about 10 mins. So far so good. Then I tried 20 mins. Still good.    I did the same with my face. I tested a small area for 5 mins, and no redness or burn. I spoke to customer service and she was very helpful. She told me since I have sensitive skin, I should put it on for 10 mins.    The clay harden after a few minutes. Then I washed my face and boy was I impressed. My face looked clean, my skin felt smooth and no signs of irritation. I&#x27;m so happy I finally found a mask that works for me.    Besides the masks, the gifts are great. I received a brush and a sponge. The brush is nice because it evenly distributes the clay all over. I use the sponge to clean off the clay, it acts like as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> easily my favorite mask that i use.  i love bentonite clay to deep clean my pores and make my skin feel so smooth and firm.  will purchase again when i run out!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friends daughter and she loves it, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask!  I have been using for several weeks now and I have used it twice per week.  It goes on smoothly, without being too drippy or too dry and I leave it on for about 10 - 15 mts (I go do something else while it is on....so I KNOW it does not drip off) and then I rinse it off - it comes off easily and cleanly. My skin feels so wonderful afterwards!  So smooth and refreshed!  I highly recommend anyone looking to improve their skin texture to try this.</li>
            <li> Pain in the rear to use this stuff. They give you this big jar of powder and basically no directions on how to use it ....other than equal parts clay and water.You&#x27;ll have to have your own mixing bowl, that&#x27;s not metal, and you can&#x27;t use a metal spoon for some reason. The brush is a joke and is not even strong enough in the least to put this clay on your face. Plus, the brush is really really cheap and comes misshapen so you won&#x27;t be able to use it for makeup either. The sponge is interesting and works nice on your face, but stinks! Even after using it with a nice smelling cleanser and rinsing your face totally clean, you cannot get the smell off....And it&#x27;s a weird funky smell that I can&#x27;t even describe. Overall, the product itself (clay) may be ok, but getting it on your face is not time friendly and clean up is kinda hard bc the clay dries fast.....it&#x27;s just a pain and something you&#x27;ll find you will only drag out on a Saturday when you have no plans.</li>
            <li> Great product! I was surprised how much it is. The sponge and brush make it a great gift for a friend or family member :)</li>
            <li> Great product for price!</li>
            <li> This is a great clay mask however you need to get the consistency correct or will lump up but wasn&#x27;t too hard to figure out.  I would recommend using  baby wipes or warm baby wipes to remove as it can clog the drain a bit if not careful.  Have used it three times and each and every time my skin feels great and feels and looks like the pores are decreasing. Would highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> Great value, great quality!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love this clay mask...it absorbs the dirty from my pore. make my skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li> Very effective and I love the brush...it also gives you instructions on how to use the product...Great product!</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome. That makes my face skin so smooth and moisture. I love it and I will keep buying when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> I used this last weekend for the first time,  First I used it as a face mask, my skin felt amazing.  I mixed with apple vinegar although you can use spring water to mix also.  I also used it in the bath tub, I think it works best as a mask.</li>
            <li> This is very good!! reasonable price~~</li>
            <li> I bought his product with a discount code and was told to leave my unbiased opinion. I used this just once the other night after I got it and it left my face feeling really soft. I left it on for about 15 minutes and that&#x27;s all I needed.</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I never want to run out!</li>
            <li> Ordered less than three days ago and it is already here! Used the product and it works great.</li>
            <li> This mask dried up acne but left a rash on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I simply loooooove it!</li>
            <li> I really like how this works!!</li>
            <li> The product is AMAZING, I love it so much I bought 2 of these. It gives my skin a super deep cleaning, removes all blackheads, dead skin, ect. My skin is always red after use but that goes away in a couple hours. The following day, my skin will still be amazingly soft. When I use it on my hair, I do not need to use any conditioner because it literally strips away ALL gunk from my hair, leaving it ridiculously soft! The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because the first time I ordered this product, they didn&#x27;t send the brush and sponge. They did however send a replacement, but when I submitted a second order because I loved this stuff so much, they again, didn&#x27;t send the brush and sponge, and said they would issue a replacement and never did. The product its self is amazing, but the quality control of making sure products are included, could use some help.</li>
            <li> Just mixed this with aloe juice, an oil blend, co-wash base, glycerin, added peppermint oil and eucalyptus essential oil, and a preservative to make an awesome conditioning detox mask for my hair.  Not only did my hair and scalp get cleansed but my hair is so soft and lustrous. Bentonite Clay has awesome detoxing capabilities and I will soon make a mask for my face. I love that this brand, it was awesome that it comes with facial accessories to truly make using this clay feel like going to the spa.</li>
            <li> I have problems with flaky and itchy scalp. I used a mixture of Bentonite Clay Mask mixed with Apple Cider Vineger and various oils on my hair and scalp. I had very little flaking and no itching for a little more than 2 weeks. I decided to use on my face, especially around the hairline, forehead, and corners of my nose area where I receive the most issues with flaking mixed with apple cider vineger and spring water. The result was no itching or flaking and it has been about 4 days. I love this stuff and will continue to use it on my hair and face. My next plan is to use it as a foot detox.</li>
            <li> Love love this stuff for skin detoxing and clearing up blemishes</li>
            <li> This is great! It does make your face pretty red, so use it before bed. I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a week - but, it is so clarifying and nice...</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, great quality, very nice seller !! Definitely going to by again!</li>
            <li> Really cool.  Felt great.</li>
            <li> My face felt so soft after I removed the mask and it was super easy to put on. I even used it in my hair...my hair felt super soft and touchable afterwards. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The best mask I&#x27;ve ever tried! Goes on easy and makes your skin feel so healthy!</li>
            <li> Love this mask, my skin is super soft after 2nd used. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Nice! will keep for long time use.</li>
            <li> I love this clay.  It helps so much with my acne. The only problem is that my skin is very sensitive and  I can only leave it on my face for 10 minutes otherwise I feel like my face is burning. My mom tried this and she absolutely  loves it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing -- reduces bumps and redness from acne after one use.&lt;br /&gt;A little difficult to mix up smoothly, so expect some lumps.</li>
            <li> I use for my son&#x27;s scarring due to his cystic acne. It literally rid of the chronic infection and swelling of the keloid scarring. We finally found a product that works!</li>
            <li> This was nice..I used it in the bath for a detox bath..felt like it really worked.Anxious to have another &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; bath in the comfort of my own bath.Way less expensive too!!</li>
            <li> I totally messed up this mask the first two times I tried to mix it. However, I still noticed my skin feeling tighened as it dried and regardless of how good/bad you are at mixing this, it&#x27;s amazing and works very well, especially when you add exfoliating to the process.  My skin felt flawless and smooth afterwards even though I clearly didn&#x27;t follow the instructions :/ Give it a try guys, it&#x27;s hard to goof this one up!</li>
            <li> My daughter love it. She skin look great and it even had a glow.</li>
            <li> One jar of this will last a VERY long time! The powder is wonderfully smooth, comes with a nice applicator brush and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My order actually came with a few bonus items- face brush and cloth. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and am obsessed!</li>
            <li> I used this after a chemical peel and my skin felt SO good. The only thing I need to mention is a little bit goes a LONG way. I put in a tablespoon of Water and clay and had way too much.</li>
            <li> a quality of the item is good, thanks to you!</li>
            <li> My skin on my face feels so smooth already after one try</li>
            <li> O.M.G. Love this mask! Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair!!!</li>
            <li> love the brush and sponge came with it. I only tried couple of times that I have not seen clear result yet.  So far I like it very much. Great service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my breakouts. It&#x27;s good for helping out with oily skin, though.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; seller ! Product does what it says &amp; detoxes your clogged pores. I have tried so many masks from all price ranges and before this I loved glam glo but this is just as good! It was gentle on my sensitive skin that is recovering from using dr prescribed epiduo for hormonal jaw line acne. I noticed that this mask worked right away bringing to surface things that needed to come out of my clogged pores within the first 24 hours of using, I used extraction facial tools to clear them out right away &amp; then I applied thayers rose water witch hazel toner that is fabulous with this mask! In the morning my face was so clear and soft and tight !! I was very happy ! Have used it serval times and same result , my skin has finally calmed down since finding this miracle mask. I didn&#x27;t like the smell of using it w apple cider vinegar so I added lavender essential oil drops and it helped. I also loved the facial brush and sponge it came with as gifts ! Very good quality ! I am more impressed with the seller who sent a lovely follow up purchase email with additional recipes for different skin conditions / hair detox using this mask. Excellent customer service , I will continue to buy here but the cab product comes in is very generous ! If you have stubborn skin conditions that have not responded to other treatments I would recommend you give this a shot as it helped me a lot even more than dermatologist visit .</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful.  I used it in a bath, hair, and facial. I loved it.  I will purchase again.  I give it only a four star because the packaging Made the product look sketchy. It looked as though it was all ready open.</li>
            <li> A great buy and amount you get  is excellent! Works great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading several reviews on it&#x27;s benefits for hair and skin. Saw that it was on sale and decided to give it a try. this product is amazing. It deep cleans my facial pores and draws out any impurities. You can feel it working as it hardens on your face. I also used it as a hair mask on my natural kinky, coily hair and it cleaned my scalp extremely well. Removed a lot of product build up. I would definitely recommend this product to others. Along with purchasing apple cider vinegar and aloe vera juice.</li>
            <li> After using this mask my face becomes so smooth and easy to put make up on.</li>
            <li> This product works great love love how it makes my skin feel so smooth and refreshed. The masks is so relaxing so glad I was introduced to this product !!😉</li>
            <li> Pros: Creates Healthy Look; Effective; Easy To Take; Good Value&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Causes Side Effects&lt;br /&gt;This is the best mask I have ever used!!! For the best results its best to follow the directions by using the equal amount of powder and vinegar (or water). I prefer a thinner texture and build it up with two coats when applied with a foundation brush. It dries quickly and does what it says it will do, PULL OUT THOSE TOXINS! My face has never felt so clean or looked so good! I did have 1 small acne breakout on one side of my face after my second use, however by the 3rd use (7 day intervals) I was back to clear skin. I am also currently drinking ACV on a daily basis, so my breakout may have been caused by my body&#x27;s detoxification process. This is a must have!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product so much!! It has given my skin new light. It has cleared my pores and makes me have a nice clean glow. I will nevwr use anything else!</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome.  A little messy on my first once you figure it out. This product leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth. Happy with my purchase will buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!! You will feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the 1st time and I love it, I have facial dermatitis and it leaves my skin smooth and super soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week, and it makes my skin feel excellent!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t effect to my skin. Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> A little practice is needed to get the proper consistency with this mask, however, it is well worth it!! I use the sponge to remove the mask and I find that works very well. The brush is great for applying the mask, not for mixing it though. I love the way it tightens my pores!!</li>
            <li> i love this product .  it is very good it does what it says. yes i would recommond to my family and friends</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It always leaves my skin feeling smooth and firm. And the brush that came with it felt silky smooth and made it so easy to apply the mask. I also liked the little sponge that was included. It really helped to gently remove the mask when I was finished. I&#x27;ve previously used another brand of Bentonite Clay and felt that the Amaki Skincare clay was of equal quality, which is to say great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman and after just one application you can see and feel a major difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing and cleaning my face with the sponge Konjac sponge included, I used water to make my clay paste.  After a few minutes you could feel the clay absorbing into your pores and pulling them tight.  After about 20 minutes I washed off the clay, which was very easy with warm water.  I could definitely feel a difference on how tight my pores was, especially on my chin and around my nose.  I received this at a promotional rate to try and then to review with my honest opinion.  Being that I&#x27;m not one to go to the spa like a lot of others, I found a major benefit in using this for my middle aged, country woman with some sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan on continuing to use this on a daily basis and recommending to family and friends.</li>
            <li> You get a ton of the clay.  Skin feels very nice after using.</li>
            <li> this was kind of an impulse purchase for me, but I say- it is awesome! I mix it up with some apple cider vinegar and put it on my face. it does get a little warm from the acid in the vinegar as it tightens, but it feels like a really good/expensive  facial treatment and it really really cleans your skin</li>
            <li> leaves my skin very soft, stings a little and redness after but it goes away.... i have used it with water and apple cider...downfall with apple cider is the smell but it&#x27;s tolerable.....works great with both.</li>
            <li> This clay is wonderful ! I Love it !! I use it daily.  I  have received  many compliments about my skin: how well it has cleared up !  My friends have noticed a big difference.  I just found out it can be used as a detox and for bug bites! The Amaki-Bentonite clay has a place in my home !</li>
            <li> What an amazing mask! It is wonderful on tightening pores and removing excess oil. The addition of the facial mask brush &amp; a Konjac facial sponge is a bonus that is worth buying just for these tools. The bentonite clay is great for removing toxins and promoting cell growth. The clay can be mixed with water or apple cider vinegar and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to make the mask. Have your facials in the convenience of your own home.</li>
            <li> Love this clay mask...make my skin so soft and clean feeling</li>
            <li> I went to use this facial mud mask the first time and the accompanying brush broke. Upon emailing the company I also discovered that this powder can only be used externally. There are other higher quality bentonite clays available on Amazon which can be used internally as well as externally and at a comparable price.  I also found the texture of this powder to be strange and unlike other bentonite clay I have used before.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I will have to add that I did experience the redness when I used more clay and apple cider vinegar to water ratio. This mask didn&#x27;t deliver immediate amazing results but I did notice a fair amount of difference in my complexion, pore reduction and skin tightness, I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference using this clay once a week on my skin. I normally have dry skin so I don&#x27;t do it more than once a week, however, I have suffered with blemishes for a good 5 years and I do occasionally break out with blackheads. This clay is amazing, not only has the blemishes started to diminish, but I have no more blackheads at all. The clay leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh and not as dry. I&#x27;m sure I will enjoy this product when it gets much colder outside because that&#x27;s when my skin is the worst. This product is well worth the price and is a great inexpensive way to keep your skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I actually mix mine with apple cider vinegar. My face feels wonderful when I get finished. I use it once a week, usually Sunday night. Helps me face my week, no pun intended. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product. A little really goes a long way! Also, I love the free gifts that were included.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice and absolutely loved it.It left my skin refreshed, clean and glowing when I washed my face. When I was using this product for first time I had no idea how much water I should add which resulted in forming of lumps but second time I made right consistency and applied with the given brush. I kept it for 10 min. It dries very fast and I felt it reduced my pores too. I removed it by washing my face but it clogged my drain so I would recommend to apply this mask before taking bath or just remove it with wet wipes or wet cloth. This mask really works and worth buying.</li>
            <li> Before buying anything you have to make sure you rad the Detail and some reviews&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will tell you my experience of this one&lt;br /&gt;Every 1 week I use it twice and  After 2 weeks of using it , I saw the changes in my face.&lt;br /&gt;-Removed the blackheads&lt;br /&gt;-Stop growing of incoming acne&lt;br /&gt;-healing the huge acne&lt;br /&gt;-cleaning the open porse&lt;br /&gt;REALLY HAPPY WITH IT</li>
            <li> originally bought this for my 16yrs old son, has acne.  however, I always make it a mother &amp; son spa night, because I used the remaining that was left after I applied on his face &amp; back.  it&#x27;s cold feeling when 1st applied, then in 15-20 minutes super tightening.  after rinse off the skin is smooth &amp; soft.  love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have horrible skin, but I always seem to have one more two pimples on my face. I first used this about a week ago and I have not seen any new breakouts, so it seems to be working so far. I used one tablespoon each of the powder, apple cider vinegar and water. It mixed fine and there was more than enough to cover my face. My face was really red once the mask was removed, but that went away in about 30 minutes. My face felt super clean after and I have also noticed my face does not get as oily throughout the day. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> nice and very effective on me!</li>
            <li> Very Good Product!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used it with apple cider vinegar and also with water alone. Works either way. It leaves my skin glowing. It also came with a surprise gift, which I am very pleased about :)</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the size of the product. It was much larger than I expected. I was excited to try it out. I followed the instructions but still had a little trouble getting the consistency of the mask right and I ended up using much more than I needed to which is wasteful. I also found it easier to apply it with my fingers rather than with the included brush. I&#x27;ve only used the mask three times so far but I do like how clean my face feels after. I also love the sponge that was included. Made it really easy to remove the mask after use.</li>
            <li> This clay mask is awesome! I love how it came with everything. The tools that came with it do comes in handy. The package looks great and fast delivery too! Great as a gift to a friend as well.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my hair and skin. I did a spa day .</li>
            <li> I have used this twice already and LOVE it. My skin and hair feel and look so much healthier. It came so fast and the manufacturer was helpful and attentive. Would definitely buy from again thank you so much!</li>
            <li> very good~! Thank you</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> Great masque, you can certainly feel it working! The brush it comes with is so soft as well :)</li>
            <li> 100% clay, no additives... awesome for many uses. I will buy this product again</li>
            <li> When I first opened this product, I was a bit surprised to find that it was a powder, but I guess I should have read the description better. I didn&#x27;t have sparkling water on hand, so I simply mixed one teaspoon of the clay mask with one teaspoon of filtered water. It was difficult to mix the two together and the result was very clumpy, having almost a jelly like consistenty. I added one more teaspoon of clay along with quite a bit more water and kept mixing, and eventually the mask did take on a pasty texture. It says on the directions to allow the mix to sit for about half an hour before using it, but I was in a hurry so I used it right after I mixed it. I used the included brush to apply the mask to my face and it was fairly easy to get an even layer on my face. I left it on for about 20 minutes and washed it off when it was dry. Although I still have blackheads in my nose, my face looks noticeably clearer and I love it. The product did begin tingling a bit while it was on my face, so I would advise people with extra sensitive skin to take caution. I haven&#x27;t used the konjac sponge included with the product yet since I already have another one open, but I do love that it is included and think that this product would truly make an excellent gift as noted in the title. The clay comes in a huge container and the brush and sponge were included with it in a cellophane bag. I&#x27;m probably going to try actually using sparkling water the next time I use this product, but overall I am very pleased, especially since this product didn&#x27;t dry my face out.</li>
            <li> It is really nice. I listen to my heart.&lt;br /&gt;So as to purchase frequently in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you.</li>
            <li> this is really good stuff, it takes a little bit of time to mix with water, but after you put it on, stuff is great!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very oily skin and nothing has ever worked for me. I tried this mask and it made my skin feel so clean I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I also felt like it kept the oil at a minimum for the following week. I highly recommend this mask for anyone with skin like myself! All my other masks went directly in the trash!</li>
            <li> So far I can see the changed of my face since I started used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I see the change of my face since I started used this product. I can see the difference of my face now, the acne stop coming up of my face so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I like it, I have tried it as a face mask with the apple cider and water mixture. My acne is almost non existant now, but I also switched to all natural skin and body care regimen. Not going to lie I was terrified when I first used it and removed to see my skin was bright red but it didn&#x27;t feel irritated, the redness was gone within an hour. With that being said I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it before you plan on going somewhere but instead as a part of a relaxing pampering day :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;m always cautious about trying new products because I have very sensitive skin. I used the clay as a mask when I mixed it with water and apple cider and my skin felt so soft after. I could also tell that it deep cleaned my pores. I use it once or twice a week and and have never had a negative reaction.</li>
            <li> Helps dry out skin irritations</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! A little messy on my first try, but once I got the hang of it, it was fine. Leaves my skin feeling invigorated and super-clean! :)</li>
            <li> I love my Bentonite clay, leaves skin baby butt soft</li>
            <li> This mask is pretty good but the only thing I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s hard to mix, especially it he direction say do not use anything metal to mix so all plastic spoons break on me.</li>
            <li> MESSY AT FIRST BUT PRETTY GOOD STUFF</li>
            <li> Wonderful unit. Better than I expected</li>
            <li> Very much impressed, very fast shipping , nicely packed. Very impressive product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing. It didn&#x27;t mix well, I didn&#x27;t even use it. It comes in powder form and you mix it with water or Vinegar. I used water but it never made it to anyone&#x27;s face. Will probably go in the trash.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Not only is it a face/hair mask but it can be used to make an all natural tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Even following the instructions perfectly doesn&#x27;t work. This is a powder that you add water to and mix each time you want to apply. But this stuff just cakes up and makes a huge mess. It&#x27;s not even spreadable. It&#x27;s clumpy and gross</li>
            <li> Used on my granddaughters hair, not as frizzy.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice set. It comes in a nice bag and would be good as a gift. I like how my skin feels after using.</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay is absorbent, which makes it a great natural skin care tool. Sodium Bentonite expands when wet and absorbs as much as several times its dry mass in water. The absorption properties allow Bentonite clay to absorb impurities, extract toxins, deeply cleanse and tighten skin, and stimulate circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 100% pure Sodium Bentonite Clay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE: Recommended recipe is to mix equal parts of the clay with apple cider vinegar or spring water and stir the mixture until it reaches a paste consistency. Metal bowls and utensils are not recommended since the clay absorbs metals and become less effective. I mixed about 1 teaspoon of the clay with some water and kept adding a little of the clay/water until it reached the consistency. I mixed the clay and water in my palm with the index finger of the other hand. Otherwise, I would use a wooden coffee stirring stick that I have in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the clay mixture to my face and let it dry for about 15-20 minutes before getting in the shower. If you have sensitive skin, leave the clay for 5-10 minutes. In the shower, I rinsed the clay off with my hands. A warm wash cloth can also be used. After getting out of the shower, I applied my usual moisturizer (organic Argan Oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite clay can also be used as a hair mask. Separate the hair into 4 sections and apply the clay to the scalp land hair. Leave on for 20-25 minutes and thoroughly wash out with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to try using clay for a detox bath. Amaki recommends adding 1/4 cup to 1 cup of clay to running water until dissolved. Soak in the clay bath for 20-30 minutes and drink lots of water afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS: When clay dries on your skin, it makes the skin feel tight. Washing it off with my fingers in the shower took a few minutes, so next time I will likely use a wash cloth to make sure to get it all off. The skin on my face felt smooth and fresh. The skin felt moisturized, though I still applied some of my usual light moisturizer. I really like the immediate results from using the clay mask. Even if I do not have 15-20 minutes, I can keep the clay mask on my face for 5 minutes and still gain the benefits of clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a pure Sodium Bentonite Clay for a clay mask or other homemade cosmetic uses, I would recommend Amaki Bentonite Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate this review.

            <li> Save money on facials and get this purifying bentonite clay mask. I loved that it came with the applicator brush and sponge.  I have sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to this mask.  This is made of 100% pure sodium Bentonite clay powder that you mix with raw apple cider vinegar or water and works well for detoxifying your skin.</li>
            <li> Something different for me.  It is a fun experience to try.  It left my face refreshed and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK ... have problems mixing it to make a mask.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to want to make &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; but ends up clumping which I need to smear around with my fingers.  Would not order again.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Amaki Skincare Bentonite Clay Mask! I used the clay with raw apple cider vinegar. It makes your skin so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used it just a few times so far and I have seen a huge improvement in the overall quality of my skin. Smaller pores, more even complexion and so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to be a return customer!</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this for the amount of time I should have, (I have sensitive skin) it burned my face a little. I ran to the sink getting it off my face, it wasn&#x27;t even on for 5 minutes. Not very impressed that I spent that money and can&#x27;t use it on my face for fear of burning it.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!! Made my face feel really good after use. Do wonder though how to get another sponge</li>
            <li> My daughter has a problem with acne and I had heard some great things about this mask when mixed with vinegar. She used it a few times with vinegar and a few times with just water. She seemed to get better results with the vinegar. It made her skin feel very soft and really helped with her Acne. Its not 100% cured but its a lot better. I don&#x27;t feel as bad with her using a more natural product then some of the harsh chemicals with had been using on her face that didn&#x27;t seem to help too much at all. Its easy to use and the odor isn&#x27;t horrible. Its a great mask and a great price.</li>
            <li> Love these products. ..fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love the sponge.  It makes my face supper clean.  The mask is super smooth, easy to apply and  it&#x27;s help to use the brush.  My face feel a lot smoother after 2 used. Overall,  I&#x27;m glad that I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this Organic Bentonite Clay Mask from Amaki Skincare! I really loved that it came with the free gifts! The konjac sponge is gentle yet effective and the brush makes it easy to apply the mask in a smooth layer. I love the way that it feels going on with the soft brush. It really helps to get the product on my face and not all over my counter. The jar is huge, a whopping 16 ounces and it will definitely last a long time. I made my mask with the instructions on the label, which were very clear and easy to understand. I opted for the apple cider vinegar mask over the one made with water. I really like the healing benefits that it provides, even when I&#x27;m not mixing it with bentonite clay. I use about 2 teaspoons of clay and I added vinegar until it was a smooth paste. I believe I used about 3 teaspoons of vinegar. I just remember that it wasn&#x27;t a 1:1 ratio like the directions stated. It would have been too thick if I had not of added more liquid. Be careful and don&#x27;t add too much liquid, which I did the first time, but the second time I was more careful and it was perfect. I used the included brush and applied a thin layer. I let it sit on my face for 20 minutes and it felt funny when it started to dry. Not in a bad way, just tickled a little. After I rinsed the mask off with warm water, I noticed my face was a little red, like a very mild sunburn and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I would suggest trying this at night to see if the same thing happens to you. I don&#x27;t know if this was caused by the apple cider vinegar since I haven&#x27;t tried it yet with water, but I think it was. The third time I made it with part water and part vinegar and it still made my face pink but was gone by the time I woke up. I always follow with a moisturizer and I think that is important. I love this product and will never stop using it, I really love what it has done for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing that I would like to note is that I had a question and Amaki responded very promptly and was very courteous in their response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Please be sure to see my attached photo collage of the packaging. It came together in a cute clear bag with a silver tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.

            <li> This is a great product, it comes in a big jar! The kit comes with a wonderful spong and brush.  I did add about 4 drops of water to thin down the mid, it bursh on my face like silk.  Great deal for money worth.</li>
            <li> Love the product, makes my face nice and smooth. Love the free little gift that came with it.</li>
            <li> This mask is great! I&#x27;ve notices my pores are smaller after only 2 uses. I add some lavender essential oils to the mixture and it makes it smell amazing and helps make me sleepy so by the time I wash it off I&#x27;m relaxed and ready for a good nights sleep!</li>
            <li> Great basic and affordable mask. Can use several other ingredients to customize your mask. Can&#x27;t complain, it&#x27;s a product.</li>
            <li> Irecieved this product at a disvount from the seller and I couldnt believe it I felt so pampered before even opening the product. Adorable packaging and a sweet free gift. Perfect for a loved one for upcoming valentines or just an everyday appreciation gift. Mask goes on smooth and leaves you soft and cuddly. Even gentle enough to use on my little ones arm without irritation! I will definitely be a return customer!</li>
            <li> Great Product- definitely will purchase again. It leaves my face feeling rejuvenated, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Choose the right !&lt;br /&gt;A good product&lt;br /&gt; Do not regret choice&lt;br /&gt;For smooth skin!For smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and I love how clear my skin looks as soon as take the mask off. I had tried Anastasia Beverly Hills dipbrow pomade and it made me breakout horribly and this is helping clear my skin. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s really good product.</li>
            <li> It works but the thing is it itches and I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> good !! very good!! skincare best product</li>
            <li> cured my jock itch too</li>
            <li> Works well. I wish I found this before now.</li>
            <li> Is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;Fits my skin and soft&lt;br /&gt;I can feel that the skin is healing.</li>
            <li> I can feel my skin tightening up and this mask working. I can see some change in the fine lines that come with age.</li>
            <li> Very good use on the face junginde</li>
            <li> I like this, but definitely do a skin test first. I didn&#x27;t, and ended up burning my skin. I left it on for 20 minutes. I think 10 minutes would be fine.            Update:   I tried it again for 10 minutes instead of 20. It was perfect. I updated it to 5 stars instead of 4.</li>
            <li> And is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My wife used the clay with raw apple cider vinegar once every 3 days and she LOVES it. She said she&#x27;s never found a product before that has made her skin feel so soft she&#x27;s seen a huge improvement in the overall quality of her skin and less breakouts too! You use such a small amount of the powder to make a paste that one jar used every 3 days will last for MONTHS. She has used this product about 10 times now and still has over 3/4th of the container left. She said its exactly like paying for a $100 facial at the local spa&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my wife she highly recommends Amaki Skincare Bentonite Clay Mask!</li>
            <li> Awesome product great for acne !!</li>
            <li> I recieved a promotional offer to try this product. I am always looking for a natural and simple way to pamper myself, as well as to pass on to others! This is definately something to use, and then order extra for gifts! The product in itself is great- high quality and organic. There are so many ways to use the clay it&#x27;s unreal- and the way it works wonders on the skin is amazing! The seller even sends different &#x27;recipes&#x27; and ways to use their clay, which I enjoyed and thought very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this item is that it comes ready to use (less the liquid you add) as a kit! it arrives in a celophane package, ready to gift - if you don&#x27;t tear into it and start using it yourself!</li>
            <li> Very smooth and quick absorption into the skin.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this clay mask, I could see the difference in my pores after my first time using around my nose which was great. I did feel like the clay clogged up my sink when I rinsed it off, I am not quite sure what to do about that, but it won&#x27;t stop me from using it again, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago and have not stopped using it since I first started.  I love it!  I have oily skin and use it 3 times a week on my face leaving it on for 15 minutes each time.  I have only used water to mix it and so far it’s working great.  It leaves my face feeling smooth and soft and I’ve noticed less oil and my pores look smaller as well.  I have also used it on my hair.  I couldn’t believe how my hair turned out!  It’s like a miracle product!  I have curly hair that I usually straighten daily and after a lot of straightening my curls turned into waves after washes and often looks really dry but using this mask brings my curls back to life.  It takes away all residue and toxins from my hair.  People hadn’t seen my hair so curly in the recent years that they thought I had gotten a perm.  I don’t think I have ever felt my hair so clean.  I use it 1-2 times a week in my hair mixing the powder with water only and leaving for 20 minutes.  I definitely recommend this product.  I’ve used several different masks and this one has been the best by far.  I love that you can use this for your face and hair.  This is a good buy!  This product was offered to me at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> I have back acne and prone to breaking out. I&#x27;ve tried everything! Skin treatments, lazer, proactiv, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. So, I went on youtube to learn about bentonite since it&#x27;s suppose to be good for your skin. Looked on Amazon and found this product. The reviews are great, the price is good for it&#x27;s size. ( 1lb). and it comes with gifts. I purchased the product and so far I&#x27;ve used it 3 times. Let me tell you! It feels so good on the skin. My back acne seems to be clearing up. I&#x27;m 40, I&#x27;ve had bad skin since I was a teenager, to have some form of clear skin has brought up my confidence. There&#x27;s plenty in the container to last a while, so i&#x27;ve given my friends samples to test out. They enjoy Amaki Organic Bentonite Clay as well. Buy this product! For the price, the benefits and the amount (1lb) in the container, this is a steel.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Like the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Product looks good.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, low price. I love it. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having constant breakouts for the past few years. You&#x27;d think one of the perks of reaching 30 would be no pimples...but nop...not me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying this mask every day for 2 weeks after I got it, and 2-3 times per week after that. This stuff is amazing! My pores are smaller, and the back heads on my nose are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;Also, someone from their team send a few uses for the cream, one of them was as a hair mask. I was trying to get some coconut oil out of my hair  at that time, so I figured maybe a clarifying mask would help (¾ cup Bentonite Clay + 1cup of water + cup raw apple cider vinegar + 10 drops peppermint oil ---&amp;#62; HIGHLY recommend). I&#x27;ve washed my hair 5 times since, and it has still kept its shine and volume! I am assuming it was the combination of coconut oil plus mask....but needless to say, I am a happy customer and I will be buying again :)!</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling smooth. I would have given this product 5 stars, but it was pretty messy. As soon as you open it, the powder goes every where. Its a really fine powder, mix with water or apple cider vinegar and apply to your face. It makes your face feel really tight while it dries and hardens on your face. If you can tolerate that, your face will feel smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> since the title says its organic, I expected the packaging to say organic or have an organic seal somewhere on it but it does not. the fan brush is useless. but the sponge is great and the clay is excellent. my skin is sooo soft after using this and it feels tighter. as a face mask! i&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of use of this clay mask and especially love the way my face feels after using this clay mask.</li>
            <li> I like this clay. I tried for a facial and for detoxing. I did not really care for the texture too much for the facial, but it did leave my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> What a great little kit! Pure bentonite clay is awesome for so many things. I put it into my cold process soaps, melt &amp; pour soaps, and masks.  But this is a steal with the bonus Kanjac sponge (which can be $10 each) and a REALLY nice fan brush. This would be an awesome gift for anyone who loves skin care and natural solutions! Plus, Amaki Skincare has sent 2 nice followup emails, which included recipes for masks!&lt;br /&gt;My only caution is regarding the ratio of clay to liquid. Even with 3 parts liquid to 1 part clay, it was way too thick for the brush to spread.  The second time around I started with the desired amount of liquid in a bowl, and little by little added the clay until it was the desired consistency. This means this container will last even longer!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel heavenly</li>
            <li> Needed this....OMG! ...great stuff!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was a powder, but it was easy to make the paste. It really left my face feeling refreshed, and my skin already looks clearer!</li>
            <li> Excellent mud mask. You can immediately see results after applying .my skin looked clear and clean. However if you have dry skin,you don&#x27;t want to over do it with applications especially in the winter. I use it once a week and I like it because I feel that it does clean my clogged pores. Good product though. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love what this does to my face. May try it on my hands too. Easy to apply and rinse off.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice so far and already see my pores smaller and skin is clearer!! I LOVE this product. My skin is combination dry around jawline and cheeks/oily in the &#x27;T&#x27; zone.  The mask doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and I have had sensitivity to other facial cleansers/masks so this is great. The sponge it comes with feels a bit &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; while holding it when wet (not sure how to describe it) but it scrubs nicely without being too hard on the face.  I love using the fan brush instead of using my hands with the paste.  The smell of apple cider vinegar is unpleasant to add, but the benefits of it are worth adding to the clay.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff love this!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good! so convenient</li>
            <li> Used this a couple of times - so far I love it - makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> bought as gift no complaints</li>
            <li> My daughter and I used this product the other night and I was extremely excited about the results. We only left it on for the 10 mins and after removing it, my face was extremely smooth and felt so clean and detoxified. We mixed it with the ACV, which made my eyes water. LOL, but the results were great. Next time we will the Spring Water. I have never used a product like this before because I thought they were too messy and inconvenient, but I was surprised at how easy this was. As I age, I am looking into more products to keep me &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; looking and this product fits the bill. Thanks for a great facial.</li>
            <li> I mixed this powder with Apple cider vinegar as instructed, and found it easy to apply to the face.  It seems to do a good job pulling impurities to the surface and leaving my face soft and glowing. Overall, it felt like a spa treatment.</li>
            <li> I recently strained my back and had been using Epsom salt bathes to ease the pain. I had the GREAT IDEA to try my clay for a soak and WOW! Best BEST thing for sore muscles. Another great use for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have used many facial masks and clays in my life but have never seen one that came with a brush and sponge before. Love the brush for mixing up the powder and water together as well as for applying the clay to my face or body. No more digging the clay out from under my finger nails. Why didn&#x27;t I think of this before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is great for rinsing off the clay or for washing your face everyday. These sponges are amazing. What is great about clay is that it has healing properties. Love using it for my knees when they are in pain. It helps draw out the pain and relives my knees a bit. Of course you have to have time to do this. The time it takes is worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> Very good product even for sensitive skin. Love it</li>
            <li> So far so good. Have yet to do a mask, but used this to make some homemade toothpaste. Just be careful when opening the first time. There is no seal under the cover so I made a huge mess the first time I opened it.</li>
            <li> love it was like a being at a spa . every mom needs this. even my tone out and I felt refreshed I mixed with vinegar . didn&#x27;t try the water one</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing.I used for the first time and felt my skin really smooth. I received the product quick with no problems and simple directions on how to apply.I recommend everyone to try this product and it&#x27;s a great gift idea.</li>
            <li> Love this clay and the little extras that came with it. My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> Pure as Bentonite clay gets! Perfect stuff</li>
            <li> It leaves my face so clean-looking. Love it!</li>
            <li> Yeahhhhh it definitely tingles! Lol. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try this bentonite clay because everyone rants and raves about it. I&#x27;m so happy that I was offered to try this product at a discounted rate for an honest and unbiased review. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I used it as a facial mask. Lately my skin has been so dry and nothing has worked until this. I&#x27;d tried just about everything. This clay mask is amazing. All you do is mix 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar or water with 1 tablespoon of bentonite clay. Mix it together until it&#x27;s all creamy and then allow it to sit for 30 mins before applying it to ur face. If you have sensitive skin like me, use water instead of vinegar. I used vinegar this time and it was a little harsh on my skin (I knew better lol). After applying the mask let it sit for like 15-20 mins. As it dries you&#x27;ll feel your face get tighter and tighter. At first it feels weird, then it feels nice and soothing, and then it gets annoying lol. That&#x27;s when u rinse it off with warm water. You&#x27;ll definitely feel and see the difference immediately after washing it off. Apply your moisturizer and you&#x27;re all done. I&#x27;m so excited to try this on my hair this weekend. I keep hearing about how good it makes your hair and scalp feel. My face has never felt so smooth, soft and moisturized. This clay mask is gonna be added to my weekly beauty session.</li>
            <li> Something clicked with me last December, in one more year I hit 60, since then I have been changing my life style, detox, healthier foods, and exercise.  Amazing at how much better I feel just in a few months time.  Decided it was time to add some other personal habits in my routine.  With the great reviews of this product I decided this is the one for me to try and I LOVE the way it makes my skin feel.  I have only done 2 treatments and even with the first treatment I could feel and see a difference.  Love It, and love the fact I do not have to seek another product, this one is Great and will continue to use</li>
            <li> I used this clay mask twice so far, and right now I like this clay mask a lot. The brush and sponge delivered with the mask are also very useful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I was skeptical to try at first but this is worth the buy. My skin was soft and radiant after one use</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. It comes with a facial sponge and applying brush. This clay is great, once I applied it my skin felt tight and refreshed and I was left with a healthy glow. I will definitely use it on my neck and chest the next time.</li>
            <li> I recieved my product two days after shipping and everything came as described I really love the brush it also includes I thought that was pretty awesome anyways down to the product you do have to wash your face before applying a mask as any mask before doing you should. It literally helps maintain acne free I would recommend to a friend! Thank you!</li>
