            <li>Good price, great product, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Its got a nice minty flavor- not too sweet and great ability to clean and maintain the whiteness of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the flavor, but it is ok, For me it is about two to three days to be accustomed to toothpaste&#x27;s flavors.</li>
            <li>and I guess I can use this for more than a year, which is a lot for me.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite toothpaste for 30 years</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite toothpaste for 40 years.  </li>
            <li>Love Ultrabrite, can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not in the drugstores or supermarkets anymore.</li>

            <li>ok for the price.</li>
            <li>After my local stores stopped carrying this toothpaste, I had to start getting in on Amazon because it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the spicy mint flavor, like an Altoid mint.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been stuck wearing braces for the last year too, and this stuff keeps everything perfectly spotless without bleaching.</li>
            <li>I started using this toothpaste years ago when Consumer Reports gave it a top rating.</li>
            <li>If you want a toothpaste that&#x27;s the best performing, you need not look any further.</li>
            <li>Ultra Brite has been my favorite for years.  </li>
            <li>and it really leaves my mouth with an incredible clean taste every time...and</li>
            <li>This is a great toothpaste, i have been using it for yrs and really love it, it&#x27;s not harsh at all</li>
            <li>a bit pricier than grocery store a lot more available.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean mint aftertaste that makes your mouth feel clean after use.</li>
            <li>Not only that, rapid delivery, fair price and Prime too!  </li>
            <li>and this paste works fine for me despite this.</li>
            <li>It has the best cleaning and whitening without harsh abrasiveness.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is very good, although I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and other advanced whiting toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it tastes good,  fresh breath lasts a good long while, and value to dollar is good.</li>
            <li>it is my favorite toothpaste love the flavor and as usual amazon great service and delivery</li>
            <li>Thanks so much we can&#x27;t find this in the stores any more and love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>My dentist always asks me what I use because my teeth are always super smooth and clean at my 6-month cleaning appointments, and she assumes I never drink cola or coffee</li>
            <li>Works good, enough said.</li>
            <li>The more expensive and very good popular natural brands don&#x27;t have SLF either.  </li>
            <li>I love trying new products</li>
            <li>, it was exactly as I remembered!  </li>
            <li>For several years I have been using this toothpaste and love the clean and fresh taste.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fact that there are no gimmicky aspects to this toothpaste . . .</li>
            <li>(I drink way too much of both!).  </li>
            <li>The only place I have been able to find it, is on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>great, based upon consumer research...  brightens (whitens faster than other of the same product... definitely more gritty.)</li>
            <li>Most of us are not sensitive though.  </li>
            <li>Old faithful....tried and true.  </li>
            <li>I frankly expected a bit more whitening using this product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic at keeping teeth white!</li>
            <li>I can use it twice daily , as much as I want and enjoy the clean white feeling it gives me.</li>
            <li>the whole \\&quot;sex appeal\\&quot; thing, plus the lively mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only to be totally turned off by the baking soda / peroxide / gacky taste of so many of the others.  </li>
            <li>Ultrabrite was recommended by my wonderful dentist who did her own private study and determined that it beat all the others for whitening, AND that it was the least expensive.</li>
            <li>I have used Ultrabrite for about 25 years and was quite distressed when it disappeared from my normal supplier.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are still doing the old Ultrabrite commercials (&amp;#34;GIves your mouth sex appeal&amp;#34; -- I mean, really), but I love Ultrabrite toothpaste and the way it tingles as it cleans.</li>
            <li>I have gone through a few tubes of this toothpaste and enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>When I received the package, I couldn&#x27;t get in it fast enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Ultra Brite and it is now difficult to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I love the scrubbiness of the baking soda, and the flavoring 100% masks the gross flavor of the soda, unlike every other brand I&#x27;ve tried with equal amounts.</li>
            <li>and they were all less effective and harder to rinse out of the brackets and wires, and they left staining on the bracket glue that UltraBrite got rid of.</li>
            <li>I began purchasing this toothpaste because of the high reviews here on Amazon and because it was one of the cheapest options at my local supermarket (quite a bit cheaper than here).</li>
            <li>Since it can be difficult to find in stores unless you have them order it for you, it&#x27;s easier to cut out the middle and just have it delivered directly to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the good product and service.</li>
            <li>Increasingly hard to find locally so like being able to order on line.</li>
            <li>Crest (and maybe other large national brands) do not have SLF.</li>

            <li> Increasingly hard to find locally so like being able to order on line.</li>
            <li> Crest (and maybe other large national brands) do not have SLF.</li>
            <li> I began having issues with dry mouth and sensitive teeth after using this product and it turns out it has the dreaded SLF as an active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> That has led to several years of experimenting with various brands, with no real success.  </li>
            <li> (Yet many brand claim that they have lots of whitening abilities and they do not).&lt;br /&gt;Several times, I have tried other more expensive so called super whitening brands (that tasted terrible) only to come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Once I realized that the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; capability of ultrabrite can do no more than remove plaque over time that causes discoloration and that this paste can not actually make your teeth any whiter than they naturally are, I quit using it</li>
            <li> Then, I found Ultrabrite on Amazon and ordered immediately, but expected something that was not the same.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying this brand as long as I can find it!</li>
            <li> I tried several other brands when I ran out</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other supposed &#x27;whitening&#x27; toothpastes,</li>
            <li> Also, the taste seems to me to be minty-er than practically any other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The other toothpastes are, frankly, built around marketing gimmicks like colors, sparkles, packaging, whitening(that doesn&#x27;t work), enamel hardening(that doesn&#x27;t work), etc...</li>
            <li> The taste is fine, not overbearing or annoying like several others.</li>
            <li> There are toothpastes that get teeth whiter with abrasives in the paste but those wear down the enamel and cause long-term damage.</li>
            <li> Normally these pastes taste weirdly salty and \\&quot;off\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> things like multi-colored paste and flip-top lids which I detest (messy).  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this in local stores.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, I saw hardly any whitening with the others...</li>
            <li> Or at least my husband does...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be a sucker.  </li>
            <li> and it is getting very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Not great for the purpose that I needed which is maintain whitened</li>
            <li> I was appalled when my local supermarket no longer carried it.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it does some whitening abilities, some but not that dramatic.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for years, and now that it&#x27;s getting difficult to find in stores I resorted to ordering 6 tubes online.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The product itself is very good, although I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and other advanced whiting toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they sold this toothpaste in smaller quantities because a pack of 6 will take forever to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Blue</li>
            <li> Good deal ... a bit pricier than grocery store a lot more available.</li>

But I am back to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy and great toothpaste!</li>
            <li> prompt delivery and product as advertised.. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Or at least my husband does...only product he uses.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Good mint flavored &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste. I frankly expected a bit more whitening using this product. Overall it tastes good,  fresh breath lasts a good long while, and value to dollar is good. It&#x27;s a good toothpaste, but nothing to scream and rave about.</li>
            <li> if you are a fan of ultrabrite i sugest buying it ive used it for 20 plus years it is my favorite toothpaste love the flavor and as usual amazon great service and delivery</li>
            <li> this paste does what it advertises- that&#x27;s why I did not give it a 1 star.  I began having issues with dry mouth and sensitive teeth after using this product and it turns out it has the dreaded SLF as an active ingredient.  Crest (and maybe other large national brands) do not have SLF. The more expensive and very good popular natural brands don&#x27;t have SLF either.  Once I realized that the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; capability of ultrabrite can do no more than remove plaque over time that causes discoloration and that this paste can not actually make your teeth any whiter than they naturally are, I quit using it</li>
            <li> What can you say about toothpaste???  This has been my favorite toothpaste for 30 years and it is getting very hard to find. You had some - and at a good price so I bought some.</li>
            <li> I have started to use it also.  It was a good price for 6 tubes, and we will not run out for awhile.</li>
            <li> ... if you can find it in any stores...which I can&#x27;t, so thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this toothpaste!  Yes, it does whiten - and tastes great too!  I&#x27;ve tried other supposed &#x27;whitening&#x27; toothpastes, only to be totally turned off by the baking soda / peroxide / gacky taste of so many of the others.  Not to mention, I saw hardly any whitening with the others...if any at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying this brand as long as I can find it!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends this toothpaste for me. It works beautifully and helps contain my plaque formation. Increasingly hard to find locally so like being able to order on line.</li>
            <li> Experts say you need to give this 2 weeks...I noticed results in 2 days. It works. I was just looking to have stains gone and it not only did that but my teeth are brighter...now glistening white, but noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite toothpaste for 40 years.  You know -- the whole \\&quot;sex appeal\\&quot; thing, plus the lively mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preferred Mart on Amazon.com. was a good way to stock up, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use them again.  Since it can be difficult to find in stores unless you have them order it for you, it&#x27;s easier to cut out the middle and just have it delivered directly to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the good product and service.</li>
            <li> Love Ultrabrite, can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not in the drugstores or supermarkets anymore. Thank God for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I love the taste and it really leaves my mouth with an incredible clean taste every time...and NO cavities ever at the Dentist!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for years, and now that it&#x27;s getting difficult to find in stores I resorted to ordering 6 tubes online.  I enjoy the fact that there are no gimmicky aspects to this toothpaste . . . things like multi-colored paste and flip-top lids which I detest (messy).  Also, the taste seems to me to be minty-er than practically any other toothpaste.  It&#x27;s the best value out there!</li>
            <li> Tastes good.  Not great for the purpose that I needed which is maintain whitened teethe.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic at keeping teeth white!</li>
            <li> I began purchasing this toothpaste because of the high reviews here on Amazon and because it was one of the cheapest options at my local supermarket (quite a bit cheaper than here). I have gone through a few tubes of this toothpaste and enjoy the product. It has a nice clean mint aftertaste that makes your mouth feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> This is Consumer Reports top-rated toothpaste.  It has the best cleaning and whitening without harsh abrasiveness.  There are toothpastes that get teeth whiter with abrasives in the paste but those wear down the enamel and cause long-term damage. This is a toothpaste you can use your entire life and not damage your teeth. The taste is fine, not overbearing or annoying like several others.</li>
            <li> great, based upon consumer research...  brightens (whitens faster than other of the same product... definitely more gritty.)</li>
            <li> After my local stores stopped carrying this toothpaste, I had to start getting in on Amazon because it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the spicy mint flavor, like an Altoid mint.  I love the scrubbiness of the baking soda, and the flavoring 100% masks the gross flavor of the soda, unlike every other brand I&#x27;ve tried with equal amounts. Normally these pastes taste weirdly salty and \\&quot;off\\&quot;. Baking soda isn&#x27;t so abrasive that you can&#x27;t use this every day, but if you have a sulfate sensitivity, this one does have some sulfates for foaming. Most of us are not sensitive though.  I have naturally sensitive teeth and this paste works fine for me despite this. My dentist always asks me what I use because my teeth are always super smooth and clean at my 6-month cleaning appointments, and she assumes I never drink cola or coffee (I drink way too much of both!).  My teeth feel noticeably smoother with this paste than they do with the standard brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been stuck wearing braces for the last year too, and this stuff keeps everything perfectly spotless without bleaching. I tried several other brands when I ran out and they were all less effective and harder to rinse out of the brackets and wires, and they left staining on the bracket glue that UltraBrite got rid of.</li>
            <li> I started using this toothpaste years ago when Consumer Reports gave it a top rating. Its got a nice minty flavor- not too sweet and great ability to clean and maintain the whiteness of your teeth. I can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore so Amazon is my source. I will buy this again. Try it!</li>
            <li> Although my teeth aren&#x27;t dazzlingly white after using for months now, my teeth are visibly whiter than they were.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this in local stores. I started using this back in the 1980&#x27;s and have used it ever since. The only place I have been able to find it, is on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Old faithful....tried and true.  Rated best by Consumer Reports.  The other toothpastes are, frankly, built around marketing gimmicks like colors, sparkles, packaging, whitening(that doesn&#x27;t work), enamel hardening(that doesn&#x27;t work), etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be a sucker.  If you want a toothpaste that&#x27;s the best performing, you need not look any further.</li>
            <li> Ultra Brite has been my favorite for years.  I was pleased when it was rated best  in whitening.  I was appalled when my local supermarket no longer carried it.  When I couldn&#x27;t get it at a pharmacy either I resorted to Amazon and Voila!  I&#x27;m so happy that I no longer have to ration the remains in a squeezed- out tube.  I can use it twice daily , as much as I want and enjoy the clean white feeling it gives me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Ultra Brite and it is now difficult to find in the stores.  I was very happy to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. Thank you for a great quality and quantity product. I use it on alternate days.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much we can&#x27;t find this in the stores any more and love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Good price, great product, fast shipping.  What else needs to be said?</li>
            <li> I have used Ultrabrite for about 25 years and was quite distressed when it disappeared from my normal supplier.  That has led to several years of experimenting with various brands, with no real success.  Then, I found Ultrabrite on Amazon and ordered immediately, but expected something that was not the same.  When I received the package, I couldn&#x27;t get in it fast enough.  Joy, of all joys, it was exactly as I remembered!  Not only that, rapid delivery, fair price and Prime too!  Get it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are still doing the old Ultrabrite commercials (&amp;#34;GIves your mouth sex appeal&amp;#34; -- I mean, really), but I love Ultrabrite toothpaste and the way it tingles as it cleans.</li>
            <li> As expected. Thx! Would buy here again. A+</li>
            <li> Works good, enough said. CR rated it the best for whitening, it has a good, regular taste, and it is at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothpaste, i have been using it for yrs and really love it, it&#x27;s not harsh at all...will continue to buy and use</li>
            <li> Ultrabrite was recommended by my wonderful dentist who did her own private study and determined that it beat all the others for whitening, AND that it was the least expensive. I&#x27;ve loved it ever since. My drugstores stopped carrying it so the only place I can get it is online, and this seller had the best price. It works out to about $2/tube!</li>
