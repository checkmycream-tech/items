            <li>The face scrub felt and smelled nice</li>
            <li>and it is much better than the neutrogena version.</li>

            <li>But after trying for a month the difference is huge.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>We noticed an improvement right away!</li>
            <li>Both together really keep my KP at bay :)</li>
            <li>lotion is some of the best lotion / moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used hands down it makes the skin feel so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Works as stated, and is helping my KP tremendously.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it</li>
            <li>I tried it against a basic lotion (one on my left arm and one on my right arm) to see which worked best.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really clear it out 100%, but I could see a HUGE difference in the color!</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked was the very gentle lotion.</li>
            <li>I was a bit scared using it because some of these products could cause a bit of problems but after I used it, it really helped me!</li>
            <li>Thanks and I will continue working!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product because it really works!</li>
            <li>My skin is now clear, soft, and ridiculously smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and so much clearer and younger looking.</li>
            <li>Although it really hasnt removed the bumps on my chest area it does make my skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this KPCare skin cream for almost a year now, and it really helps with my KP.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation from the scrub was the real kicker for my skin</li>
            <li>and I noticed a real improvement after about a week of using it in combination with KP Elements cream.</li>
            <li>really digging into the formulation of this product and the ingredients, it just makes me worried that it&#x27;s formulated by some marketing company that doesn&#x27;t have experience in skin care.</li>
            <li>These were really bothering me</li>
            <li>Takes three weeks basically whole bottle to get rid of it all.  </li>
            <li>Get the stainless steel scraper which is also sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>That really exfoliates you skin also.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my KP.</li>
            <li>i use it mainly on arms and legs...</li>
            <li>If you do research you will see that too much keratin causes acne and other skin problems, and this product does a fantastic job of removing it.</li>
            <li>this was new on Amazon</li>
            <li>The pre-shower gel is pretty potent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy process everyday</li>
            <li>I will continue to take, as I see only positive things come of it.</li>
            <li>After two weeks the bumps are nearly invisible.</li>
            <li>I still have a lot of the product left but don&#x27;t use it anymore because it didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  </li>
            <li>So far, it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>It has been about 3 weeks so far and vast improvements thus far.  </li>
            <li>I tried the shower gel in hopes that it would finally smooth out the last little bit of KP - and it worked!</li>

            <li> I tried the shower gel in hopes that it would finally smooth out the last little bit of KP - and it worked!</li>
            <li> It freaks me out a bit to use such a high acid product that also seems to be formulated with dangerous ingredients - I&#x27;d recommend avoiding this &amp;#34;pre-shower gel&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t want to burn your skin with such an intense acid formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24, have had KP for as long as I can remember and have tried everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> I saw improvements before any other product and I will definitely be buying this one once again</li>
            <li> I keep at least a few bottles in my bathroom all the time just in case i run out, and i would recommend this to anybody who wants to get rid of that extra keratin.</li>
            <li> This product is so expensive, but the lotion that&#x27;s supposedly designed for KP is exactly the same stuff you can buy at the drugstore for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My skin was not really any smoother, but it was A LOT REDDER.</li>
            <li> I used as recommended and noticed the blemishes starting to go away within a few weeks time.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel healthier too, almost like my skin can breathe easier, not sure if that is possible</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first, but there are plenty of products that I&#x27;ve tried in the stores that just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything with no success.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical as it is more expensive than the drugstore counterparts.</li>
            <li> I have probably used about half the bottle at this point.</li>
            <li> but I can get that from St. Ives apricot scrub for twice the amount and less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Still though, I had a little bit of roughness and redness that I couldn&#x27;t quite kick.</li>
            <li> and I started noticing results after a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks my skin rapidly reduced in bumps.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and it works.</li>
            <li> Those irritating bumps slowly went away and now I have 0 issues at all.  </li>
            <li> My KP is pretty horrible, so anything could help.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using KP Care, my KP was MUCH WORSE on that arm.</li>
            <li> We bought this product for our 13 year old son, who had terrible KP covering both arms.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terribly irritating!</li>
            <li> I have to say it IS expensive</li>
            <li> So expensive and for nothing.</li>
            <li> This was just another expensive disappointment.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> Total waste of money. Does not work at all.</li>
            <li> The pre-shower gel is pretty potent and a little goes a long way. The exfoliation feels good and I started noticing results after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is some of the best lotion / moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used hands down it makes the skin feel so smooth and soft it absorbs so fast and feels amazing!, even after the Keratosis Pilaris is under control I think i&#x27;ll keep using the lotion.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as it is more expensive than the drugstore counterparts. But after trying for a month the difference is huge. My hair color has improved a lot. Totally recommended if you are having problems with your hair color.</li>
            <li> I (the wife) ordered this after my mother recommended picking some up.  It has been about 3 weeks so far and vast improvements thus far.  Those irritating bumps slowly went away and now I have 0 issues at all.  It makes me feel healthier too, almost like my skin can breathe easier, not sure if that is possible but it makes me feel that way.  I will continue to take, as I see only positive things come of it.</li>
            <li> If you do research you will see that too much keratin causes acne and other skin problems, and this product does a fantastic job of removing it. I have been using this for a month now and it is much better than the neutrogena version. The results are great and my skin finally feels smooth! I keep at least a few bottles in my bathroom all the time just in case i run out, and i would recommend this to anybody who wants to get rid of that extra keratin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and feels like it is actually smoothing out your skin when you apply it.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. I was a bit scared using it because some of these products could cause a bit of problems but after I used it, it really helped me! There are many products that just didn&#x27;t help but this is not one of those products I can assure you that! I saw improvements before any other product and I will definitely be buying this one once again</li>
            <li> We bought this product for our 13 year old son, who had terrible KP covering both arms.  We had tried everything with no success.  In one week the redness was gone and the bumps were getting smaller.  After two weeks the bumps are nearly invisible.</li>
            <li> This product seemed alright but never fully cleared up my skin.  I used it for over a month, several times a week and followed the directions.  I still have a lot of the product left but don&#x27;t use it anymore because it didn&#x27;t seem to help much.  I may try again when the seasons change to try and get results out of it.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first, but there are plenty of products that I&#x27;ve tried in the stores that just didn&#x27;t work. My KP is pretty horrible, so anything could help. This product did great for me... It didn&#x27;t really clear it out 100%, but I could see a HUGE difference in the color! Thanks and I will continue working!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend, and it seems to be helping a bit since she started using it. Will update once it amount a month in.</li>
            <li> I do like the pre shower scrub. Although it really hasnt removed the bumps on my chest area it does make my skin feel softer. I have probably used about half the bottle at this point. The after shower lotion feels good too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this KPCare skin cream for almost a year now, and it really helps with my KP. Still though, I had a little bit of roughness and redness that I couldn&#x27;t quite kick. I tried the shower gel in hopes that it would finally smooth out the last little bit of KP - and it worked! The exfoliation from the scrub was the real kicker for my skin and I noticed a real improvement after about a week of using it in combination with KP Elements cream.The combo of the two is the best thing to exfoliate your skin and then use the cream to put the moisture back in. Both together really keep my KP at bay :)</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my skin for a long time. I have tried several different formulas and gels but none seem to work. Finally, I found this and I can immediately see an improvement. I will continue to use this product because it really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had KP for several years and have tried almost every product on the market - this was new on Amazon so I bought it. I tried it against a basic lotion (one on my left arm and one on my right arm) to see which worked best. After two weeks of using KP Care, my KP was MUCH WORSE on that arm. My skin was not really any smoother, but it was A LOT REDDER. That&#x27;s the entire point of getting rid of KP - the visible redness is so embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the ingredients on the back, and the &amp;#34;pre shower gel&amp;#34; is 15% acid total - no wonder it&#x27;s terribly irritating! It also has sodium benozoate in it, which is actually banned in cosmetics products in Japan. It freaks me out a bit to use such a high acid product that also seems to be formulated with dangerous ingredients - I&#x27;d recommend avoiding this &amp;#34;pre-shower gel&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t want to burn your skin with such an intense acid formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also compared the ingredients in their &amp;#34;after shower lotion&amp;#34; with the $5 lotion I buy from Walgreens - it&#x27;s almost identical! It just kind of seems fishy to me. This product is so expensive, but the lotion that&#x27;s supposedly designed for KP is exactly the same stuff you can buy at the drugstore for cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After really digging into the formulation of this product and the ingredients, it just makes me worried that it&#x27;s formulated by some marketing company that doesn&#x27;t have experience in skin care. Not only did it not help with my KP, but I also feel somewhat taken advantage of.</li>
            <li> Works well and the best I&#x27;ve tried yet to help reduce the appearance of KP.</li>
            <li> Had some red bumps on my skin from acne that I&#x27;ve had on my face from clogged pores. These were really bothering me so I purchased some of this treatment. I used as recommended and noticed the blemishes starting to go away within a few weeks time. KPCare works great I can see the difference and it actually works don&#x27;t hesitate to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have always been embarassed by KP...this product is AMAZING!!! The very first time I used it I saw a HUGE difference!!  I have to say it IS expensive but I love it...so will you!! I wish there were a larger bottle though...i use it mainly on arms and legs...wear sun screen though!!</li>
            <li> I was uncertain about this product before but it actually does work.  Follow the directions and you will see results in a week or two; you have to be patient. Nothing fixes KP overnight.  This is a great non prescription treatment.  I think you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> It works but takes two weeks before it cleared my arm mostly.  Takes three weeks basically whole bottle to get rid of it all.  Directions say rub for up to 3 mins.  That&#x27;s nuts.  I do it for 1 min and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This aint workin on my KP. So disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks my skin rapidly reduced in bumps. My skin is now clear, soft, and ridiculously smooth. Just place some of the gel before taking a shower, and the lotion after showering. It&#x27;s an easy process everyday and I got amazing results. Not only does my skin look great, but I feel great in my skin now too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. So happy. My skin is smooth and so much clearer and younger looking. I&#x27;m now regularly using it every night before i go to sleep. This lotion is the best and i&#x27;ll keep using it! Worth the price!</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to do the job. Get the stainless steel scraper which is also sold on Amazon. That really exfoliates you skin also.</li>
            <li> Works as stated, and is helping my KP tremendously.</li>
            <li> This Gel works great for my KP. I have been using it for a few weeks and it works. My redness is gone and my scin looks good. I would recommend atleast trying it you never know until you try it,</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter. We noticed an improvement right away!</li>
            <li> So expensive and for nothing. I&#x27;m 24, have had KP for as long as I can remember and have tried everything under the sun. This was just another expensive disappointment. It did absolutely nothing for my KP. The only thing I liked was the very gentle lotion. The face scrub felt and smelled nice but I can get that from St. Ives apricot scrub for twice the amount and less than half the price.</li>
