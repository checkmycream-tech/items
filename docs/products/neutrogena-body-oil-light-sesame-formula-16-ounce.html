            <li>She smells so nice and feels so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This is a great product for after shower for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I has a very fragrant aroma that I love.</li>
            <li>I like the big bottles a really good value.</li>
            <li>I am requesting a full REFUND PLUS SHIPPING AND HANDLING.</li>
            <li>I use it after showers to moisturize my ultra dry skin, and it not only is light, it smells wonderful, and my body laps it up like a sponge absorbs water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick way to keep your skin moist.</li>
            <li>great skin softner especially in winter-avilable locally but much more</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed the oil quickly and felt silky afterwards.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has a fresh sesame scent.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant light smell that is not strong.  </li>
            <li>So light you never feel greasy, but moisturizes your whole body.  </li>
            <li>it is exciting plus</li>
            <li>I apply right after my shower to damp skin and let it sink in.</li>
            <li>I use it right after my shower and it soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I use this almost every day during winer months right after a shower.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh, soft, silky, succulent!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells okay, a little too good for a guy, but the light scent doesn&#x27;t hang around for too long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also add this oil to my regular moisturizing lotion (Aveeno) and it makes for a great extra moisturizing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean and light and goes well with my other perfumed body lotions or fragrances.</li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>This oil is great for keeping your hands soft and your bath water from being too drying (just be careful not to use too much or the tub can get slippery).</li>
            <li>Into the hot tub.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>When I use it in the morning it works as perfume, soft and light.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very nice and very subtle, but it also comes in fragrance free, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The sesame oil is pleasant and light, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance or simply prefer none of it at all, Neutrogena also makes a fragrance-free version (I spotted it at my local Target).</li>
            <li>Especially during the winter it is a great cure for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a great job of preventing dry skin for overall body use.  </li>
            <li>The light fragrance is lovely alone, but isn&#x27;t so much that it interferes with other fragrances like cologne, perfumes, etc.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to put on my damp skin right after my shower to lock in the moisture.  </li>
            <li>If you love a soft fresh scent in a luxurious body oil, you need look no further.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the one I usually buy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a 50:50 mix of Neutrogena sesame oil and baby oil for more than 25 years to remoisturize my otherwise chronically dry skin after showering, swimming, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the outdoors and summertime, but my chronic dry skin made trips to the beach and the pool a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>Use in combination with a strong hand cream for total protection.</li>
            <li>Feel of the oil is fine, but I really can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only one to notice that this smells like patchouli oil.</li>
            <li>The scent is very plesant and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I so much wanted to like this oil, how I wish it was unscented.</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>It soaks in without any greasy feeling and it really does moisturize like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>I have  purchased this product and really like the oil.  </li>
            <li>I really dislike oily products because I fear transferring residue everywhere, but this was not a problem after I got out of the bath.</li>
            <li>and I really like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to my friend who gave me a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>It makes the shower floor very slippery, so be careful! :)</li>
            <li>I like many other Neutrogena products but the scent in this stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not sure if this is what they use, but this oil feels a lot like what you&#x27;d get when you get a deluxe massage.</li>
            <li>I much prefer it with the pump for dispensing rather than a small hole in the flip top lid.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for a long time &amp; love putting it on in the shower &amp; wrapping up in my big bathrobe &amp; letting it soak in.</li>
            <li>Neutragena Body Oil Light Sesame Formula is natural, has a very slight fresh fragrance, and is quite moisturizing.</li>
            <li>&quot; I feel like it is quickly absorbed and keeps my skin soft and not dry and isn&#x27;t greasy on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I applied some of this oil to my dry skin and it soaked right in, without leaving a trace of grease or shine.  </li>
            <li>My young daughter-in-law loves it as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Body Oil for nearly 10 years.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft without any oily residue.  </li>
            <li>, I find that my skin is silky soft.  </li>
            <li>Proof of my baby soft skin?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t towel off completely as I like to mix alittle water on my body with the oil.</li>
            <li>The smell, to me, is an old fashioned floral/soapy scent.  </li>
            <li>The sesame oil is hydrophilic and therefore absorbed well by wet skin.</li>
            <li>Useful for moisturizing wet skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li>The effect is like no other!</li>
            <li>Love this product, I use it daily as I have dry skin due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome Disorder.  </li>
            <li>It is so DRY here that I was using tons of lotion and nothing really made any difference.</li>
            <li>Others seemed more irritating to my skin.    </li>
            <li>Neutragena Body oil stopped the main symptom of chronic dry skin....ITCHING!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s a quick way to keep your skin moist.</li>
            <li> great skin softner especially in winter-avilable locally but much more</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed the oil quickly and felt silky afterwards.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and has a fresh sesame scent.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant light smell that is not strong.  </li>
            <li> So light you never feel greasy, but moisturizes your whole body.  </li>
            <li> it is exciting plus</li>
            <li> I apply right after my shower to damp skin and let it sink in.</li>
            <li> I use it right after my shower and it soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day during winer months right after a shower.</li>
            <li> Light, fresh, soft, silky, succulent!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells okay, a little too good for a guy, but the light scent doesn&#x27;t hang around for too long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also add this oil to my regular moisturizing lotion (Aveeno) and it makes for a great extra moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean and light and goes well with my other perfumed body lotions or fragrances.</li>
            <li> Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> This oil is great for keeping your hands soft and your bath water from being too drying (just be careful not to use too much or the tub can get slippery).</li>
            <li> Into the hot tub.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> When I use it in the morning it works as perfume, soft and light.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very nice and very subtle, but it also comes in fragrance free, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The sesame oil is pleasant and light, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance or simply prefer none of it at all, Neutrogena also makes a fragrance-free version (I spotted it at my local Target).</li>
            <li> Especially during the winter it is a great cure for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a great job of preventing dry skin for overall body use.  </li>
            <li> The light fragrance is lovely alone, but isn&#x27;t so much that it interferes with other fragrances like cologne, perfumes, etc.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to put on my damp skin right after my shower to lock in the moisture.  </li>
            <li> If you love a soft fresh scent in a luxurious body oil, you need look no further.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the one I usually buy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a 50:50 mix of Neutrogena sesame oil and baby oil for more than 25 years to remoisturize my otherwise chronically dry skin after showering, swimming, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the outdoors and summertime, but my chronic dry skin made trips to the beach and the pool a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> Use in combination with a strong hand cream for total protection.</li>
            <li> Feel of the oil is fine, but I really can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only one to notice that this smells like patchouli oil.</li>
            <li> The scent is very plesant and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I so much wanted to like this oil, how I wish it was unscented.</li>
            <li> really like it.</li>
            <li> It soaks in without any greasy feeling and it really does moisturize like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I have  purchased this product and really like the oil.  </li>
            <li> I really dislike oily products because I fear transferring residue everywhere, but this was not a problem after I got out of the bath.</li>
            <li> and I really like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to my friend who gave me a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> It makes the shower floor very slippery, so be careful! :)</li>
            <li> I like many other Neutrogena products but the scent in this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if this is what they use, but this oil feels a lot like what you&#x27;d get when you get a deluxe massage.</li>
            <li> I much prefer it with the pump for dispensing rather than a small hole in the flip top lid.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time &amp; love putting it on in the shower &amp; wrapping up in my big bathrobe &amp; letting it soak in.</li>
            <li> Neutragena Body Oil Light Sesame Formula is natural, has a very slight fresh fragrance, and is quite moisturizing.</li>
            <li> &quot; I feel like it is quickly absorbed and keeps my skin soft and not dry and isn&#x27;t greasy on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I applied some of this oil to my dry skin and it soaked right in, without leaving a trace of grease or shine.  </li>
            <li> My young daughter-in-law loves it as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Body Oil for nearly 10 years.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft without any oily residue.  </li>
            <li> , I find that my skin is silky soft.  </li>
            <li> Proof of my baby soft skin?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t towel off completely as I like to mix alittle water on my body with the oil.</li>
            <li> The smell, to me, is an old fashioned floral/soapy scent.  </li>
            <li> The sesame oil is hydrophilic and therefore absorbed well by wet skin.</li>
            <li> Useful for moisturizing wet skin after a shower.  </li>
            <li> The effect is like no other!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it daily as I have dry skin due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome Disorder.  </li>
            <li> It is so DRY here that I was using tons of lotion and nothing really made any difference.</li>
            <li> Others seemed more irritating to my skin.    </li>
            <li> Neutragena Body oil stopped the main symptom of chronic dry skin....ITCHING!  </li>
            <li> Apply it after your bath or shower while your skin is still wet n wait a short while to absorb naturally or pat dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower and add to my back for dry skin after my shower.  </li>
            <li> They love this since it doesn&#x27;t go on cold like lotion does.  </li>
            <li> Takes too long to rub in.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert where the humidity level is usually around 6%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other oils, and some felt like they left a residue.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s got dry skin and this after a shower worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> I put it on at the end of my shower and pat myself dry.</li>
            <li> You can air dry or pat yourself dry with a towel and the water stays in your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, I couldn&#x27;t even smell the sesame oil within half an hour of my bath.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Just squirt a little into a running bath and sit back and relax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely a lifelong fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> need to wipe down the outside of the bottle with every use, otherwise it will leave a little puddle under the bottle.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes an extremely long way.</li>
            <li> I had to go on line to get it because I can&#x27;t find it in other stores either.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sorry, bath &amp; body works, but this product could put your lotions and creams out of business, and fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other body oil products and there is no comparison!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using for only two weeks, I developed red bumps behind both arms and thighs.</li>
            <li> Within minutes (or less)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe my stupidity in buying so much.</li>
            <li> It is not oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where it&#x27;s always dry and hate going to bed with itchy skin</li>
            <li> like maybe it&#x27;s very old.  :-(</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve used it for the past decade!</li>
            <li> Well , i have to say  am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> on thin and doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky.</li>
            <li> I always cross the street whenever I see people selling these awful smelling scented things.  </li>
            <li> I hate using lotion.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena Light Sesame Formula Body Oil for decades - so I am really familiar with the scent.  I have purchased it via Amazon before, from others, no longer available, and it was fine.  This batch, from this retailer, has an off odor - like maybe it&#x27;s very old.  :-(</li>
            <li> What can I say? my friend who lives overseas asks me to bring this to him whenever I visit, and it&#x27;s the only thing on his wish list.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena body oil is great for lubricating your skin after the shower. It&#x27;s a quick way to keep your skin moist.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have used it before. It is a light moisturizing oil suitable for any skin type. I find it expecially good in the summer months. It is not oily and heavy. My daugher likes to use a heaver oil in the winter, and I might agree that purhaps the feet might want an heaver oil in the winter months. Great Product! It is also really really good for massage.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this~ greatest moisturizer for my sensitive skin. Wish they had it in PUMP form and have the unscented closer to the same price as the sesame scented..Regardless, I have been using this for YEARS!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a final step after a shower.  Especially during the winter it is a great cure for dry skin.  I even use it on my scalp.  The scent is very plesant and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  I have never had a problem with any kind of iritation or blocked pores with it.  Excellent Product in general.</li>
            <li> This oil feels ok.  My problem is the obnoxious smell of this oil. It smells like Indian/Rasta/Hippie????  incense. I always cross the street whenever I see people selling these awful smelling scented things.  Now I am stuck with two pints of this oil and I don&#x27;t know what to do with it. Can&#x27;t believe my stupidity in buying so much. I so much wanted to like this oil, how I wish it was unscented.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to mineral oil. And it seems everything beauty related or lotion, has mineral oil in it. I found this product when I read that sesame oil is better for your skin than mineral oil. I apply right after my shower to damp skin and let it sink in. Within minutes (or less) it&#x27;s totally absorbed and there&#x27;s NO greasy feeling! It leaves your skin lightly scented and nicely moisturized with a beautiful, healthy sheen. I personally love the scent. It&#x27;s very clean and light and goes well with my other perfumed body lotions or fragrances. I also add this oil to my regular moisturizing lotion (Aveeno) and it makes for a great extra moisturizing product. I buy mine from a bulk warehouse in a HUGE size and it lasts me forever! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a 50:50 mix of Neutrogena sesame oil and baby oil for more than 25 years to remoisturize my otherwise chronically dry skin after showering, swimming, etc. The sesame oil is hydrophilic and therefore absorbed well by wet skin. The baby oil (light mineral oil)is hydrophobic so it stays on the skin surface as a light protective coating and lubricant. An inexpensive year-round basic skin care formula for body, hands, feet, and face. Apply while your skin is still wet for best results.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my sister...she was totally stoked!  Received soonest, great product.</li>
            <li> I found this body oil, because I was wondering what oil that massage places use. I&#x27;m still not sure if this is what they use, but this oil feels a lot like what you&#x27;d get when you get a deluxe massage. The smell is very nice and very subtle, but it also comes in fragrance free, [[ASIN:B005M2DSR8 Neutrogena Body Oil, Fragrance-Free]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. I&#x27;m definitely a lifelong fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Works well&lt;br /&gt;+Smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Unless you use a ton of this with every use, the cap will probably break before you&#x27;re through with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;-You&#x27;ll need to wipe down the outside of the bottle with every use, otherwise it will leave a little puddle under the bottle.</li>
            <li> This body oil smooths skin better than lotions. I has a very fragrant aroma that I love. It used to be sold at Costco in huge bottles but they have discontinued selling it. I had to go on line to get it because I can&#x27;t find it in other stores either. I will buy it again no doubt. My young daughter-in-law loves it as well and she is getting some for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I was already a fan of the bath and body wash, so I thought I&#x27;d give the body oil a try based on the reviews here. OMG - this stuff is amazing! I live in the desert where the humidity level is usually around 6%. It is so DRY here that I was using tons of lotion and nothing really made any difference. Now, I use this product twice a day. It soaks in without any greasy feeling and it really does moisturize like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before. The light fragrance is lovely alone, but isn&#x27;t so much that it interferes with other fragrances like cologne, perfumes, etc. My hubby loves the fragrance too, so it is a winner all around in my book. I&#x27;d buy it by the gallon if I could!</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where it&#x27;s always dry and hate going to bed with itchy skin... use this after every shower and never ever feel itchy... I will use this product daily for the rest of my life!  Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil for many years n I love it. Apply it after your bath or shower while your skin is still wet n wait a short while to absorb naturally or pat dry with a towel. You&#x27;ll just love the way you skin feels after the first use.</li>
            <li> Feel of the oil is fine, but I really can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only one to notice that this smells like patchouli oil. Reminds me of an aging hippie.    I won&#x27;t buy again since I don&#x27;t like smelling like a head shop.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful to use right after your shower or even in the bath.  I love keeping it in my shower with my hair products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for twenty years.  Useful for moisturizing wet skin after a shower.  It is very economical to get this quantity at Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I originally got this as a gift, but realized that my kids might like it since they detest lotion.  They love this since it doesn&#x27;t go on cold like lotion does.  So now I have to buy one for them and one for me!  It has a pleasant light smell that is not strong.  Although it is \\&quot;oil\\&quot; I feel like it is quickly absorbed and keeps my skin soft and not dry and isn&#x27;t greasy on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Love this body oil.  I have very dry skin and this just keeps it supple if applied after my shower, under some regular lotion application.  I found that it is also a great remedy for mild sun damage.</li>
            <li> I have  purchased this product and really like the oil.  When I purchased it before it came with a pump for dispensing.  I much prefer it with the pump for dispensing rather than a small hole in the flip top lid.  The pump is easier and neater.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product because it kept my skin moist, without a greasy feeling. Unfortunately, after using for only two weeks, I developed red bumps behind both arms and thighs. Seems I have Keratosis Pilaris. Super bummed because I absolutely loved the product!</li>
            <li> As a lover of relaxing baths, I was concerned about my skin drying out. I&#x27;ve tried several body lotions on the market (from both the U.S. and overseas), but I never found my holy grail until now. Just squirt a little into a running bath and sit back and relax. You don&#x27;t need to rub it in for it to work. As the oil spreads throughout the water, you just need to soak. Alternatively, you can use the product once you get out of bath or shower. It is best to apply a few drops to your body before you towel off for maximum moisturization. After bathing in it, my skin always feel very moisturized and surprisingly non-greasy! I really dislike oily products because I fear transferring residue everywhere, but this was not a problem after I got out of the bath. My skin absorbed the oil quickly and felt silky afterwards. The sesame oil is pleasant and light, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance or simply prefer none of it at all, Neutrogena also makes a fragrance-free version (I spotted it at my local Target). Personally, I couldn&#x27;t even smell the sesame oil within half an hour of my bath. I find that my skin stays mositurized and smooth throughout the day, so I didn&#x27;t need to reapply in the evening at all.     Note: It is slightly hazardous applying this while standing in the shower. It makes the shower floor very slippery, so be careful! :)</li>
            <li> This oil is great for keeping your hands soft and your bath water from being too drying (just be careful not to use too much or the tub can get slippery). It also is a great massage oil. Although it&#x27;s sesame-based, it isn&#x27;t food grade so don&#x27;t try to use it in any situtation where you&#x27;d be ingesting it. ALso, don&#x27;t use it as eye makeup remover because oil will sting and cloud your eyes temporarily.</li>
            <li> I hate using lotion.  Takes too long to rub in.  This stuff is like a dream in a bottle. Goes on smooth, is not greasy and smells divine.</li>
            <li> If you love a soft fresh scent in a luxurious body oil, you need look no further.  I try others, but always go back to this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena Body Oil for nearly 10 years.  It leaves your skin feeling soft without any oily residue.  Just put it on after a shower and let it absorb for a minute or two.  It also has a pleasant subtle scent.  I&#x27;ve used other oils, and some felt like they left a residue.  Others seemed more irritating to my skin.    This body oil works great.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve used it for the past decade!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for after shower for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a renowned name in the beauty industry and so when I viewed this body oil two pack, I realized that this was a fantastic savings.  I have used this product for over tw0 decades and at age 54, I find that my skin is silky soft.  The best way to apply the body old is when you step out of the shower. Place some oil in your hand, and then rub the oil onto your body.  It absorbs quickly and has a fresh sesame scent.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and a lovely product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this several times from Amazon. Best bath oil I&#x27;ve ever had and my BF isn&#x27;t allergic to the scent! Double bonus!</li>
            <li> The best body oil  I always use it . I like the big bottles a really good value.THank you for caring it.</li>
            <li> Love Neutrogena oil!!!  I do water aerobics every day and go. Into the hot tub.  This is the only thing that has he&#x27;d with the itch.</li>
            <li> Light, fresh, soft, silky, succulent!  Nice fragrance.  Not overpowering.  Keeps skin smooth and soft, great bargain in the two pack, available for interval shipping as well, eligible for free super saver shipping with amazon a plus.  Fresh from the shower, seal in moisture using this product, love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This body oil is light and not greasy feeling.I like how it feels on my skin and I really like the fragrance.  It is very convenient to put on my damp skin right after my shower to lock in the moisture.  My mother used this for years and so have I.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  She&#x27;s got dry skin and this after a shower worked wonders.  A little bit goes an extremely long way.</li>
            <li> Luv,luv this oil! I use it religiously, it&#x27;s lite &amp; mixes well w/any perfume. I only wish that Neutrogena would re-visit this oil w/a sun screen formula. The rejuvenating shower gel is great also.</li>
            <li> I love this body oil. I use it right after my shower and it soaks right in. And the fragrance is heavenly!</li>
            <li> So my wife bought it. Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used so i stole it from her. :D</li>
            <li> I have loved this oil for years now.  I have a lot of family members inteerested now too.  When I use it in the morning it works as perfume, soft and light.  So it works two ways for me.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena Body Oil for years.  I keep it in the shower and add to my back for dry skin after my shower.  Its a great value to buy through Amazon instead of a drug store.</li>
            <li> Neutragena Body oil stopped the main symptom of chronic dry skin....ITCHING!  I love the outdoors and summertime, but my chronic dry skin made trips to the beach and the pool a nightmare.  Neutragena&#x27;s light oil formula used at the end of my shower did away with all the post shower itching and ashy skin as well!  My girlfriend turned me on to this and it works!</li>
            <li> great skin softner especially in winter-avilable locally but much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why any more words are required</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time &amp; love putting it on in the shower &amp; wrapping up in my big bathrobe &amp; letting it soak in. I put mine into a medium size spray bottle for easier all-over use when my husband isn&#x27;t around to apply to my back.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the one I usually buy.  It almost has a rancid odor!  Won&#x27;t purchase again from you!</li>
            <li> I wish if i can find it cheaper but I like this oil for massage and for the body. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> So light you never feel greasy, but moisturizes your whole body.  I put it on at the end of my shower and pat myself dry.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this Neutragena Body Oil and use it on our skin before we get out of the shower. It&#x27;s also perfect to add to my daughter&#x27;s bath to soften her skin. She hates lotion being rubbed on her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neutragena Body Oil Light Sesame Formula is natural, has a very slight fresh fragrance, and is quite moisturizing. You can air dry or pat yourself dry with a towel and the water stays in your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller gives a great deal by offering a pack of two. We always buy from her!</li>
            <li> this retails for something like $10+ in stores for an 8oz bottle. are you kidding me? i caught this at $25.55 for 2 - 16oz bottles. i can&#x27;t even believe i bothered with body cream for so many years. never again. i&#x27;m sorry, bath &amp; body works, but this product could put your lotions and creams out of business, and fast.</li>
            <li> Well , i have to say  am not happy with this product. Even though specs match what i bought in CVS pharmacy ..quality is not the same.. I am bit disspointed</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it after showers to moisturize my ultra dry skin, and it not only is light, it smells wonderful, and my body laps it up like a sponge absorbs water.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it daily as I have dry skin due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome Disorder.  The scent is great and absorbs evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Body Oil for 30 years and it has proven to be the most effective moisturizer albeit all the fancy schmancy products filling today&#x27;s shelves. After a shower or bath, hand swipe the excess water off your body and apply Neutrogena Body Oil. The effect is like no other! I&#x27;ve tried other body oil products and there is no comparison! Proof of my baby soft skin? The men in my life! 8?)</li>
            <li> I apply this product while still in the shower after turning the water off.  It soaks right into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells okay, a little too good for a guy, but the light scent doesn&#x27;t hang around for too long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job of preventing dry skin for overall body use.  Use in combination with a strong hand cream for total protection.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day during winer months right after a shower. I don&#x27;t towel off completely as I like to mix alittle water on my body with the oil.</li>
            <li> Literally.  I like many other Neutrogena products but the scent in this stuff burned my eyes and gave me a splitting headache.  I&#x27;m sending it back!!!!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended I try this oil for \\&quot;lubrication.\\&quot;  Of course, I found it on Amazon and ordered next day shipping, I was so enthused about trying it!  The 2 bottle set comes packaged nicely.  You could almost see giving it as a gift!  The smell, to me, is an old fashioned floral/soapy scent.  I like it.  I applied some of this oil to my dry skin and it soaked right in, without leaving a trace of grease or shine.  I can myself buying this again; I am very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> This is the best body oil that I have found and have been using it daily for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this, no matter if it is the best product for chapped or not. I buy in bulk to save money as I have bottles in every bathroom in the 2 houses I own. This is a good deal for the product</li>
            <li> The scent of the body oil is light and fragrant and it&#x27;s not greasy.  It&#x27;s easy to apply in the shower on damp skin and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. She smells so nice and feels so soft and smooth it is exciting plus it is a good deal</li>
            <li> Contents inside bottles of items purchased are conterfeit. Neutrogena Body Oil was replaced with something that smells like vegetable oil. I am requesting a full REFUND PLUS SHIPPING AND HANDLING.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product especially in the winter. Thanks to my friend who gave me a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on thin and doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky. Amazing!</li>
