    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Though it does help, I had to use quite a bit, and I think it is best paired with another conditioner.</li>
            <li>The renewal line has the best products.</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner!  </li>
            <li>It is an option, just not as great as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this is a great option for those rushed mornings, and has no smell to it.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Great leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>The Tresemme hair leave in conditioner works great.</li>
            <li>and it is very effective for my use.  </li>
            <li>but now we both love it because it smells so delicious!  </li>
            <li>The spray has a pleasant scent but makes my scalp itchy and for that reason, I do not recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Prize is very cheap for a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very good leave-in conditioner -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Its too much of a good thing in my opinion so hold your breath and spray away.</li>
            <li>I used leave-in conditioner a lot during the 90s, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The liquid is amazing though.</li>
            <li>In order for this to be effective, I had to rinse it out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented, and the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>There is a light, pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>new favorite line!!!</li>
            <li>I did not give it 5 stars because I&#x27;m not over the moon gaga about it, but it&#x27;s definitely worth 4 stars as a great product.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that has a lot of wave and</li>
            <li>Clean and bright and neither perfumey or like a hippie.</li>
            <li>I have another spray product from Tressemme and it too has an obnoxiously strong (but nice smelling) odor.</li>
            <li>I will buy again. :)</li>
            <li>Which, that sort of defeats the point of a leave in conditioner for many.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to be able to use it on days</li>
            <li>Because of the tea tree oil, I thought this might feel refreshing and tingly on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>But not just, my son has curly and sometimes frizzy hair and this has done well in keeping his hair healthy and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo does more for dandruff than medicated ones.</li>
            <li>I love Tresemme products.</li>
            <li>I did choose Tressemme because I&#x27;m very happy with their line of shampoos and regular conditioners.  </li>
            <li>okay, it&#x27;s just over powering.  </li>
            <li>Many hair gels leave residue</li>
            <li>&quot; I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning on her hair to get rid of the frizz and just to be able to get a brush through it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best used on wet hair after it&#x27;s washed.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair</li>
            <li>This spray is lightweight, smells great, and helps keep hair soft and fluffable.  </li>
            <li>I loved the light mist and smell of the spray when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this was going to be a good product.  </li>
            <li>In Conditioning Spray is so easy to use</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like strong scented hair products this one is not for you.  </li>
            <li>My own hair is very straight and fine</li>
            <li>on fine hair</li>
            <li>The first thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the perfume scent of this spray is VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with how my hair turns out when using this product and definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Tresemme Renewal Hair Conditioning Spray is a non-sticky, light weight, leave in hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent</li>
            <li>This is lightly conditioning without causing a lot of build up.</li>
            <li>There is a light fragrance to this product</li>
            <li>It did not make my hair feel smooth or silky at all.</li>
            <li>Originally bought thinking the tea tree oil might be a lice deterrent -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also given my recently bleached hair tips that extra moisture to keep it looking healthy and attractive!  </li>
            <li>It did make it nice and shiny and conditioned, but my fine hair is fussy about what I put on it and this just didn&#x27;t completely satisfy me.  </li>
            <li>Will leave you hair soft and it has a nice light scent to it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and there is no residue on my scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will most certainly continue to use this product on myself and the hair of my son.</li>
            <li>It doesnâ€™t weigh down fine textured hair and has a light, pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and wont way your hair down-it also smells nice enough.</li>
            <li>and I love leave in conditioners, just because I feel like they leave my hair more protected, especially from the sunlight out on the lake.  </li>
            <li>This is a good leave-in conditioner for dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>pump spray bottle is easy to handle and the pump works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So the good news is that a couple of sprays worked well on my boys&#x27; hair, that is, hair that is pretty short.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested this in a few ways, and been happy with all the results.</li>
            <li>prefer a more serious conditioner most of the time, but using this on the ends of my hair with a light traditional conditioner after shampooing seems to be a good mix for making sure the tips are conditioned without causing a lot of product build up near the roots of my hair.</li>
            <li>This gave my hair a bit more body then most of the other products I use.</li>
            <li>The first few times he used it, it was great, but after that, he said he felt like his hair was oily.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not a bad product, and for a different hair type it might work better, but I didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>So I thought trying a good leave in conditioner would help with the tangles and calm the frizzies down.  </li>
            <li>The spray is a fine mist, giving more control in how heavy or how light an application you want to apply.</li>
            <li>all Renewal products removes buildup and leaves hair light and airy and super soft.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t untangle my hair as well as my normal detangler, but did leave my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this affected my scalp any, but my hair looks and feels great when I use it.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, the sprayer does give a decent fine mist to distribute over the hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this for the last few days and love the light weight, yet effective spray-on conditioner.  </li>
            <li>However, with the second washing my scalp was squeaky clean and free of dandruff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say its best paired with the deep conditioner, but that&#x27;s likely to be said of any product since, well, deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, it was all good.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s appreciated!</li>
            <li>I even applied lightly and did not intentionally rub on my scalp (even though the name is called hair and scalp conditioning spray) and my scalp and also parts of my face and neck near my hairline were also itchy.  </li>
            <li>tried it on my daughters hair which is long and VERY fine.</li>
            <li>I let the product dry and hair look healthier and looked a whole lot more refresh after several more uses,.</li>
            <li>My already straight hair hangs very straight and is very shiny after applying this Tresemme Hair Renewal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just keep a large tooth comb and the Conditioning Spray in my shower and after I use the Tresemme&#x27; Platinum Strength Shampoo and Conditioning combo set, I spray the conditioner in my hair and comb it out while still in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It was certainly flattened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seemed to require considerably longer for my hair to air-dry (I rarely use a hair-dryer since I have long hair that I want to keep healthy).</li>
            <li>Works equally well on damp or dry hair and leaves hair smooth and healthy looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li>This leave-in spray is pretty good as a conditioner, but I found that it weighs down my fine hair a little bit too much.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen much difference, but its been a month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Conditioner is light and helps control the frizz that I struggle with on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has been a real delight to use.</li>
            <li>Sorta confused as to why it works great on fine/straight hair, but not on thick/curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have yet to try something i have not liked or loved.</li>
            <li>If your hair is smooth (i.e., not coarse) and full, you might get very different results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it does for the scalp -- but it does work nicely on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have curly, fine hair that is difficult to get looking neat and tidy.</li>
            <li>Decent product, not greasy and works well as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;Subtracting a star because of the over-powering smell.</li>
            <li>This one is very average and has very light conditioning.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li>But over the course of the day, I noticed my ends seemed to be getting a little more flyaway.</li>
            <li>It was very lightweight and on dry hair it gave me super shine and softness.</li>
            <li>UGH is the best response- my hair got really tangled and the flyaways got 10 times worse when my hair dried.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I also had no trouble washing it out the next day.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>When I am in a hurry, I like being able to skip the usual conditioning routine and will continue to keep this on hand for those times.  </li>
            <li>thing I should mention is that this has a lovely, and not overwhelming, scent.  </li>
            <li>Great for the frizzy dry tired hair..</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I am going to wear my hair in a curly style (I have natural corkscrew curls)</li>
            <li>It detangles my course, yet straightened hair, leaving it soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair looking neat, yet still allows my natural curl to shine through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I used too much or didnâ€™t rinse out soap well enough.  </li>
            <li>It does virtually nothing for my hair - results in some frizzies but does makes my hair somewhat soft.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m a bit older, and my hair texture has changed considerably, so it&#x27;s possible that nothing except the old fashioned, slather-on-in-the-shower-and-wait-three-minutes could help me, regardless of the brand.</li>
            <li>I donâ€™t like flat straight hair, even if it took care of the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Overall not a terrible product, but not sure I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I just spray on wet hair and comb through, or lightly spritz on dry hair.</li>
            <li>A few spritz here and there is quite enough to easily comb through with no de-tangler needed.</li>
            <li>So I will say that this product left my hair somewhat limp and volume-less, if tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I love that they are affordable and work well on my thick Italian hair.  </li>
            <li>While I usually use a detangler on my hair, I decided to give this product a try as I&#x27;ve used Tresemme products in the past with good results.</li>
            <li>My hair honestly is left with that after salon feeling of soft and smoothness!</li>
            <li>I used my old stuff the next day and -voila- back to normal again.</li>
            <li>It is pretty lightweight, and I don&#x27;t think it would provide adequate conditioning in and of itself on particularly dry or thick hair.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t generally use them and finding an alternative</li>
            <li>My hair is long and straight and I was hoping for a softening, volumizing effect like the Nexxus Youth Renewal Elixir drops that I tested earlier for Vine.</li>
            <li>After use, my hair as well as my sons was left looking and feeling soft and quite healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my curly hair, it gives it a much better feel and way less frizz than using plain water.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long thin hair and it tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>Did not dry out my hair or cause flakiness  to it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll use a little water and then finish up with the Tresemme, either way, much better results than plain water.</li>
            <li>enjoy Tresemme products, but this is just not a good conditioning spray.</li>
            <li>My hair is color treated, long (about 4 inches below my shoulders) and naturally wavy.</li>

            <li> However, with the second washing my scalp was squeaky clean and free of dandruff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say its best paired with the deep conditioner, but that&#x27;s likely to be said of any product since, well, deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, it was all good.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s appreciated!</li>
            <li> I even applied lightly and did not intentionally rub on my scalp (even though the name is called hair and scalp conditioning spray) and my scalp and also parts of my face and neck near my hairline were also itchy.  </li>
            <li> tried it on my daughters hair which is long and VERY fine.</li>
            <li> I let the product dry and hair look healthier and looked a whole lot more refresh after several more uses,.</li>
            <li> My already straight hair hangs very straight and is very shiny after applying this Tresemme Hair Renewal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just keep a large tooth comb and the Conditioning Spray in my shower and after I use the Tresemme&#x27; Platinum Strength Shampoo and Conditioning combo set, I spray the conditioner in my hair and comb it out while still in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It was certainly flattened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seemed to require considerably longer for my hair to air-dry (I rarely use a hair-dryer since I have long hair that I want to keep healthy).</li>
            <li> Works equally well on damp or dry hair and leaves hair smooth and healthy looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li> This leave-in spray is pretty good as a conditioner, but I found that it weighs down my fine hair a little bit too much.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen much difference, but its been a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Conditioner is light and helps control the frizz that I struggle with on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has been a real delight to use.</li>
            <li> Sorta confused as to why it works great on fine/straight hair, but not on thick/curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have yet to try something i have not liked or loved.</li>
            <li> If your hair is smooth (i.e., not coarse) and full, you might get very different results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it does for the scalp -- but it does work nicely on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have curly, fine hair that is difficult to get looking neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> Decent product, not greasy and works well as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;Subtracting a star because of the over-powering smell.</li>
            <li> This one is very average and has very light conditioning.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> But over the course of the day, I noticed my ends seemed to be getting a little more flyaway.</li>
            <li> It was very lightweight and on dry hair it gave me super shine and softness.</li>
            <li> UGH is the best response- my hair got really tangled and the flyaways got 10 times worse when my hair dried.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I also had no trouble washing it out the next day.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> When I am in a hurry, I like being able to skip the usual conditioning routine and will continue to keep this on hand for those times.  </li>
            <li> thing I should mention is that this has a lovely, and not overwhelming, scent.  </li>
            <li> Great for the frizzy dry tired hair..</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I am going to wear my hair in a curly style (I have natural corkscrew curls)</li>
            <li> It detangles my course, yet straightened hair, leaving it soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair looking neat, yet still allows my natural curl to shine through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I used too much or didnâ€™t rinse out soap well enough.  </li>
            <li> It does virtually nothing for my hair - results in some frizzies but does makes my hair somewhat soft.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m a bit older, and my hair texture has changed considerably, so it&#x27;s possible that nothing except the old fashioned, slather-on-in-the-shower-and-wait-three-minutes could help me, regardless of the brand.</li>
            <li> I donâ€™t like flat straight hair, even if it took care of the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Overall not a terrible product, but not sure I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I just spray on wet hair and comb through, or lightly spritz on dry hair.</li>
            <li> A few spritz here and there is quite enough to easily comb through with no de-tangler needed.</li>
            <li> So I will say that this product left my hair somewhat limp and volume-less, if tangle free.  </li>
            <li> I love that they are affordable and work well on my thick Italian hair.  </li>
            <li> While I usually use a detangler on my hair, I decided to give this product a try as I&#x27;ve used Tresemme products in the past with good results.</li>
            <li> My hair honestly is left with that after salon feeling of soft and smoothness!</li>
            <li> I used my old stuff the next day and -voila- back to normal again.</li>
            <li> It is pretty lightweight, and I don&#x27;t think it would provide adequate conditioning in and of itself on particularly dry or thick hair.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t generally use them and finding an alternative</li>
            <li> My hair is long and straight and I was hoping for a softening, volumizing effect like the Nexxus Youth Renewal Elixir drops that I tested earlier for Vine.</li>
            <li> After use, my hair as well as my sons was left looking and feeling soft and quite healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my curly hair, it gives it a much better feel and way less frizz than using plain water.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long thin hair and it tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> Did not dry out my hair or cause flakiness  to it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll use a little water and then finish up with the Tresemme, either way, much better results than plain water.</li>
            <li> enjoy Tresemme products, but this is just not a good conditioning spray.</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated, long (about 4 inches below my shoulders) and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> I will apply a second coating of spray after the initial towel dry to ensure my curls dry soft and non-frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made their hair feel more soft and smooth and decreased the small amount of little tangles each one normally had with brushing (especially the one with very thick hair).</li>
            <li> I really like the other Tresemme products I&#x27;ve tried, especially their original shampoo, so this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> There is a minimal scent that is barely detectible to me.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and very faint.</li>
            <li> I generally shower at night and refresh in the morning with spritzes of water and leave-in conditioner, before adding other product.</li>
            <li> the 10 oz size bottle goes a long way, been using it for 2 months now and counting.</li>
            <li> I also color and process my hair allot which of course means I need to condition allot to fight potential damages these rough process can cost.</li>
            <li> So next I tried it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I tend to apply and blow dry my hair after and found my hair to still be quite workable for all my styling needs.</li>
            <li> I spritzed this on my towel dry hair.</li>
            <li> that because it is colored, tends to dry.</li>
            <li> After about a week it was clear this was hurting my hair, so I stopped, went back the other brand of leave-in conditioner I usually use, and a heavy-duty conditioner in the shower, and my hair returned to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did not like the way it left her hair feeling because it left it sorta stiff and crunchy,</li>
            <li> Later, however, this conditioner left my hair feeling heavy and weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Tresemme products and really liked them, so I was disappointed with this one.  </li>
            <li> For winter months, I&#x27;ll stick to the heavy duty products like serums and deep treatments because the winter is harsher on my hair.</li>
            <li> Per the instructions this product is applied to towel dried yet still obviously damp hair.</li>
            <li> I carefully followed the sparse instructions.</li>
            <li> It complements the Tresemme&#x27; shampoo and conditioner and doesn&#x27;t compete with other hygiene products I use.  </li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner works wonders for me and only requires a small amount and still leaves hair weightless.</li>
            <li> BUT that might be due to my hair type.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is about the packaging.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again as it combines conditioner with detangler, which cuts down on the time I need to spend on my hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not weighing down my hair or making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my very thick hair about every 3 days, and I felt like the two together made my hair seem a bit less oily than normal by the time day 3 rolls</li>
            <li> the leave in can tend to leave your hair with a slightly greasy look.</li>
            <li> husband also had this effect in his hair, even with a lot less hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to straighten it, and am always on the lookout for products to help tame the curls without weighing them down or having my hair look like it&#x27;s got a ton of product in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It adds a little shine and makes my hair softer.  </li>
            <li> A little tends to go along way.</li>
            <li> So the bottom line is that I may continue to spritz a little in the boys hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m running late and save the minutes spent rinsing out conditioner.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> a lot of conditioners are too heavy to allow any volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just spray on towel dried hair and run a comb through</li>
            <li> In fact, I kept having trouble with my hair</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy like a lot of leave-ins I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> My five year old daughter has very curly, unruly hair that gets tangled horribly.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is that it did not work well for me (moderately short hair) or my daughter with long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my scalp was &amp;#34;nourished at the surface cellular level&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried it with the usual conditioner I use, and it also had an added effect there.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this has not won its way into my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of leave-in conditioner sprays over the past years.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no de-tangling from this; all the tangles were as bad as if I&#x27;d not put any conditioner in my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Dramatic difference noticed when switched to this line of products.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> been using it and I haven&#x27;t seen much difference, but its been a month.</li>
            <li> This is a good leave-in conditioner for dry, itchy scalp. Will leave you hair soft and it has a nice light scent to it. Don&#x27;t use this with a second day hair, it will leave your hair with a sticky, frizzy feeling - follow the instructions. Been using this for 2 months now and will definitely buy again however! I don&#x27;t find it anywhere else but Amazon...why?! Prize is very cheap for a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very good leave-in conditioner - the 10 oz size bottle goes a long way, been using it for 2 months now and counting. I will buy again. :)</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this conditioner before school every morning.  Originally bought thinking the tea tree oil might be a lice deterrent - but now we both love it because it smells so delicious!  Clean and bright and neither perfumey or like a hippie.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last few days and love the light weight, yet effective spray-on conditioner.  It&#x27;s best used on wet hair after it&#x27;s washed.  There is a minimal scent that is barely detectible to me.  I am happy with how my hair turns out when using this product and definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tresemme products for years now.  I love that they are affordable and work well on my thick Italian hair.  I just keep a large tooth comb and the Conditioning Spray in my shower and after I use the Tresemme&#x27; Platinum Strength Shampoo and Conditioning combo set, I spray the conditioner in my hair and comb it out while still in the shower.  The steam from the shower seems to enhance the effectiveness of the spray.  Sometimes if I am going to wear my hair in a curly style (I have natural corkscrew curls) I will apply a second coating of spray after the initial towel dry to ensure my curls dry soft and non-frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragrance too.  It complements the Tresemme&#x27; shampoo and conditioner and doesn&#x27;t compete with other hygiene products I use.  Will definitely be keeping this in my beauty regime&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Tresemme Renewal Hair Conditioning Spray is a non-sticky, light weight, leave in hair conditioner. It adds a little shine and makes my hair softer.  The scent is nice and very faint. However, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;help treat surface signs of hair damage&amp;#34; as promised. I&#x27;m not sure if my scalp was &amp;#34;nourished at the surface cellular level&amp;#34; either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Leave-In Conditioning works well...I use allot of their products because it is salon quality and affordable. I also color and process my hair allot which of course means I need to condition allot to fight potential damages these rough process can cost. It&#x27;s light and wont way your hair down-it also smells nice enough. Great for the frizzy dry tired hair..it works well.</li>
            <li> While I usually use a detangler on my hair, I decided to give this product a try as I&#x27;ve used Tresemme products in the past with good results. I prefer spray-on conditioners to those you have to rinse out as I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait the 2+ minutes to let the conditioner set before rinsing. This didn&#x27;t untangle my hair as well as my normal detangler, but did leave my hair smooth and shiny. Will buy this again as it combines conditioner with detangler, which cuts down on the time I need to spend on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested this in a few ways, and been happy with all the results. The directions indicate to use after the Tresemme Renewal Deep Conditioner, and the two combined do make for softer hair. I usually wash my very thick hair about every 3 days, and I felt like the two together made my hair seem a bit less oily than normal by the time day 3 rolls around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it by itself, without any conditioner in the shower. Though it does help, I had to use quite a bit, and I think it is best paired with another conditioner. Which, that sort of defeats the point of a leave in conditioner for many. I was hoping to be able to use it on days I&#x27;m running late and save the minutes spent rinsing out conditioner. It is an option, just not as great as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried it with the usual conditioner I use, and it also had an added effect there. It made brushing through my hair easier, and seemed to control a bit of the frizz I tend to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say its best paired with the deep conditioner, but that&#x27;s likely to be said of any product since, well, deep conditioner. But this is a great option for those rushed mornings, and has no smell to it.</li>
            <li> I swim a lot so I like to use some extra conditioning to protect my hair from the chemicals.  This leave-in spray is pretty good as a conditioner, but I found that it weighs down my fine hair a little bit too much.  It did make it nice and shiny and conditioned, but my fine hair is fussy about what I put on it and this just didn&#x27;t completely satisfy me.  I will continue to use it though on occasion because it did find some benefit.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioning spray is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using every week for several weeks.  The scent is lovely and not overwhelming.  It detangles my course, yet straightened hair, leaving it soft to the touch.  Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post the initial use, I notice some drying on my scalp.  However, with the second washing my scalp was squeaky clean and free of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I like the light scent and I use it instead of water to &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; my curly hair, it gives it a much better feel and way less frizz than using plain water. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use a little water and then finish up with the Tresemme, either way, much better results than plain water. I like it a lot and will probably buy it when I run out of my trial bottle. I did not give it 5 stars because I&#x27;m not over the moon gaga about it, but it&#x27;s definitely worth 4 stars as a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this affected my scalp any, but my hair looks and feels great when I use it. I spray it on after a shower, brush through and there you go! It isn&#x27;t heavy like a lot of leave-ins I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have curly, fine hair that is difficult to get looking neat and tidy. I don&#x27;t like to straighten it, and am always on the lookout for products to help tame the curls without weighing them down or having my hair look like it&#x27;s got a ton of product in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Conditioner is light and helps control the frizz that I struggle with on a daily basis. I just spray on wet hair and comb through, or lightly spritz on dry hair. It keeps my hair looking neat, yet still allows my natural curl to shine through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see several reviewers mention combining it with the conditioner. I use it after shampooing, yet also on the days I don&#x27;t shampoo just to help control frizz and maintain my hair. It works great.</li>
            <li> While I like the smell the leave in can tend to leave your hair with a slightly greasy look. Overall not a terrible product, but not sure I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Tresemme is a brand name that I trust and I love leave in conditioners, just because I feel like they leave my hair more protected, especially from the sunlight out on the lake.  The first few times I used it, it was all good.  Later, however, this conditioner left my hair feeling heavy and weighted down.  I thought maybe I used too much or didnâ€™t rinse out soap well enough.  I donâ€™t like flat straight hair, even if it took care of the frizzies.  In order for this to be effective, I had to rinse it out really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also had this effect in his hair, even with a lot less hair.  The first few times he used it, it was great, but after that, he said he felt like his hair was oily.  It was certainly flattened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend his for occasional use, if your hair feels damaged, or even proactively, if you know you are going to be out in the sunlight all day.</li>
            <li> This is lightly conditioning without causing a lot of build up. It also works well as a detangling spray, and seems to help prevent frizzing for my daughter who has curly hair. My own hair is very straight and fine and it&#x27;s not weighing down my hair or making it look greasy. It&#x27;s lightly scented, and the scent is pleasant. I like the spray, and the size of the bottle as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a more serious conditioner most of the time, but using this on the ends of my hair with a light traditional conditioner after shampooing seems to be a good mix for making sure the tips are conditioned without causing a lot of product build up near the roots of my hair. For winter months, I&#x27;ll stick to the heavy duty products like serums and deep treatments because the winter is harsher on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated, long (about 4 inches below my shoulders) and naturally wavy. I generally shower at night and refresh in the morning with spritzes of water and leave-in conditioner, before adding other product. When I used this Tresemme renewal, my ends turned into flyaway, crunchy frizzies. There was absolutely no de-tangling from this; all the tangles were as bad as if I&#x27;d not put any conditioner in my hair at all. After about a week it was clear this was hurting my hair, so I stopped, went back the other brand of leave-in conditioner I usually use, and a heavy-duty conditioner in the shower, and my hair returned to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy Tresemme products, but this is just not a good conditioning spray.</li>
            <li> This spray is lightweight, smells great, and helps keep hair soft and fluffable.  Because of the tea tree oil, I thought this might feel refreshing and tingly on the scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m not sure what it does for the scalp -- but it does work nicely on my hair.  It is pretty lightweight, and I don&#x27;t think it would provide adequate conditioning in and of itself on particularly dry or thick hair.</li>
            <li> Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Leave-In Conditioning Spray has done wonders for my hair! But not just, my son has curly and sometimes frizzy hair and this has done well in keeping his hair healthy and moisturized.  Per the instructions this product is applied to towel dried yet still obviously damp hair. A few spritz here and there is quite enough to easily comb through with no de-tangler needed. After use, my hair as well as my sons was left looking and feeling soft and quite healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I tend to apply and blow dry my hair after and found my hair to still be quite workable for all my styling needs. My hair honestly is left with that after salon feeling of soft and smoothness! There is a light fragrance to this product but it&#x27;s not overpowering as I thought maybe it would be.  This product has been a real delight to use. There&#x27;s been no adverse reactions, itchy scalp, residue, or flakes. A little tends to go along way. It&#x27;s also given my recently bleached hair tips that extra moisture to keep it looking healthy and attractive!  I will most certainly continue to use this product on myself and the hair of my son.</li>
            <li> The renewal line has the best products. The shampoo does more for dandruff than medicated ones. The leave in conditioner works wonders for me and only requires a small amount and still leaves hair weightless. all Renewal products removes buildup and leaves hair light and airy and super soft. Dramatic difference noticed when switched to this line of products.&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite line!!!</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner. Did not dry out my hair or cause flakiness  to it. This gave my hair a bit more body then most of the other products I use. I rolled my hair after putting this in. I let the product dry and hair look healthier and looked a whole lot more refresh after several more uses,. Saw a difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Decent product, not greasy and works well as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;Subtracting a star because of the over-powering smell. I have another spray product from Tressemme and it too has an obnoxiously strong (but nice smelling) odor. Its too much of a good thing in my opinion so hold your breath and spray away.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner!  It doesnâ€™t weigh down fine textured hair and has a light, pleasant scent.  Works equally well on damp or dry hair and leaves hair smooth and healthy looking and feeling.  The spray is a fine mist, giving more control in how heavy or how light an application you want to apply.</li>
            <li> I carefully followed the sparse instructions. I spritzed this on my towel dry hair. Since there were no specifics, I sprayed from my roots to my ends. As directed, I ran my fingers through my hair to fully distribute the product. It seemed to require considerably longer for my hair to air-dry (I rarely use a hair-dryer since I have long hair that I want to keep healthy). And, the results? As though I had done nothing differently at all. I saw virtually no difference between the results of my regular routine and this instance (of using Renewal). Luckily, I also had no trouble washing it out the next day. Needless to say, this has not won its way into my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I love Tresemme products. I have yet to try something i have not liked or loved. My only complaint is about the packaging. The spray nozzel doesn&#x27;t spray enough at once with each pump. The liquid is amazing though. Leaves my hair shiny all day!</li>
            <li> I used leave-in conditioner a lot during the 90s, and loved it.  I did choose Tressemme because I&#x27;m very happy with their line of shampoos and regular conditioners.  Now I&#x27;m a bit older, and my hair texture has changed considerably, so it&#x27;s possible that nothing except the old fashioned, slather-on-in-the-shower-and-wait-three-minutes could help me, regardless of the brand. So I will say that this product left my hair somewhat limp and volume-less, if tangle free.  BUT that might be due to my hair type.  If your hair is smooth (i.e., not coarse) and full, you might get very different results.  When I am in a hurry, I like being able to skip the usual conditioning routine and will continue to keep this on hand for those times.  But as a go-to conditioner, I&#x27;ll stick with my Tressemme liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I should mention is that this has a lovely, and not overwhelming, scent.  That&#x27;s appreciated!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this was going to be a good product.  I&#x27;ve used other Tresemme products and really liked them, so I was disappointed with this one.  My five year old daughter has very curly, unruly hair that gets tangled horribly.  So I thought trying a good leave in conditioner would help with the tangles and calm the frizzies down.  The first thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that the perfume scent of this spray is VERY strong.  If you don&#x27;t like strong scented hair products this one is not for you.  I like the scent itself okay, it&#x27;s just over powering.  The second thing is that it did not help with the tangles, it didn&#x27;t even make her hair softer, it ended up making it sticky and crunchy.  So it didn&#x27;t help with the tangles at all.  I did not like the way it left her hair feeling because it left it sorta stiff and crunchy, like I stated already.  So it&#x27;s not a bad product, and for a different hair type it might work better, but I didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> i took a chance with this leave in, as the reviews were split. I have thick curly hair that because it is colored, tends to dry. I loved the light mist and smell of the spray when I first put it on. It was very lightweight and on dry hair it gave me super shine and softness. But over the course of the day, I noticed my ends seemed to be getting a little more flyaway. So next I tried it on wet hair. UGH is the best response- my hair got really tangled and the flyaways got 10 times worse when my hair dried. So plan B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my daughters hair which is long and VERY fine. It added shine, softness and some detangling. Sorta confused as to why it works great on fine/straight hair, but not on thick/curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to summarize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;smell&lt;br /&gt;light weaight&lt;br /&gt;great shine&lt;br /&gt;works on fine hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;causes flyaways and tangled on curly/thick hair</li>
            <li> I have tried Tresemme products before because they are affordable products for hair care.  I have never used a leave in conditioner before but thought I would give this a whirl.  I have very fine hair that has a lot of wave and a lot of conditioners are too heavy to allow any volume to my hair.  Many hair gels leave residue so I don&#x27;t generally use them and finding an alternative can be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;This Leave-In Conditioning Spray is so easy to use and it is very effective for my use.  Just spray on towel dried hair and run a comb through and you are done.  There is a light, pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering. My hair feels clean and there is no residue on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The pump spray bottle is easy to handle and the pump works very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> So the good news is that a couple of sprays worked well on my boys&#x27; hair, that is, hair that is pretty short. It made their hair feel more soft and smooth and decreased the small amount of little tangles each one normally had with brushing (especially the one with very thick hair). The bad news is that it did not work well for me (moderately short hair) or my daughter with long hair. It did not make my hair feel smooth or silky at all. In fact, I kept having trouble with my hair and then I realized that it was because of the conditioner. I used my old stuff the next day and -voila- back to normal again. It did help to minimize tangles in my daughters hair, but it made her hair look a bit clumpy, almost greasy. So the bottom line is that I may continue to spritz a little in the boys hair but I will not ever use it again for my daughter or me.</li>
            <li> This product is a \\&quot;leave-in conditioning spray.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did add weight to my hair, coating individual strands of hair. My already straight hair hangs very straight and is very shiny after applying this Tresemme Hair Renewal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This contains \\&quot;Tea Tree Extract &amp; Sunflower Seed Oil.\\&quot; I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The Tresemme hair leave in conditioner works great. My daughter has long thin hair and it tangles very easily. I use this every morning on her hair to get rid of the frizz and just to be able to get a brush through it. The spray also lasts all day in her hair.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of leave-in conditioner sprays over the past years.  This one is very average and has very light conditioning.  It does virtually nothing for my hair - results in some frizzies but does makes my hair somewhat soft.  The spray has a pleasant scent but makes my scalp itchy and for that reason, I do not recommend it.  I even applied lightly and did not intentionally rub on my scalp (even though the name is called hair and scalp conditioning spray) and my scalp and also parts of my face and neck near my hairline were also itchy.  On a positive note, the sprayer does give a decent fine mist to distribute over the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the other Tresemme products I&#x27;ve tried, especially their original shampoo, so this was a big disappointment. My hair is long and straight and I was hoping for a softening, volumizing effect like the Nexxus Youth Renewal Elixir drops that I tested earlier for Vine. However, this spray didn&#x27;t make my hair feel much different than just spraying water on it, and the chemical-ish fragrance didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Nexxus.</li>
