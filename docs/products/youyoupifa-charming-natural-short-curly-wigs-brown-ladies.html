            <li>looks great so prepare yourself for complements</li>
            <li>It was a great price.</li>
            <li>So beautiful hair look grate,color nice</li>
            <li>I do love the wig, for the price the quality is very good.</li>
            <li>But it is good for the price.  </li>
            <li>Style is good.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>It is more wavy than curly but since it is not tangle free this is probably for the best.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is light and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Love the wig!</li>
            <li>I bought it because my own hair wont hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>Nice coverage</li>
            <li>It is great for a quick style change...</li>
            <li>The wig kind of squished in the bag, but it kept more of the curl than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if it was made more towards children.</li>
            <li>It has an adjustable strap to fit any head size!  </li>
            <li>Sincerely, Lorie</li>
            <li>Appears to be more of a reddish brown.</li>
            <li>Fits comfortably enough--the inner loops to adjust it are stitched over, but tightening it to where I could ended up perfect for me (my hair is buzzed, so if you&#x27;re piling hair underneath, you may not even need to tighten</li>
            <li>it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not an amazing product, but definitely worth the twelve dollars I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Not a thin skimpy wig --I am VERY satisfied</li>
            <li>Totally fun hair for my grand daughter with leukemia.  </li>
            <li>Really cute wig, looks good on except for the bangs being to long and you can cut those.</li>
            <li>and hey, what a terrific price  quality is very good and very naturak looking.  </li>
            <li>Picture does not show true color.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for but this is not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>the cheap kind like Aqua Net.</li>
            <li>They included a free wig cap (black), which was a pleasant surprise, even though I don&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li>The stitching show through if you do not style it just right and use some super hold hair spray...</li>
            <li>I love the way this natural stlye just bounces and flows in the wind  </li>
            <li>Would have liked it better if it wasn&#x27;t so small.</li>
            <li>Hey it is cheap and better than expected.</li>
            <li>However I would recommend this for anyone who wants to buy a fun wig at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a joke</li>
            <li>Id say the wig runs on the smaller side to the &#x27;one size fits most.&#x27;</li>
            <li>actual strands are nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>The hair is very &#x27;flat&#x27; and took a bit of fluffing up to make it look more realistic and not so &#x27;greasy&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Most things I have ordered here have arrived quickly, so I ordered it a few weeks before Halloween, hoping to have it by Halloween.</li>
            <li>The bangs were tricky to get smoothed out, but hey, so are real bangs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I was able to get it in place, I had to comb the hair around since you could slightly see some of the netting in spots and the bangs did not fall like in the photo.</li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than I would have liked, I guess my head is bigger than I thought.</li>
            <li>But it did not arrive until early December.</li>
            <li>Wig is soft and seems well made.  </li>
            <li>i looked like a 30 year old Shirley temple.</li>
            <li>I like the style, a little long for me...would it be able to be trimmed.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately its not as curley as pictured, more wavy really.  </li>
            <li>Curls were tight and super cute but it seemed a bit on the thin side.</li>

            <li> Hey it is cheap and better than expected. It is great for a quick style change...bad hair day or party. The stitching show through if you do not style it just right and use some super hold hair spray...the cheap kind like Aqua Net. It is more wavy than curly but since it is not tangle free this is probably for the best. You get what you pay for but this is not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I got it today.So beautiful hair look grate,color nice and they&#x27;re come with hair net too. I am recommend. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I do love the wig, for the price the quality is very good. It is a little smaller than I would have liked, I guess my head is bigger than I thought. The only issue I had with it was that it took so long to arrive. Most things I have ordered here have arrived quickly, so I ordered it a few weeks before Halloween, hoping to have it by Halloween. But it did not arrive until early December. Other than that I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wrong color, bad packaging, slow shipping. Do not buy!  The wig looks like a rats nest due to the poor packaging. The wig I received is fire-engine red not brown like I ordered. The wig is not curly it is a frizzy ugly mess. At first I thought it was a joke but the only joke is on me :(</li>
            <li> Wig is soft and seems well made.  Unfortunately its not as curley as pictured, more wavy really.  I bought it because my own hair wont hold a curl.  But it is good for the price.  It takes a while to receive because it comes from China.  Just wish it was curley.</li>
            <li> this wig was a sloppy mess. i looked like a 30 year old Shirley temple. not cute, i never wore it outside the house. ive given up on short wigs</li>
            <li> I love the way this natural stlye just bounces and flows in the wind  looks great so prepare yourself for complements</li>
            <li> I like the style, a little long for me...would it be able to be trimmed.  It was a great price.</li>
            <li> Would have liked it better if it wasn&#x27;t so small. The wig itself is light and looks beautiful. I do have a small head size, but this barely fits on me. I wonder if it was made more towards children.</li>
            <li> The wig did not fit properly and looked like doll hair.</li>
            <li> Curls were tight and super cute but it seemed a bit on the thin side. Once I was able to get it in place, I had to comb the hair around since you could slightly see some of the netting in spots and the bangs did not fall like in the photo. The hair is very &#x27;flat&#x27; and took a bit of fluffing up to make it look more realistic and not so &#x27;greasy&#x27;. There are also two straps (looks like the hook end of a bra strap) that I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to make them &#x27;hold the wig in place.&amp;#34; they are not adjustable and too short to work for me. Id say the wig runs on the smaller side to the &#x27;one size fits most.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a Halloween costume.  It has an adjustable strap to fit any head size!  Included was also a stretchable net mesh. Love the wig!</li>
            <li> Lightweight. Nice coverage and hey, what a terrific price  quality is very good and very naturak looking.  Not a thin skimpy wig --I am VERY satisfied</li>
            <li> Really cute wig, looks good on except for the bangs being to long and you can cut those.</li>
            <li> The color is not what I expected but the quality is on point. I would buy again. In another color of course.</li>
            <li> It arrived about four days sooner than estimated, which still means it took 20 days total.  They included a free wig cap (black), which was a pleasant surprise, even though I don&#x27;t need it.  The wig kind of squished in the bag, but it kept more of the curl than I was expecting.  The bangs were tricky to get smoothed out, but hey, so are real bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual strands are nice and soft.  Fits comfortably enough--the inner loops to adjust it are stitched over, but tightening it to where I could ended up perfect for me (my hair is buzzed, so if you&#x27;re piling hair underneath, you may not even need to tighten it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not an amazing product, but definitely worth the twelve dollars I paid for it.  I added a photo.</li>
            <li> too small for my head</li>
            <li> No Comment Coz I Like All Of them.&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely, Lorie</li>
            <li> Style is good.  Picture does not show true color.  Appears to be more of a reddish brown. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered tow wigs but only received one</li>
