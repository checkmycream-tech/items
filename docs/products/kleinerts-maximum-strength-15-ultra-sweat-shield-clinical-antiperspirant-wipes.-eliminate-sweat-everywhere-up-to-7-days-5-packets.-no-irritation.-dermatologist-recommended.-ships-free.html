            <li>More confidence, I used to sweat like a pig, at first didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it as I sweat a lot and with going to Disney World</li>
            <li>and then the week I was there and did not see a significant decrease in sweat.  </li>
            <li>So it has a good solid 8-10 hours to set in.</li>

            <li>I did experience a burning sensation on my underarms right after I applied it, but it went away after about 15-20 minutes.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll use this product up (4 weeks left to go) then try the next brand, but I think this works great.</li>
            <li>The main instructions are to shave the area of any hair, clean the intended area, and apply the product at night when the sweat gland are&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is truly is first product</li>
            <li>Did exactly as it says delivered quickly&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>It also makes me itch for the first couple of hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to use it 2 times the first week</li>
            <li>There is a funny smell...like peppercorns</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny if you have issues with too much sweat.  </li>
            <li>am in a hot car or out in the heat all day,</li>
            <li>This was the first product I purchased and</li>
            <li>first application lasted 3 days.</li>
            <li>Will buy more of this in the future</li>

            <li>I mean it&#x27;s too good to be true</li>
            <li>Though sweating isn&#x27;t fun for anyone, it is even more embarrassing being a women and having wet stains in the armpits of your shirt.</li>
            <li>Instead of sweat pouring out of my armpits and ruining everything this week, after I followed another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to blot on the stuff at night and SAVE the wipe to use two more times (save in a sealed plastic baggie), I&#x27;ve been dry for 6 days straight.</li>
            <li>No joke, this stuff is a straight up miracle</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>

            <li>These work really, really well.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed when I used it for the first time (last week) getting through an entire day without sweating and with a dry shirt is amazing!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even put on normal deodorant today.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, so just a quick bit of info... I don&#x27;t generally sweat a lot all over, but I definitely sweat under my arms a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I can finally wear light colored shirts without fear of having huge sweat stains under my arms in a few hours of wearing them!</li>

            <li>It got to the point where I would completely sweat through my shirt 2 hours into my work day.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first about each one lasting a week, but it absolutely does, maybe more.  </li>
            <li>I remembered to check and my armpits felt warm like usual and I was fully expecting wet spots on my t-shirt underarms...</li>
            <li>The only thing is I live in Tulsa where it&#x27;s been pretty hot lately</li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t advise shaving and then directly applying the stuff...</li>

            <li>I was surprised that one sheet actually does last a week.</li>

            <li> I feel there and it is COMPLETELY DRY.</li>
            <li> and I have literally tried every single deodorant there is out there</li>
            <li> I decided that I have nothing to loose so tried it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d let it dry!</li>
            <li> and I know this review sounds a bit odd with me going into graphic detail about my sweating</li>
            <li> it will get your armpit wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a &amp;#34;reviewer&amp;#34; when I buy things online</li>
            <li> I was half through the day before I realized that I was completely dry in my underarms.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of antiperspirants</li>
            <li> I am an extreme sweater and have been for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds looking for a solution,  it works!  </li>
            <li> I know you are not suppose to use them anywhere other than your underarms but based on other reviews</li>
            <li> I saw a small decrease in sweat on my back, shoulders, chest, and forehead</li>
            <li> Works as well as the other towelette style for less $.</li>
            <li> The burning/itching when first applied is a little uncomfortable....</li>
            <li> I just wish I could find something equally effective and less painful!</li>
            <li> /&gt; less active.  </li>
            <li> which was my biggest concern)&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is not bad at all...not overpowering or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I typically keep my arms close to my body out of habit, and</li>
            <li> did some activities that typically leave my underarms DRENCHED in sweat...</li>
            <li> however there was no difference in sweat from my typical over the counter antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Works, &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; made me break out and for the few in the pack, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not even a little damp.</li>
            <li> just a little.</li>
            <li> And yesterday and today it was 100 degrees, with just a little sweat showing.</li>
            <li> I rubbed a little,  not a drop, I will be buying this until it stops.  </li>
            <li> so sometimes I may stink a little at the end of the day, so</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I was very skeptical about trying this product because I 100% did not think that it could work on me.  </li>
            <li> but all of them were a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Can have a slight irritation first day after application for me but not as bad as the roll-on types.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now as for the negative issues other people experienced:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> then if it&#x27;s hot and also if I&#x27;m a bit anxious or nervous, it is impossible to control my sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but she has a pretty bad case of hyperhydrosis.</li>
            <li> I sweat profusely and the Antiperspirant Wipes controls my excessive underarm sweat.</li>
            <li> Hardly had to put on any of my deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I have not had to apply deodorant for 3 days now and have not experienced any of the embarrassing sweat stains that I usually have.</li>
            <li> I used it night before a tough day which included conferences and meetings, and would normally mean that I would sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> but walking around with a soaked shirt is worse and the burn/itch goes away within and hour or</li>
            <li> in a weird, tingly way.</li>
            <li> The smell, really not that terrible.</li>
            <li> and I was even going to get desperate and use those sticky pads you stick inside shirts....</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone who suffers from sweaty armpits to try it.</li>
            <li> From the start these wipes prevent me from pitting out all day, even in the gym when I&#x27;m sweating everywhere else like crazy.</li>
            <li> like so bad I need to change my shirt.</li>
            <li> I sweat really bad and nothing has worked for me yet.  </li>
            <li> so I am giving it a 2 because I don&#x27;t necessarily hate it</li>

            <li> When I was reading happy reviews on Amazon about this product, I was thinking that it probably won&#x27;t work same way with me, since I have a bigger problem than most of the people. I used it night before a tough day which included conferences and meetings, and would normally mean that I would sweat a lot. I was half through the day before I realized that I was completely dry in my underarms. When I got home my clothing was spotless! This is truly is first product that&#x27;s really delivers its promise in terms of stopping excessive sweating! Silk shirts, here I come!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. I use it on my forehead, neck and armpits. It has kept me sweat free for a week. I am so thankful I found something that actually works! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Works as well as the other towelette style for less $. Can have a slight irritation first day after application for me but not as bad as the roll-on types.</li>
            <li> Great product recomended</li>
            <li> It burns when you place it on your skin but it does the job&lt;br /&gt;Beauty hurts....</li>
            <li> Works, &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; made me break out and for the few in the pack, not worth it. Also, get it on anything and touch your face or mouth, eeew. Just use deodorant and the instructions say DO NOT USE on scalp or face.</li>
            <li> These things WORK. I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of antiperspirants and I was even going to get desperate and use those sticky pads you stick inside shirts.... but man what a hassle that would be. Every time I put a shirt on I have to peel off and stick on pads? Plus what if they slip out while wearing them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so just a quick bit of info... I don&#x27;t generally sweat a lot all over, but I definitely sweat under my arms a whole lot. I typically keep my arms close to my body out of habit, and then if it&#x27;s hot and also if I&#x27;m a bit anxious or nervous, it is impossible to control my sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is like magic. I applied it yesterday night and let it sit for about 15 minutes to air dry and then I went to sleep. The next day I did my normal activities and stuff which usually results in my sweating under the arms a lot. Halfway through the day my armpit area is usually totally soaked with sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I remembered to check and my armpits felt warm like usual and I was fully expecting wet spots on my t-shirt underarms... I feel there and it is COMPLETELY DRY. Not even a little damp. Like 100% dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some activities that typically leave my underarms DRENCHED in sweat... like so bad I need to change my shirt. I checked again. NOTHING. No wetness whatsoever! I didn&#x27;t even put on normal deodorant today. There was ZERO odor! I &amp;#34;sweat&amp;#34; in this shirt all day and all I smell is the clothing detergent fragrance! No joke, this stuff is a straight up miracle and I know this review sounds a bit odd with me going into graphic detail about my sweating but I am just in awe of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see how long it can last for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now as for the negative issues other people experienced:&lt;br /&gt;- The smell, really not that terrible. It went away by the time I woke up in the morning also&lt;br /&gt;- It was a bit itchy for me... just a little. But not unbearable. I can see how the product could burn/sting your skin if you shaved it recently though, so my tip would be to wait to apply it until a day or two after shaving an area. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t advise shaving and then directly applying the stuff... yeah that probably burns quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, these things are a lifesaver. I can finally wear light colored shirts without fear of having huge sweat stains under my arms in a few hours of wearing them! Honestly I&#x27;m kind of intrigued how these things work and I&#x27;ll have to do more research on them because it&#x27;s almost too good to be true. I told my girlfriend about them and she says &amp;#34;sounds like it causes cancer&amp;#34;. Which... yeah, I mean it&#x27;s too good to be true right? Haha. Anyway, I 100% recommend this. To anyone saying it&#x27;s not working... I have to wonder if they properly applied it. You definitely should scrub the area you are applying it with soap and water first. Dry it COMPLETELY. Then liberally wipe the area with the pad. THEN let it dry out nice. Don&#x27;t just immediately jump into doing stuff that will make you sweat. This is the reason you apply it before bed. So it has a good solid 8-10 hours to set in. Think of it like paint drying. You wouldn&#x27;t go take a hose to a wall you just painted. You&#x27;d let it dry!oduct could burn/sting your skin if you shaved it recently though, so my tip would be to wait to apply it until a day or two after shaving an area.

            <li> It works! I bought 3 different kinds of sweat block, and this is the first I tried. Instead of sweat pouring out of my armpits and ruining everything this week, after I followed another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to blot on the stuff at night and SAVE the wipe to use two more times (save in a sealed plastic baggie), I&#x27;ve been dry for 6 days straight. Yay! And yesterday and today it was 100 degrees, with just a little sweat showing. I&#x27;ll use this product up (4 weeks left to go) then try the next brand, but I think this works great.</li>
            <li> just apply once, dont over do it it will get your armpit wet.  It last like a week.  good product</li>
            <li> Did exactly as it says delivered quickly&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply no smell perfect for hyperhidrosis treatment&lt;br /&gt;Great price definitely recommend</li>
            <li> It does work. Like others have said, it has a clove-like smell to it, that seems to dissapear after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to dab it on, don&#x27;t rub it in, YOU WILL REGRET IT! If you apply too much, it hurts...in a weird, tingly way. It also makes me itch for the first couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it does what it says. I just wish I could find something equally effective and less painful!</li>
            <li> This did not work well at all for me. I&#x27;m going back to sweat blocker.</li>
            <li> I would like to write a review for this product,  First off let me say that I was very skeptical about trying this product because I 100% did not think that it could work on me.  I am an extreme sweater and have been for years.  I sweat really bad and nothing has worked for me yet.  I decided that I have nothing to loose so tried it. I read all the other reviews before I purchased to ensure that I would be following all the directions properly.  The main instructions are to shave the area of any hair, clean the intended area, and apply the product at night when the sweat gland are&lt;br /&gt; less active.  The product worked great for me I can actually go a couple of days of one use and have no skin irritation, great product.</li>
            <li> I have hyper hydrosis and It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. They smelled really nice but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Product works as described. Is not a cure for the problem but it dramatically reduces perspiration for several days. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I had to use it 2 times the first week but only once a week after that. The pads have enough moisture to use them twice. There is a funny smell...like peppercorns but I&#x27;d rather smell like spices than have sweaty pits.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Great product to arrest unwanted perspiration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tossing these in my travel bag</li>
            <li> My daughter said these don&#x27;t work but she has a pretty bad case of hyperhydrosis.</li>
            <li> This has been the only thing that has controlled my sweating! I sweat a lot from my underarm and I have literally tried every single deodorant there is out there but all of them were a waste of money. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds looking for a solution,  it works!  More confidence, I used to sweat like a pig, at first didn&#x27;t work but I tapped it on, I rubbed a little,  not a drop, I will be buying this until it stops.  Very very impressed!</li>
            <li> I sweat profusely and the Antiperspirant Wipes controls my excessive underarm sweat. Almost to the point where I don&#x27;t need to use deodorant. The only con I can think of is it lasts closer to 3 or 4 days as opposed to the 5 to 7 range. I would recommend anyone who suffers from sweaty armpits to try it.</li>
            <li> This product works as described.  I did experience a burning sensation on my underarms right after I applied it, but it went away after about 15-20 minutes. I have very sensitive/dry skin which may have contributed to that.  I have not had to apply deodorant for 3 days now and have not experienced any of the embarrassing sweat stains that I usually have. I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Finally something that actually work... Hope the summer works out</li>
            <li> it did not work aswell as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> I was excited to use it as I sweat a lot and with going to Disney World I knew my sweat glands would be working OT.  I used them on my under arms, my back, chest, shoulders, and head.  I know you are not suppose to use them anywhere other than your underarms but based on other reviews I thought I&#x27;d try it.  There was a strange tingling, sensitive sensation on my forehead and back when applied there.  I applied it the week leading up and then the week I was there and did not see a significant decrease in sweat.  Not any different than applying spray anti-antiperspirant in these same areas.  No tingling in my underarms however there was no difference in sweat from my typical over the counter antiperspirant.  I saw a small decrease in sweat on my back, shoulders, chest, and forehead so I am giving it a 2 because I don&#x27;t necessarily hate it but I would not purchase it again.  .</li>
            <li> I buy these for my daughter and she says they work really well. Good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a &amp;#34;reviewer&amp;#34; when I buy things online but this product warrants it. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that has actually worked completely. I&#x27;ve tried different store antiperspirants,  even clinical, using them at night or twice a day. I always pit out. From the start these wipes prevent me from pitting out all day, even in the gym when I&#x27;m sweating everywhere else like crazy. Worth every penny if you have issues with too much sweat.  I was skeptical at first about each one lasting a week, but it absolutely does, maybe more.  The only thing is I live in Tulsa where it&#x27;s been pretty hot lately and I work in outside sales so am in a hot car or out in the heat all day, so sometimes I may stink a little at the end of the day, so I use a small amount of deodorant after say day 2 or 3 of using a new wipe for a couple days. I have no issues with irritation or anything. I don&#x27;t get too excited about online purchases too much but tj is was a great find and has had a very positive impact on my comfort level now not having to worry about my sweat showing.  :)</li>
            <li> I have been a severe armpit sweater for over a year now. It got to the point where I would completely sweat through my shirt 2 hours into my work day. Though sweating isn&#x27;t fun for anyone, it is even more embarrassing being a women and having wet stains in the armpits of your shirt. I would actually put tissue in my armpits during the day to prevent the sweat marks. I didn&#x27;t feel like I really had any options.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I started searching for a product to try....even if it didn&#x27;t work I could mark it off of the list and try again. This was the first product I purchased and will definitely be the last. I was absolutely amazed when I used it for the first time (last week) getting through an entire day without sweating and with a dry shirt is amazing! I literally did not sweat at all (in the armpit area-which was my biggest concern)&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is not bad at all...not overpowering or unpleasant. The burning/itching when first applied is a little uncomfortable....but walking around with a soaked shirt is worse and the burn/itch goes away within and hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;My first application lasted 3 days. I applied the product again on the third day and am on my 6th day sweat free!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who profusely sweats and haven&#x27;t found a remedy. You will definitely regain your self confidence.</li>
            <li> These work really, really well. I was surprised that one sheet actually does last a week. Hardly had to put on any of my deodorant.  Will buy more of this in the future</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter and after following the directions to a t did not help very much. so I won&#x27;t get them again</li>
            <li> excellent sweat control it woks for me</li>
            <li> Very good product. Works well!</li>
