    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for the five o&#x27;clock touch up</li>
            <li>Some of my best hair days now are 2-3 days after I wash it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I will never be without!</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant as well!</li>
            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>Its best to put it on a beauty puff and apply to the head.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very pleasant, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>but it works great now.</li>
            <li>This is great for travel when you want to skip washing your hair.</li>
            <li>Soaks up the oil, volumizes a bit, and smells great.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find anything great about this product</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my stylist and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it absorbs the extra oil but also gives hair nice volume and body, best described as \\&quot;grab.\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s superb for absorbing oil and the lift in volume and style are remarkable.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical!</li>
            <li>I love the Bumble and Bumble products and this one is no exception!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Wish it had a nice scent.</li>
            <li>After using the spray, I really liked it...until I read the ingredients.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and blends in easily after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite one, it smells great and really makes my hair look great.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product works but it has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>I love this one, and feel better about using something with NO propane!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all- just a very light, pleasant fragrance to make your hair smell clean.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great quality.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I do not like many of the bumble and bumble products</li>
            <li>and this is more of a dusting.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>They were all ok</li>
            <li>If you have allergies, you will not be able to use it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo ever</li>
            <li>Thank you, B &amp; B!ly allowed me to have better hair habits and enjoy my hair every day after I wash it.</li>
            <li>It has fragrance that I would describe as pleasant, a spicy floral, rather high end.</li>
            <li>This product is hands down the best dry shampoo ever PLUS the best hair product over all I have used.</li>
            <li>I even use it on clean hair, just because I love the volume and the way it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and lovely.</li>
            <li>have dry-ish hair, fair to medium-thin hair with light breakage near my forehead hairline.</li>
            <li>I am going to try using a blush brush to apply it lightly for those days when I forget to do it the night before.</li>
            <li>I recommend purchasing through Sephora, $26 and add it to something else you can get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes my hair feel clean without having to wash it.</li>
            <li>I prefer this much, much more as I do think it does a better job of absorbing excess oil around my roots.  </li>
            <li>I now tend to get more compliments those days than the first day I shampoo my hair.  </li>
            <li>It works great as a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The price is a worthwhile investment for such amazing hair.</li>
            <li>Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Pret-A-Powder has really allowed me to have better hair habits and enjoy my hair every day after I wash it.</li>
            <li>Good overall.</li>
            <li>However, this is by far the BEST dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s pricey, this dry shampoo is worth it because it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>I love how great it makes my hair look the second or third day after my shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo has a nice texture and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth noticing that it is perfumed, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering like some hair products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>For me it wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>First of all, know that this is so much more than a single product; you truly receive three benefits in one bottle, which more than makes up for the price.</li>
            <li>Some of them you have to squeeze and you get a ton right in one area</li>
            <li>Works ok, but kind of hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>My first experience with dry shampoo was with a spray kind that comes in a can.  </li>
            <li>I have used SEVERAL dry shampoos, and this one is by far, the best!</li>
            <li>I used to only be able to skip 1 shampoo, max.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo every, and just this little bit has lasted me months</li>
            <li>Works great as dry shampoo and also gives my hair extra volume and texture.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t benefit me to shampoo my hair every day.  </li>
            <li>Very absorbent.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps to absorb the excess oil and also give your hair some volume.</li>
            <li>very well substitute w/baby powder and corn starch</li>
            <li>Yes, 2oz doesn&#x27;t seem like much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any issues with it not blending well unless i put waaaay too much in.</li>
            <li>Even so, didn&#x27;t think it made that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but far better than any dry shampoo I&#x27;ve yet tried.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a dry shampoo and had a free sample of a spray, which my niece swears by.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that you shake it from a tiny hole on top.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is that since you sprinkle it on instead of a spray it&#x27;s pretty messy and gets on your clothes so it&#x27;s best to apply before dressing.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple dry shampoos: Batiste Dry Shampoo, Sexy Hair Big Sexy Hair</li>
            <li>My hair naturally looks healthier and feels more full after following this new hair regime for the past two months.</li>
            <li>I love that I can get an extra day or two out of my faux(using a waver)beach curls without having to wash my hair, blow dry and restyle day after day!</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this product enough and I have tried so many other products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Pret-A-Powder is pricier than most dry shampoos, it is well worth it when I can save money in the long run from not having to wash/condition my hair every other day like I used to.</li>
            <li>but there was always something that I didn&#x27;t like, whether it had alcohol in it; gave my hair a dry, unnaturally thick texture and then was hard to wash out; left a good texture but didn&#x27;t work well-enough as a dry shampoo; took two shampoos to get the colored powder to completely wash out; or, smelled good but didn&#x27;t work very well either.</li>
            <li>If I use B&amp;B&#x27;s Pret-A-Powder daily starting from about the day after I wash my hair, this post-wash silky, fine texture is gradually replaced with a light, natural feeling volume and texture boost that doesn&#x27;t dull any of my natural shine or weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am someone who has a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>For those who are sensitive to scents</li>
            <li>As a busy mom, I need to not be washing and blow drying every day.</li>
            <li>It is light and gives just enough lift for a second and third day hair style.</li>
            <li>It has a soft, delicate smell and it leaves my hair feeling fresh and manageable while giving it just the right amount of body.</li>
            <li>(thanks to this powder), but normally I use it on dry hair for volume.</li>
            <li>and it helps add a little bit of hold to clean hair and body to slept-in hair.</li>
            <li>It really revives flat, greasy hair.</li>
            <li>However, a little bit of product goes a very long way on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and my only wish is that it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, especially when I&#x27;m pressed for time or being lazy and don&#x27;t want to blow dry my hair or re-flat</li>
            <li>Bumble&#x27;s dry shampoo washes completely out, leaving my hair feeling silky soft again.</li>
            <li>have brunette hair and put this right along my roots and let it sit for a few minutes to absorb the oils.</li>
            <li>(and I use it pretty much everyday)</li>
            <li>Although the bottle is small, after I used it I realize it will last a good long time, since the amount needed to do the trick is very small.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, the bottle is small but it definitely goes a long way!</li>

            <li> As long as you&#x27;re controlled in how you sprinkle this on and take the time to work it in, it works fabulously and doesn&#x27;t have to leave a white color behind.  </li>
            <li> do, which I was looking for in a product like this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, straight hair</li>
            <li> I had to make the hole a little larger with a needle for the powder to come out properly</li>
            <li> the rest of my hair is on the dry side</li>
            <li> Volumizing Dry Shampoo, Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo, Schwarzkopf Osis</li>
            <li> I was about to give up hope on dry shampoos, until I found Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Pret-A-Powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add all the texture like some dry shampoos</li>
            <li> I have fine-ish, dry hair and this stuff makes it greasy.  </li>
            <li> With this stuff I can sometimes skip 2 without looking like a hot mess (unless I worked out really hard or did something else that made my hair or style be gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is dark, and this does not leave a white residue after.</li>
            <li> Spray dry shampoos have propane in them!</li>
            <li> When you get up in the morning you will notice less white in your hair, but it will still be present.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was recommended by my stylist and loved it.  It smells good and easy to use.  I am someone who has a sensitive scalp so I was a little hesitant to use.  It did not give me problems.  I will use this one day out of the week and it seems to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> My first experience with dry shampoo was with a spray kind that comes in a can.  I prefer this much, much more as I do think it does a better job of absorbing excess oil around my roots.  For me this is key because while I do seem to get some oil buildup there the rest of my hair is on the dry side so it really doesn&#x27;t benefit me to shampoo my hair every day.  As long as you&#x27;re controlled in how you sprinkle this on and take the time to work it in, it works fabulously and doesn&#x27;t have to leave a white color behind.  I love how great it makes my hair look the second or third day after my shampoo.  I now tend to get more compliments those days than the first day I shampoo my hair.  For those who are sensitive to scents it&#x27;s worth noticing that it is perfumed, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering like some hair products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever</li>
            <li> Perfect for the five o&#x27;clock touch up</li>
            <li> I use it after my workouts and in the morning after 2nd day hair. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Very absorbent. Good overall.</li>
            <li> Works and adds volume</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has a nice texture and is easy to use. It freshens up my hair and adds a little volume. I had to make the hole a little larger with a needle for the powder to come out properly but it works great now.</li>
            <li> When I recieved this in the mail I was shocked to see how tiny the bottle was. However, a little bit of product goes a very long way on my fine hair. As a busy mom, I need to not be washing and blow drying every day. It has fragrance that I would describe as pleasant, a spicy floral, rather high end. My hair is dark but it does not leave it looking white or too dusty. The best part is that it absorbs the extra oil but also gives hair nice volume and body, best described as \\&quot;grab.\\&quot; I catch myself using it to keep updos in place and a ponytail will stay put all day with this stuff. Works extremely well, just very expensive for the amount received!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on 1/11/15:&lt;br /&gt;I think this product truly excels under the following conditions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply the night before to all the necessary areas. Work it in with your fingertips like you are shampooing. Don&#x27;t brush.&lt;br /&gt;2. Sleep on it. When you get up in the morning you will notice less white in your hair, but it will still be present.&lt;br /&gt;3. Using the densest boar bristle brush that will work for your hair, brush vigorously, section by section, starting at the scalp. Continue brushing till all the white is gone. Turn your head upside down and brush too.&lt;br /&gt;4. Flip your hair back and run your fingers through it. 5 minute supermodel hair voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thought: I think some times the over-application issue is due to the design of the bottle. I discovered at the end of the product you can pry the \\&quot;plug\\&quot; with the hole in it out to get to the last bit. I am going to try using a blush brush to apply it lightly for those days when I forget to do it the night before.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing through Sephora, $26 and add it to something else you can get free shipping. I&#x27;ve always got something to buy through Sephora.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I do not like many of the bumble and bumble products and I think they are over priced! However, this is by far the BEST dry shampoo I have ever used. It is light and gives just enough lift for a second and third day hair style. It has a soft, delicate smell and it leaves my hair feeling fresh and manageable while giving it just the right amount of body. I highly recommend this product and my only wish is that it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical! It really revives flat, greasy hair. It&#x27;s pricey, but far better than any dry shampoo I&#x27;ve yet tried.</li>
            <li> One of the worst dry shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried. Like baby powder. Gives no volume and leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li> It works great as a dry shampoo.  I especially like that you shake it from a tiny hole on top.  Some of them you have to squeeze and you get a ton right in one area and this is more of a dusting.  I do have to comb it out with a boar&#x27;s hair brush to get it all worked in.  I don&#x27;t however, notice a big difference in volume which it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works great as dry shampoo and also gives my hair extra volume and texture. Expensive and comes in a little bottle, but I find that you don&#x27;t need that much to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I have used SEVERAL dry shampoos, and this one is by far, the best! I was a little shocked at first at how small the bottle was when I received it, but a little does go a long way. So I do anticipate it lasting for a little while. I am a mother of 3 little ones and I don&#x27;t have time to wash and blow out my hair daily. This stuff really helps to absorb the excess oil and also give your hair some volume. Some of my best hair days now are 2-3 days after I wash it. The fragrance is very pleasant, not overpowering at all. My hair is dark, and this does not leave a white residue after. It quickly absorbs. Great stuff, I will never be without!</li>
            <li> Works ok, but kind of hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is great for travel when you want to skip washing your hair. Although the bottle is small, after I used it I realize it will last a good long time, since the amount needed to do the trick is very small. I use a travel-size kabuki makeup brush to apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Mom of 5 so I have 5 mins tops to do my hair. I love that I can get an extra day or two out of my faux(using a waver)beach curls without having to wash my hair, blow dry and restyle day after day! It&#x27;s true, the bottle is small but it definitely goes a long way! The scent is very pleasant as well! I don&#x27;t know how I got along before without it! Actually, I remember now...I spent endless hours(that I didn&#x27;t have)on my hair. Ugh, who has time for that?!</li>
            <li> Soaks up the oil, volumizes a bit, and smells great. I can go 3 days without washing my hair and still get compliments on it (thanks to this powder), but normally I use it on dry hair for volume.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes my hair feel clean without having to wash it.</li>
            <li> Small container for price. Wish it had a nice scent.</li>
            <li> First of all, know that this is so much more than a single product; you truly receive three benefits in one bottle, which more than makes up for the price. This product is hands down the best dry shampoo ever PLUS the best hair product over all I have used. It&#x27;s superb for absorbing oil and the lift in volume and style are remarkable. Nothing else extends my blowouts like this one. In fact, since using this I need fewer hair washes and overall styling which has translated to healthier and longer hair for me. The scent is mild and lovely. I cannot recommend this product enough and I have tried so many other products.  I recommend this to everyone I know. The price is a worthwhile investment for such amazing hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple dry shampoos: Batiste Dry Shampoo, Sexy Hair Big Sexy Hair Volumizing Dry Shampoo, Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo, Schwarzkopf Osis Refresh Dust Bodifying Dry Shampoo, Keratin Complex Volumizing Dry Shampoo Lift Powder Brunettes, and Lulu Organics Hair Powder Jasmine Scented. They were all ok but there was always something that I didn&#x27;t like, whether it had alcohol in it; gave my hair a dry, unnaturally thick texture and then was hard to wash out; left a good texture but didn&#x27;t work well-enough as a dry shampoo; took two shampoos to get the colored powder to completely wash out; or, smelled good but didn&#x27;t work very well either. I was about to give up hope on dry shampoos, until I found Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Pret-A-Powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry-ish hair, fair to medium-thin hair with light breakage near my forehead hairline. Washing my hair has been something that I&#x27;ve needed to start to cut down on to prolong my color and prevent breakage. With Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Pret-A-Powder I only need to wash my hair every 6-7 days now. I&#x27;ve found that some other dry shampoos take one or two washings to get the product 100% out, but Bumble&#x27;s dry shampoo washes completely out, leaving my hair feeling silky soft again. If I use B&amp;B&#x27;s Pret-A-Powder daily starting from about the day after I wash my hair, this post-wash silky, fine texture is gradually replaced with a light, natural feeling volume and texture boost that doesn&#x27;t dull any of my natural shine or weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Pret-A-Powder is pricier than most dry shampoos, it is well worth it when I can save money in the long run from not having to wash/condition my hair every other day like I used to. With the help of this product, I&#x27;ve cut down from washing my hair approximately 15 times per month to 5 per month. My hair naturally looks healthier and feels more full after following this new hair regime for the past two months. Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Pret-A-Powder has really allowed me to have better hair habits and enjoy my hair every day after I wash it. There isn&#x27;t a day that goes by that it feels funky, heavy or oily. Thank you, B &amp; B!ly allowed me to have better hair habits and enjoy my hair every day after I wash it. There isn&#x27;t a day that goes by that it feels funky, heavy or oily. Thank you, B &amp; B!</li>
            <li> This product works but it has a very strong smell. If you have allergies, you will not be able to use it.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be could very well substitute w/baby powder and corn starch</li>
            <li> Great!  Just what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> stretches the time between shampoos!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a dry shampoo and had a free sample of a spray, which my niece swears by.  After using the spray, I really liked it...until I read the ingredients. Spray dry shampoos have propane in them! No way. I told my daughter, and she said she used the Bumble and Bumble, not a spray. I love this one, and feel better about using something with NO propane!</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo! It is my favorite one, it smells great and really makes my hair look great.  It doesn&#x27;t add all the texture like some dry shampoos do, which I was looking for in a product like this for a long time.  It is expensive but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s pricey, this dry shampoo is worth it because it&#x27;s very effective. Plus a little goes a long way. Definitely saves my next day hair when I skip a shower. It has a pleasant smell and blends in easily after it&#x27;s applied. The only negative is that since you sprinkle it on instead of a spray it&#x27;s pretty messy and gets on your clothes so it&#x27;s best to apply before dressing. I always put it on in my pjs so I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting all it off</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, especially when I&#x27;m pressed for time or being lazy and don&#x27;t want to blow dry my hair or re-flat iron it. I don&#x27;t find the smell overpowering at all- just a very light, pleasant fragrance to make your hair smell clean. Yes, 2oz doesn&#x27;t seem like much but I use this stuff 3-4 times a week and have been for the last couple of months and it hardly looks like a put a dent in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have brunette hair and put this right along my roots and let it sit for a few minutes to absorb the oils. Then I blend it in with my fingers by using them sort of like a brush to blend it in. I don&#x27;t have any issues with it not blending well unless i put waaaay too much in. I can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday or else it dries out. I used to only be able to skip 1 shampoo, max. With this stuff I can sometimes skip 2 without looking like a hot mess (unless I worked out really hard or did something else that made my hair or style be gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is the little hole got plugged up after a couple weeks so hardly any product came out. I poked it with a safety pin to open it up a little which seemed to work.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find anything great about this product</li>
            <li> I love the Bumble and Bumble products and this one is no exception!</li>
            <li> I have fine-ish, dry hair and this stuff makes it greasy.  I would not recommend this product, especially not at this price point.</li>
            <li> The shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair feel less dirty, although it definitely looked a bit fresher.  I have thick hair so the volumizing effect was less noticeable than it is for my friends with thinner hair who also use this product.  For me it wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have thick, straight hair and it helps add a little bit of hold to clean hair and body to slept-in hair. This would not be a replacement for mousse or another body-providing hair product in my mind, though. I haven&#x27;t played around with it other than these two uses like the bottle instructions encourage. I&#x27;ll update my review if I do!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the tiny hole dispenser. Its best to put it on a beauty puff and apply to the head.  Even so, didn&#x27;t think it made that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Love it. Best dry shampoo every, and just this little bit has lasted me months (and I use it pretty much everyday) I even use it on clean hair, just because I love the volume and the way it makes my hair look.</li>
