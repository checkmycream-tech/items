            <li>works beautifully as a flea shampoo!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great and promptly refunded my money, but I would never order anything again from Livamed</li>
            <li>As some others have said, it&#x27;s a transition to shampoo that isn&#x27;t aplenty in your hands, but it does a great cleaning job.</li>
            <li>, it smells great</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell  great</li>

            <li>This shampoo works great for me.</li>

            <li>This is a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I see a great difference.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo and has greatly reduced by itching and flaking.</li>
            <li>As I posted in my review of the Theraneem Conditioner, They are both great products.  </li>

            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling nice!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny, healthy, and manageable (the best part).</li>
            <li>The neem is great for your scalp and this shampoo feels good on your scalp when you shampoo.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it has a rather pleasant smell that hints of mint.</li>
            <li>The smell of it isn&#x27;t so good though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is too soon to notice any good benefits.</li>
            <li>Good product I like the way my hair feels when I use it.  </li>
            <li>One bottle lasts a good while too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We&#x27;ll find a good one someday</li>
            <li>If you want a shampoo that makes your hair smells good; this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>It seems good.</li>
            <li>This shampoo fit the bill perfectly .</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li>but i can tell this shampoo does have alot beneficial vitanins for the scalp and hair....not a good substitute for nizoral at all</li>
            <li>I loved the shampoo</li>
            <li>Probably good for scalp but HORRID on hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job at a good price so still a 4/5 product in my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>great shampoos, cleans and keeps scalp healthy</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll quit looking and stick with a sure thing!</li>

            <li>Shampoo has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Nice smell--</li>
            <li>but it is nice.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, smells good and leaves my hair looking healthy.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>

            <li>this shampoo really did a great job!!!!</li>
            <li>Like the smell and makes hair nice</li>
            <li>i started using it when it was warm out</li>
            <li>Neem Oil not the kind for insect protection read the ones on how the Neem oil works in soaps &amp; salve.  </li>
            <li>Using a sparing amount, get a good lather and enjoy!</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell and a lot</li>
            <li>I would like my hair to be shinier  after using it and that is a dissapointment although the texture is nice.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo because I use a TheraNeem product on my face which is the best non steroid treatment I&#x27;ve ever found for eczema.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the healthy look of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have many chemical sensitivities, and most products bother me, but not this one!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results after searching for a solution for so many years.  </li>
            <li>so far, this is the best one I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>Love that shampoo amazing</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is a nice shampoo and leaves hair feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of this shampoo, it smells great and my hair and scalp feel great too</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re very cheap.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is also very light.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a cruelty-free product, and I look forward to using it more often.</li>
            <li>give it 2 weeks and your scalp will feel better.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>AND my hair is softer, more mangeable than ever.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I should have ordered more.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I waited for about 6 weeks before posting this review, to make sure it was not just another fluke.</li>
            <li>I use it twice though, each wash and dilute it with water, which gets it into my scalp much better.</li>
            <li>so I got more after.</li>
            <li>My husband has always had itchy, difficult-to-control dandruff and could never go more than a day or 2 without medicated shampoo.  </li>
            <li>We are buying more.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Have used this for years, love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>but I feel like this shampoo is what has helped the most.</li>
            <li>but the conditioner smells magical</li>
            <li>(I love coconut scents).</li>
            <li>more than once a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair, too.</li>
            <li>and my patches got more aggressive.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li>Well, I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>but it sure helps.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my seborrheic dermatitis feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>Safe to use on colored hair.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy course hair and need more oil in it.</li>
            <li>In fact, my scalp itched more than ever because this stuff dries out the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I wish it lathered more</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it does what it says .i know the effect of neem</li>
            <li>The product was okay.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, okay.  </li>
            <li>This soap handles many problems associated with aging which is a bacterial problem.  </li>
            <li>Most folks do not understand that you must detox your bod as you</li>
            <li>I have yet to have any complaints because she seem to be doing better, combining this product with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The more I was using the shampoo the more</li>
            <li>I got lots more dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost out of this shampoo and plan to order more.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed washing my hair</li>
            <li>I went to the Dermatologist who put me on a foam antibiotic for the clogged follicles most people get some time or another.  </li>
            <li>I feel that I have the most &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair and scalp after using this product that I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something more naturals.</li>
            <li>Although it is not listed in the ingredients, I suspect that some kind of citrus oil is used for the natural fragrance - it does have a pleasant grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li>Even for the first use, I already feel so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>It works great and really leaves your hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, makes my hair feel light and clean and am glad that it is safe for sensitive individuals :)</li>
            <li>She said it washed out easy and helped untangle her hair.</li>
            <li>its too strong</li>
            <li>The Neem shampoo and conditioner solved all that, and I can easily comb it out now with a fine tooth comb after showering.  </li>
            <li>It smelled nice and crisp.</li>
            <li>My hair seems fine without any conditioner, just this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This TheraNeem shampoo is ideal for people that suffer from dry scalps.</li>
            <li>i have mild problems with itchy scalp and sometimes flaking and sometimes the national brands make my head itch more, but this doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>After just one use I noticed a huge improvement in my scalp.</li>
            <li>and after luckily im a huge believer in conditioners.....</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews of others who bought it, until I was satisfied that it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone, but suggest that you read as much as you can on what others shared about their own experiences with TheraNeem, to determine if it might be helpful for you.  </li>
            <li>When using this shampoo, within the second use, I will see a great reduction in the itching and sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A nice gentle cleansing shampoo</li>
            <li>but I still don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this</li>
            <li>Redmond Clay is also a fantastic product NOT TO BE WITHOUT.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus scent - I don&#x27;t really enjoy its smell</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Awesome, can&#x27;t say enough, really works</li>
            <li>Good for my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Your hair feels light and clean.</li>
            <li>My new favorite shampoo!  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and feels very natural and light.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used that actually makes a huge difference</li>
            <li>I read that Neem (azadirachta Indica) is an unique herb from India that acts as an anti bacterial, anti parasitic, anti fungal, anti protozoal and anti viral.</li>
            <li>I also have really long hair that requires a great deal of care.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>You will find itching is significantly reduced when these products products are used.</li>
            <li>so Im going to call it a success!</li>
            <li>Gets hair really clean.</li>
            <li>I like the clean feel of my hair and the gentleness of the shampoo for my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have started to make a positive effort moving toward \\&quot;greener\\&quot; and more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; solutions to products and foods.  </li>
            <li>Probably I&#x27;d give that to her because just because if it isn&#x27;t good for me that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t good for her</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special about my hair/scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer than usual and remarkably my psoriasis has greatly improved (it has not cleared completely, but close).</li>
            <li>Good shampoo for dog flees or human lice.  </li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes a nice lather and rinses out completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scalp itch was the problem that concerned me most, so after reading the reviews, and using the product myself, I can say that those reviews were very helpful to me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it at Whole Foods anymore, so I am glad Amazon is still carrying</li>
            <li>; so I can&#x27;t give full credit to this shampoo</li>
            <li>It works, its doesnt have a sickly sweet odor, it helps with the itchy feel from sweat, dirt and plant grime.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, majority organic and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It was good enough for me that it is organic with no chemicals.</li>
            <li>My hair is super clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>I have used many Shampoos that cost half the amount and they are twice a good.</li>
            <li>it looses completely the moisture despite I&#x27;d used those products hours prior to wash my hair, and using a very good conditioner</li>
            <li>My scalp is no longer itchy, I no longer notice any dandruff, and my hair is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The scent is a mild lemon-grapefruit cleaner smell that doesn&#x27;t last/stick to hair after you wash it out.   </li>
            <li>I was almmost bold.</li>
            <li>Hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>I really have no complaints about the smell what so ever and was surprised at how good this shampoo was at foaming considering it is without sulfates.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft, and my scalp has never felt more clean and flake-free.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the claims that it was good for dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product overall.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that from the first wash onwards, I knew that it was worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li>So, I doubt anyone with long hair, or anyone who likes a classic lathering shampoo, will be happy with this aspect of it.</li>
            <li>It has been an amazing shampoo to use when I had lost hope with some scalp/hair loss issues emerged suddenly and would not go away.</li>
            <li>but it was sort of worth it.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to give it a try because if it worked like others had said, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos for sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Not very moisturing, but still good stuff.</li>
            <li>I love that when I use it I feel that I am benefitting my body with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>A nice shampoo after working outside.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because I&#x27;ve been having so many problems with my hair, I know that many of those problems comes with aging, the hair aged as we do.</li>
            <li>Worked well for an oily patch/itching I had on my scalp when I was first pregnant.</li>
            <li>The price is also right.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I mostly bought this shampoo because I&#x27;d bought the TheraNeem toothpaste and liked it, and I&#x27;d run out of my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li>Wet your hair first before putting it on your hair so that you&#x27;ll be able to spread it more widely, especially near the scalp.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter tried it and really liked it on her very long hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo - leaves my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say about this product is that they use natural products.</li>
            <li>My hair turns out soft and clean, and my -ultra sensitive, hyper allergic to corn and gluten- scalp, is soothed and healthy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>very much see...</li>
            <li>Very gentle and non-toxic.  </li>
            <li>No longer need any conditioner - my fine hair feels silky, but it&#x27;s not limp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my hair but really keeps my scalp clean.  </li>
            <li>It did miracles at first.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have eczema on my scalp and until I found this shampoo, I never got consistent results with &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; shampoos.  </li>
            <li>If I add several drops of jojoba oil to it I can prevent most of the drying</li>
            <li>Overall not my favorite shampoo but something I might keep in rotations when I need to mix it up here and there.</li>
            <li>it was pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>I think for regular hair it would be better.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>i was getting alot of compliments on how shiny and pretty my hair was.</li>
            <li>Lathers up pretty well and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch</li>
            <li>Thanks and God bless!</li>
            <li>Will, I used the shampoo and the conditioner for the first time on 5/31/15.</li>
            <li>the only thing I like is the smell is ok and imy hair felt cleansed</li>
            <li>I have dry, voluminous  hair, yet it makes very easy to manage and the silky feel when i touch it after washing....</li>
            <li>I have seborrheic dermatitis and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or make my head more itchy like many other natural shampoos.   </li>
            <li>Other than that one niggle, this shampoo is amazing, and I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a bit of product on my hair - shampoo, conditioner, styling gel and hairspray, and have been using the same popular brands for years - none of them organic or natural.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re very abrasive/stinging on my scalp but theraneem is VERY gentle that you won&#x27;t feel it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have fine hair that gets build up without shampoo usage, and this one does the best job for cleaning my hair for a low amount of irritation.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair sooo dry, and it&#x27;s very light .</li>
            <li>So I tried this neem shampoo and wow this solved my dandruff and other skin problems without any side effects and smell good too.</li>
            <li>You only need a little to get a good lather and my hair feels clean and not STRIPPED of all oils.  </li>
            <li>I have a super sensitive scalp that using anything besides baking soda and vinegar will cause itching.</li>
            <li>I always use this when my scalp feels itchy or dry and it feels better after one use.</li>
            <li>This product cleared up my scalp, made my oily hair much more dry but still moisturized.</li>
            <li>By the way I have never felt compelled to write an Amazon review, but this product certainly deserves support.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has a sensitive scalp or is looking for a natural sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s seen a real improvement.  </li>
            <li>I initially ordered it to augment scabies infection treatment, but discovered that it makes my hair so smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as gentle as baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Very watery</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell</li>
            <li>my scalp feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li>Since it has no harsh chemicals, I am not afraid to use it often.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out very silky</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all that I was looking for - an organic shampoo that would be gentle with my scalp and not exacerbate the itching.</li>
            <li>He said it did absolutely nothing for his skin condition.</li>
            <li>My hair stopped falling out very soon after using it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather quite as much as shampoos with SLS in them, but that&#x27;s why I bought this one...</li>
            <li>I am not saying this will get rid of your scalp condition, but it manages it very well.</li>
            <li>Ive noticed I dont need to use as much conditioner or oil treatments as often as I would without this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It makes the whole process easier and faster.</li>
            <li>This really helps itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because I was struggling with very stubborn scalp dandruff.</li>
            <li>You also dod not have to use much of this shampoo either, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>The hair on the crown on my head gets very oily.</li>
            <li>but then again it help my hair from fallin and dryin as much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light/liquidy, but I like how well it lathers for a sulfate-free shampoo and think it penetrates to the scalp really well.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that your hair is plenty wet, the lather builds up well in your hair.</li>
            <li>and i can&#x27;t say much about it.</li>
            <li>I recommend the readers of this review try the TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I put it on early in my bath and only wash it off after it&#x27;s on more than 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>After using this shampoo, my hair is actually flexible, and much more maneageble and soft.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo, my scalp feels the same nothing significant changed.</li>
            <li>Love some of the other products.</li>
            <li>It definitely will keep mosquitoes away from your head, if you are one of the lucky people that seem to attract them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this shampoo and conditioner to kill lice and to prevent lice.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking for relief for their scalp.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>and I like how this shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave any residue (unlike so many of the other natural sulfate-free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried).  </li>
            <li>it took a little getting used to because it is thinner and more liquidy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This  has a lot of natural ingredients and it is really gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s more natural than the strong medicated shampoos and the ingredients aren&#x27;t irritating to his sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, very long wavy hair and this product works great.</li>
            <li>it sure does I&#x27;ve always had a dry itchy scalp all my life especially in winter</li>
            <li>This definitely is hypoallergenic but it&#x27;s cleaning properties are not as strong as a standard shampoo.</li>
            <li>So I got on line and started doing a little research on scalp conditions and Neem oil kept popping up as a healthy, natural hair and scalp treatment.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to do any more damage with shampoos like Denorex (it strips your scalp raw)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s liquidy and as others say, it doesn&#x27;t lather well and doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance, so I add it to a thick fruity or flowery shampoo or bodywash with better lather.</li>
            <li>So far, my scalp hasn&#x27;t itched, i don&#x27;t have dandruff, and I don&#x27;t have any lice which is the whole point of me using natural herbal shampoos which have neem and/or tea tree</li>
            <li>My only caution is this; I recommend this primarily for short hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was clean no matter how much product I had put on it, but it was looking smoother with less frizz.</li>
            <li>Helps to reduce the itchy feeling from sweating and mild dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Seems gental on my scalp which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my cheekbones and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>When I purchase this product was based on the reviews, my hair is thick and naturally curly, I bought coconut oil Vatika, Raw argan oil and Ojon hair repairing mask, and my hair feels so good after these products penetrate into hair but right after shampooing my hair with  TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone wanting to go organic or anyone interested in healthier hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>The first two uses actually did something</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement, and in fact, my scalp started itching more than usual..</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>like the product but the pine tar is a little strong</li>
            <li>just a little, you could not smell strongly because of the fruity smell power it.  </li>
            <li>He likes the smell (I think it&#x27;s a little strong, almost like Pine Sol) and the way it makes his hair feel.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it like other shampoos have and it makes my hair feel clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>But still, worth trying if you have itchy or dry scalp.</li>
            <li>However, it leaves my hair so squeaky clean, that it&#x27;s super fragile, hard to comb, and still falls out.  </li>
            <li>After the 1st use my scalp was clear &amp;</li>
            <li>My scalp looks clear and has no noticeable redness along the hairline.</li>
            <li>but this just didn&#x27;t clear my skin up.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this shampoo, as I&#x27;ve been having issues with my hair and scalp recently and none of the dandruff or coal-tar shampoos have had any effect.</li>
            <li>I decided to use this as a dandruff shampoo for my 3 year old and myself.</li>
            <li>Just Natural Products&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft and manageable, with shine.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try a natural method to get rid of it before using a prescription medication.</li>
            <li>I give it a 5 star because it made my hair soft</li>
            <li>They leave my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Also the texture of the shampoo is very watery and it doesn&#x27;t have a solid lotion-like texture.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiniy looking.</li>
            <li>I have tried every shampoo and conditioner and 2 in 1 on the market it seems, both natural and drug-store brands.  </li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, but will not use if often as it dried my very fine already on the dry side hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using it as a first shampoo for my 3 month old, being careful not to get it near her eyes, and her hair is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and my scalp has  changed significantly.</li>
            <li>My head feels so clean, and it gets rid of all the dead skin.</li>
            <li>- I do wish it had a pump top because it is so thin and easy to waste product.</li>
            <li>First, I would like to say that I am an African American woman age 45.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 26 year old woman and have a highly problematic scalp with seborrheic dermatitis, due to previous use of hard water, imbalanced hormones, etc..Was grappling with MAJOR hair loss as well, but eventually found a protocol that greatly helped till I ran out of their herbal organic shampoo.</li>
            <li>but after that my head went back to its normal greasy hair and itchy scalp ways.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a grandma with aging hair and was looking for a gentle shampoo that would cleanse well but not turn my hair dry.  </li>
            <li>I read where some people did not need to use a conditioner as the shampoo left their hair very soft.</li>
            <li>A description of the previous condition of my hair - it&#x27;s on the long side, tends to be dry, very fine, with an itchy sometimes oily scalp.  </li>
            <li>And, apparently, it treated my scalp eczema!</li>
            <li>Using this with the Nizoral has started me in the right direction for obtaining a healthier scalp with less irritation and dandruff compared to using Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li>It makes the hair oily so you may want to keep another clean shampoo on hand if you feel like you went overboard.</li>
            <li>I also have scalp problems in general.</li>
            <li>Actually helps keep my scalp clear.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is the only one that has given me relief.</li>
            <li>I have the classic conundrum of dry, itchy scalp that causes dandruff, along with oily hair.</li>
            <li>it cleans the hair and scalp well enough but does not do much for dry scalp,</li>
            <li>My hair balled up in to a huge dried out pile of knots!!</li>
            <li>With a spray of oil for flat ironing and a light hairspray after finishing, my style has lasted the past 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a guy like me with fairly short hair, one bottle will last for months, and as a bonus, it has no harsh chemicals (like SLS), for those worried about thinning hair, etc.  </li>
            <li>I also used Tea Tree oil (couple of drops) mixed into this shampoo for a period of time and occasionally use another shampoo &amp;#34;Just Natural Thicker Hair Shampoo</li>
            <li>So far, showering once, and occasionally twice a day for over a month, I still have plenty left.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and then tried other shampoos and always come back to TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My grey hair have blended with my dirty blonde natural color and actually look like a good frosting job.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that the patches of dry skin on both of our heads completely disappeared after 2 uses of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was told my hair was oily because my scalp was so dry and my natural oils were trying to save it.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that it has eliminated the dandruff that I&#x27;ve had for the past few years.  </li>
            <li>Maybe somebody with really oily hair would appreciate this, or a guy with very little hair, but I&#x27;m used to my hair coming out soft and bouncy even if I shampoo daily, and this stuff makes it feel like straw.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough for my hair to be growing back already, but It does wash and dry soft and thicker.  </li>
            <li>my friend is even older than me with hair problems and she doesn&#x27;t like to use conditioner because her hair is thinning and the conditioner flats her hair down.</li>
            <li>The oil I used filled the hair with seeds and made it very hard to decide if they were eggs or nits left in the hair, the shampoo also conditions both hair and scalp and big plus.</li>

            <li> works beautifully as a flea shampoo!</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Amazon was great and promptly refunded my money, but I would never order anything again from Livamed</li>
            <li> As some others have said, it&#x27;s a transition to shampoo that isn&#x27;t aplenty in your hands, but it does a great cleaning job.</li>
            <li> , it smells great</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell  great</li>

            <li> Leaves my hair feeling nice!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny, healthy, and manageable (the best part).</li>
            <li> The neem is great for your scalp and this shampoo feels good on your scalp when you shampoo.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it has a rather pleasant smell that hints of mint.</li>
            <li> The smell of it isn&#x27;t so good though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too soon to notice any good benefits.</li>
            <li> Good product I like the way my hair feels when I use it.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a good while too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We&#x27;ll find a good one someday</li>
            <li> If you want a shampoo that makes your hair smells good; this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> It seems good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo fit the bill perfectly .</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li> but i can tell this shampoo does have alot beneficial vitanins for the scalp and hair....not a good substitute for nizoral at all</li>
            <li> I loved the shampoo</li>
            <li> Probably good for scalp but HORRID on hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job at a good price so still a 4/5 product in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>

            <li> Shampoo has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Nice smell--</li>
            <li> but it is nice.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, smells good and leaves my hair looking healthy.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> it s nice</li>
            <li> this shampoo really did a great job!!!!</li>
            <li> Like the smell and makes hair nice</li>
            <li> i started using it when it was warm out</li>
            <li> Neem Oil not the kind for insect protection read the ones on how the Neem oil works in soaps &amp; salve.  </li>
            <li> Using a sparing amount, get a good lather and enjoy!</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell and a lot</li>
            <li> I would like my hair to be shinier  after using it and that is a dissapointment although the texture is nice.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo because I use a TheraNeem product on my face which is the best non steroid treatment I&#x27;ve ever found for eczema.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the healthy look of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have many chemical sensitivities, and most products bother me, but not this one!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the results after searching for a solution for so many years.  </li>
            <li> so far, this is the best one I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> Love that shampoo amazing</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is a nice shampoo and leaves hair feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this shampoo, it smells great and my hair and scalp feel great too</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very cheap.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is also very light.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a cruelty-free product, and I look forward to using it more often.</li>
            <li> give it 2 weeks and your scalp will feel better.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> AND my hair is softer, more mangeable than ever.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered more.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I waited for about 6 weeks before posting this review, to make sure it was not just another fluke.</li>
            <li> I use it twice though, each wash and dilute it with water, which gets it into my scalp much better.</li>
            <li> so I got more after.</li>
            <li> My husband has always had itchy, difficult-to-control dandruff and could never go more than a day or 2 without medicated shampoo.  </li>
            <li> We are buying more.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> but I feel like this shampoo is what has helped the most.</li>
            <li> but the conditioner smells magical</li>
            <li> (I love coconut scents).</li>
            <li> more than once a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair, too.</li>
            <li> and my patches got more aggressive.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> but it sure helps.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my seborrheic dermatitis feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> Safe to use on colored hair.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy course hair and need more oil in it.</li>
            <li> In fact, my scalp itched more than ever because this stuff dries out the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I wish it lathered more</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it does what it says .i know the effect of neem</li>
            <li> The product was okay.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, okay.  </li>
            <li> This soap handles many problems associated with aging which is a bacterial problem.  </li>
            <li> Most folks do not understand that you must detox your bod as you</li>
            <li> I have yet to have any complaints because she seem to be doing better, combining this product with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The more I was using the shampoo the more</li>
            <li> I got lots more dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out of this shampoo and plan to order more.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed washing my hair</li>
            <li> I went to the Dermatologist who put me on a foam antibiotic for the clogged follicles most people get some time or another.  </li>
            <li> I feel that I have the most &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair and scalp after using this product that I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> I love that.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something more naturals.</li>
            <li> Although it is not listed in the ingredients, I suspect that some kind of citrus oil is used for the natural fragrance - it does have a pleasant grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li> Even for the first use, I already feel so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> It works great and really leaves your hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my hair feel light and clean and am glad that it is safe for sensitive individuals :)</li>
            <li> She said it washed out easy and helped untangle her hair.</li>
            <li> its too strong</li>
            <li> The Neem shampoo and conditioner solved all that, and I can easily comb it out now with a fine tooth comb after showering.  </li>
            <li> It smelled nice and crisp.</li>
            <li> My hair seems fine without any conditioner, just this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This TheraNeem shampoo is ideal for people that suffer from dry scalps.</li>
            <li> i have mild problems with itchy scalp and sometimes flaking and sometimes the national brands make my head itch more, but this doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> After just one use I noticed a huge improvement in my scalp.</li>
            <li> and after luckily im a huge believer in conditioners.....</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews of others who bought it, until I was satisfied that it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone, but suggest that you read as much as you can on what others shared about their own experiences with TheraNeem, to determine if it might be helpful for you.  </li>
            <li> When using this shampoo, within the second use, I will see a great reduction in the itching and sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A nice gentle cleansing shampoo</li>
            <li> but I still don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this</li>
            <li> Redmond Clay is also a fantastic product NOT TO BE WITHOUT.</li>
            <li> It has a light citrus scent - I don&#x27;t really enjoy its smell</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Awesome, can&#x27;t say enough, really works</li>
            <li> Good for my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Your hair feels light and clean.</li>
            <li> My new favorite shampoo!  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and feels very natural and light.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used that actually makes a huge difference</li>
            <li> I read that Neem (azadirachta Indica) is an unique herb from India that acts as an anti bacterial, anti parasitic, anti fungal, anti protozoal and anti viral.</li>
            <li> I also have really long hair that requires a great deal of care.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> You will find itching is significantly reduced when these products products are used.</li>
            <li> so Im going to call it a success!</li>
            <li> Gets hair really clean.</li>
            <li> I like the clean feel of my hair and the gentleness of the shampoo for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have started to make a positive effort moving toward \\&quot;greener\\&quot; and more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; solutions to products and foods.  </li>
            <li> Probably I&#x27;d give that to her because just because if it isn&#x27;t good for me that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t good for her</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special about my hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer than usual and remarkably my psoriasis has greatly improved (it has not cleared completely, but close).</li>
            <li> Good shampoo for dog flees or human lice.  </li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes a nice lather and rinses out completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scalp itch was the problem that concerned me most, so after reading the reviews, and using the product myself, I can say that those reviews were very helpful to me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it at Whole Foods anymore, so I am glad Amazon is still carrying</li>
            <li> ; so I can&#x27;t give full credit to this shampoo</li>
            <li> It works, its doesnt have a sickly sweet odor, it helps with the itchy feel from sweat, dirt and plant grime.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, majority organic and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It was good enough for me that it is organic with no chemicals.</li>
            <li> My hair is super clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> I have used many Shampoos that cost half the amount and they are twice a good.</li>
            <li> it looses completely the moisture despite I&#x27;d used those products hours prior to wash my hair, and using a very good conditioner</li>
            <li> My scalp is no longer itchy, I no longer notice any dandruff, and my hair is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The scent is a mild lemon-grapefruit cleaner smell that doesn&#x27;t last/stick to hair after you wash it out.   </li>
            <li> I was almmost bold.</li>
            <li> Hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints about the smell what so ever and was surprised at how good this shampoo was at foaming considering it is without sulfates.  </li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft, and my scalp has never felt more clean and flake-free.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the claims that it was good for dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use too much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product overall.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that from the first wash onwards, I knew that it was worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li> So, I doubt anyone with long hair, or anyone who likes a classic lathering shampoo, will be happy with this aspect of it.</li>
            <li> It has been an amazing shampoo to use when I had lost hope with some scalp/hair loss issues emerged suddenly and would not go away.</li>
            <li> but it was sort of worth it.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to give it a try because if it worked like others had said, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have tried many shampoos for sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturing, but still good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love that when I use it I feel that I am benefitting my body with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> A nice shampoo after working outside.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I&#x27;ve been having so many problems with my hair, I know that many of those problems comes with aging, the hair aged as we do.</li>
            <li> Worked well for an oily patch/itching I had on my scalp when I was first pregnant.</li>
            <li> The price is also right.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I mostly bought this shampoo because I&#x27;d bought the TheraNeem toothpaste and liked it, and I&#x27;d run out of my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> Wet your hair first before putting it on your hair so that you&#x27;ll be able to spread it more widely, especially near the scalp.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter tried it and really liked it on her very long hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo - leaves my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say about this product is that they use natural products.</li>
            <li> My hair turns out soft and clean, and my -ultra sensitive, hyper allergic to corn and gluten- scalp, is soothed and healthy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> very much see...</li>
            <li> Very gentle and non-toxic.  </li>
            <li> No longer need any conditioner - my fine hair feels silky, but it&#x27;s not limp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my hair but really keeps my scalp clean.  </li>
            <li> It did miracles at first.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my scalp and until I found this shampoo, I never got consistent results with &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; shampoos.  </li>
            <li> If I add several drops of jojoba oil to it I can prevent most of the drying</li>
            <li> Overall not my favorite shampoo but something I might keep in rotations when I need to mix it up here and there.</li>
            <li> it was pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li> I think for regular hair it would be better.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> i was getting alot of compliments on how shiny and pretty my hair was.</li>
            <li> Lathers up pretty well and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch</li>
            <li> Thanks and God bless!</li>
            <li> Will, I used the shampoo and the conditioner for the first time on 5/31/15.</li>
            <li> the only thing I like is the smell is ok and imy hair felt cleansed</li>
            <li> I have dry, voluminous  hair, yet it makes very easy to manage and the silky feel when i touch it after washing....</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or make my head more itchy like many other natural shampoos.   </li>
            <li> Other than that one niggle, this shampoo is amazing, and I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a bit of product on my hair - shampoo, conditioner, styling gel and hairspray, and have been using the same popular brands for years - none of them organic or natural.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re very abrasive/stinging on my scalp but theraneem is VERY gentle that you won&#x27;t feel it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have fine hair that gets build up without shampoo usage, and this one does the best job for cleaning my hair for a low amount of irritation.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair sooo dry, and it&#x27;s very light .</li>
            <li> So I tried this neem shampoo and wow this solved my dandruff and other skin problems without any side effects and smell good too.</li>
            <li> You only need a little to get a good lather and my hair feels clean and not STRIPPED of all oils.  </li>
            <li> I have a super sensitive scalp that using anything besides baking soda and vinegar will cause itching.</li>
            <li> I always use this when my scalp feels itchy or dry and it feels better after one use.</li>
            <li> This product cleared up my scalp, made my oily hair much more dry but still moisturized.</li>
            <li> By the way I have never felt compelled to write an Amazon review, but this product certainly deserves support.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a sensitive scalp or is looking for a natural sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s seen a real improvement.  </li>
            <li> I initially ordered it to augment scabies infection treatment, but discovered that it makes my hair so smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as gentle as baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Very watery</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell</li>
            <li> my scalp feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li> Since it has no harsh chemicals, I am not afraid to use it often.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out very silky</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all that I was looking for - an organic shampoo that would be gentle with my scalp and not exacerbate the itching.</li>
            <li> He said it did absolutely nothing for his skin condition.</li>
            <li> My hair stopped falling out very soon after using it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather quite as much as shampoos with SLS in them, but that&#x27;s why I bought this one...</li>
            <li> I am not saying this will get rid of your scalp condition, but it manages it very well.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed I dont need to use as much conditioner or oil treatments as often as I would without this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It makes the whole process easier and faster.</li>
            <li> This really helps itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I was struggling with very stubborn scalp dandruff.</li>
            <li> You also dod not have to use much of this shampoo either, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> The hair on the crown on my head gets very oily.</li>
            <li> but then again it help my hair from fallin and dryin as much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light/liquidy, but I like how well it lathers for a sulfate-free shampoo and think it penetrates to the scalp really well.  </li>
            <li> Make sure that your hair is plenty wet, the lather builds up well in your hair.</li>
            <li> and i can&#x27;t say much about it.</li>
            <li> I recommend the readers of this review try the TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I put it on early in my bath and only wash it off after it&#x27;s on more than 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> After using this shampoo, my hair is actually flexible, and much more maneageble and soft.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo, my scalp feels the same nothing significant changed.</li>
            <li> Love some of the other products.</li>
            <li> It definitely will keep mosquitoes away from your head, if you are one of the lucky people that seem to attract them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this shampoo and conditioner to kill lice and to prevent lice.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for relief for their scalp.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> and I like how this shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave any residue (unlike so many of the other natural sulfate-free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried).  </li>
            <li> it took a little getting used to because it is thinner and more liquidy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This  has a lot of natural ingredients and it is really gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s more natural than the strong medicated shampoos and the ingredients aren&#x27;t irritating to his sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, very long wavy hair and this product works great.</li>
            <li> it sure does I&#x27;ve always had a dry itchy scalp all my life especially in winter</li>
            <li> This definitely is hypoallergenic but it&#x27;s cleaning properties are not as strong as a standard shampoo.</li>
            <li> So I got on line and started doing a little research on scalp conditions and Neem oil kept popping up as a healthy, natural hair and scalp treatment.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to do any more damage with shampoos like Denorex (it strips your scalp raw)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s liquidy and as others say, it doesn&#x27;t lather well and doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance, so I add it to a thick fruity or flowery shampoo or bodywash with better lather.</li>
            <li> So far, my scalp hasn&#x27;t itched, i don&#x27;t have dandruff, and I don&#x27;t have any lice which is the whole point of me using natural herbal shampoos which have neem and/or tea tree</li>
            <li> My only caution is this; I recommend this primarily for short hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was clean no matter how much product I had put on it, but it was looking smoother with less frizz.</li>
            <li> Helps to reduce the itchy feeling from sweating and mild dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Seems gental on my scalp which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my cheekbones and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> When I purchase this product was based on the reviews, my hair is thick and naturally curly, I bought coconut oil Vatika, Raw argan oil and Ojon hair repairing mask, and my hair feels so good after these products penetrate into hair but right after shampooing my hair with  TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for anyone wanting to go organic or anyone interested in healthier hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> The first two uses actually did something</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement, and in fact, my scalp started itching more than usual..</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> like the product but the pine tar is a little strong</li>
            <li> just a little, you could not smell strongly because of the fruity smell power it.  </li>
            <li> He likes the smell (I think it&#x27;s a little strong, almost like Pine Sol) and the way it makes his hair feel.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it like other shampoos have and it makes my hair feel clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> But still, worth trying if you have itchy or dry scalp.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves my hair so squeaky clean, that it&#x27;s super fragile, hard to comb, and still falls out.  </li>
            <li> After the 1st use my scalp was clear &amp;</li>
            <li> My scalp looks clear and has no noticeable redness along the hairline.</li>
            <li> but this just didn&#x27;t clear my skin up.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this shampoo, as I&#x27;ve been having issues with my hair and scalp recently and none of the dandruff or coal-tar shampoos have had any effect.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this as a dandruff shampoo for my 3 year old and myself.</li>
            <li> Just Natural Products&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and manageable, with shine.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try a natural method to get rid of it before using a prescription medication.</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 star because it made my hair soft</li>
            <li> They leave my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Also the texture of the shampoo is very watery and it doesn&#x27;t have a solid lotion-like texture.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiniy looking.</li>
            <li> I have tried every shampoo and conditioner and 2 in 1 on the market it seems, both natural and drug-store brands.  </li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, but will not use if often as it dried my very fine already on the dry side hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it as a first shampoo for my 3 month old, being careful not to get it near her eyes, and her hair is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and my scalp has  changed significantly.</li>
            <li> My head feels so clean, and it gets rid of all the dead skin.</li>
            <li> - I do wish it had a pump top because it is so thin and easy to waste product.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that I am an African American woman age 45.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old woman and have a highly problematic scalp with seborrheic dermatitis, due to previous use of hard water, imbalanced hormones, etc..Was grappling with MAJOR hair loss as well, but eventually found a protocol that greatly helped till I ran out of their herbal organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> but after that my head went back to its normal greasy hair and itchy scalp ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a grandma with aging hair and was looking for a gentle shampoo that would cleanse well but not turn my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I read where some people did not need to use a conditioner as the shampoo left their hair very soft.</li>
            <li> A description of the previous condition of my hair - it&#x27;s on the long side, tends to be dry, very fine, with an itchy sometimes oily scalp.  </li>
            <li> And, apparently, it treated my scalp eczema!</li>
            <li> Using this with the Nizoral has started me in the right direction for obtaining a healthier scalp with less irritation and dandruff compared to using Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li> It makes the hair oily so you may want to keep another clean shampoo on hand if you feel like you went overboard.</li>
            <li> I also have scalp problems in general.</li>
            <li> Actually helps keep my scalp clear.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is the only one that has given me relief.</li>
            <li> I have the classic conundrum of dry, itchy scalp that causes dandruff, along with oily hair.</li>
            <li> it cleans the hair and scalp well enough but does not do much for dry scalp,</li>
            <li> My hair balled up in to a huge dried out pile of knots!!</li>
            <li> With a spray of oil for flat ironing and a light hairspray after finishing, my style has lasted the past 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a guy like me with fairly short hair, one bottle will last for months, and as a bonus, it has no harsh chemicals (like SLS), for those worried about thinning hair, etc.  </li>
            <li> I also used Tea Tree oil (couple of drops) mixed into this shampoo for a period of time and occasionally use another shampoo &amp;#34;Just Natural Thicker Hair Shampoo</li>
            <li> So far, showering once, and occasionally twice a day for over a month, I still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and then tried other shampoos and always come back to TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My grey hair have blended with my dirty blonde natural color and actually look like a good frosting job.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that the patches of dry skin on both of our heads completely disappeared after 2 uses of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was told my hair was oily because my scalp was so dry and my natural oils were trying to save it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is that it has eliminated the dandruff that I&#x27;ve had for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> Maybe somebody with really oily hair would appreciate this, or a guy with very little hair, but I&#x27;m used to my hair coming out soft and bouncy even if I shampoo daily, and this stuff makes it feel like straw.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough for my hair to be growing back already, but It does wash and dry soft and thicker.  </li>
            <li> my friend is even older than me with hair problems and she doesn&#x27;t like to use conditioner because her hair is thinning and the conditioner flats her hair down.</li>
            <li> The oil I used filled the hair with seeds and made it very hard to decide if they were eggs or nits left in the hair, the shampoo also conditions both hair and scalp and big plus.</li>
            <li> Only one slight negative, the smell is a bit odd at first, but I&#x27;ve learned to actually like it&#x27;s clean, somewhat peanutty smell.  </li>
            <li> Really helped clear up my dry scalp unlike anything else I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I ordered a couple of bottles of Neem Hair Shampoo, and within less than two weeks, my scalp is completely normal.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo is exceptional and got rid of bad scales instantly.  </li>
            <li> But the main thing with buying this product was it not having the bad ingredients national brands have, so in that sense I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Livamed seems to have positive ratings, with a few very negative complaints similar to mine, but the positive reviews are so short and generic, I have to wonder if they are written by actual customers.</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis and have been using organic shampoos for a few years to help calm it down.</li>
            <li> After I let my hair air dry until it was damp, I noticed that my hair was really shiny and the skin of my scalp felt firm but not drying or itchy.</li>
            <li> I will continue using despite the small allergic reaction but urge anyone with the allergy to be ready to switch if they have a severe reaction.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but it has all natural ingredients which makes it more expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and I have much less breakage.</li>
            <li> I have really coarse, straight black hair, and with ordinary shampoos, i end up looking like a koosh ball unless I put something (gel, etc) in my hair, and even then, only the strongest hold stuff would ever work.  </li>
            <li> However, since there was no shampoo on the bottle or shipping box, I believe the shampoo had leaked out prior to shipping and was shippied to me in this condition, empty.</li>
            <li> I did use conditioner on my hair (on the ends) since it is really long (almost waist length</li>
            <li> I couldnt find a product like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days with a conditioner alternating with a all natural conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have had scalp/dandruff problems for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Theraneem Shampoo and Conditioner, and although it is a bit expensive, it is very very worth it.  </li>
            <li> It has no strong smell and leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning a bit due to age, and I read somewhere that the SLS in regular shampoo could be to blame.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap also need to be tough to kill bacteria and so folks with sensitive skin should use on the backsides and legs and areas that are not so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with seborrhea on my scalp for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> This is not the shampoo for dry hair.</li>
            <li> It does dry out your hair</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It somewhat relieved my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> But with this product I don&#x27;t even comb my hair until it&#x27;s almost dry and there are no knots.</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp but oily hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides, it made my hair dry...</li>
            <li> but wow did i realize the difference when i ran out, my hair started shedding again alot dry itchy scalp and no more shiny hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very thin, and while it penetrates down to the scalp easily, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;lather up\\&quot; a lot.</li>
            <li> but it also had a little smell of the hair oil mixed in.</li>
            <li> Over the past few months I developed a really itchy scalp and little raw spots started appearing.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t always trust reviews, I do trust Amazon.com and try always to buy directly from them, or at least say &amp;quot;shipped by Amazon.com&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li> but it still did what I expected.</li>
            <li> But what I received was an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and the strands are heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything possible from organic markets and drug stores and this shampoo is by far, the least harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, a harsh anti-fungal shampoo used in tandem with this one might be the answer for external treatment.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair for the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so much trouble, I would send it back.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair my whole life</li>
            <li> I did not really see a change in my dandruff at all</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s not enough to return my hair&#x27;s natural moisture, this is one of the worse shampoos I had ever used.</li>
            <li> Even after I felt it was safe to use a  flat iron on it (med. heat), it was thick, manageable and the thin side was hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other Neem products, their is no classic \\&quot;Neem\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very dry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed to a natural styling spray - no more gels - and use just a little Aveda hairpray.</li>
            <li> and then what I believe is the Neem which has a kind of unpleasant smell to it, at least to me.</li>
            <li> Just 2 little drops go a long way</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and coarse (mix of 4a and 4b) and my hair did not dry out at all.</li>
            <li> Neem is toxic for lice and other insects but not to humans.  </li>
            <li> It is also not perfumy like all the other dandruff shampoos that you find at the store.</li>
            <li> It also got rid of my itchy scalp, something i would get from time to time with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day, that works for me.</li>
            <li> Whenever I used other products, I had to comb through my hair while the conditioner was on</li>
            <li> Usually my scalp produces scales and itches a lot after only hours of washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed since so many people said this did not aggravate their skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo along with other Neem products to help combat a scabies infestation I had.</li>
            <li> At that period I couldnt take any vitamins due to treatment.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine/thin highlighted hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very minimal itching</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell isn&#x27;t 100% to my liking</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t as thick as regular shampoos</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a year and a half of being allergic to every shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> Even shea butter soaps, castile soap, and black soap cause itching, but also don&#x27;t help at all with the build-up.</li>
            <li> After fighting head lice with chemicals and seeing how horrible it left my grand daughters scalp</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell to it that is a mix between something like a normal shampoo fragrance</li>
            <li> The cap to the shampoo was not screwed on tightly</li>
            <li> My hair still falling out like crazy, now is even more frizzy, the worse part is that I bought two of them, one for me and the other as a gift, but now I am thinking what to do!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has a little psoriasis, so he&#x27;s been using the shampoo, and ordered some Neem oil as well.  </li>
            <li> so I had a little leakage problem.</li>
            <li> it did not smell It smell like a little of fruits of gragefruits/orange/pineapple/apple</li>
            <li> One thing though is that this shampoo is very thin compared to other traditional shampoos so you have to be careful not to waste by letting it slip off your hands.  </li>
            <li> We have hard water and very dry, itchy scalps.</li>
            <li> But after a few months it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> If I wash with this and then let the conditioner sit for a few minutes I will have almost no flakes.</li>
            <li> And it dried out my scalp</li>
            <li> However, when I&#x27;m out camping in the woods for a few days, this would be my pick of shampoos.</li>
            <li> Had a heavy meds treatment and lost lots of hair.</li>
            <li> Is thin as others have mentioned but it is not a problem as long as you pay attention when you pour some out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I had long and thin hair</li>
            <li> so one can use very little every time and that saves.</li>
            <li> The box it had shipped in was not damaged or covered in the shampoo, but I found a small crack on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money and it was pricey too!</li>
            <li> give five stars because this seems like an every day ordinary shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does take care of most of the scalp itch, but it&#x27;s terribly drying</li>
            <li> well as winter rolled around i was still using it and not sure if it was working still or not,</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this neem shampoo did not smell as bad as the oil I had purchased and not full of seeds either.</li>
            <li> One of the very few products I&#x27;ve found that work.</li>
            <li> Upon first impressions of this shampoo I really hate the smell.</li>
            <li> It is near impossible to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have a laundry list of chemical ingredients like Sodium Laureth Sulfate.</li>
            <li> so it was hard to be patient.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is very harsh it dryed my hair out bad with 1 use ,i had to put major oil treatments on my hair after using this shampoo</li>
            <li> and I used to have lots of it before I hit my late 20s</li>
            <li> AT LEAST NOT  WITH ME</li>
            <li> It is a thick liquid that you massage in and let set on your hair for a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> I washed her hair and she seem to slow up on her scratching.</li>
            <li> Because the shampoo has a very thin consistency, I put it directly on my scalp rather than in my hands by putting drops on random areas of my scalp.</li>
            <li> Completely stopped the itching on my head (i don&#x27;t know what causes my itching) for almost 3 months, but then i started to itch again :(  </li>
            <li> It is very thin and liquidy which helps it penetrate down to the scalp</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the combination to clear up an annoying scalp condition.</li>
            <li> At first I tried shampooing with T-Gel, but it made no difference and that coal tar smell was nasty.  </li>
            <li> I can even get away with using very small amounts of styling product now, since my hair no longer is wiry enough to require the mega-hold crap.      </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thin</li>
            <li> Did not like the thin consistency.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarassing, painful and messy.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the shampoo is NOT pleasant!</li>
            <li> and I find that I&#x27;m unable to use it without augmenting it.</li>
            <li> Smells weird.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this product line.</li>
            <li> Expensive for results.</li>
            <li> I Even tried Selsun Blue medicated shampoo which did not do anything for me and smelled awful.</li>
            <li> not impressed with it at all</li>
            <li> my hair becomes like wire, hard and stiff, it feels awful!!!</li>
            <li> I have an awful dry scalp with very thin hair and itching.</li>
            <li> I would use a shampoo and think, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s gonna work.&amp;#34; but after a few uses, my scalp would break out and itch that itch that drives you crazy!!  </li>
            <li> I have dandruff but greasy looking hair and was desperate for relief from the itching.</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders and it was awful dealing with what it did.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have a bad case of plaque psoriasis and this was recommended to me by my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell.</li>
            <li> At the time, I had a very bad build-up</li>
            <li> No fault to the shampoo, just a horrible set of cards to be dealt</li>
            <li> The packaging for this shampoo was horrible!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this shampoo - leaves my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very satisfied. I didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t as thick as regular shampoos but it still did what I expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> TheraNeem Shampoo was too drying, and made my hair &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34;.  Gave the shampoo to my husband to try and he loves it.  I ordered a second bottle for him.  This is not the shampoo for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo for dog flees or human lice.  Neem is toxic for lice and other insects but not to humans.  Shampoo has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Over the past few months I developed a really itchy scalp and little raw spots started appearing.  I have no allergies and have never had anything like this before.  I&#x27;ve used quite a bit of product on my hair - shampoo, conditioner, styling gel and hairspray, and have been using the same popular brands for years - none of them organic or natural.  At first I tried shampooing with T-Gel, but it made no difference and that coal tar smell was nasty.  So I got on line and started doing a little research on scalp conditions and Neem oil kept popping up as a healthy, natural hair and scalp treatment.  I ordered a couple of bottles of Neem Hair Shampoo, and within less than two weeks, my scalp is completely normal.  It is thinner than regular shampoo so it covers the scalp, and I leave it on for the recommended 3-5 minutes before rinsing.  No longer need any conditioner - my fine hair feels silky, but it&#x27;s not limp.  I&#x27;ve changed to a natural styling spray - no more gels - and use just a little Aveda hairpray. It&#x27;s a really terrific product.  My husband has a little psoriasis, so he&#x27;s been using the shampoo, and ordered some Neem oil as well.  He&#x27;s seen a real improvement.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It did miracles at first. But after a few months it stopped working. It does dry out your hair but it was sort of worth it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this shampoo, as I&#x27;ve been having issues with my hair and scalp recently and none of the dandruff or coal-tar shampoos have had any effect. I like to buy SLS-free, paraben-free shampoos from Wholefoods, which are more expensive than your Herbal Essences, etc., but this Neem shampoo is still a bit pricey even in comparison to those. But I wanted to give it a try because if it worked like others had said, it would be worth it. But what I received was an empty bottle. A completely, 100% empty bottle. The box it had shipped in was not damaged or covered in the shampoo, but I found a small crack on the bottom of the bottle. However, since there was no shampoo on the bottle or shipping box, I believe the shampoo had leaked out prior to shipping and was shippied to me in this condition, empty. Also, I contacted the seller (Livamed) as per the Amazon protocol, and never even received a response, let alone a replacement as should have been the case. Amazon was great and promptly refunded my money, but I would never order anything again from Livamed and I wish Amazon would carry the shampoo from a different seller. Livamed seems to have positive ratings, with a few very negative complaints similar to mine, but the positive reviews are so short and generic, I have to wonder if they are written by actual customers. If I were you, I would not order anything from Livamed, order the product elsewhere to avoid the possibility of having a problem with your order, because Livamed won&#x27;t fix it and then you&#x27;re left having to order from somewhere else anyway.</li>
            <li> Really helped clear up my dry scalp unlike anything else I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I love that it&#x27;s a cruelty-free product, and I look forward to using it more often. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This shampoo cured me of itchy scalp that I&#x27;ve had for some time. It is also not perfumy like all the other dandruff shampoos that you find at the store.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used - and that is no exaggeration.  I initially ordered it to augment scabies infection treatment, but discovered that it makes my hair so smooth and shiny.  What&#x27;s even better is that it has eliminated the dandruff that I&#x27;ve had for the past few years.  A description of the previous condition of my hair - it&#x27;s on the long side, tends to be dry, very fine, with an itchy sometimes oily scalp.  The Neem shampoo and conditioner solved all that, and I can easily comb it out now with a fine tooth comb after showering.  As for the scabies, I don&#x27;t know how well it works for that, but this shampoo just can&#x27;t be beat.  Only one slight negative, the smell is a bit odd at first, but I&#x27;ve learned to actually like it&#x27;s clean, somewhat peanutty smell.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last, btw, it&#x27;s only on application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jason&#x27;s shampoos which have tea tree oil in them but they&#x27;re very abrasive/stinging on my scalp but theraneem is VERY gentle that you won&#x27;t feel it.  It&#x27;s as gentle as baby shampoo.  It&#x27;s liquidy and as others say, it doesn&#x27;t lather well and doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance, so I add it to a thick fruity or flowery shampoo or bodywash with better lather. Wet your hair first before putting it on your hair so that you&#x27;ll be able to spread it more widely, especially near the scalp. I put it on early in my bath and only wash it off after it&#x27;s on more than 5-10 minutes.  So far, my scalp hasn&#x27;t itched, i don&#x27;t have dandruff, and I don&#x27;t have any lice which is the whole point of me using natural herbal shampoos which have neem and/or tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s certified organic, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and gluten-free.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do a lot for my hair but might be my well water is the reason why</li>
            <li> helps with itchy scalp!  give it 2 weeks and your scalp will feel better.</li>
            <li> But my scalp itchiness has improved by 90%. I still have some irritated spots but they seem to be improving. It&#x27;s been a year and a half of being allergic to every shampoo on the market. So far, this is the only one that has given me relief. I&#x27;ll do another review after I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I just like this product.  My granddaughter tried it and really liked it on her very long hair.  She said it washed out easy and helped untangle her hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this daily for about a month. Nice smell-- definite red grapefruit in there. Very watery consistency-- had to get use to tipping and pouring differently but it lathers up well. Feels like I use &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; than cheaper shampoos so it is worth the money. As some others have said, it&#x27;s a transition to shampoo that isn&#x27;t aplenty in your hands, but it does a great cleaning job.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  It works great and really leaves your hair feeling clean.  Seems gental on my scalp which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have really coarse, straight black hair, and with ordinary shampoos, i end up looking like a koosh ball unless I put something (gel, etc) in my hair, and even then, only the strongest hold stuff would ever work.  After using this shampoo, my hair is actually flexible, and much more maneageble and soft. I can even get away with using very small amounts of styling product now, since my hair no longer is wiry enough to require the mega-hold crap.      For a guy like me with fairly short hair, one bottle will last for months, and as a bonus, it has no harsh chemicals (like SLS), for those worried about thinning hair, etc.  It also got rid of my itchy scalp, something i would get from time to time with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is exceptional and got rid of bad scales instantly.  Will continue to use and buy...</li>
            <li> Wow! This works! Even for the first use, I already feel so good. I like this product!</li>
            <li> Worked well for an oily patch/itching I had on my scalp when I was first pregnant.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance but otherwise it worked well</li>
            <li> It is a nice shampoo and leaves hair feeling very clean. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell but it is nice.</li>
            <li> After trying everything on the market to get rid of lice I discovered neem oil and shampoos.  I highly recommend using this shampoo and conditioner to kill lice and to prevent lice.  Since I have been using this once a week on my girls hair, no lice!</li>
            <li> I have scalp exzema &amp; I swear I have tried EVERY shampoo, treatment, scalp brush, herbal treatment out there &amp; was resigned to the fact that I would have a flakey, itchy, embarassing scalp for the rest of my life.  I came across this product after yet another search for yet another shampoo so I thought why not try it after reading reviews.  After the 1st use my scalp was clear &amp; I could actually see my scalp, feel my scalp (before I could only see, feel the flakes).  I am thrilled with the results after searching for a solution for so many years.  I also purchased the conditioner.  Using these two products my scalp feels so much cleaner, it smells great AND my hair is softer, more mangeable than ever.  Cannot say enough good things about it.  I &amp;#60;3 Theraneem!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month. I hesitated because of having to order it but I&#x27;m glad I did. My hair was thinning a bit due to age, and I read somewhere that the SLS in regular shampoo could be to blame.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a nice lather and rinses out completely. Since it has no harsh chemicals, I am not afraid to use it often. My hair comes out very silky and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner. I should have ordered more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like its smell. It makes my hair sooo dry, and it&#x27;s very light . I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this as a dandruff shampoo for my 3 year old and myself. We have hard water and very dry, itchy scalps. I was amazed that the patches of dry skin on both of our heads completely disappeared after 2 uses of this shampoo. I&#x27;m also using it as a first shampoo for my 3 month old, being careful not to get it near her eyes, and her hair is so soft and supple. Just 2 little drops go a long way so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the first-ever review I&#x27;m writing on Amazon even after buying scores of products from the site. I&#x27;m a 26 year old woman and have a highly problematic scalp with seborrheic dermatitis, due to previous use of hard water, imbalanced hormones, etc..Was grappling with MAJOR hair loss as well, but eventually found a protocol that greatly helped till I ran out of their herbal organic shampoo. That&#x27;s all that I was looking for - an organic shampoo that would be gentle with my scalp and not exacerbate the itching. After 3 months of trying different shampoos, I finally chanced upon Theraneem. All I can say is that from the first wash onwards, I knew that it was worth its weight in gold! Nevertheless, I waited for about 6 weeks before posting this review, to make sure it was not just another fluke. I wash my hair 2ce a week with Theraneem. I use it twice though, each wash and dilute it with water, which gets it into my scalp much better. Will never try another shampoo and will be buying the conditioner now!</li>
            <li> This is just what I need for my Psoriasis.  I can&#x27;t wait to start my treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for dandruff and it didn&#x27;t work for me.  It was a waste of my money and it was pricey too!</li>
            <li> TheraNeem:  My hair is coarse and the strands are heavy.  My problem is that it has been falling out and has become noticeably thinner on one side of my head.  I read all of the reviews of others who bought it, until I was satisfied that it was worth trying.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough for my hair to be growing back already, but It does wash and dry soft and thicker.  Even after I felt it was safe to use a  flat iron on it (med. heat), it was thick, manageable and the thin side was hardly noticeable.  With a spray of oil for flat ironing and a light hairspray after finishing, my style has lasted the past 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scalp itch was the problem that concerned me most, so after reading the reviews, and using the product myself, I can say that those reviews were very helpful to me.  I recommend this product to anyone, but suggest that you read as much as you can on what others shared about their own experiences with TheraNeem, to determine if it might be helpful for you.  While I don&#x27;t always trust reviews, I do trust Amazon.com and try always to buy directly from them, or at least say &amp;quot;shipped by Amazon.com&amp;quot;.</li>
            <li> He said it did absolutely nothing for his skin condition. He does not use it now. Waste of money. He has eczema of the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I have used for years.  I can&#x27;t find it at Whole Foods anymore, so I am glad Amazon is still carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and I use this with the TheraNeem Scalp Therapy to keep dandruff from being a problem.  These 2 products are excellent for this.  If I wash with this and then let the conditioner sit for a few minutes I will have almost no flakes.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo if u have psoraisis</li>
            <li> And it dried out my scalp so I got more after. And my hair felt strawy! It&#x27;s usually very shiny and soft. I did not like this at all.</li>
            <li> My husband has always had itchy, difficult-to-control dandruff and could never go more than a day or 2 without medicated shampoo.  He has been using only this Neem Shampoo for over a week and has not felt the need to go back to the \\&quot;coal tar\\&quot; products. We are buying more.  :)</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, love it. Do not want to be without it because I am allergic to everything else.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo. it is a life saver!  Takes the itch AWAY!!!  I use it every other day, that works for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for itchy irritated scalp.  The smell of it isn&#x27;t so good though.</li>
            <li> Just got this shampoo. It smelled nice and crisp. Cleans well without any residue. Is thin as others have mentioned but it is not a problem as long as you pay attention when you pour some out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t give five stars because this seems like an every day ordinary shampoo. Nothing too special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is too soon to notice any good benefits. If there are any I will update.</li>
            <li> I have tried many shampoos for sensitive skin- so far, this is the best one I&#x27;ve found.  My hair stopped falling out very soon after using it.  It lathers well, smells good and leaves my hair looking healthy.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Doesn&#x27;t lather quite as much as shampoos with SLS in them, but that&#x27;s why I bought this one...no sodium laurel sulfate.  I plan to buy this again.  Next time I might try the conditioner, too.  My hair seems fine without any conditioner, just this shampoo.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and feels very natural and light. It somewhat relieved my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I feel like I had some scalp issues that this shampoo has helped resolve.  I feel like my hair has slowed, or stopped, thinning.  I also used Tea Tree oil (couple of drops) mixed into this shampoo for a period of time and occasionally use another shampoo &amp;#34;Just Natural Thicker Hair Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;from Just Natural Products&amp;#34; so I can&#x27;t give full credit to this shampoo but I feel like this shampoo is what has helped the most.</li>
            <li> I have a super sensitive scalp that using anything besides baking soda and vinegar will cause itching. Even shea butter soaps, castile soap, and black soap cause itching, but also don&#x27;t help at all with the build-up. Unfortunately, I have fine hair that gets build up without shampoo usage, and this one does the best job for cleaning my hair for a low amount of irritation. I use this 1-2 times a week when I need to have presentable looking hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my hair feel light and clean and am glad that it is safe for sensitive individuals :)</li>
            <li> Completely stopped the itching on my head (i don&#x27;t know what causes my itching) for almost 3 months, but then i started to itch again :(  But still, worth trying if you have itchy or dry scalp. It has no strong smell and leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have thick, very long wavy hair and this product works great. I&#x27;ve been looking for organic hair products and this is the BEST that I&#x27;ve used. I use it daily along with the TheraNeem Conditioner. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell  great but the conditioner smells magical (I love coconut scents). My hair is so soft and I have much less breakage. I think the key is to let it sit for 3-5 minutes as recommended on the bottle. Whenever I used other products, I had to comb through my hair while the conditioner was on or I would end up with nothing but knots. But with this product I don&#x27;t even comb my hair until it&#x27;s almost dry and there are no knots. I definitely recommend this product for anyone wanting to go organic or anyone interested in healthier hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  It&#x27;s gentle on my hair but really keeps my scalp clean.  I have eczema on my scalp and until I found this shampoo, I never got consistent results with &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; shampoos.  I would use a shampoo and think, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s gonna work.&amp;#34; but after a few uses, my scalp would break out and itch that itch that drives you crazy!!  When using this shampoo, within the second use, I will see a great reduction in the itching and sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and then tried other shampoos and always come back to TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo.  I think I&#x27;ll quit looking and stick with a sure thing!</li>
            <li> A nice gentle cleansing shampoo</li>
            <li> this shampoo is very harsh it dryed my hair out bad with 1 use ,i had to put major oil treatments on my hair after using this shampoo</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis and have been using organic shampoos for a few years to help calm it down. I was searching for an organic shampoo that helps improve the condition of the scalp, found this shampoo, and read the reviews. After just one use I noticed a huge improvement in my scalp. Usually my scalp produces scales and itches a lot after only hours of washing my hair. I&#x27;ve had very minimal itching and I haven&#x27;t seen or felt any scales. My hair is very thick and coarse (mix of 4a and 4b) and my hair did not dry out at all. Because the shampoo has a very thin consistency, I put it directly on my scalp rather than in my hands by putting drops on random areas of my scalp. Since I just recently started this shampoo, I will continue to use it and will write an updated review. So far, this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used that actually makes a huge difference so I&#x27;m already impressed. I am not saying this will get rid of your scalp condition, but it manages it very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the claims that it was good for dry itchy scalp. I have been using it for about a month now and I can say that it is not as advertised. it cleans the hair and scalp well enough but does not do much for dry scalp,</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo because I use a TheraNeem product on my face which is the best non steroid treatment I&#x27;ve ever found for eczema. This shampoo does take care of most of the scalp itch, but it&#x27;s terribly drying and I find that I&#x27;m unable to use it without augmenting it. If I add several drops of jojoba oil to it I can prevent most of the drying but I still don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this more than once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YMMV. Maybe somebody with really oily hair would appreciate this, or a guy with very little hair, but I&#x27;m used to my hair coming out soft and bouncy even if I shampoo daily, and this stuff makes it feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Good product I like the way my hair feels when I use it.  Very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed since so many people said this did not aggravate their skin. I have very sensitive skin on my cheekbones and around my eyes. This shampoo seemed to irritate it. Although it is not listed in the ingredients, I suspect that some kind of citrus oil is used for the natural fragrance - it does have a pleasant grapefruit smell. However, citrus can be an irritant for me. My boyfriend seems to like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It works, its doesnt have a sickly sweet odor, it helps with the itchy feel from sweat, dirt and plant grime.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great for me. I have many chemical sensitivities, and most products bother me, but not this one! It also sooths my scalp, which is often irritated.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great for me. I have seborrheic dermatitis and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or make my head more itchy like many other natural shampoos.   It doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates so it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair, too. It is quite drying (on the hair, not on scalp) but works great along with the matching conditioner. It is very thin and liquidy which helps it penetrate down to the scalp - I do wish it had a pump top because it is so thin and easy to waste product. The scent is a mild lemon-grapefruit cleaner smell that doesn&#x27;t last/stick to hair after you wash it out.   I would recommend this to anyone who has a sensitive scalp or is looking for a natural sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells weird. Bought in 2012 and I still have it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with seborrhea on my scalp for a very long time.  It&#x27;s embarassing, painful and messy.  My hair is naturally thin and I used to have lots of it before I hit my late 20s and my patches got more aggressive.  I&#x27;ve tried everything possible from organic markets and drug stores and this shampoo is by far, the least harsh on my skin.  However, it leaves my hair so squeaky clean, that it&#x27;s super fragile, hard to comb, and still falls out.  I started using a vitamin detangler to  help out with that. Otherwise, a harsh anti-fungal shampoo used in tandem with this one might be the answer for external treatment.  As with these types of dermatitis, a lot of healing must be from within- diet, nutrients, exercise, etc.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this product line.Expensive for results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo meets  my needs . I do not have to condition my hair each time I used it . My  hair would be over conditioned if I did .</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it like other shampoos have and it makes my hair feel clean and manageable. Great product!</li>
            <li> It is near impossible to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have a laundry list of chemical ingredients like Sodium Laureth Sulfate. This  has a lot of natural ingredients and it is really gentle on the hair. It has a weird smell to it that is a mix between something like a normal shampoo fragrance and then what I believe is the Neem which has a kind of unpleasant smell to it, at least to me. I bought this for dandruff and it didn&#x27;t get rid of it, but it helped decrease the flakiness overall. Overall not my favorite shampoo but something I might keep in rotations when I need to mix it up here and there.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, majority organic and natural ingredients.  You only need a little to get a good lather and my hair feels clean and not STRIPPED of all oils.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this shampoo, it smells great and my hair and scalp feel great too</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.  It definitely will keep mosquitoes away from your head, if you are one of the lucky people that seem to attract them.  I like this product a lot, but will not use if often as it dried my very fine already on the dry side hair.  However, when I&#x27;m out camping in the woods for a few days, this would be my pick of shampoos.</li>
            <li> it s nice did not help with SCABIES THO AT LEAST NOT  WITH ME</li>
            <li> I have a bad case of plaque psoriasis and this was recommended to me by my hair dresser. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and my scalp has  changed significantly. It took about a month (shampooing 2 times a week) to start feeling any changes. At the time, I had a very bad build-up but I didn&#x27;t want to do any more damage with shampoos like Denorex (it strips your scalp raw) so it was hard to be patient. It&#x27;s easy to use too much so I put some on my fingertips and massage onto the scalp. It makes the hair oily so you may want to keep another clean shampoo on hand if you feel like you went overboard. Ive noticed I dont need to use as much conditioner or oil treatments as often as I would without this shampoo. I do not wash my hair every day, only 2-3 times per week. This has kept my scalp under control but if I don&#x27;t continue regular use the plaque will build up and it will take another 1-2 weeks to get it back under control. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for relief for their scalp.  UPDATE: I have had some itchiness a day or so after use and realized it has PEG-7 as one of it&#x27;s ingredients. I am allergic to PG/PEG (propolyne glycol/polyethylene glycol) and think that is why I still have some itchiness. I&#x27;ve noticed the same reaction when I use body scrub that has PG/PEG in it. My scalp looks clear and has no noticeable redness along the hairline. I will continue using despite the small allergic reaction but urge anyone with the allergy to be ready to switch if they have a severe reaction.  UPDATE 2016: It stills works like a charm and is a permanent fixture in my life. I now use one of the bottles used to dye roots to apply the shampoo to my scalp. It makes the whole process easier and faster. Definitely consider getting one- they&#x27;re very cheap.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like laundry detergent. Hate the smell. I have dry scalp but oily hair. I was told my hair was oily because my scalp was so dry and my natural oils were trying to save it. I have dandruff but greasy looking hair and was desperate for relief from the itching. I tried this shampoo and the conditioner that goes along with it for two months now and I&#x27;ve seen no improvement. The first two uses actually did something but after that my head went back to its normal greasy hair and itchy scalp ways. I tried it different ways too, conditioner only on the length of my hair but not the scalp, only shampoo without the conditioner, and just the conditioner with no shampoo but nothing. I know everyone&#x27;s body is different. This stuff just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo along with other Neem products to help combat a scabies infestation I had. Scabies does not affect the scalp in adults, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt, b/c I also have scalp problems in general. I have the classic conundrum of dry, itchy scalp that causes dandruff, along with oily hair. Well, I love this shampoo. Unlike other Neem products, their is no classic \\&quot;Neem\\&quot; smell. In fact, it has a rather pleasant smell that hints of mint. After using this shampoo for over a month, I have ditched my dandruff shampoo, never to go back. My scalp is no longer itchy, I no longer notice any dandruff, and my hair is clean and fresh. One bottle lasts a good while too. So far, showering once, and occasionally twice a day for over a month, I still have plenty left. My only caution is this; I recommend this primarily for short hair. This shampoo is very thin, and while it penetrates down to the scalp easily, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;lather up\\&quot; a lot. So, I doubt anyone with long hair, or anyone who likes a classic lathering shampoo, will be happy with this aspect of it. If desired, you can simply rinse and repeat. It always produces a much bigger lather on the second application. Other than that one niggle, this shampoo is amazing, and I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo at local organic store in despeair. Had a heavy meds treatment and lost lots of hair. I was almmost bold. Since I had long and thin hair it was pretty noticeable. At that period I couldnt take any vitamins due to treatment. As my doc told me eat fruits and vegetables. I bought this shampoo without any research. It was good enough for me that it is organic with no chemicals. It is been 6 months since I use it and I see a great difference. My hair grew back. No splits.  Love it! It takez time but it sure helps. Considering all those chemicals I had inside my organism this shampoo really did a great job!!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my seborrheic dermatitis feel so much better.  It is not a cure, but it definitely part of the therapy I am using and my condition is clearing up.  This shampoo a couple of times a week, and Bragg&#x27;s vinegar a couple of time between shampoos.  Can&#x27;t beat the combination to clear up an annoying scalp condition.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my chronic skin problems and it just didn&#x27;t work. No fault to the shampoo, just a horrible set of cards to be dealt (psoriasis)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll find a good one someday but this just didn&#x27;t clear my skin up.</li>
            <li> The packaging for this shampoo was horrible!!! The cap to the shampoo was not screwed on tightly so I had a little leakage problem. The smell of the shampoo is NOT pleasant! If you want a shampoo that makes your hair smells good; this product is not for you. After using this shampoo, my scalp feels the same nothing significant changed. The only good thing I can say about this product is that they use natural products.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Helps my scalp issues!  It has been an amazing shampoo to use when I had lost hope with some scalp/hair loss issues emerged suddenly and would not go away.</li>
            <li> This takes a bit of getting used to as it is thin.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am used to not having my hair falling out of my head and all over the shower.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have that stuff in it... sl something that makes your hair fall out.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and manageable, with shine. Did not strip out any dyes. Would buy again or recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Like the smell and makes hair nice</li>
            <li> Works well for my son&#x27;s scalp issues.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Your hair feels light and clean. Safe to use on colored hair.  I recommended getting the conditioner too.  Hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> This really helps itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Bought it since one of the reviews claimed it help kill lice.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything to kill the lice..</li>
            <li> I have a bit of persistent Psoriasis on my scalp and I wanted to try a natural method to get rid of it before using a prescription medication. I tried this shampoo for about two months with no results. I will continue to use it because I like how it makes my hair feel, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work as an herbal remedy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because on Dr. Oz they talked about it. It seems good. I have wavy course hair and need more oil in it. I think for regular hair it would be better.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to help with dandruff and itchy scalp;  it did niether.  In fact, my scalp itched more than ever because this stuff dries out the scalp.  I can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love that shampoo amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product. I wish it lathered more and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special about my hair/scalp. But the main thing with buying this product was it not having the bad ingredients national brands have, so in that sense I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use this with the conditioner.  The combo has cleared my scalp of psoriasis.  Very happy with this product line.</li>
            <li> like the product but the pine tar is a little strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a grandma with aging hair and was looking for a gentle shampoo that would cleanse well but not turn my hair dry.  This shampoo fit the bill perfectly . It is a thick liquid that you massage in and let set on your hair for a couple of minutes.  Within a week of using it, I noticed a difference. My hair was clean no matter how much product I had put on it, but it was looking smoother with less frizz. So I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how my hair improves with continued use and I&#x27; thinking I&#x27;ll try the matching conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I was struggling with very stubborn scalp dandruff. Before buying this shampoo I did tons of research what can fight with dandruff. I read that Neem (azadirachta Indica) is an unique herb from India that acts as an anti bacterial, anti parasitic, anti fungal, anti protozoal and anti viral. Neem is a cure for all diseases. I Even tried Selsun Blue medicated shampoo which did not do anything for me and smelled awful. So I tried this neem shampoo and wow this solved my dandruff and other skin problems without any side effects and smell good too. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the good reviews I read. I will admit I was very skeptical. I have psoriasis on my scalp and I have to alternate shampoos regularly. I also have really long hair that requires a great deal of care. Upon first impressions of this shampoo I really hate the smell. I almost did not try it. I read where some people did not need to use a conditioner as the shampoo left their hair very soft. I did use conditioner on my hair (on the ends) since it is really long (almost waist length and I am 5&#x27;8\\&quot;). I have since used this shampoo each time I wash my hair for the last few weeks. I have noticed a significant difference. My hair is softer than usual and remarkably my psoriasis has greatly improved (it has not cleared completely, but close). You also dod not have to use much of this shampoo either, which is a plus. I will defiantly buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it does what it says .i know the effect of neem ,it is excellent for scalp.&lt;br /&gt;i dont like the smell but i can work with it.would be a regular buyer of this product.</li>
            <li> The product was okay.  Did not like the thin consistency.  Otherwise, okay.  Promptly shipped.  Love some of the other products.</li>
            <li> My child had some itches on her scalps, I see improvement after use. Need to condition the hair after use.</li>
            <li> Neem Hair Shampoo is definately a product that works as advertised and to this day we continue to use it in our daughters hair and she hasn&#x27;t contracted Lice from classmates since.  This product is not going to rid your child&#x27;s hair from nit eggs or lice, you will still have to purchase a Lice removal kit and do the painstaking process of combing every strand of hair daily for a week to get all the nits out. What this shampoo does is prevent future infestations and it works! Our child&#x27;s school has had multiple Lice alerts since we started using the product and we haven&#x27;t had any issues. Thank God!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Love it! Will do business with them again.Exactly as described.  Love it! Will do business with them again.</li>
            <li> My hair is super clean and shiny.  I&#x27;ve even gotten several compliments.</li>
            <li> I have used many Shampoos that cost half the amount and they are twice a good. If it wasn&#x27;t so much trouble, I would send it back.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very dry!</li>
            <li> The scent on this shampoo if horrid.  The hair on the crown on my head gets very oily.</li>
            <li> it sure does I&#x27;ve always had a dry itchy scalp all my life especially in winter i started using it when it was warm out so my scalp wasn&#x27;t bothering me. i was getting alot of compliments on how shiny and pretty my hair was. well as winter rolled around i was still using it and not sure if it was working still or not, but wow did i realize the difference when i ran out, my hair started shedding again alot dry itchy scalp and no more shiny hair. i will defiantly keep using this product</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling nice!  Just that it is like water so you use a lot of it trying to get it on your head!</li>
            <li> One of the best anti-bacterial and viral on the market. This soap handles many problems associated with aging which is a bacterial problem.  Neem Oil not the kind for insect protection read the ones on how the Neem oil works in soaps &amp; salve.  Neemaura Skin Salve and Thera Neem Leaf shampoo &amp; skin lotion.  Most folks do not understand that you must detox your bod as you age and their are 180 different types of bacteria on the OUTSIDE of your body.  Two of which if allowed inside can kill you. While there is somewhat of a order that lingers I do not find it offensive.  What offenses are women who ware perfume to the guy. This soap also need to be tough to kill bacteria and so folks with sensitive skin should use on the backsides and legs and areas that are not so sensitive.  You will find itching is significantly reduced when these products products are used. Another must have in you &#x27;aging kit&#x27; is Redmond Clay is also a fantastic product NOT TO BE WITHOUT.</li>
            <li> This shampoo may be a bit watery, and the smell takes a bit of getting used to. But, time and again, day after day, it works. My hair turns out soft and clean, and my -ultra sensitive, hyper allergic to corn and gluten- scalp, is soothed and healthy with this shampoo. Not very moisturing, but still good stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my granddaughter who has eczema and cradle cap. I washed her hair and she seem to slow up on her scratching. I have yet to have any complaints because she seem to be doing better, combining this product with the conditioner. The smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I ordered it after researching online the benefits of Neem. I have thin hair my whole life but recently it got thinner because of some medicine I was taking. I&#x27;ve been trying several things. The Noxin that everyone talks about for hair regrowth made my strands brittle and my scalp itchy (although it was working for hair regrowth). I use this shampoo every time I was my hair and I let it sit for up to the 3 minutes (recommended on the bottle). I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner. It makes my hair shiny, healthy, and manageable (the best part). I love it and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve also been taking Neem vitamins.</li>
            <li> Actually helps keep my scalp clear.  One of the very few products I&#x27;ve found that work.</li>
            <li> The more I was using the shampoo the more I got lots more dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;Besides, it made my hair dry...It is not work with me.</li>
            <li> This definitely is hypoallergenic but it&#x27;s cleaning properties are not as strong as a standard shampoo. I will continue to buy it though.</li>
            <li> I give this a 10 star. My head feels so clean, and it gets rid of all the dead skin. I will use this forever. Love it.</li>
            <li> seems to workwell but my scalp remains itchy all the same</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever. I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything and this shampoo actually soothes my scalp rather than breaking me out! It&#x27;s an added bonus that I&#x27;m constantly complimented on how shiny my hair is!</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 star because it made my hair soft it didnt fall asmuch i didnt like the smell its too strong but then again it help my hair from fallin and dryin as much</li>
            <li> I couldnt find a product like this for a long time. Thanks for a great product. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out of this shampoo and plan to order more.  It&#x27;s very light/liquidy, but I like how well it lathers for a sulfate-free shampoo and think it penetrates to the scalp really well.  It has a light citrus scent - I don&#x27;t really enjoy its smell but I don&#x27;t dislike it either.  I&#x27;ve used the volumizing version of this shampoo and prefer this version.  The conditioner is also very light.  I have extremely fine/thin highlighted hair and I like how this shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave any residue (unlike so many of the other natural sulfate-free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried).  The neem is great for your scalp and this shampoo feels good on your scalp when you shampoo.  I always use this when my scalp feels itchy or dry and it feels better after one use.</li>
            <li> Lathers up pretty well and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch so Im going to call it a success!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and has greatly reduced by itching and flaking.</li>
            <li> This TheraNeem shampoo is ideal for people that suffer from dry scalps. You can also add almond and/or aloe vera oil and it will do wonders, IMO. Also this can be used for lice problems and just for regular bathing, also get the conditioner. Thanks and God bless!</li>
            <li> As I posted in my review of the Theraneem Conditioner, They are both great products.  They leave my hair soft and manageable.  A bonus is that they have eliminated my need to use hair color.  My grey hair have blended with my dirty blonde natural color and actually look like a good frosting job.</li>
            <li> I did not really see a change in my dandruff at all but i can tell this shampoo does have alot beneficial vitanins for the scalp and hair....not a good substitute for nizoral at all</li>
            <li> i have mild problems with itchy scalp and sometimes flaking and sometimes the national brands make my head itch more, but this doesn&#x27;t.  it took a little getting used to because it is thinner and more liquidy but i like it and it doesn&#x27;t smell mediciney.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but it has all natural ingredients which makes it more expensive. Also the texture of the shampoo is very watery and it doesn&#x27;t have a solid lotion-like texture.</li>
            <li> I am using this shampoo in conjunction with Nizoral Anti-Dandruff shampoo.  I have started to make a positive effort moving toward \\&quot;greener\\&quot; and more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; solutions to products and foods.  What drew me to this shampoo was its lack of sulfates.  Using this with the Nizoral has started me in the right direction for obtaining a healthier scalp with less irritation and dandruff compared to using Head &amp; Shoulders (NEVER AGAIN!).  I really have no complaints about the smell what so ever and was surprised at how good this shampoo was at foaming considering it is without sulfates.  One thing though is that this shampoo is very thin compared to other traditional shampoos so you have to be careful not to waste by letting it slip off your hands.  Using a sparing amount, get a good lather and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this.  Didn&#x27;t notice any improvement, and in fact, my scalp started itching more than usual.. Might work for some, but not me</li>
            <li> Will, I used the shampoo and the conditioner for the first time on 5/31/15. I loved the shampoo very much see...it did not smell It smell like a little of fruits of gragefruits/orange/pineapple/apple but it also had a little smell of the hair oil mixed in. just a little, you could not smell strongly because of the fruity smell power it.  Overall, the shampoo lather was so well mixed into your hand and hair. Make sure that your hair is plenty wet, the lather builds up well in your hair. Massage well and rinse well.  I enjoyed washing my hair it felt so goooooooood!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has worked wonders on my son&#x27;s scalp psoriasis.  He likes the smell (I think it&#x27;s a little strong, almost like Pine Sol) and the way it makes his hair feel.  I like that it&#x27;s more natural than the strong medicated shampoos and the ingredients aren&#x27;t irritating to his sensitive face.  Been using it for about a month and no flakes or irritation.  We ordered through Neem King and received it in only a couple days.  I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> I went to the Dermatologist who put me on a foam antibiotic for the clogged follicles most people get some time or another.  I started using this in addition to Jasons Dandruff Relief (also awesome) instead of the antibiotic.  It works great.  The TheraNeem conditioner is awesome too.</li>
            <li> I just started using it and i can&#x27;t say much about it. Has a nice smell and a lot lather so one can use very little every time and that saves. The price is also right.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I mostly bought this shampoo because I&#x27;d bought the TheraNeem toothpaste and liked it, and I&#x27;d run out of my usual shampoo. I must say, my hair is smoother and silkier than I&#x27;d ever experienced. And, apparently, it treated my scalp eczema! I&#x27;d never known why I was always scratching my head until this product made it stop!</li>
            <li> One cannot beat the product quality or price anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product this product to folks concerned about what is put in the hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome, can&#x27;t say enough, really works</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I have ever used. I love that when I use it I feel that I am benefitting my body with natural ingredients. I have an awful dry scalp with very thin hair and itching. This product cleared up my scalp, made my oily hair much more dry but still moisturized. I also feel that this product has made my hair thicker. I feel that I have the most &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair and scalp after using this product that I have ever had in my life. I recommend this product to all of my friends and family. I am on my fourth bottle now and I am telling you, you need to try this product!!!!</li>
            <li> My new favorite shampoo!  Very gentle and non-toxic.  Good for my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Gets hair really clean.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Makes my hair soft and shiniy looking. I have dry, voluminous  hair, yet it makes very easy to manage and the silky feel when i touch it after washing.... I love that.</li>
            <li> keeps dandruff out of my hair</li>
            <li> great shampoos, cleans and keeps scalp healthy</li>
            <li> not impressed with it at all</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo three time and despise the way it makes my hair feel while im washing it and after luckily im a huge believer in conditioners.....the only thing I like is the smell is ok and imy hair felt cleansed</li>
            <li> works beautifully as a flea shampoo!</li>
            <li> A nice shampoo after working outside. Helps to reduce the itchy feeling from sweating and mild dry scalp. I use it every few days with a conditioner alternating with a all natural conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would like my hair to be shinier  after using it and that is a dissapointment although the texture is nice.</li>
            <li> I have had scalp/dandruff problems for as long as I can remember.  I have tried every shampoo and conditioner and 2 in 1 on the market it seems, both natural and drug-store brands.  Everything either dries my scalp and hair and leaves it coarse or leaves everything greasy, etc.  I bought the Theraneem Shampoo and Conditioner, and although it is a bit expensive, it is very very worth it.  My hair has never felt so soft, and my scalp has never felt more clean and flake-free.  Thank you Theraneem!  Highly recommend this product.  By the way I have never felt compelled to write an Amazon review, but this product certainly deserves support.</li>
            <li> Probably good for scalp but HORRID on hair. My hair balled up in to a huge dried out pile of knots!! My hair is past my shoulders and it was awful dealing with what it did.</li>
            <li> After fighting head lice with chemicals and seeing how horrible it left my grand daughters scalp I wanted to try something more naturals. I was pleasantly surprised that this neem shampoo did not smell as bad as the oil I had purchased and not full of seeds either. The oil I used filled the hair with seeds and made it very hard to decide if they were eggs or nits left in the hair, the shampoo also conditions both hair and scalp and big plus. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I&#x27;ve been having so many problems with my hair, I know that many of those problems comes with aging, the hair aged as we do. When I purchase this product was based on the reviews, my hair is thick and naturally curly, I bought coconut oil Vatika, Raw argan oil and Ojon hair repairing mask, and my hair feels so good after these products penetrate into hair but right after shampooing my hair with  TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo my hair becomes like wire, hard and stiff, it feels awful!!! it looses completely the moisture despite I&#x27;d used those products hours prior to wash my hair, and using a very good conditioner, that&#x27;s not enough to return my hair&#x27;s natural moisture, this is one of the worse shampoos I had ever used. My hair still falling out like crazy, now is even more frizzy, the worse part is that I bought two of them, one for me and the other as a gift, but now I am thinking what to do!!! my friend is even older than me with hair problems and she doesn&#x27;t like to use conditioner because her hair is thinning and the conditioner flats her hair down. Probably I&#x27;d give that to her because just because if it isn&#x27;t good for me that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t good for her, I don&#x27;t know???. I Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. I like the clean feel of my hair and the gentleness of the shampoo for my scalp. I would recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that I am an African American woman age 45. My hair is cut into a pixie hairstyle, and the  texture of my hair is similar to Caucasian and Hispanic hair. I tried the shampoo and conditioner after receiving them on the same day from the seller. Wow! This product is fantastic. Instantly, I felt a tingly sensation, which makes me feel that it was working. After I let my hair air dry until it was damp, I noticed that my hair was really shiny and the skin of my scalp felt firm but not drying or itchy. Afterwards, I added John Masters Organics pomade to my hair and wrapped it in a silk scarf. The next day, I removed the scarf and applied Morocconoil to add moisture and sheen to my hair. I was very pleased with the healthy look of my hair. In addition, the frizz that used to occur on the outside edges of my scalp have disappeared. I recommend the readers of this review try the TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product overall. It works well for me and doesn&#x27;t trigger my eczema. My only complaint is the smell isn&#x27;t 100% to my liking but it does it&#x27;s job at a good price so still a 4/5 product in my eyes.</li>
