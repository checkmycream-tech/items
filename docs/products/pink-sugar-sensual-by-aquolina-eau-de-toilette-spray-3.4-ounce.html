            <li>And I love it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very nice cotton candy scent to it.</li>
            <li>While it smells good, it smells like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL LIGHT FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li>Good smell for summer.</li>
            <li>GOod price though.</li>
            <li>I got a 1 oz bottle of this because of good reviews.</li>
            <li>I smelled this perfume in Sephora and loved it and decided to order it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>- you smell so good.</li>
            <li>The price was good, though.</li>
            <li>I saw reviews for Sensual were almost as good</li>
            <li>fruitiness makes this a good choice for daytime and</li>
            <li>then the fragrance&#x27;s lightness could be good for avoiding scent-induced headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>GREAT deal on my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Great product, my wife love it.</li>

            <li>Love the Scent!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>This is nothing like I expected-not spicy or sophisticated at all!</li>
            <li>I just love this smell!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I will for sure wear this, but nothing compared to the orginal!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance!  </li>
            <li>Also nice for day or night.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a nice cotton-candy scent, start here.</li>
            <li>I SMELL NICE</li>
            <li>Kind of musky to be honest.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it was a great price and it came quickly, I just don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li>Unless this was a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34;, this scent is best suited for young men.</li>
            <li>Great price for a perfume well worth more.</li>
            <li>Seriously sexy scent.</li>
            <li>Men and women of all ages love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance &amp; ordered and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I also have chocolovers which is delicious, so I felt it necessary to try PS Sensual!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more sophisticated</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I already love this one; it is my signature fragrance.  </li>
            <li>not my favorite..</li>
            <li>Overall a great scent, thats why I rate it 4 stars!</li>
            <li>If anyone else has tried that, I&#x27;d love to know how it worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, and always will.</li>
            <li>I love the vanilla tones.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Although this smells more like the &amp;#34;grown</li>
            <li>This is one of my many favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I have also used the hair perfume which has captured many people&#x27;s compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is ok.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the Sensual is a better pm fragrance though.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this one though.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is sexy.</li>
            <li>more please.</li>
            <li>I class this as being better suited to spring/summer</li>
            <li>I class this as being better suited to spring/summer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great day wear and a good smell for being young and sweet.</li>
            <li>I own the original as well as Gold Sugar and PS Sparks, so I just had to purchase Sensual when I seen it.</li>
            <li>It is not as sweet as PS, and I also think that it smells more perfumey than the orginal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of sweet warm scents, but I started feeling like</li>
            <li>I ordered this after smelling this scent in a store,  It is rather sweet and stays on nicely throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I liked the cotton candy smell , I will be using it, still it is  a bit to sweet for my taste</li>
            <li>Its a nice change from the original Pink which is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>However, I think the issue is more with how strong it is</li>
            <li>I still wear both Pink Sugar scents, but I love the Sensual one the best!</li>
            <li>but to each there own right</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s honestly just right in all of those departments.</li>
            <li>The original and choco lovers is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I though how wonderful to have the grown up version of pink sugar!  </li>
            <li>smells better than the original.</li>
            <li>This product smells more like alcohol than what a sweet perfume should smell like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but sexy.  </li>
            <li>It has a sweet but sexy scent.  </li>
            <li>This scent is sexy and sweet.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li>I still love the orginal Pink Sugar better, but this one is nice too!</li>
            <li>it actually gives me a headache - but the Sensual is great.  </li>
            <li>It smells like cotton candy, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not for everyone, but it makes me smile to wear it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just for fun and most wearable in the winter.</li>
            <li>It might just have something to do with how this reacts with my body chemistry, but I really enjoy both of these fragrances.</li>
            <li>The smell lasts me the entire day and blends great with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being fruity and light</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being fruity and light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, not too sweet-</li>
            <li>IT HAS A VERY FRESH AND CLEN SMELL</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering and has a very clean and fresh smell....</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the original, like I do, then I would encourage you to stick with that.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be a nice scent to wear in the evening, a more sophisticated Pink Sugar</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would just be sort of a toned-down sweetness version of the original.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to get this scent....</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if this isn&#x27;t unique what is the point in buying it?</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if this isn&#x27;t unique what is the point in buying it?</li>
            <li>It is fun, fresh, light-hearted and irresistibly sweet.  </li>
            <li>Also goes great with the Pink Sugar hair perfume.</li>
            <li>and you like sweet smelling fragrances.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I read reviews stating that it was a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Very sensual and sexy without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is such a good scent.  </li>
            <li>Still sweet.</li>
            <li>Sweet scent</li>
            <li>I would recommend to someone who likes sweet scents (smells like cotton candy)  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only good thing about this purchase</li>
            <li>Sweet, but not to the point of being sticky and sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t detect a hint of the bergamot, but the note of tiare flower is sweet and creamy and adds to the vanilla which seeps up from the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a bad one, I just like the super sweet smells and</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and it was well packed.</li>
            <li>Got it quickly..</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t especially high dollar</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d like a scent more than Pink Sugar original, but this is even better.</li>
            <li>the light florals mean you can safely wear it to work; It may not be the most sophisticated choice for work, but I&#x27;ve received loads of compliments on it.</li>
            <li>This version is much more subtle and is probably more suited for everyday wear and the original is best for nights out/parties.</li>
            <li>I love the regular Pink Sugar.....and this one smells great as well.....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>The fragrance is more for the young at heart,age has nothing to do with</li>
            <li>This is a more mature twist and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, I do like it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy light sweet, fruity scents (like VS Love Spell or BBW Sweet Pea) rather than heavy floral or &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; fragrances.</li>
            <li>It just smells so sweet and pretty.  </li>
            <li>When I realized it, I figured I&#x27;d go ahead and give it a try since I like the original so much.</li>
            <li>I have the original pink sugar and loved the playful sweet smell, but it&#x27;s not exactly a &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; appropriate perfume.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite out of the Pink Sugars, sweet but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>However, I still think I like the original just a little bit more!</li>
            <li>Sweet and soft, but not overly sweet.</li>
            <li>It smelled very cheap and the scent was actually nauseating!</li>
            <li>I like the Original Pink Sugar much better..</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d try this perfume because I LOVE the original Pink Sugar and have gotten tons of compliments.  </li>
            <li>Which is funny because I LOVE PINK SUGAR, the original.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m such a fan of the original Pink Sugar - I thought for sure I&#x27;d love this one too.</li>
            <li>This was actually a reorder for me, for Christmas!! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what the name describes-</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend not using more than one pump when spraying.</li>
            <li>this for a romantic dinner or dessert,perhaps you are feeling a bit flirty :)</li>
            <li>Wish I would have gotten it there in the first place.</li>
            <li>Lasts for about 6 hours on my skin, is super affordable, and smells crazy delicious</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing the original Pink Sugar for over 6 years and thought I&#x27;d give Pink Sugar Sensual a try after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>My wife didn&#x27;t like wearing the original pink sugar every day because it was too sweet; this has a hint of sweet without being too much for her.</li>
            <li>but it draws more positive comments than anything I&#x27;ve worn in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be using it for dressed-up or evening occassions, but it&#x27;s not so strong that it would be inappropriate for the workplace.</li>
            <li>It has a lighter and just as sweet fragrance as the original Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>Its a nice scent, but a little too musky.</li>
            <li>This is nice, almost a little lemon vanilla after note.  </li>
            <li>FAST shipping.</li>
            <li>BUt this one not so much.  </li>
            <li>And a really slobbery lick at that.  </li>
            <li>so I figured it wasn&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li>Very yummy and candy</li>
            <li>Also, the scent does not stay on very well.  </li>
            <li>I loved the original Pink Sugar although it was a little heady.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a spicy turn of the original Pink Sugar, and makes great for late evening dates.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments from this perfume than any other I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this by mistake after I ran out of the original.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really long lasting - it&#x27;s just as good as the original Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a sexier scent, this is very flowery and sweet, still lovely,still like it, but I personally think it doesnt do justice to the word sensual...</li>
            <li>Well this is a true example that not everyones sense of smell is the same.</li>
            <li>In fact the only real difference is that Fantasy is heavier and contains a few more sweet and cake</li>
            <li>In fact the only real difference is that Fantasy is heavier and contains a few more sweet and cake</li>
            <li>If you love Pink Sugar and want to try one within the same family, with just a little more \\&quot;spice,\\&quot; give this a try!</li>
            <li>Pink sugar sensual is such an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>Called Amazon to complain and they quickly refunded my money back.  </li>
            <li>; version of my favorite cotton candy perfume, it just doesn&#x27;t give me the same comforting feeling as my first purchase of Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of Pink Sugar, really love it!</li>
            <li>A little more grown up maybe?</li>
            <li>but it has a little more musk smell to it.</li>
            <li>the regular one is still my first choice!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this scent - and am surprised, as I am a HUGE Pink Sugar fan.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Pink Sugar fan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so much a fan of Pink Sugar - it is SO sugary sweet</li>
            <li>I love the original Pink Sugar, but I found Sensual a few years ago and it has become harder to find in stores... fantastic price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The long note of vanilla and the berries linger from the softly floral heart and carry through to the base, giving PINK SUAR SENSUAL a lovely warmth that whispers \\&quot;come closer\\&quot; to passers by - making this perfect for people who work in public based settings as you&#x27;ll seem even more approachable.</li>
            <li>the original Pink Sugar fits the bill to a T.</li>
            <li>the original Pink Sugar was just a tad too little-girly for me.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of the original Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li>I have had regular Pink Sugar for years and love it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a sweet-scent fan and you like other Pink Sugar products, odds are you&#x27;ll love Sensual as well!</li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;ll still wear this on occasion, it&#x27;s back to the original for daily wear for me.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT FIRST BLUE SUGAR</li>
            <li>Pink sugar&#x27;s sweet scent is playful and sophisticate.</li>
            <li>it has the sweet warm base smell that Aquolina&#x27;s known for, but it&#x27;s more complex than the original.</li>
            <li>Not only is it long wearing, but it&#x27;s also light and non-sickly.</li>
            <li>Not only is it long wearing, but it&#x27;s also light and non-sickly.</li>
            <li>This is a signature scent- light and floral but not sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>This has a deeper, slightly heavier fragrance than the original, if that makes scense...</li>
            <li>It has a familiar scent like something I may have previously worn.  </li>
            <li>I personally think it&#x27;s too quiet and not unique enough for evening wear, but if you plan on hitting a packed club then the fragrance&#x27;s lightness could be good for avoiding scent-induced headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, not too light, and lingers throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>My young son gets a kick out of it too.  </li>
            <li>I find that I&#x27;m using 2 or 3 times as much and by mid-day there isn&#x27;t much left on me....</li>
            <li>The currants are stronger on me, but the tangerine note is still well developed.</li>
            <li>It has a bergamot/citronella top note that just won&#x27;t dry down to anything else.</li>
            <li>It smells a little sweet but has a &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34; scent also.</li>
            <li>It was just for myself, new and unused, and at the price, entirely acceptable.</li>
            <li>It is less sweet than the regular Pink Sugar but still has a nice dry down leaving those vanilla tones.</li>
            <li>the original pink sugar is the winner!!!!</li>
            <li>The scent stays on all day and it is a little more grown up than the other one.</li>
            <li>But smelling almost identical to Fantasy makes Sensual not very creative or unique, which is why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The only unexpected thing about the order of the 3.4 oz size was that it was a tester.  </li>
            <li>The dry down is a bit more like Pink Sugar, but I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>I have the original pink sugar, and while I like it, it dries down to a burnt smell on me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that black sugar contains molasses and I was keen to see how it&#x27;d be represented in a EDT, but between the vanilla, berries and softly creamy sandalwood, I can&#x27;t separate any other sweet notes used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This scent is not very sweet, so if sweet is what you seek, stick with the regular Pink Sugar perfume.</li>
            <li>If original Pink Sugar is a 12-yr old girl in a pink tutu, this is a 25-yr old woman in a classy little black dress.</li>
            <li>my wife purchased this as a sampler from another source last November 2013, tried to find it locally, but the cost was too much, found it on Amazon for much less and loves the fragrance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little like fantasy, but has a more complex scent.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li> It smells awesome and is good for evening wear or for a date!</li>
            <li> PACKAGED BEAUTIFULLY</li>
            <li> AT A GREAT  PRICE,</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> She had pinned it on Pinterest and was happy to receive it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!!</li>
            <li> And I love it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very nice cotton candy scent to it.</li>
            <li> While it smells good, it smells like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL LIGHT FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li> Good smell for summer.</li>
            <li> GOod price though.</li>
            <li> I got a 1 oz bottle of this because of good reviews.</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume in Sephora and loved it and decided to order it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> - you smell so good.</li>
            <li> The price was good, though.</li>
            <li> I saw reviews for Sensual were almost as good</li>
            <li> fruitiness makes this a good choice for daytime and</li>
            <li> then the fragrance&#x27;s lightness could be good for avoiding scent-induced headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> GREAT deal on my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Great product, my wife love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent!</li>
            <li> Love the Scent!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> This is nothing like I expected-not spicy or sophisticated at all!</li>
            <li> I just love this smell!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I will for sure wear this, but nothing compared to the orginal!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!  </li>
            <li> Also nice for day or night.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a nice cotton-candy scent, start here.</li>
            <li> I SMELL NICE</li>
            <li> Kind of musky to be honest.</li>
            <li> Regardless, it was a great price and it came quickly, I just don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> Unless this was a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34;, this scent is best suited for young men.</li>
            <li> Great price for a perfume well worth more.</li>
            <li> Seriously sexy scent.</li>
            <li> Men and women of all ages love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance &amp; ordered and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I also have chocolovers which is delicious, so I felt it necessary to try PS Sensual!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more sophisticated</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li> I already love this one; it is my signature fragrance.  </li>
            <li> not my favorite..</li>
            <li> Overall a great scent, thats why I rate it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> If anyone else has tried that, I&#x27;d love to know how it worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, and always will.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla tones.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Although this smells more like the &amp;#34;grown</li>
            <li> This is one of my many favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I have also used the hair perfume which has captured many people&#x27;s compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is ok.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the Sensual is a better pm fragrance though.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this one though.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is sexy.</li>
            <li> more please.</li>
            <li> I class this as being better suited to spring/summer</li>
            <li> I class this as being better suited to spring/summer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great day wear and a good smell for being young and sweet.</li>
            <li> I own the original as well as Gold Sugar and PS Sparks, so I just had to purchase Sensual when I seen it.</li>
            <li> It is not as sweet as PS, and I also think that it smells more perfumey than the orginal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of sweet warm scents, but I started feeling like</li>
            <li> I ordered this after smelling this scent in a store,  It is rather sweet and stays on nicely throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I liked the cotton candy smell , I will be using it, still it is  a bit to sweet for my taste</li>
            <li> Its a nice change from the original Pink which is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> However, I think the issue is more with how strong it is</li>
            <li> I still wear both Pink Sugar scents, but I love the Sensual one the best!</li>
            <li> but to each there own right</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s honestly just right in all of those departments.</li>
            <li> The original and choco lovers is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I though how wonderful to have the grown up version of pink sugar!  </li>
            <li> smells better than the original.</li>
            <li> This product smells more like alcohol than what a sweet perfume should smell like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet but sexy.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet but sexy scent.  </li>
            <li> This scent is sexy and sweet.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li> I still love the orginal Pink Sugar better, but this one is nice too!</li>
            <li> it actually gives me a headache - but the Sensual is great.  </li>
            <li> It smells like cotton candy, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not for everyone, but it makes me smile to wear it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just for fun and most wearable in the winter.</li>
            <li> It might just have something to do with how this reacts with my body chemistry, but I really enjoy both of these fragrances.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts me the entire day and blends great with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being fruity and light</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being fruity and light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong, not too sweet-</li>
            <li> IT HAS A VERY FRESH AND CLEN SMELL</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering and has a very clean and fresh smell....</li>
            <li> If you enjoy the original, like I do, then I would encourage you to stick with that.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a nice scent to wear in the evening, a more sophisticated Pink Sugar</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would just be sort of a toned-down sweetness version of the original.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to get this scent....</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if this isn&#x27;t unique what is the point in buying it?</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if this isn&#x27;t unique what is the point in buying it?</li>
            <li> It is fun, fresh, light-hearted and irresistibly sweet.  </li>
            <li> Also goes great with the Pink Sugar hair perfume.</li>
            <li> and you like sweet smelling fragrances.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I read reviews stating that it was a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Very sensual and sexy without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This is such a good scent.  </li>
            <li> Still sweet.</li>
            <li> Sweet scent</li>
            <li> I would recommend to someone who likes sweet scents (smells like cotton candy)  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only good thing about this purchase</li>
            <li> Sweet, but not to the point of being sticky and sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t detect a hint of the bergamot, but the note of tiare flower is sweet and creamy and adds to the vanilla which seeps up from the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a bad one, I just like the super sweet smells and</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and it was well packed.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly..</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t especially high dollar</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d like a scent more than Pink Sugar original, but this is even better.</li>
            <li> the light florals mean you can safely wear it to work; It may not be the most sophisticated choice for work, but I&#x27;ve received loads of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This version is much more subtle and is probably more suited for everyday wear and the original is best for nights out/parties.</li>
            <li> I love the regular Pink Sugar.....and this one smells great as well.....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> The fragrance is more for the young at heart,age has nothing to do with</li>
            <li> This is a more mature twist and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, I do like it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy light sweet, fruity scents (like VS Love Spell or BBW Sweet Pea) rather than heavy floral or &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; fragrances.</li>
            <li> It just smells so sweet and pretty.  </li>
            <li> When I realized it, I figured I&#x27;d go ahead and give it a try since I like the original so much.</li>
            <li> I have the original pink sugar and loved the playful sweet smell, but it&#x27;s not exactly a &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; appropriate perfume.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite out of the Pink Sugars, sweet but not too sweet.</li>
            <li> However, I still think I like the original just a little bit more!</li>
            <li> Sweet and soft, but not overly sweet.</li>
            <li> It smelled very cheap and the scent was actually nauseating!</li>
            <li> I like the Original Pink Sugar much better..</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try this perfume because I LOVE the original Pink Sugar and have gotten tons of compliments.  </li>
            <li> Which is funny because I LOVE PINK SUGAR, the original.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a fan of the original Pink Sugar - I thought for sure I&#x27;d love this one too.</li>
            <li> This was actually a reorder for me, for Christmas!! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what the name describes-</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend not using more than one pump when spraying.</li>
            <li> this for a romantic dinner or dessert,perhaps you are feeling a bit flirty :)</li>
            <li> Wish I would have gotten it there in the first place.</li>
            <li> Lasts for about 6 hours on my skin, is super affordable, and smells crazy delicious</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the original Pink Sugar for over 6 years and thought I&#x27;d give Pink Sugar Sensual a try after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like wearing the original pink sugar every day because it was too sweet; this has a hint of sweet without being too much for her.</li>
            <li> but it draws more positive comments than anything I&#x27;ve worn in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be using it for dressed-up or evening occassions, but it&#x27;s not so strong that it would be inappropriate for the workplace.</li>
            <li> It has a lighter and just as sweet fragrance as the original Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> Its a nice scent, but a little too musky.</li>
            <li> This is nice, almost a little lemon vanilla after note.  </li>
            <li> FAST shipping.</li>
            <li> BUt this one not so much.  </li>
            <li> And a really slobbery lick at that.  </li>
            <li> so I figured it wasn&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li> Very yummy and candy</li>
            <li> Also, the scent does not stay on very well.  </li>
            <li> I loved the original Pink Sugar although it was a little heady.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spicy turn of the original Pink Sugar, and makes great for late evening dates.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments from this perfume than any other I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this by mistake after I ran out of the original.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really long lasting - it&#x27;s just as good as the original Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a sexier scent, this is very flowery and sweet, still lovely,still like it, but I personally think it doesnt do justice to the word sensual...</li>
            <li> Well this is a true example that not everyones sense of smell is the same.</li>
            <li> In fact the only real difference is that Fantasy is heavier and contains a few more sweet and cake</li>
            <li> In fact the only real difference is that Fantasy is heavier and contains a few more sweet and cake</li>
            <li> If you love Pink Sugar and want to try one within the same family, with just a little more \\&quot;spice,\\&quot; give this a try!</li>
            <li> Pink sugar sensual is such an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> Called Amazon to complain and they quickly refunded my money back.  </li>
            <li> ; version of my favorite cotton candy perfume, it just doesn&#x27;t give me the same comforting feeling as my first purchase of Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Pink Sugar, really love it!</li>
            <li> A little more grown up maybe?</li>
            <li> but it has a little more musk smell to it.</li>
            <li> the regular one is still my first choice!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this scent - and am surprised, as I am a HUGE Pink Sugar fan.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Pink Sugar fan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so much a fan of Pink Sugar - it is SO sugary sweet</li>
            <li> I love the original Pink Sugar, but I found Sensual a few years ago and it has become harder to find in stores... fantastic price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The long note of vanilla and the berries linger from the softly floral heart and carry through to the base, giving PINK SUAR SENSUAL a lovely warmth that whispers \\&quot;come closer\\&quot; to passers by - making this perfect for people who work in public based settings as you&#x27;ll seem even more approachable.</li>
            <li> the original Pink Sugar fits the bill to a T.</li>
            <li> the original Pink Sugar was just a tad too little-girly for me.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the original Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li> I have had regular Pink Sugar for years and love it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a sweet-scent fan and you like other Pink Sugar products, odds are you&#x27;ll love Sensual as well!</li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;ll still wear this on occasion, it&#x27;s back to the original for daily wear for me.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT FIRST BLUE SUGAR</li>
            <li> Pink sugar&#x27;s sweet scent is playful and sophisticate.</li>
            <li> it has the sweet warm base smell that Aquolina&#x27;s known for, but it&#x27;s more complex than the original.</li>
            <li> Not only is it long wearing, but it&#x27;s also light and non-sickly.</li>
            <li> Not only is it long wearing, but it&#x27;s also light and non-sickly.</li>
            <li> This is a signature scent- light and floral but not sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> This has a deeper, slightly heavier fragrance than the original, if that makes scense...</li>
            <li> It has a familiar scent like something I may have previously worn.  </li>
            <li> I personally think it&#x27;s too quiet and not unique enough for evening wear, but if you plan on hitting a packed club then the fragrance&#x27;s lightness could be good for avoiding scent-induced headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, not too light, and lingers throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> My young son gets a kick out of it too.  </li>
            <li> I find that I&#x27;m using 2 or 3 times as much and by mid-day there isn&#x27;t much left on me....</li>
            <li> The currants are stronger on me, but the tangerine note is still well developed.</li>
            <li> It has a bergamot/citronella top note that just won&#x27;t dry down to anything else.</li>
            <li> It smells a little sweet but has a &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34; scent also.</li>
            <li> It was just for myself, new and unused, and at the price, entirely acceptable.</li>
            <li> It is less sweet than the regular Pink Sugar but still has a nice dry down leaving those vanilla tones.</li>
            <li> the original pink sugar is the winner!!!!</li>
            <li> The scent stays on all day and it is a little more grown up than the other one.</li>
            <li> But smelling almost identical to Fantasy makes Sensual not very creative or unique, which is why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The only unexpected thing about the order of the 3.4 oz size was that it was a tester.  </li>
            <li> The dry down is a bit more like Pink Sugar, but I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> I have the original pink sugar, and while I like it, it dries down to a burnt smell on me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that black sugar contains molasses and I was keen to see how it&#x27;d be represented in a EDT, but between the vanilla, berries and softly creamy sandalwood, I can&#x27;t separate any other sweet notes used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This scent is not very sweet, so if sweet is what you seek, stick with the regular Pink Sugar perfume.</li>
            <li> If original Pink Sugar is a 12-yr old girl in a pink tutu, this is a 25-yr old woman in a classy little black dress.</li>
            <li> my wife purchased this as a sampler from another source last November 2013, tried to find it locally, but the cost was too much, found it on Amazon for much less and loves the fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little like fantasy, but has a more complex scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sweet for me and a little tiny bit, goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The perfume lasts long enough so that you might only have to spray yourself twice throughout the day.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it isn&#x27;t my new favorite scent either.</li>
            <li> ; For such a sweet fragrance it isn&#x27;t sickly or cloying, even in hot weather.</li>
            <li> ; For such a sweet fragrance it isn&#x27;t sickly or cloying, even in hot weather.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Been wearing Pink Sugar for ages and this is NOT the same company, it smells like alcohol and made my skin itchy and red DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> The floral notes are powdery and light and the juicy sweetness of the berries make everything seem breezy, laid back and casual.</li>
            <li> this isnt my favorite scent, i usually where the original pink sugar and thought id go for something sexier and this one well seems a little peppery in scent i know that sounds tad weird but its spicy smelling</li>
            <li> Smells like I lathered myself in cupcakes.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely more mature than Pink Sugar but not in a bad way!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Having said that I do wear mine all year round and have never suffered ill effects and the scent doesn&#x27;t change in different weather, which many fragrances do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having said that I do wear mine all year round and have never suffered ill effects and the scent doesn&#x27;t change in different weather, which many fragrances do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is definitely like the grown up version of Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar to the Pink Sugar</li>
            <li> I prefer sensual over the pink and white version.</li>
            <li> Stick with the regular Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular Pink Sugar for years and wanted to try the Sensual.</li>
            <li> Like Pink Sugar plus a deep floral scent, maybe vanilla too.</li>
            <li> Round this off with the fact that the individual notes don&#x27;t develop differently during different seasons</li>
            <li> Round this off with the fact that the individual notes don&#x27;t develop differently during different seasons</li>
            <li> Well, the smell is slightly different, nothing dramatic just a slightly heavier version of the original.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too sugary as the regular pink sugar, but is just as scrumptious!</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it smells a lot like Britney&#x27;s Fantasy, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing at all because I love that scent.</li>
            <li> Weird but true.  </li>
            <li> I tried to give it to him, but he won&#x27;t wear anything called Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> I wear Pink Sugar all the time, but had never smelled this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Pink Sugar addict.</li>
            <li> I use Pink Sugar and was hesitant to try this.</li>
            <li> I wear it in the evening and still wear my pink sugar during the day.</li>
            <li> Think of it as a grown-up version of Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> MAYBE I WILL LIKE THE PINK SUGAR.</li>
            <li> Even the pink sugar does not have the Aquolina name on it.</li>
            <li> I have this as well as the just the pink sugar.</li>
            <li> This to me is a grown up version of Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar does.  </li>
            <li> PINK SUGAR SENSUAL opens with fruity scents of currants and tangerine.</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s other scent Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely stick with the originial Pink Sugar!!!!</li>
            <li> The lasting power is unbelievable for a mass-market EDT.</li>
            <li> The lasting power is unbelievable for a mass-market EDT.</li>
            <li> I like both these and will wait a year or so to get Pink Sugar Sparks, when the price comes down.  </li>
            <li> I mean that when I spray one of each on each wrist I can barely tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I mean that when I spray one of each on each wrist I can barely tell the difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Official scent notes; Black currant, tangerine, bergamot, orange blossom, pink jasmine, tiare flower, vanilla, black sugar and sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Pink Sugar before, and was anxious to try Pink Sugar Sensual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SHE WROTE IT DOWN.</li>
            <li> But all is not lost: I spray the insides of sneakers and other shoes with it, I spray the insides of closets with it, even a little bit on my rugs...</li>
            <li> I have been addicted to the regular pink sugar for 6 years now, and I decided to give this one a try...</li>
            <li> To me, smells predominantly of vanilla, cherry and black licorice.</li>
            <li> just a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real pink sugar!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The initial fruity blast burns down with ten minutes, but a undertone of the currants [and possibly raspberry too] lingers throughout the heart and base of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S ONE OF THE FEW</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s fake, maybe an old batch?  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t spray it on myself, although I am tempted to spray myself and go outdoors just to see if it will repel mosquitos because it really does dry down to what smells like a citronella base.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first; PINK SUGAR SENSUAL smells startlingly close to Britney Spears Fantasy - and by startlingly close</li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first; PINK SUGAR SENSUAL smells startlingly close to Britney Spears Fantasy - and by startlingly close</li>
            <li> When I got the bottle, needless to say, did not smell the same</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> It made my fiance uncomfortable because when I put it on, I smelled like man.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong if you purchase it</li>
            <li> I ordered this blindly, having never smelled it.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this one for a change, but I just got it today and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely  terrible!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite out of the Pink Sugars, sweet but not too sweet. A little more grown up maybe?</li>
            <li> I have had regular Pink Sugar for years and love it. I thought I&#x27;d try this one for a change, but I just got it today and was very disappointed. While it smells good, it smells like men&#x27;s cologne. It made my fiance uncomfortable because when I put it on, I smelled like man. I tried to give it to him, but he won&#x27;t wear anything called Pink Sugar. Regardless, it was a great price and it came quickly, I just don&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent! It has a lighter and just as sweet fragrance as the original Pink Sugar. The scent stays on all day and it is a little more grown up than the other one. I still wear both Pink Sugar scents, but I love the Sensual one the best! You won&#x27;t go wrong if you purchase it and you like sweet smelling fragrances.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I read reviews stating that it was a sweet smell. Well this is a true example that not everyones sense of smell is the same. This product smells more like alcohol than what a sweet perfume should smell like. Now I can&#x27;t even give it away because my friends don&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> If you love Pink Sugar and want to try one within the same family, with just a little more \\&quot;spice,\\&quot; give this a try! It is definitely like the grown up version of Pink Sugar. I get more compliments from this perfume than any other I&#x27;ve ever worn. And with a price in the $20 range, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever try another. Seriously sexy scent. Also goes great with the Pink Sugar hair perfume. You just smell yummy!</li>
            <li> Love the Scent! It smells awesome and is good for evening wear or for a date! It smells a little sweet but has a &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34; scent also.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this every time I wear it and I am a perfume lover, wearing all sorts of high-dollar perfume.  This isn&#x27;t especially high dollar but it draws more positive comments than anything I&#x27;ve worn in a long time.  I&#x27;m not so much a fan of Pink Sugar - it is SO sugary sweet it actually gives me a headache - but the Sensual is great.  Men and women of all ages love this stuff.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, not too light, and lingers throughout the day.  Also nice for day or night.</li>
            <li> It just came in the mail today. I used Pink Sugar before, and was anxious to try Pink Sugar Sensual.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice cotton candy scent to it. Smells like I lathered myself in cupcakes.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely more mature than Pink Sugar but not in a bad way!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a nice cotton-candy scent, start here.</li>
            <li> I was uncertain if I would like this perfume.  I wear Pink Sugar all the time, but had never smelled this one.  I took a chance &amp; ordered and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have the original pink sugar, and while I like it, it dries down to a burnt smell on me.  I also have chocolovers which is delicious, so I felt it necessary to try PS Sensual!  It&#x27;s much more sophisticated and I love it!  I get compliments every time I wear it!  It&#x27;s a little like fantasy, but has a more complex scent.  It&#x27;s sweet but sexy.  My hubby loves it!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL LIGHT FRAGRANCE AT A GREAT  PRICE, PACKAGED BEAUTIFULLY; I WOULD  RECOMMEND IT; IT&#x27;S ONE OF THE FEW I CAN ACTUALLY SMELL ONCE IT&#x27;S ON;</li>
            <li> Do not order this!!! It smells absolutely  terrible!!! It&#x27;s not the real pink sugar! Not worth it at all!!!!! I wonder why amazon would sell this on their site???</li>
            <li> Good smell for summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the original Pink Sugar for over 6 years and thought I&#x27;d give Pink Sugar Sensual a try after reading all the great reviews. Thought it would be a nice scent to wear in the evening, a more sophisticated Pink Sugar ---- I was so disappointed!  This is nothing like I expected-not spicy or sophisticated at all! It smelled very cheap and the scent was actually nauseating! I&#x27;ll definitely stick with the originial Pink Sugar!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT deal on my favorite scent. I love the original Pink Sugar, but I found Sensual a few years ago and it has become harder to find in stores... fantastic price. FAST shipping. Perfect purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a signature scent- light and floral but not sickly sweet. I get compliments all the time when I wear it. Not over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a fan of the original Pink Sugar - I thought for sure I&#x27;d love this one too. While it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it isn&#x27;t my new favorite scent either. I was hoping it would just be sort of a toned-down sweetness version of the original. It isn&#x27;t on me - it&#x27;s a completely different smell. Not a bad one, I just like the super sweet smells and the original Pink Sugar fits the bill to a T. So while I&#x27;ll still wear this on occasion, it&#x27;s back to the original for daily wear for me.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It has a sweet but sexy scent.  My boyfriend actually loves the smell also. Trust me it&#x27;s worth it and it last all day.</li>
            <li> I love the regular Pink Sugar.....and this one smells great as well.....It is not overpowering and has a very clean and fresh smell....I get compliments all of the time.</li>
            <li> this isnt my favorite scent, i usually where the original pink sugar and thought id go for something sexier and this one well seems a little peppery in scent i know that sounds tad weird but its spicy smelling i wasnt a fan but to each there own right</li>
            <li> I already love this one; it is my signature fragrance.  This was actually a reorder for me, for Christmas!! :)</li>
            <li> I like the Original Pink Sugar much better..&lt;br /&gt;There is just something about this one I don&#x27;t like..&lt;br /&gt;I will still wear it for alil change occasionally..&lt;br /&gt;Just not my favorite..</li>
            <li> Been wearing Pink Sugar for ages and this is NOT the same company, it smells like alcohol and made my skin itchy and red DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I just love this smell! Can&#x27;t get enough of it!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Pink sugar sensual is such an amazing scent. Can be worn day or night.  It smells like spun sugar with just a hint of spice.  Very sensual and sexy without being overpowering.  Love it!  Delivery was quick and it was well packed.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> I have been addicted to the regular pink sugar for 6 years now, and I decided to give this one a try... I was expecting a sexier scent, this is very flowery and sweet, still lovely,still like it, but I personally think it doesnt do justice to the word sensual... the original pink sugar is the winner!!!! Overall a great scent, thats why I rate it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Pink Sugar addict. I own the original as well as Gold Sugar and PS Sparks, so I just had to purchase Sensual when I seen it. Personally, I think it smells a lot like Britney&#x27;s Fantasy, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing at all because I love that scent. But smelling almost identical to Fantasy makes Sensual not very creative or unique, which is why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Lasts for about 6 hours on my skin, is super affordable, and smells crazy delicious so I&#x27;m still happy with this purchase.  If you&#x27;re a sweet-scent fan and you like other Pink Sugar products, odds are you&#x27;ll love Sensual as well!</li>
            <li> This product is no longer formulated as a women&#x27;s scent. Unless this was a &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34;, this scent is best suited for young men. It has a bergamot/citronella top note that just won&#x27;t dry down to anything else. Amazon should maybe check with Aquolina or Selectiva S.p.A, it&#x27;s parent company in Italy, to see what the story is. But all is not lost: I spray the insides of sneakers and other shoes with it, I spray the insides of closets with it, even a little bit on my rugs...just a little. I just don&#x27;t spray it on myself, although I am tempted to spray myself and go outdoors just to see if it will repel mosquitos because it really does dry down to what smells like a citronella base. If anyone else has tried that, I&#x27;d love to know how it worked.</li>
            <li> I use Pink Sugar and was hesitant to try this. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It&#x27;s very similar to the Pink Sugar but it has a little more musk smell to it. I wear it in the evening and still wear my pink sugar during the day.</li>
            <li> Purchased after receiving a sample from a local store. It smells like cotton candy, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not for everyone, but it makes me smile to wear it.  My young son gets a kick out of it too.  It&#x27;s just for fun and most wearable in the winter.</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE A WOMEN THAT LOVES COMPLIMENTS THIS IS A FRAGERANCE YOU MUST TRY.  IT HAS A VERY FRESH AND CLEN SMELL AND YOU WILL RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS FROM BOTH MEN AND WOEN!</li>
            <li> Great product, my wife love it.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this scent - and am surprised, as I am a HUGE Pink Sugar fan. This scent is not very sweet, so if sweet is what you seek, stick with the regular Pink Sugar perfume.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a staple for me.  It is fun, fresh, light-hearted and irresistibly sweet.  I have bought it 3 times.  I prefer sensual over the pink and white version.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, and always will. It&#x27;s a spicy turn of the original Pink Sugar, and makes great for late evening dates. It&#x27;s not too strong, not too sweet- it&#x27;s honestly just right in all of those departments.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and very long lasting. Sweet and soft, but not overly sweet. To me, smells predominantly of vanilla, cherry and black licorice. Some people say it smells like cookies or donuts.</li>
            <li> This is such a good scent.  I smell delicious!  I love the vanilla tones.  It&#x27;s a great day wear and a good smell for being young and sweet.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this perfume and the size of the bottle!!! I am a huge Pink Sugar fan so I was excited to get this scent....I still love the orginal Pink Sugar better, but this one is nice too! It is not as sweet as PS, and I also think that it smells more perfumey than the orginal! I will for sure wear this, but nothing compared to the orginal!</li>
            <li> Love this. Its a nice change from the original Pink which is WONDERFUL. This has a deeper, slightly heavier fragrance than the original, if that makes scense... Still sweet. Still delicious. Definately recommend.</li>
            <li> Which is funny because I LOVE PINK SUGAR, the original.  BUt this one not so much.  GOod price though. one word</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like wearing the original pink sugar every day because it was too sweet; this has a hint of sweet without being too much for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of sweet warm scents, but I started feeling like the original Pink Sugar was just a tad too little-girly for me. I ordered this blindly, having never smelled it. It&#x27;s exactly what the name describes- it has the sweet warm base smell that Aquolina&#x27;s known for, but it&#x27;s more complex than the original. Think of it as a grown-up version of Pink Sugar. If original Pink Sugar is a 12-yr old girl in a pink tutu, this is a 25-yr old woman in a classy little black dress. I&#x27;ll definitely be using it for dressed-up or evening occassions, but it&#x27;s not so strong that it would be inappropriate for the workplace.</li>
            <li> I got a 1 oz bottle of this because of good reviews. It&#x27;s heavenly!  The dry down is a bit more like Pink Sugar, but I don&#x27;t mind I like both these and will wait a year or so to get Pink Sugar Sparks, when the price comes down.  The only unexpected thing about the order of the 3.4 oz size was that it was a tester.  It was just for myself, new and unused, and at the price, entirely acceptable.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!! I GET TONS OF COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME WHERE EVER I AM AT. I EVEN GET THEM AT THEM GYM AFTER WORKING OUT IMAGIME THE GYM AFTER SWEATING!!!! THAT I SMELL NICE AND WHAT ARE YOU WHEREIN ALL THE TIME!&lt;br /&gt;MY DR LIKES IT AND NOW HIS NURSE HAS ASKED ME THE LAST 2 TIMES WHAT I WAS WEARING THIS LAST TIME SHE WROTE IT DOWN. I BOUGHT FIRST BLUE SUGAR FOR MY HUSBAND I LIKE IT THOUGHT IF I LIKE IT MAYBE I WILL LIKE THE PINK SUGAR. THEN I BOUGHT THE PING SUGAR SENSUAL  OH MY GOODNESS I WAS LIKE WOWWWWW AND HAVE BEEN HOOKED!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  When I asked her what to say in this review her response was:  Great!  Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> Got it quickly.. And I love it!!</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Pink Sugar, really love it! thought I would try something new.  I am not as impressed with this fragrance would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Its a nice scent, but a little too musky. However, I think the issue is more with how strong it is and I would definitely recommend not using more than one pump when spraying.</li>
            <li> My friend loves this perfume and the price and size of bottle was great! She had pinned it on Pinterest and was happy to receive it.</li>
            <li> This perfume just makes me want to scoop up my wife and lick her neck like an ice cream cone.  Weird but true.  And a really slobbery lick at that.  Heheh.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the original Pink Sugar. Read the reviews on this so figured I would give it a shot. I love it! I will definitley be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> This line is not the same company, comes on like alcohol don&#x27;t buy.  Even the pink sugar does not have the Aquolina name on it.</li>
            <li> Stick with the regular Pink Sugar. Although this smells more like the &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; version of my favorite cotton candy perfume, it just doesn&#x27;t give me the same comforting feeling as my first purchase of Pink Sugar. Kind of musky to be honest.</li>
            <li> This is one of my many favorite scents.The fragrance is more for the young at heart,age has nothing to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;It is alluring to the opposite sex, yet women have also shared with me ,&amp;#34;You smell yummy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; Sweet scent like it&#x27;s other scent Pink Sugar. I have also used the hair perfume which has captured many people&#x27;s compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t over wear/outwear any perfumes,I switch it up in order to appreciate each fragrances that captures my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear this for a romantic dinner or dessert,perhaps you are feeling a bit flirty :)</li>
            <li> This is ok.  It&#x27;s a little sweet for me and a little tiny bit, goes a long way.  Use sparingly!  My husband hates the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after smelling this scent in a store,  It is rather sweet and stays on nicely throughout the day. I would recommend to someone who likes sweet scents (smells like cotton candy)  The cologne arrives well packaged and in at timely manner.</li>
            <li> This scent is sexy and sweet. My husband compliments me everytime I wear it. Great price for a perfume well worth more.</li>
            <li> This is nice, almost a little lemon vanilla after note.  The price was unbeatable after researching and wanting this for the last year.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. Found it at Nordstrom rack for $9.99, though. Wish I would have gotten it there in the first place.</li>
            <li> I loved the original Pink Sugar although it was a little heady.  This version is much more subtle and is probably more suited for everyday wear and the original is best for nights out/parties.</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume in Sephora and loved it and decided to order it on Amazon.  When I got the bottle, needless to say, did not smell the same so I figured it wasn&#x27;t real.  Called Amazon to complain and they quickly refunded my money back.  That&#x27;s the only good thing about this purchase is that I got my money back.  Maybe it&#x27;s fake, maybe an old batch?  Who knows but all I know is it is not the same as the one in Dept stores.</li>
            <li> my wife purchased this as a sampler from another source last November 2013, tried to find it locally, but the cost was too much, found it on Amazon for much less and loves the fragrance and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;Almost intoxicating... Thank you</li>
            <li> Pink sugar&#x27;s sweet scent is playful and sophisticate. The perfume lasts long enough so that you might only have to spray yourself twice throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The original and choco lovers is my favorite. Very yummy and candy like.. This is a more mature twist and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, I do like it.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular Pink Sugar for years and wanted to try the Sensual. It is less sweet than the regular Pink Sugar but still has a nice dry down leaving those vanilla tones. It might just have something to do with how this reacts with my body chemistry, but I really enjoy both of these fragrances. I feel like the Sensual is a better pm fragrance though.</li>
            <li> I liked the cotton candy smell , I will be using it, still it is  a bit to sweet for my taste</li>
            <li> I love this one. I have this as well as the just the pink sugar. I get so many compliments on this one though. The smell lasts me the entire day and blends great with my body chemistry. This is a must have for ladies that want to give someone that &amp;#34;Hmmmm - you smell so good. It&#x27;s not too sugary as the regular pink sugar, but is just as scrumptious!</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this by mistake after I ran out of the original. When I realized it, I figured I&#x27;d go ahead and give it a try since I like the original so much. This is nothing like it. I enjoy light sweet, fruity scents (like VS Love Spell or BBW Sweet Pea) rather than heavy floral or &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; fragrances. This one reminds me of &amp;#34;old lady cologne&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s). One spray gave me a headache. If you enjoy the original, like I do, then I would encourage you to stick with that. The price was good, though.</li>
            <li> I have the original pink sugar and loved the playful sweet smell, but it&#x27;s not exactly a &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; appropriate perfume.  So I though how wonderful to have the grown up version of pink sugar!  Well, the smell is slightly different, nothing dramatic just a slightly heavier version of the original.  Also, the scent does not stay on very well.  I find that I&#x27;m using 2 or 3 times as much and by mid-day there isn&#x27;t much left on me....So, it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price.</li>
            <li> This to me is a grown up version of Pink Sugar. This fragrance is sexy. On me, it is citrusy.</li>
            <li> more please. smells better than the original.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d like a scent more than Pink Sugar original, but this is even better. Like Pink Sugar plus a deep floral scent, maybe vanilla too. The scent lasts for hours. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!  It just smells so sweet and pretty.  However, I still think I like the original just a little bit more!</li>
            <li> I chose &amp;#34;Sensual&amp;#34; because I wanted to see how different it was from the regular &amp;#34;Pink Sugar&amp;#34;... It is not bad,&lt;br /&gt;but the regular one is still my first choice! I believe this one lasts quite a while too, but you would have to&lt;br /&gt;get it yourself to see if you actually like it.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try this perfume because I LOVE the original Pink Sugar and have gotten tons of compliments.  It&#x27;s great!  I saw reviews for Sensual were almost as good but personally I just don&#x27;t think it comes close.  It has a familiar scent like something I may have previously worn.  To me it doesn&#x27;t stand out like Pink Sugar does.  Maybe it will grow on me.</li>
            <li> PINK SUGAR SENSUAL opens with fruity scents of currants and tangerine. Sweet, but not to the point of being sticky and sickly sweet. The currants are stronger on me, but the tangerine note is still well developed. The bergamot must be closely intertwined with the tangerine, because I don&#x27;t pick up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial fruity blast burns down with ten minutes, but a undertone of the currants [and possibly raspberry too] lingers throughout the heart and base of the fragrance. The floral notes are powdery and light and the juicy sweetness of the berries make everything seem breezy, laid back and casual. The jasmine is the strongest floral on my skin, followed by the orange blossom. I still can&#x27;t detect a hint of the bergamot, but the note of tiare flower is sweet and creamy and adds to the vanilla which seeps up from the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long note of vanilla and the berries linger from the softly floral heart and carry through to the base, giving PINK SUAR SENSUAL a lovely warmth that whispers \\&quot;come closer\\&quot; to passers by - making this perfect for people who work in public based settings as you&#x27;ll seem even more approachable. I&#x27;d read that black sugar contains molasses and I was keen to see how it&#x27;d be represented in a EDT, but between the vanilla, berries and softly creamy sandalwood, I can&#x27;t separate any other sweet notes used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official scent notes; Black currant, tangerine, bergamot, orange blossom, pink jasmine, tiare flower, vanilla, black sugar and sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really long lasting - it&#x27;s just as good as the original Pink Sugar. I wear mine to bed and can still smell it in the morning, for an EDT this is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fruitiness makes this a good choice for daytime and the light florals mean you can safely wear it to work; It may not be the most sophisticated choice for work, but I&#x27;ve received loads of compliments on it. I personally think it&#x27;s too quiet and not unique enough for evening wear, but if you plan on hitting a packed club then the fragrance&#x27;s lightness could be good for avoiding scent-induced headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being fruity and light I class this as being better suited to spring/summer; For such a sweet fragrance it isn&#x27;t sickly or cloying, even in hot weather. Having said that I do wear mine all year round and have never suffered ill effects and the scent doesn&#x27;t change in different weather, which many fragrances do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first; PINK SUGAR SENSUAL smells startlingly close to Britney Spears Fantasy - and by startlingly close I mean that when I spray one of each on each wrist I can barely tell the difference. In fact the only real difference is that Fantasy is heavier and contains a few more sweet and cake notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if this isn&#x27;t unique what is the point in buying it? The lasting power is unbelievable for a mass-market EDT. One spray and you&#x27;re sorted for the day [or night]. Not only is it long wearing, but it&#x27;s also light and non-sickly. Round this off with the fact that the individual notes don&#x27;t develop differently during different seasons and I&#x27;m sold.if you plan on hitting a packed club then the fragrance&#x27;s lightness could be good for avoiding scent-induced headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being fruity and light I class this as being better suited to spring/summer; For such a sweet fragrance it isn&#x27;t sickly or cloying, even in hot weather.
