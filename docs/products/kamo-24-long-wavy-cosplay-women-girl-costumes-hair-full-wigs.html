            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>The quality was very good and it looked really nice when I took it out of the package, but it didn&#x27;t look as good on.</li>
            <li>For the price it was definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It as a great wig and fell lovely.  </li>
            <li>Styling is required and make sure it does not tangle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely wig!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>LOVE this wig!</li>
            <li>This wig is an amazing quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>the curls are amazing.</li>
            <li>all though its still a nice wig.</li>
            <li>One of the thickest wigs I own.  </li>
            <li>Pictured is pre-cut; they look nice as a swoop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality for a cheap price!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Very good wig!&lt;br /&gt;Color is vibrant and it looks amazing in person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the best quality wig we have received.</li>
            <li>Very nice wig looks exactly like the pic.</li>
            <li>Using this for Bulma and I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you brush it, it will get poofy and maybe even more tangled.</li>
            <li>Love the interior elastic band to keep it fitting snugly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how wonderful this wig is.  </li>
            <li>I love this wig</li>
            <li>Very surprised how beautiful this wig is.</li>
            <li>I bought this for New Orleans costuming and it is actually very nice.</li>
            <li>Very full and</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tangle easily either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wearable but not on a day to day basis because it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>The curls are beautiful and the color of the photo matches the actual wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot longer than I thought it was gonna be, it&#x27;s so fun to wear I love it.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s a fabulous wig out of the package, regardless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit my head.  </li>
            <li>It fits my rather large head! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bangs are long, which is great for you to cut and style them yourself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right color easy to braid and style.</li>
            <li>will absolutely be buying more wigs from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Better quality then expected for the price, nice length.</li>
            <li>I thought it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig does have the shiny wig look, but nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed with baby powder and some creative eye-shadow usage.  </li>
            <li>Delivered right on time.</li>
            <li>i get tons of complements and its very full and soft.</li>
            <li>Its nice and thick and is still cute.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly as pictured, the wefts are thick, and the curls are beautiful.</li>
            <li>and the whole eccentric dyed hair is very popular right now especially the pastel color.</li>
            <li>color isn&#x27;t an exact match, but I&#x27;ve learned not to expect that.  </li>
            <li>I ended up straightening with a straightener on low heat, and I think that made it look better.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve added full cosplay photos for Bunny Bulma to give a solid idea of the full look.  </li>
            <li>I even managed to style it into a ponytail, which looked very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a lot more curly than I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>The real problem with it was the bangs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very beautiful, don&#x27;t get me wrong!</li>
            <li>Added a few bobby pins to be sure, and wore it all Halloween night with no issues.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>It fits well, and is very soft.</li>
            <li>A friend ended up sewing some hair clips in for me (as I was sans wig cap) and those helped immensely and were relatively inexpensive, so if you really love how this wig looks and are worried it won&#x27;t stay in, it&#x27;s a simple fix.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The cap is large enough to completely cover my head without issue.  </li>
            <li>The color holds up to the picture, except there is a little more blue.</li>
            <li>wig itself is soft and it fits my head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and very pretty and vibrant.</li>

            <li> The color is exact and it&#x27;s so thick and long.</li>
            <li> It was thick, shiny, and held it&#x27;s shape very well.</li>
            <li> &amp; it was down to the middle of her back on the length.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a little longer than I&#x27;d like them to be,  but I  have a pretty small forehead.</li>

            <li> They were too long and looked horrible on me.</li>

            <li> Very surprised how beautiful this wig is. The packaging preserved it&#x27;s curls and was nicely brushed. I was planning on buying this inexpensive wig and cutting it for the short length I need but now I can&#x27;t bring myself to cut it because it&#x27;s the BEST and most BEAUTIFUL wig I have ever purchased. Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> The wig is beautiful, just like the picture, and it looked wonderful. I even managed to style it into a ponytail, which looked very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I had with the wig was sizing. There are hooks inside that are suppose to help size it, but those kept falling out when I tried to make it smaller. A friend ended up sewing some hair clips in for me (as I was sans wig cap) and those helped immensely and were relatively inexpensive, so if you really love how this wig looks and are worried it won&#x27;t stay in, it&#x27;s a simple fix. I thought it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> perfect wig for bulma cosplay and it can be styled into literally any of her hairstyles (except maybe the afro)</li>
            <li> For the price it was definitely a good purchase. Only bad thing is wish it was thicker.</li>
            <li> Not the color I expected from this. I wanted to use this for bulma, and I thought the color was close enough. It&#x27;s also a lot more curly than I expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all though its still a nice wig. Its nice and thick and is still cute. Not exactly what I needed though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot longer than I thought it was gonna be, it&#x27;s so fun to wear I love it. Sheds a bit but it&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s thick. I love it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig must buy ♡</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very beautiful, don&#x27;t get me wrong! It&#x27;s thick and very pretty and vibrant. BUT it does tangle A TON. If you brush it, it will get poofy and maybe even more tangled. The curls fall out over time...</li>
            <li> Honestly one of the best wigs I have ordered on here. Very full and the color is spot on. Delivered right on time.</li>
            <li> great quality for the price. will get several uses from it. Love the interior elastic band to keep it fitting snugly. Added a few bobby pins to be sure, and wore it all Halloween night with no issues.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly as pictured, the wefts are thick, and the curls are beautiful. Definitely a great buy! I bought this for my Michiru Kaioh cosplay, and it is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> This wig is an amazing quality for the price.  One of the thickest wigs I own.  I can&#x27;t stress enough how wonderful this wig is.  The cap is large enough to completely cover my head without issue.  The hair is thick, no net shows through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are long, which is great for you to cut and style them yourself.

What you see in the photos from other customers is what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely be buying more wigs from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve added full cosplay photos for Bunny Bulma to give a solid idea of the full look.  I cut and styled the wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely wig! and the whole eccentric dyed hair is very popular right now especially the pastel color. It&#x27;s wearable but not on a day to day basis because it tangles easily. I had to cut the bangs and the hair to my desired length. The curls are perfect! However, it is too shiny for me so I had to spray some dry shampoo to tone down it a little bit.</li>
            <li> Love this! We have purchased a few wigs within this price range here on Amazon, since my daughter is into cosplaying.  This is by far the best quality wig we have received. It was thick, shiny, and held it&#x27;s shape very well. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice wig looks exactly like the pic. Ordered it for my daughter&#x27;s costume for comic-con in Nashville matched perfectly to here costume. She is 5&#x27;2 &amp; it was down to the middle of her back on the length. Looked great would definitly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Great quality</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised! I bought this for New Orleans costuming and it is actually very nice. It fits my rather large head! :)</li>
            <li> I got a lot of compliments from this wig</li>
            <li> This has to be the best wig I have ordered off of amazon. Everytime I wear it i get tons of complements and its very full and soft. The color holds up to the picture, except there is a little more blue.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I ordered on a Friday morning and it arrived on Monday. I&#x27;m so happy with the purchase! The color is exact and it&#x27;s so thick and long. It comes to about mid back and I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34;. I will definitely buy from here again!</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations. Especially in the quality regard. I love this wig</li>
            <li> It as a great wig and fell lovely.  I would buy again in every color.</li>
            <li> I got this wig to use with my Cheshire Cat costume.The quality was very good and it looked really nice when I took it out of the package, but it didn&#x27;t look as good on. I ended up straightening with a straightener on low heat, and I think that made it look better. The real problem with it was the bangs. They were too long and looked horrible on me. I thought of cutting them, but I was too scared to. So I ended up just tucking them under the wig and it looked great for my costume!</li>
            <li> Its great,  but it doesn&#x27;t fit my head.  I had to sew in wig clips.  To get it to stay.  But other than that it&#x27;s fine.  I got this for a Bulma cosplay.  It&#x27;s the right color easy to braid and style.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig. Will be buying. Additional in different colors. Better quality then expected for the price, nice length.</li>
            <li> Very good wig!&lt;br /&gt;Color is vibrant and it looks amazing in person.&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself is soft and it fits my head.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent wig. The curls are beautiful and the color of the photo matches the actual wig. Good quality for a cheap price!</li>
            <li> LOVE this wig! the color is slightly different but i don&#x27;t even care. the curls are amazing.</li>
            <li> Love it!! The bangs are a little longer than I&#x27;d like them to be,  but I  have a pretty small forehead.</li>
