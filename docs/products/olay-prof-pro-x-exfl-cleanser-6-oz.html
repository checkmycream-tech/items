            <li>I have had severe acne and this is a great product that cleans well</li>

            <li>This is a great product</li>
            <li>It works great but had to stop buying after reading about how it is messing with aquatic ecosystems.</li>

            <li>Product is amazing!</li>
            <li>you make sure that you cover each area of your face thoroughly, it also does an excellent job of removing makeup/foundation.  </li>
            <li>However, I will give it credit for being a really good cleanser as it did a great job of getting off all my makeup and not leaving any makeup residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating effect is perfect to prepare your skin for your favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was the best I could find anywhere on the internet, so I recommend purchasing it here too :)</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and works quite well with the machine.</li>
            <li>By itself I thought it was a good product, but with the bush it is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Oil of Olay fan, but this is not their best product.</li>
            <li>Good exfoliator (made-up that word</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>I also bought a really good mask as well.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>The Cleanser was delivered as scheduled, in good condtion.  </li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t go a day without a good cleanser.  </li>
            <li>everything is all good using everything together.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin shine and works as good as the Clarion which is around 130.00.</li>
            <li>Good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a good face scrubber cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, price is good, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Nice face cleaner, I use this once a week and it works great with the Olay Pro X set or by itself.</li>
            <li>Good product, I will buy again.</li>
            <li>Rubbing your skin with plastics to look good, when you can buy grounds, any coffee grounds shipped from heaven for over $30 a pound, the going price for this plastics by P&amp;G...</li>
            <li>Recommend lightly using accompanying circulating exfoliating brush periodically for best result.</li>
            <li>looks good after using.</li>
            <li>Now I use this with my fingers and it works just as good.  </li>
            <li>Your face feels so good after using it.  </li>
            <li>That description is not meant to be derogatory, because I guess that&#x27;s what a good exfoliating product should feel like.</li>
            <li>feels good for sometime but doesnt do any miracle on my face.</li>
            <li>Using this product has made me feel so good.  </li>

            <li>Sounds good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>There is also no scent which I love!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>either I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>It keeps her face oil free without drying out her skin!!</li>
            <li>do  not use more than once a week!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>My face has never looked better!</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Many fish and sea creatures mistake these poisonous pollution clusters as food!</li>
            <li>If you sign up for auto delivery they take off more money!</li>
            <li>I also use Oil of Olay&#x27;s tinted moisturizer w/ SPF 15 which I love!</li>
            <li>(it kind of felt like a fine sugar scrub and worked great</li>
            <li>I learned about this product line from a Consumer Reports study that rated this Olay line very high, and I agree that it is the best value around for skin care.</li>
            <li>I use this with the olay brush, and it really is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser, my face feels so smooth after.</li>
            <li>Great light exfoliant and affordable.</li>
            <li>Amazing what marketing does.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The cleanser itself does not smell that nice, but I suppose that I would prefer there not being any fragrances added to</li>
            <li>Nice product..</li>
            <li>cleanser has a nice, gel-like texture.  </li>
            <li>I have gone to spas and gotten many facials before, and I feel this leaves my face feeling as good as a spa you have to go out to.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still effective.</li>
            <li>then realize it&#x27;s just my own</li>
            <li>I do believe that this system wouldn&#x27;t be as effective without having this cleanser and using it with that handheld brush.  </li>
            <li>Based on my experience I believe it will be quite popular.</li>
            <li>I thought it will be softer after using it and the temperature of this cleanser gets warm</li>
            <li>Then go to the show and  wash your face with the warm water.</li>
            <li>It works well on its own in the shower and with the Pro-X Cleansing Device also.</li>
            <li>used to Shiseido, which is a much more pricey product, so may not be a fair comparison</li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>(I also remove my makeup every night,  applying Neutrogena face soap to my Olay face scrubber and it effectively removes every bit of makeup, something that I feel is a MUST for nice skin)  </li>
            <li>Honestly, if you&#x27;re expecting something exfoliating, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to have some kind of sand or beads in it or something.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get why this has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>guess she liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice product.feels like its doing something for me.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much to clean your face because this stuff suds up great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Love this, price is good, love the convenience of auto shop to my home👍🏻</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>
            <li>Love that it feels gentle but washes wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Liked regenerist scrub better.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is one of the best that I have found for my sensitive skin, and it removes every trace of makeup from my face.</li>
            <li>I tried it based on the review and comments of some men who&#x27;ve had great success with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the best price by far.  </li>
            <li>I am 50+ and this is by far the best exfoliating cleanser I have ever used, and I have used many&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is suitable for Pro-X advance cleansing systems</li>
            <li>of the best natural scrubs recommended is baking soda.</li>
            <li>so Amazon offers it at a great price!</li>
            <li>Loved that it was fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>It has very fine grit in it to polish the skin.  </li>
            <li>It rinses off cleanly and leaves my face feeling really good.</li>
            <li>this makes my skin feels very smooth and health.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe for storing in the shower since it&#x27;s plastic, and it&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate while taking a hot shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is suitable for daily use and it is best to finish up with a moisturizer for guys.</li>
            <li>I prefer my own cleanser that foams a bit more and washes away more easily.</li>
            <li>And I love that it doesn&#x27;t take very much to get a great clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge!</li>
            <li>I have used it for a year and there is a huge difference in the smoothness, softness and brightness of my skin!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena scrub worked better for me.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>My 3 sisters and nieces use this product and also love it.</li>
            <li>I did end up buying the Olay exfoliating spinning brush and that, with this cleanser, is better.</li>
            <li>Having a product which I feel makes my face more able to absorb and use more productivity</li>
            <li>I love this exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still handsome as I&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
            <li>~ I love the feel &amp; look of my face, and when I don&#x27;t use it I can tell as my face tends to get an oily sheen that day.  </li>
            <li>I am not the most well-versed in skin care products to be frank with you.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, however, but for the price I think it should be better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I used to use DDF acne facial scrub and that stuff was awesome</li>
            <li>I would like to see about 4 times as many exfoliating beads in this.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This does not burn your eyes as many products do.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>I use my CLAIRISONIC every day and love it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Olay&#x27;s works just as well</li>
            <li>Love the Dove one.</li>
            <li>My complexion looks more radiant after I use it.  </li>
            <li>I love the exfoliating brush</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this when the time comes.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased my Pro-X Plus, I was given a sample of the Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and it worked wonderfully, so I ordered this larger size.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>I will buy this again!:)</li>
            <li>As the next best thing to microdermabrasion in use with the hand held machine and brush.  </li>
            <li>Friends tell me that I have lovely skin, I am 50.</li>
            <li>more like every 3 or 4 days, and</li>
            <li>For exfoliating on a regular basis, this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>Also, if you are going to use this product, it is best to get some sore of facial exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne for years and have found that i really love a lot of the Olay products</li>
            <li>It works and my skin always feels cleaner and looks better after using it.</li>
            <li>glad this was just a sample that came with my Olay exfoliating system</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I use it now two or three times a week because it does smooth out my skin while cleaning and exfoliating without having any breakouts or reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that this leaves my face feeling scrubbed but not looking like it.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I have used more than 2 of these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Pro X brush for 3 years now, and I love the way it cleans my face.</li>
            <li>sure Olay will replace microbeads soon,</li>
            <li>I love the way this cleanser works for me.</li>
            <li>His skin is much better than it was though.</li>
            <li>as do my friends/family that I have  gifted this product to.</li>
            <li>However, I got sticker shock when I looked to buy some more on-line.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Although I had the issue getting out, I was able to finish all.</li>
            <li>There are so many to choose from that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t has to be from Olay for me.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a St Ives apricot scrub type feel.</li>
            <li>I love most Olay products though I think a lot of them are overpriced.</li>
            <li>Okay, so she was driving me nuts.</li>
            <li>and I love it!It</li>
            <li>Great customer service, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Love this product cleanse my face</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Glad it did though.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible either.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone combination skin and most products are too drying for some part of my face.</li>
            <li>Love the ProX line...</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;d admit it.</li>
            <li>should provide more instructions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using this cream, and feel confident recommending it to men.</li>
            <li>I really love the way this cleanser feels.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon but was a rip off.</li>
            <li>Safe to use every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser for more than a month now.  </li>
            <li>I got mine as a gift, and I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love using this with my Olay face scrub brush.</li>
            <li>Yay, more salt.</li>
            <li>I love all Olay products</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter love this face scrub.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Way better than Proactiv and a million times cheaper.</li>
            <li>Love.  </li>
            <li>Favorite face wash out there.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be a lot more exfoliating than it is.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>For an exfoliant, there weren&#x27;t many beads in it at all.</li>
            <li>and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>I love this line of products.</li>
            <li>Love the Olay ProX Exfoliating Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products, they&#x27;re inexpensive and I have found them to work well.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was just hoping it would be more exfoliating than it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have something more exfoliating.</li>
            <li>sister and I love it</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>You can purchase much more cheaper product and have much more job done.</li>
            <li>This has been my most favorite exfoliating cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>More in the summer with sweating etc.</li>
            <li>It breaks my face out even more.</li>
            <li>And most of us consume fish once to twice a week.</li>
            <li>For the very best face cream that tightens skin is actually virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I switched.  </li>
            <li>For more on this problem, google &#x27;5 Gyres microbeads&#x27; or #banthebead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better ways to exfoliate include using  apricot kernel, sugar or salt scrubs.</li>
            <li>But this one works well for me :)</li>
            <li>Love my Olay products.</li>
            <li>I love all the Olay products and also give them as gifts to family and friends.</li>
            <li>My face is noticeably smoother in texture, looks better when not wearing make up and make up glides on smoother.  </li>
            <li>and this does not irritate my skin like many exfoliators do.</li>
            <li>How could a product that can be purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Very excited as to see how this works, will put a review after I have used it for about a week:)</li>
            <li>The exfoliating cleanser is gentle,  but very effective.  </li>
            <li>I feel very clean after I used it.  </li>
            <li>Price was pretty good for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>My finer lines and wrinkles have diminished significantly as well, either because they have been buffed off or because my serum is able to absorb better into my skin and work more efficiently</li>
            <li>So worth it!!</li>
            <li>With the Spinning brush, it&#x27;s amazing how quick my skin can regenerate (healing blemishes and demarcation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this cleanser because it is mild yet effective.</li>
            <li>Now I have clean skin every night!</li>
            <li>I feel clean and refreshed after use and it lasts!</li>
            <li>Smooth and makes skin feel nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Very good facial cleanser without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>Olay Exfoliating Facial Cleanser is very good</li>
            <li>Great product: no added perfumes, soft exfoliating beads...</li>
            <li>it was free or I would have been more upset to have to return it to the store.....</li>
            <li>I love how well it exfoliates my face...feels so smooth...</li>
            <li>Love this product after use face feels and looks so smooth.</li>
            <li>Product feels rough on my face and does not do a superb job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>very good.it feels good.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin, but so good on the face.</li>
            <li>The Olay facial cleanser is really good!</li>
            <li>I use the entire system &amp; nothing has ever cleared my face as good as this stuff has!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an olay fragrance-free product and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I am now on auto ship (makes it easy)</li>
            <li>Was delivered very quickly</li>
            <li>and it is easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and found such a great deal on it</li>
            <li>Removes makeup easily.</li>
            <li>, it was easy to finger it as the culprit.</li>
            <li>I love knowing when going to bed that my face is clean and all the elements from the air and makeup</li>
            <li>The exfoliating beads are very mild and I do feel like they exfoliate to some extent, but not to the extent I want or need.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to stay in routine of each day.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the point in paying the huge amount for other types when Olay works so great!</li>
            <li>I think that is an excellent trade-off for any woman who wants healthy and younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>It has noticeably reduced fine lines and colored spots as well as providing a smoother feel.</li>
            <li>how lightly if foamed, as well as how easy it was to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>The grits are so fine that I don&#x27;t think this scrub would damage your skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Gives you a great clean face I love Olay products and I would buy this product again definitely.</li>
            <li>Which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fine lines on my face seem to be disappearing.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is get rid of the very top layer of dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in pores or fine lines, but there I think there is some.  </li>
            <li>I have huge pores and greasy skin, and it makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this is perfect for it - Not a harsh abrasive like some of the others.</li>
            <li>I found a great deal on this product, so I bought it at the same time that I bought my Pro-x advanced cleansing system.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores, acne scars and blotchy skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s widely available, which is great because it&#x27;s only 6 ounces</li>
            <li>This does an amazing job at making my skin soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>It is a fantastic system.</li>
            <li>It is smooth with just a hint of abrasive feel.</li>
            <li>Its light and not too exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I came about this product through a free sample that came along with the Olay cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a light soap, not greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the whole Pro X cleaning system</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on the male reviewer&#x27;s description of how great it worked for him.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and gives a nice glow.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a great addition to my daily skincare ritual.</li>
            <li>My entire experience with Olay products has been great.</li>
            <li>My face feels silky &amp; smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin and is best to use at night before you go to bed in combination with a Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the Olay rotary brush that comes in the Advanced Cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>Great for daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>The exfoliant is gentle and effective.</li>

            <li>Great scrub and facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>My solution is to use the cleanser lightly with a buff puff.  </li>
            <li>product is fantastic, I swear by this exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of this whit the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System one for myself and one for my girlfriend, and we both enjoy using this every morning.</li>

            <li>I will be happy to comment at a later date.</li>
            <li>Only works great with their ProX Cleansing System or a clairsonic.</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Cleanses very well and I am pleased with this product that cleans my pores better than soap.  </li>
            <li>love that I can use it right in the shower, the cleansing brush</li>
            <li>I use it daily and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li>this works very well !!!</li>
            <li>Very cheap, with can, after all, the price is not expensive</li>
            <li>My face feels clean when finished, and cream goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels fantastic, looks shiny and clean, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves the face feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin so smooth and so clean.</li>
            <li>With a lot of face products you don&#x27;t get much for your money, but this product seems to be pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 and while I have very good skin, my skin is highly sensitive and reactive, and I can&#x27;t use most exfoliators without getting red, inflamed skin.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased with spin brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>Originally saw this on \\&quot;the Doctors\\&quot; recommended by Dr Orden (cosmetic/plastic surgeon).</li>
            <li>For the first time my skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to use with my nutrasonic face cleanser machine but sold it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a unique process in that I need to get my face</li>
            <li>Apparently it works on her gorgeous youthful skin.</li>
            <li>As usual Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I get the feeling that it doesn&#x27;t wash off as cleanly as I like, but I have overlooked this and found no evidence [break outs] of there being any cleanser residue on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and olay does not cause breakout.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling beautifully clean.</li>
            <li>Helps minimize pores by keeping them clean.  </li>
            <li>I can see and feel how clean this product makes my skin.</li>
            <li>Ive gone back to the St Ives since it is more effective for me.</li>
            <li>Makes my face sooooo smoth and clean,  my husband loves it too I had to get him some for him.</li>
            <li>an clean  </li>
            <li>My skin feels refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I need a cleanser that will thoroughly clean the oily areas without stripping the drier areas.  </li>
            <li>I just keep telling myself that foam doesn&#x27;t &#x3D; clean.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel super smooth and realy did reduce my pores.</li>
            <li>Nothing else has ever made my face feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Really exfoliates the skin, works great on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>This seems to really clean well.  </li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t like nature or animals, remember that we all depend on a clean environment for our food and water.</li>
            <li>I feel clean and refresh even without putting moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>and it really does a good scrub job without breaking my face out like others with too much cream in them.</li>
            <li>Does not dry up the skin and good for combination skin</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance, not unpleasant but not flowery.</li>
            <li>Being familiar with the product and some other Olay items, I know it&#x27;s an excellent and reasonably priced item.  </li>
            <li>a great benefit is that I noticed after I used this cleanser that my face was more able to absorb my moisturizer and as most women know you can really spend some serious cash in that department.  </li>
            <li>I bought the whole Olay system and while I like the rotating brush to cleanse and love the microbead with the pad attachment, I didn&#x27;t find any significant results from using this cleanser.</li>
            <li>They are always right here!  </li>
            <li>Nice sudsing, and gives the skin a soft, clean feel.</li>
            <li>This is a very good cleanser, but I think it should not be used every night, but a few times a week.  </li>
            <li>has definitely helped my skin looked bright</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for exfoliating but not harsh or drying.</li>
            <li>Olay exfoliating renewal cleanser is a good daily exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a facial product, but this is good to use on a nightly basis.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this but by 10 in the morning</li>
            <li>worked nice even on my sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Really has helped complexion, bought two and glad I did.</li>
            <li>I got a sample with the pro-x cleansing system and absolutely fell in love.</li>
            <li>Its my first day of using it and its amazing!I can feel and see the difference on my face &amp; i told my husband about it and for him to try for sure he will love it as well!Other than that pretty fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Second it does not lather good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much scent which maybe a great thing for many people, but I sort of miss sweet feminine scent of other Olay products though.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have the heavy grit that apricot scrubs have, so it&#x27;s more pleasant.</li>
            <li>I give this five stars because I use it and because it was easy to find and not expensive.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about spending big bucks on high end brush cleaner/scrub, so I decided to give this a try and loved it.</li>
            <li>It works well with the cleansing massage head to clean my face, but it gets a funny plastic smell like the vinyl shower curtain (maybe there are vinyl beads!).</li>
            <li>feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exfoliating and gives a clean and fresh result after washing.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel clean, fresh and hydrated</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean and fresh after every wash.</li>
            <li>has a mild warming effect when you rub it on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild exfoliator</li>
            <li>This makes your face feel so clean, helps remove black heads, great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the product seems to be high, and I think for many users it is probably perfect--especially given the amount of product provided and price.</li>
            <li>No need for high end products anymore :)</li>
            <li>It seems to always be rated highly in any of the lists I see of &amp;#34;best XXXX skin care product&amp;#34; so I see no reason to pay more and I am seeing the results I want with it.  </li>
            <li>I use it alternately with the Olay Regenerist Crean Cleanser and am very pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li>After using this my skin for the first time my skin got so smooth that I begged my boyfriend to touch my cheek.  </li>
            <li>First time my skin become smooth and velvety after two days of use.</li>
            <li>I first used this with when I got a free sample with my pro x face scrubber macjin.</li>
            <li>When used with a brush, it provides a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and smooth afterwards, ready for moisturizing and make-up, if that&#x27;s your thing.</li>
            <li>The grains in it are very fine, but it still feels like sand on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin fresh and clean - it doesn&#x27;t turn greasy right away after washing (yes, I had problems like that).</li>
            <li>I use this product twice daily and love the clean, smooth feel my face has.</li>
            <li>well that&#x27;s until the oil and shine sets back in, but it really gives you face a good clean.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and no problem with the company who sent it tho!!</li>
            <li>I only discovered it about 6 months ago, but I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this exfoliating cleanser based on all positive reviews for it.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t look extra amazing or anything, but I&#x27;m going to give it some time</li>
            <li>Not too harsh or fragrant, great for every day use.</li>
            <li>It lightly exfoliates, and makes your skin brighter and much cleaner looking.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this product is a nice exfoliator, but I personally prefer the non-exfoliating Pro-X cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin,and have tried most cleansers out there, including the natural ones.</li>
            <li>well worth buying</li>
            <li>Love ol lay makes my sign feel young</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh, radiant...</li>
            <li>so you will end up getting your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice creamy consistency with enough granules to exfoliate well without being scratchy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth  </li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li>St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]], but still has the properties to refresh my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is also getting more sensitive and thinner.  </li>
            <li>my second time ordering this product, removes blackheads, nice scrub, no drying, but I don&#x27;t like the container</li>
            <li>I mostly use it with the Olay Professional Pro-X cleansing brush, but sometime with just my hands, and either way,.</li>
            <li>However, this cleanser is very gentle and mild, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it.  </li>
            <li>It seems like most of the exfoliation is more due to the exfoliating brush than the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem very effective to try to combine them all into one product, throw a few particles in there, and call it an exfoliant, too.</li>
            <li>Works really well, leaves skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Price is right too</li>
            <li>Right now, this cleanser is #1 on my list.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased it right</li>
            <li>I noticed right away a difference in the condition of my skin, after using the brush.</li>
            <li>Its just right.</li>
            <li>I find the balance of &#x27;grit&#x27; to lotion in just the right balance for my skin.</li>
            <li>Has just the right amount of exfoliation for my skin.</li>
            <li>The first few weeks were great..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty economical person and used to rarely spend over $4 on face wash and cleansers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a lifelong problem best solved with Retin A for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It really does clean and exfoliate well.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s much cheaper on amazon than in most store - it normally goes for 20 + dollars.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but the new RX added to the label didn&#x27;t seem to make it any different than the cheaper exfoliator by Olay.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not bad and it seems to be gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser daily on my 56 year old face since receiving it a couple of months ago and I have to say that I am totally pleased with how it leaves my skin feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>those \\&quot;scrubby micro beads\\&quot; are made of plastic that damage our waterways and health -- and are now banned in certain states (New York, Illinois), with many more states are following suit.</li>
            <li>I personally do not feel safe using anything made in China that can be absorbed through my skin or accidentally ingested while washing my face.</li>
            <li>It works very well with the Olay spin brush, together the dual make an effective facial treatment.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling dry, and I am so glad to be  done with blemishes.</li>
            <li>But this stuff makes my face feel good and baby soft, especially after shaving</li>
            <li>It really does clean the skin and leaves it feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>gently exfoliates and leaves skin smooth and ready for moisturizing products.  </li>
            <li>Has a slight chemical smell but it is a good non-harsh scrubber.  </li>
            <li>Basically it is a VERY, VERY, VERY gentle exfoliator</li>
            <li>therefore it is very gentle on the skin but the beads still get the cleaning</li>
            <li>This is a very mild exfoliating cleanser, it leaves your skin super soft and smooth, not dry.</li>
            <li>Good cleaner but a little pricey</li>
            <li>, there is little evidence that it is doing me any good</li>
            <li>A parity of foam cleanser, electricity network operators in China website to sell similar paragraph after love is 200 yuan RMB.&lt;br</li>
            <li>polishing effective not very desirable</li>
            <li>Im the first</li>
            <li>it simply makes your skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too fine and doesn&#x27;t remove enough skin for me to quickly get the desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its one of those things where you look in the mirror one day and are surprised by how smooth your skin looks.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it as a first step to fight off the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works any better than the daily hydrating scrub</li>
            <li>This product has earned my first ever Holy Grail status beauty</li>
            <li>skin has never looked better in my entire life.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth and soft and creamy.</li>
            <li>I am using this product for about 1 month now and my skin looks much cleaner, fresh now.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft and smooth when I got done without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>That being said, when used together they work really well!  </li>
            <li>I really like the ProX brush and cleanser from Olay!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have those issues anymore :) Regular use of this product took care of all those issues!</li>
            <li>Much better price than local stores</li>
            <li>My face texture smoothed out immediately when I first used the cleanser</li>
            <li>I do wish Olay would put more cleaning granules in the facial wash.  </li>
            <li>I turned the tube around to look at the ingredients, and sure enough, sodium.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin was brighter after the first use.</li>
            <li>First off, I am a guy.</li>
            <li>use it on my decolletage as well, and it keeps it smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth the $16 I paid.</li>
            <li>Thank you fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future.  </li>
            <li>This is more like just a regular face wash than something exfoliating.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have those issues anymore :) Regular use of this product took care of all those issues!</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite, especially with the spinning brush.</li>
            <li>And the aftermath is a smoothness and glow that erases all traces of winter&#x27;s once persistent &#x27;flakes&#x27; leaving me with a soft smooth glow that makes applying moisturizer and makeup</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this product</li>
            <li>Loved the feel of the cleanser and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>Hallelujah, the husband gets to go back to what he was doing originally, and the little woman is in her joy zone.</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews on this product, when I saw it on sale at my local store I grabbed it.</li>
            <li>I noticed less break outs which I contribute to the cleanser being able to clean away dirt and oil without drying out my face.  </li>
            <li>Third - results are not so great as I expected for this money.</li>
            <li>My face skin was so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>my skin has become so soft and clean looking...</li>
            <li>The product works wonders, it leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have oily but sensitive skin and this product makes my skin so clean without stripping it.</li>
            <li>You can feel the sand like lotion exfoliating the skin giving you the soft and clean feel.  </li>
            <li>I only need a tiny bit to get a good lather</li>
            <li>and this was so perfect for her, no more  dry face skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s positive review as well as using it with the rest of the proX system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had positive comments from friends and family.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and polished after using this, like I had a really good facial, and yet it isn&#x27;t dried</li>
            <li>It exfoliates incredibly well and is gentle enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Since then it&#x27;s been pretty much status quo.</li>
            <li>Since then it&#x27;s been pretty much status quo.</li>
            <li>the plus side, it does a good job of cleaning -- it gets all my makeup off, including eye makeup (I usually wear mascara and eyeshadow and sometimes liner, and I don&#x27;t have to use a separate eye makeup remover with this cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Olay exfoliating cleanser is as good as, if not better, than the brands found at Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus, etc.  </li>
            <li>But as far as a face wash, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>The last cleansing system I tried was Clinique and this works better and at a decent price</li>
            <li>I bet it is amazing based on other customer reviews!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild enough to use everyday and still effective in exfoliating and the price is right!</li>
            <li>-- I had similar problem with Neutrogena Deep Clean Face Wash, so I guess if you don&#x27;t have problem with that one, this one would be ok.</li>
            <li>Many cleanser either gives me break out and makes my skin too dry and</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have the same great feel as Arbonne, but I actually see a major improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and acne scarring.  </li>
            <li>, that I had a use a large amount.</li>
            <li>Have lived with large pores all my life and gave up years ago in ever reducing them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and still have large pores and breakouts on my face.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser reminds me of Philosophy&#x27;s Microdermabrasion cleanser, they both are clear with the very fine particles that actually do the exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is easily irritated, and this leaves my skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li>my opinion, the most effective way to use this product is to first wet \\&quot;one\\&quot; hand only, then squeeze out a pea size worth of cleanser, rub your hands together and scrub over DRY skin in a circular motion!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a very positive difference in my face&#x27;s skin tone, elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines (although it is not a remarkable difference), and I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, the cleansing beads are small and I think this works well to keep my pores clean.</li>
            <li>too hard on the skin its as good as scrub not</li>
            <li>Even with this minor flaw, I love this cleanser and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have become a huge fan of the Pro-X line, because since I have been using it, my adult acne has completely cleared up and my developing crows feet have receded.  </li>
            <li>I bought the whole Pro X system about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>I gently washed my face with it yesterday</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a month now, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Note that I have only used this cleanser in conjunction with Olay&#x27;s advanced cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expecting anything else is really the realm of a Dermatologist.</li>
            <li>The grains in this Pro-X exfoliating cleanser really feel abrasive on my skin, in spite of being small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but what I can tell you is that my wife absolutely loves this face cleaning gizmo and the cleanser that goes with it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I am prone to break out and this stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether one, two, or all three of these Olay ProX products is the reason for these results, but I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>This product combined with the Pro Scrubber has made a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>but I feel like they&#x27;re not doing much to cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li>I very like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent much, much more on exfoliating cleansers and have seldom repurchased them.  </li>
            <li>It seems to go really well with the Olay Pro-X Plus in that my face has cleared up and feels so much cleaner and softer.  </li>
            <li>and I swear after just one use my skin felt much softer.</li>
            <li>I really like it but wanted to try the Pro X version.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my face well but is gentle.</li>
            <li>It allows the moisturizer to be absorbed by your skin leaving it dewy and soft.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feel and scent of this face wash.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>it cleanses very well and has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>When I ran out, I found out how much benefit this cleanser had.</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  </li>
            <li>No information on how often or how much to scrub your face when using it.</li>
            <li>may be using too much...</li>
            <li>Cleans well, but drys my face out way too much.</li>
            <li>My whole family has it...</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>And I use the cleanser six days a week after I work out because my face is really sweaty.  </li>
            <li>It really takes off all your makeup and the residue and/or dirt or oil on your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very watery cleanser.</li>
            <li>The product is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have problem skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommended using all of the products!</li>
            <li>Olay cleanser really did it for me,it has help my sunspots disapeared so much</li>
            <li>A penny to nickel sized amount gently rubbed in and rinsed.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even more alarming is that because the plastic beads are not biodegradable, toxic chemical pollutants floating in our oceans, attach to the beads.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Not too abrasive and gets really sudsy.  </li>
            <li>Since this product was for my wife, I really can&#x27;t give you a review.</li>
            <li>Not to be missed and if you get the brush it will make a real difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser (with brush) takes off makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Clarisonic system for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not too abrasive and really has made a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this with Olay&#x27;s spinning brush in my morning shower and really like it.  </li>
            <li>BUT it really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Prices the same as stores IF it is free shipping</li>
            <li>Works very well with the Olay brush.</li>
            <li>B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid</li>
            <li>At this time I am only using it approximately 3 times weekly, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I look much younger after washing my face with this product, and my acne is completely GONE -- better than ProActive.</li>
            <li>I was looking into a professional chemical peal, but tried this exfoliating cleaner just to see what it would do &amp; within a week of daily exfoliating, it appears most if not all of my presistent whiteheads are gone.  </li>
            <li>It scrubs without being too harsh and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li>I will be returning to the much more expensive but effective exfoliating cleanser Vivant -</li>
            <li>Will purchase more in the  near future.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleaning System, and follow up with Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer in Sensitive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Articles from the New York Times + Chicago Tribune about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illinois is the first state to ban microbeads; CA and NY have proposed bills this year to ban them as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s other exfoliaters at a much lower price and work better.</li>
            <li>I love the product, cleans and leaves skin very soft, does not dry the skin, can be used frequently</li>
            <li>If you want to keep your skin clean, clear, &amp; with a natural glow, this is the product that delivers.</li>
            <li>It has tiny scrubbing beads in it that feel like they really are exfoliating my face and getting it clean.</li>
            <li>micro breads gently massages the face, enough to clean out pores.</li>
            <li>Although I think it&#x27;s a bit more than some other brands.  </li>
            <li>My skin is normal to dry, and this cleanser with the brush gives a clean, fresh finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting the other more pricey hand held cleansing system but after looking at the reviews for the Olay system, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also wondering if perhaps using it every other day rather than every day might be a better idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The micro beads in the cleanser were needed to really deep clean pores.  </li>
            <li>I feel my face really clean when I use it, but I don&#x27;t see any actual results.</li>
            <li>When I clean my face with this stuff, I feel like it is doing just as much as my facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Gives me a deep clean, leaving me with a deep clean.</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser with the Olay Cleansing Brush about once a week to remove any make-up residue &amp; to deep clean my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No dull skin with this product!</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a very strong exfoliating action, I&#x27;d suggest checking out other options.</li>
            <li>The granuals are so small and fine that I don&#x27;t feel the clean or exfoliation</li>
            <li>Many people rave about the skin-renewing benefits of dry brushing using natural bristle brushes.</li>
            <li>The Olay Professional product line is truly comparable to the higher priced department store brands, which I also use periodically.</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few products since the skin revolution started few years ago, and I find these to be the best so far.</li>
            <li>I look in the mirror and at first think \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li>I have used various other exfoliating products, but I find this one to be both gentle &amp; effective, as well as very affordable.</li>
            <li>It worked to its full potential.</li>
            <li>But when it comes down to it I was looking for a more aggresive scrub and this did not provide what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>New skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of scrubs, and this one is both effective and gentle, as well as affordable, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li>So for me, it&#x27;s important to apply this over dry skin.</li>
            <li>With any over the counter cleanser/exfoliating product you should expect it to do a decent job which this product does.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>main use for an exfoliating agent is to help scruff ingrown hair in my beard and neck area to reduce hair bumps.</li>
            <li>Maybe pores shrink as we get older, but I&#x27;m sticking with this cleanser just in case.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, but powerful at the same time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different face washes throughout the years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve picked one and stuck with it consistently.</li>
            <li>younger person (I am in my 60&#x27;s, with combination skin) with oily skin could use it much more frequently, possibly even daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  </li>
            <li>For an exfoliating cleanser, it&#x27;s pretty gentle, but not quite gentle enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both the Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and the Olay Pro-X Plus to anyone who has problems with breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>and i will highly recomend this to every one at my age 45y</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to everyone to try out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years &amp; would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide a deep exfoliation, which is nice if you are using other products as well.</li>
            <li>Have been using it once daily for 5 months and my skin is very clear, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>Pro-X seems to be a little better.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t need to use many, just a little...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where I focus my little exfoliator a bit more.  </li>
            <li>It makes my bad skin look flawless....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural girl and don&#x27;t want to fuss too much with my appearance.  </li>
            <li>It can be a very embarrassing situation for adults, but these two product help to clear up my face.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates, yet gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - it&#x27;s been my go to face wash for a few years now.</li>
            <li>You can use this exfoliator everyday, use with the Olay cleansing brush for better exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates and cleans your skin at the same time, leaving a fresh looking face.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a really good scrub this way, it will remove all dead skin cells, make your skin look younger, alive and leaving it ever sooooooo soft!</li>
            <li>I have mild adult acne occasionally and it has lessened by using this as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product, especially if you have the Olay Advanced Cleansing System, which I recently bought and now cannot live without.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and use some expensive but very effective skin products.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>Order at Amazon if you don&#x27;t live close to Walmart.  </li>
            <li>and I need to find a product that would go with my new Olay Pro-X Plus.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become an Olay girl and am always on the lookout for new products.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been slowing trying new things.</li>
            <li>This is a new product to the Olay Pro-X line.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new ones.  </li>
            <li>I have used other high end cleansers (Lancome), but none left my skin looking so smooth and without drying it!  </li>
            <li>I use it with the Pro-X cleansing brush, helps get deep into pores making skin look smooth and younger.</li>
            <li>Use it only at night and feel it really cleans my skin, but in a gentle way.</li>
            <li>My fce felt almost as smooth as it does after a facial at my local day spa.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks now and really like the cleansing ability of the product, as well as the light exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and, despite the fact that I am a 53-year-old woman, I was still getting blemishes and pimples.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use just any product on my face.</li>
            <li>red blotches to be exact</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>am 52 years old and have normal skin.</li>
            <li>Has cleared my acne and at 51 years old, that is something I have fought since adolescence!</li>
            <li>Keeps my face so soft!</li>
            <li>and you can tell after the first day using this that its starting to exfoliate your skin and bring the dirt to the surface.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li>I first starting using this when I bought the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush in or around the Spring of 2012</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin loves this stuff!</li>
            <li>Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and it has cut down on breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product - you only need to use a small amount so it lasts ages.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin too much, but I have an oily compexion to begin with.  </li>
            <li>As an 80+ year old, I&#x27;m not sure I could do any better.</li>
            <li>If you wet your face first, you will not feel the scrub as much.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft when you exfoliate with it, and it helps to clear your face and make it look brighter!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinique for years and found this to be just as effective in sloughing off the dead and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Love the little hand-held device used to apply it too!</li>
            <li>I bought the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and had a little sample of this.</li>
            <li>On the other hand if you are searching for an every day mild exfoliator then I recommend you purchase.</li>
            <li>and I can clearly see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is supposed to be formulated to be gentle enough to use every day and I have found that to be the case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to give a thumbs up to Amazon for offering this product as a auto ship with at a much lower price then even my local wal-mart.  </li>
            <li>B002UUT392 Olay Professional Pro-X Restorative Cream Cleanser, 5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I have been exfoliating for over 20 years and prefer an exfoliator that has enough beads/grit to really feel it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally know much about this</li>
            <li>And for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it my skin feels refreshed and alive.  </li>
            <li>I have problems with acne breakouts, even as an adult</li>
            <li>My face feels soft but not over exfoliated.</li>
            <li>No harsh smell</li>
            <li>I cannot say I like it because I am sensitive to the smell, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>There is considerable amount of that plastic in a tube</li>
            <li>The Olay pro x and Clarisonic brushes will work with natural products just as well as microbeads, and you won&#x27;t be poisoning fish or polluting the water and soil.</li>
            <li>This does the job and does not ever leave my skin irritated or sensitive, and I have&lt;br /&gt;sensitive</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law gave me some Arbonne cleanser which made my skin sooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It might be old?</li>
            <li>Face is feels baby soft</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and looking dewey.  </li>
            <li>I think that one day they will be completely faded away if I continue to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used it anyway without the brush and found that it didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>B002UUT38I Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, 6 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>B001JQLNM8 Olay Professional Pro-X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream, 1.7 Ounce]].</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive for the apricot scrubs, or the like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is both deep cleaning and gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel so soft and clean--espcially when used with the spin-pro brush.</li>
            <li>had my 51 year old mother and 19 year old sister use it</li>
            <li>Fast service &amp; red&#x27;d.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin fairly soft, and it is unscented.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft &amp; feels cleaner than ever.  </li>
            <li>Complete joke.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I have sensitive skin, this is non-irritating for me, &amp; could also be applied using just one&#x27;s fingers rather than the power brush applicator.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t give the same affect.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>B0012J135O Olay Complete Night</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li>like that a little goes a long way, making the price a better fit for my tight budget.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean without tight skin.</li>
            <li>You can pay a lot more for other similar products, but I don&#x27;t see why you should when this does the same quality cleansing.</li>
            <li>I can use it in shower to remove other makeup like foundation and lip gross etc...and to use to smooth arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your face, or dry face out too much!</li>
            <li>Sloughs off the dead skin cells, and leaves your skin so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product by any means, its just not any different from the lesser priced exfoliator by the same company.</li>
            <li>The cost of this product is a little on the high side for a cleanser, however I did get a really good deal on Amazon and a little goes a long way with the product,  </li>
            <li>Very little is needed and it sinks in nicely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had trouble to clean it afterwards.</li>
            <li>My skin is probably a bit better than average for someone my age, but I was curious what, if anything, this product would do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that after the first month or so, daily use is not really necessary.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that after the first month or so, daily use is not really necessary.</li>
            <li>recently noticed the Olay Pro-X brush that is supposed to be used with this, is only $21.97, it was almost $30 when I first put it in my wish list.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a high quality facial cleanser</li>
            <li>If you live near one, check your local BB&amp;B before purchasing this item from Amazon!</li>
            <li>The sensation I get is what I would expect to feel sandpapering my face with a fine, maybe 600 grit, sandpaper with a little cream mixed in.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This is probably my least favorite Pro-X product I have used so far -- I like it, but probably not enough to buy it again since I like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Unbelievable Smooth Cleanser that does not irritate my skin like some products.  </li>
            <li>My sister recently found a new exfoliating cleanser that contains green tea and glycolic acid and says it works much better, although more expensive than the Olay</li>
            <li>I know other reviews have said that it doesn&#x27;t feel rough at all, so this is surely a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product with the new Olay facial bush and it arrived two weeks before the brush.</li>
            <li>Being late for a weekend trip, we had to pack very quickly.</li>
            <li>Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on dry elbows and heels and can see a real difference in these areas.  </li>
            <li>While more expensive than others, this exfoliating cleanser really does the job.  </li>
            <li>in my mid 20s, and it has kept my skin feeling soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I have an Olay battery operated facial scrubber, that I use every morning with the exfoliating cleanser and between the two of them, my face is acne clear with  soft, suple skin.  </li>
            <li>This is better for someone with really sensitive, thin skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I was apprehensive at first, but I was not let down.</li>
            <li>Finally, found a product that I can use on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Well, I can barely see it now!</li>
            <li>When I purchased this I bought 2 other Pro X items and they have given me problems - either breakouts or not being absorbed by my skin, but this one is definitely a winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first facial cleanser I can say that I can not live without!</li>
            <li>The cleanser by it&#x27;s self is actually a very good exfoliating cleanser that is not to harsh on your face but cleans away the dull dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>Just apply a small handful on wet, clean skin and rub in a gentle circular motion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you get the point) with many little scrubbers that are not too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The only reason I tried this is because a small bottle comes with the Pro x advanced cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Regular use of this product has given my 69 year old complexion a youthful glow.  </li>
            <li>and I really need to work to spread it over my face because it tries to stay in the shape that I squirted out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is my second tube of Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>He has had marked improvement on his teen acne.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and even the acne scars are starting to disappear.  </li>
            <li>The Olay cleansers I have tried have always left my skin feeling soft, refreshed, and without overdrying.</li>
            <li>B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]].</li>
            <li>I look far younger than I am.  </li>
            <li>I have tired many fragrance-free products before and none have ever delivered on their claims.  </li>
            <li>She loved it, and was going crazy trying to find the replacement cream for the kit.</li>
            <li>my skin is soft and without any sign of my high-duty mineral sunscreen and make up, which was not happening with any other sensitive skin cleaning lotions I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>A very small amount massaged into the skin produces a smooth surface after rinsing off.</li>
            <li>This has little cleansing grains in it which does a much better job without being too harsh</li>
            <li>/&gt;This removes that dead dull surface layer to reveal the healthy new skin underneath without drying.  </li>
            <li>They absorb toxic chemicals in those waters and can be mistaken by wildlife as food.&lt;br /&gt;There are alternatives to the microbeads that are natural such as ground seeds or nuts (walnut, almond powders might be listed in the facial scrub ingredients).</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser keep the skin moistured and does not dry up the face after washing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and am surprised to say it really has made a noticeable improvement in the appearance and overall health of my skin, which is now a little lighter and brighter in color and softer in texture.</li>
            <li>I am 38 and have very temperamental skin that flares up due to various reasons.  </li>
            <li>As I have aged, my 40+ year old facial skin has developed a lot of whiteheads on my cheeks, forhead, and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but on the other hand is not exactly a walk in the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But my mind is very curious and sometimes doubts if it really is cleaning because it lacks the foam/lather of a traditional soap.</li>
            <li>I have have dry, flaky skin when I don&#x27;t regularly exfoliate (plus I live in the north).  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product based on other reviews but was thoroughly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product for dry or sensitive skin.......</li>
            <li>Is about a half a teaspoon too much?  </li>
            <li>This cleanser, used daily, keeps you face clear of the dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>product does not seem to have those beads or particles (or at least enough of them in an adequate size to exfoliate my man skin).</li>
            <li>Not to much and not too little of exfoliating &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in this solution.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling so clean its almost dry, which is what I was looking for as my skin has been on oily side lately.</li>

            <li> you make sure that you cover each area of your face thoroughly, it also does an excellent job of removing makeup/foundation.  </li>
            <li> However, I will give it credit for being a really good cleanser as it did a great job of getting off all my makeup and not leaving any makeup residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating effect is perfect to prepare your skin for your favorite moisturizer.  </li>

            <li> Your face feels so good after using it.  </li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> either I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> It keeps her face oil free without drying out her skin!!</li>

            <li> My face has never looked better!</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Many fish and sea creatures mistake these poisonous pollution clusters as food!</li>
            <li> If you sign up for auto delivery they take off more money!</li>
            <li> I also use Oil of Olay&#x27;s tinted moisturizer w/ SPF 15 which I love!</li>
            <li> (it kind of felt like a fine sugar scrub and worked great</li>
            <li> I learned about this product line from a Consumer Reports study that rated this Olay line very high, and I agree that it is the best value around for skin care.</li>
            <li> I use this with the olay brush, and it really is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, my face feels so smooth after.</li>
            <li> Great light exfoliant and affordable.</li>
            <li> Amazing what marketing does.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> The cleanser itself does not smell that nice, but I suppose that I would prefer there not being any fragrances added to</li>
            <li> Nice product..</li>
            <li> cleanser has a nice, gel-like texture.  </li>
            <li> I have gone to spas and gotten many facials before, and I feel this leaves my face feeling as good as a spa you have to go out to.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still effective.</li>
            <li> then realize it&#x27;s just my own</li>
            <li> I do believe that this system wouldn&#x27;t be as effective without having this cleanser and using it with that handheld brush.  </li>
            <li> Based on my experience I believe it will be quite popular.</li>
            <li> I thought it will be softer after using it and the temperature of this cleanser gets warm</li>
            <li> Then go to the show and  wash your face with the warm water.</li>
            <li> It works well on its own in the shower and with the Pro-X Cleansing Device also.</li>
            <li> used to Shiseido, which is a much more pricey product, so may not be a fair comparison</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> (I also remove my makeup every night,  applying Neutrogena face soap to my Olay face scrubber and it effectively removes every bit of makeup, something that I feel is a MUST for nice skin)  </li>
            <li> Honestly, if you&#x27;re expecting something exfoliating, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to have some kind of sand or beads in it or something.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why this has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> guess she liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice product.feels like its doing something for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much to clean your face because this stuff suds up great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this, price is good, love the convenience of auto shop to my home👍🏻</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>
            <li> Love that it feels gentle but washes wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Liked regenerist scrub better.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is one of the best that I have found for my sensitive skin, and it removes every trace of makeup from my face.</li>
            <li> I tried it based on the review and comments of some men who&#x27;ve had great success with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the best price by far.  </li>
            <li> I am 50+ and this is by far the best exfoliating cleanser I have ever used, and I have used many&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is suitable for Pro-X advance cleansing systems</li>
            <li> of the best natural scrubs recommended is baking soda.</li>
            <li> so Amazon offers it at a great price!</li>
            <li> Loved that it was fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> It has very fine grit in it to polish the skin.  </li>
            <li> It rinses off cleanly and leaves my face feeling really good.</li>
            <li> this makes my skin feels very smooth and health.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe for storing in the shower since it&#x27;s plastic, and it&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate while taking a hot shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is suitable for daily use and it is best to finish up with a moisturizer for guys.</li>
            <li> I prefer my own cleanser that foams a bit more and washes away more easily.</li>
            <li> And I love that it doesn&#x27;t take very much to get a great clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge!</li>
            <li> I have used it for a year and there is a huge difference in the smoothness, softness and brightness of my skin!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena scrub worked better for me.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> My 3 sisters and nieces use this product and also love it.</li>
            <li> I did end up buying the Olay exfoliating spinning brush and that, with this cleanser, is better.</li>
            <li> Having a product which I feel makes my face more able to absorb and use more productivity</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still handsome as I&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
            <li> ~ I love the feel &amp; look of my face, and when I don&#x27;t use it I can tell as my face tends to get an oily sheen that day.  </li>
            <li> I am not the most well-versed in skin care products to be frank with you.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, however, but for the price I think it should be better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I used to use DDF acne facial scrub and that stuff was awesome</li>
            <li> I would like to see about 4 times as many exfoliating beads in this.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This does not burn your eyes as many products do.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li> I use my CLAIRISONIC every day and love it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Olay&#x27;s works just as well</li>
            <li> Love the Dove one.</li>
            <li> My complexion looks more radiant after I use it.  </li>
            <li> I love the exfoliating brush</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this when the time comes.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased my Pro-X Plus, I was given a sample of the Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and it worked wonderfully, so I ordered this larger size.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I will buy this again!:)</li>
            <li> As the next best thing to microdermabrasion in use with the hand held machine and brush.  </li>
            <li> Friends tell me that I have lovely skin, I am 50.</li>
            <li> more like every 3 or 4 days, and</li>
            <li> For exfoliating on a regular basis, this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are going to use this product, it is best to get some sore of facial exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne for years and have found that i really love a lot of the Olay products</li>
            <li> It works and my skin always feels cleaner and looks better after using it.</li>
            <li> glad this was just a sample that came with my Olay exfoliating system</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I use it now two or three times a week because it does smooth out my skin while cleaning and exfoliating without having any breakouts or reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li> love the fact that this leaves my face feeling scrubbed but not looking like it.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I have used more than 2 of these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Pro X brush for 3 years now, and I love the way it cleans my face.</li>
            <li> sure Olay will replace microbeads soon,</li>
            <li> I love the way this cleanser works for me.</li>
            <li> His skin is much better than it was though.</li>
            <li> as do my friends/family that I have  gifted this product to.</li>
            <li> However, I got sticker shock when I looked to buy some more on-line.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Although I had the issue getting out, I was able to finish all.</li>
            <li> There are so many to choose from that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t has to be from Olay for me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a St Ives apricot scrub type feel.</li>
            <li> I love most Olay products though I think a lot of them are overpriced.</li>
            <li> Okay, so she was driving me nuts.</li>
            <li> and I love it!It</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s not horrible either.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone combination skin and most products are too drying for some part of my face.</li>
            <li> Love the ProX line...</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;d admit it.</li>
            <li> should provide more instructions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using this cream, and feel confident recommending it to men.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this cleanser feels.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon but was a rip off.</li>
            <li> Safe to use every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser for more than a month now.  </li>
            <li> I got mine as a gift, and I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love using this with my Olay face scrub brush.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> For an exfoliant, there weren&#x27;t many beads in it at all.</li>
            <li> and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this line of products.</li>
            <li> Love the Olay ProX Exfoliating Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products, they&#x27;re inexpensive and I have found them to work well.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was just hoping it would be more exfoliating than it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have something more exfoliating.</li>
            <li> sister and I love it</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> You can purchase much more cheaper product and have much more job done.</li>
            <li> This has been my most favorite exfoliating cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> More in the summer with sweating etc.</li>
            <li> It breaks my face out even more.</li>
            <li> And most of us consume fish once to twice a week.</li>
            <li> For the very best face cream that tightens skin is actually virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I switched.  </li>
            <li> For more on this problem, google &#x27;5 Gyres microbeads&#x27; or #banthebead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better ways to exfoliate include using  apricot kernel, sugar or salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> But this one works well for me :)</li>
            <li> Love my Olay products.</li>
            <li> I love all the Olay products and also give them as gifts to family and friends.</li>
            <li> My face is noticeably smoother in texture, looks better when not wearing make up and make up glides on smoother.  </li>
            <li> and this does not irritate my skin like many exfoliators do.</li>
            <li> How could a product that can be purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Very excited as to see how this works, will put a review after I have used it for about a week:)</li>
            <li> The exfoliating cleanser is gentle,  but very effective.  </li>
            <li> I feel very clean after I used it.  </li>
            <li> Price was pretty good for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My finer lines and wrinkles have diminished significantly as well, either because they have been buffed off or because my serum is able to absorb better into my skin and work more efficiently</li>
            <li> So worth it!!</li>
            <li> With the Spinning brush, it&#x27;s amazing how quick my skin can regenerate (healing blemishes and demarcation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser because it is mild yet effective.</li>
            <li> Now I have clean skin every night!</li>
            <li> I feel clean and refreshed after use and it lasts!</li>
            <li> Smooth and makes skin feel nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> Very good facial cleanser without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> Olay Exfoliating Facial Cleanser is very good</li>
            <li> Great product: no added perfumes, soft exfoliating beads...</li>
            <li> it was free or I would have been more upset to have to return it to the store.....</li>
            <li> I love how well it exfoliates my face...feels so smooth...</li>
            <li> Love this product after use face feels and looks so smooth.</li>
            <li> Product feels rough on my face and does not do a superb job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> very good.it feels good.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin, but so good on the face.</li>
            <li> The Olay facial cleanser is really good!</li>
            <li> I use the entire system &amp; nothing has ever cleared my face as good as this stuff has!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an olay fragrance-free product and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I am now on auto ship (makes it easy)</li>
            <li> Was delivered very quickly</li>
            <li> and it is easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and found such a great deal on it</li>
            <li> Removes makeup easily.</li>
            <li> , it was easy to finger it as the culprit.</li>
            <li> I love knowing when going to bed that my face is clean and all the elements from the air and makeup</li>
            <li> The exfoliating beads are very mild and I do feel like they exfoliate to some extent, but not to the extent I want or need.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to stay in routine of each day.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the point in paying the huge amount for other types when Olay works so great!</li>
            <li> I think that is an excellent trade-off for any woman who wants healthy and younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> It has noticeably reduced fine lines and colored spots as well as providing a smoother feel.</li>
            <li> how lightly if foamed, as well as how easy it was to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> The grits are so fine that I don&#x27;t think this scrub would damage your skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Gives you a great clean face I love Olay products and I would buy this product again definitely.</li>
            <li> Which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fine lines on my face seem to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is get rid of the very top layer of dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in pores or fine lines, but there I think there is some.  </li>
            <li> I have huge pores and greasy skin, and it makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is perfect for it - Not a harsh abrasive like some of the others.</li>
            <li> I found a great deal on this product, so I bought it at the same time that I bought my Pro-x advanced cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores, acne scars and blotchy skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s widely available, which is great because it&#x27;s only 6 ounces</li>
            <li> This does an amazing job at making my skin soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> It is a fantastic system.</li>
            <li> It is smooth with just a hint of abrasive feel.</li>
            <li> Its light and not too exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I came about this product through a free sample that came along with the Olay cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a light soap, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the whole Pro X cleaning system</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the male reviewer&#x27;s description of how great it worked for him.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and gives a nice glow.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a great addition to my daily skincare ritual.</li>
            <li> My entire experience with Olay products has been great.</li>
            <li> My face feels silky &amp; smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin and is best to use at night before you go to bed in combination with a Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the Olay rotary brush that comes in the Advanced Cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> Great for daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> The exfoliant is gentle and effective.</li>

            <li> Great scrub and facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> My solution is to use the cleanser lightly with a buff puff.  </li>
            <li> product is fantastic, I swear by this exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of this whit the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System one for myself and one for my girlfriend, and we both enjoy using this every morning.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Cleanses very well and I am pleased with this product that cleans my pores better than soap.  </li>
            <li> love that I can use it right in the shower, the cleansing brush</li>
            <li> I use it daily and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li> this works very well !!!</li>
            <li> Very cheap, with can, after all, the price is not expensive</li>
            <li> My face feels clean when finished, and cream goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels fantastic, looks shiny and clean, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves the face feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin so smooth and so clean.</li>
            <li> With a lot of face products you don&#x27;t get much for your money, but this product seems to be pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 and while I have very good skin, my skin is highly sensitive and reactive, and I can&#x27;t use most exfoliators without getting red, inflamed skin.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased with spin brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> Originally saw this on \\&quot;the Doctors\\&quot; recommended by Dr Orden (cosmetic/plastic surgeon).</li>
            <li> For the first time my skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to use with my nutrasonic face cleanser machine but sold it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a unique process in that I need to get my face</li>
            <li> Apparently it works on her gorgeous youthful skin.</li>
            <li> As usual Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get the feeling that it doesn&#x27;t wash off as cleanly as I like, but I have overlooked this and found no evidence [break outs] of there being any cleanser residue on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and olay does not cause breakout.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling beautifully clean.</li>
            <li> Helps minimize pores by keeping them clean.  </li>
            <li> I can see and feel how clean this product makes my skin.</li>
            <li> Ive gone back to the St Ives since it is more effective for me.</li>
            <li> Makes my face sooooo smoth and clean,  my husband loves it too I had to get him some for him.</li>
            <li> an clean  </li>
            <li> My skin feels refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I need a cleanser that will thoroughly clean the oily areas without stripping the drier areas.  </li>
            <li> I just keep telling myself that foam doesn&#x27;t &#x3D; clean.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel super smooth and realy did reduce my pores.</li>
            <li> Nothing else has ever made my face feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Really exfoliates the skin, works great on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> This seems to really clean well.  </li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t like nature or animals, remember that we all depend on a clean environment for our food and water.</li>
            <li> I feel clean and refresh even without putting moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> and it really does a good scrub job without breaking my face out like others with too much cream in them.</li>
            <li> Does not dry up the skin and good for combination skin</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance, not unpleasant but not flowery.</li>
            <li> Being familiar with the product and some other Olay items, I know it&#x27;s an excellent and reasonably priced item.  </li>
            <li> a great benefit is that I noticed after I used this cleanser that my face was more able to absorb my moisturizer and as most women know you can really spend some serious cash in that department.  </li>
            <li> I bought the whole Olay system and while I like the rotating brush to cleanse and love the microbead with the pad attachment, I didn&#x27;t find any significant results from using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> They are always right here!  </li>
            <li> Nice sudsing, and gives the skin a soft, clean feel.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cleanser, but I think it should not be used every night, but a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> has definitely helped my skin looked bright</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for exfoliating but not harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> Olay exfoliating renewal cleanser is a good daily exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a facial product, but this is good to use on a nightly basis.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this but by 10 in the morning</li>
            <li> worked nice even on my sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Really has helped complexion, bought two and glad I did.</li>
            <li> I got a sample with the pro-x cleansing system and absolutely fell in love.</li>
            <li> Its my first day of using it and its amazing!I can feel and see the difference on my face &amp; i told my husband about it and for him to try for sure he will love it as well!Other than that pretty fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Second it does not lather good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much scent which maybe a great thing for many people, but I sort of miss sweet feminine scent of other Olay products though.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the heavy grit that apricot scrubs have, so it&#x27;s more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I give this five stars because I use it and because it was easy to find and not expensive.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about spending big bucks on high end brush cleaner/scrub, so I decided to give this a try and loved it.</li>
            <li> It works well with the cleansing massage head to clean my face, but it gets a funny plastic smell like the vinyl shower curtain (maybe there are vinyl beads!).</li>
            <li> feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exfoliating and gives a clean and fresh result after washing.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel clean, fresh and hydrated</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean and fresh after every wash.</li>
            <li> has a mild warming effect when you rub it on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mild exfoliator</li>
            <li> This makes your face feel so clean, helps remove black heads, great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of the product seems to be high, and I think for many users it is probably perfect--especially given the amount of product provided and price.</li>
            <li> No need for high end products anymore :)</li>
            <li> It seems to always be rated highly in any of the lists I see of &amp;#34;best XXXX skin care product&amp;#34; so I see no reason to pay more and I am seeing the results I want with it.  </li>
            <li> I use it alternately with the Olay Regenerist Crean Cleanser and am very pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li> After using this my skin for the first time my skin got so smooth that I begged my boyfriend to touch my cheek.  </li>
            <li> First time my skin become smooth and velvety after two days of use.</li>
            <li> I first used this with when I got a free sample with my pro x face scrubber macjin.</li>
            <li> When used with a brush, it provides a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and smooth afterwards, ready for moisturizing and make-up, if that&#x27;s your thing.</li>
            <li> The grains in it are very fine, but it still feels like sand on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin fresh and clean - it doesn&#x27;t turn greasy right away after washing (yes, I had problems like that).</li>
            <li> I use this product twice daily and love the clean, smooth feel my face has.</li>
            <li> well that&#x27;s until the oil and shine sets back in, but it really gives you face a good clean.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and no problem with the company who sent it tho!!</li>
            <li> I only discovered it about 6 months ago, but I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this exfoliating cleanser based on all positive reviews for it.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look extra amazing or anything, but I&#x27;m going to give it some time</li>
            <li> Not too harsh or fragrant, great for every day use.</li>
            <li> It lightly exfoliates, and makes your skin brighter and much cleaner looking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this product is a nice exfoliator, but I personally prefer the non-exfoliating Pro-X cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin,and have tried most cleansers out there, including the natural ones.</li>
            <li> well worth buying</li>
            <li> Love ol lay makes my sign feel young</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh, radiant...</li>
            <li> so you will end up getting your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice creamy consistency with enough granules to exfoliate well without being scratchy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth  </li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li> St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]], but still has the properties to refresh my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is also getting more sensitive and thinner.  </li>
            <li> my second time ordering this product, removes blackheads, nice scrub, no drying, but I don&#x27;t like the container</li>
            <li> I mostly use it with the Olay Professional Pro-X cleansing brush, but sometime with just my hands, and either way,.</li>
            <li> However, this cleanser is very gentle and mild, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it.  </li>
            <li> It seems like most of the exfoliation is more due to the exfoliating brush than the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem very effective to try to combine them all into one product, throw a few particles in there, and call it an exfoliant, too.</li>
            <li> Works really well, leaves skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Price is right too</li>
            <li> Right now, this cleanser is #1 on my list.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased it right</li>
            <li> I noticed right away a difference in the condition of my skin, after using the brush.</li>
            <li> Its just right.</li>
            <li> I find the balance of &#x27;grit&#x27; to lotion in just the right balance for my skin.</li>
            <li> Has just the right amount of exfoliation for my skin.</li>
            <li> The first few weeks were great..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty economical person and used to rarely spend over $4 on face wash and cleansers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a lifelong problem best solved with Retin A for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It really does clean and exfoliate well.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s much cheaper on amazon than in most store - it normally goes for 20 + dollars.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but the new RX added to the label didn&#x27;t seem to make it any different than the cheaper exfoliator by Olay.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not bad and it seems to be gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser daily on my 56 year old face since receiving it a couple of months ago and I have to say that I am totally pleased with how it leaves my skin feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> those \\&quot;scrubby micro beads\\&quot; are made of plastic that damage our waterways and health -- and are now banned in certain states (New York, Illinois), with many more states are following suit.</li>
            <li> I personally do not feel safe using anything made in China that can be absorbed through my skin or accidentally ingested while washing my face.</li>
            <li> It works very well with the Olay spin brush, together the dual make an effective facial treatment.</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling dry, and I am so glad to be  done with blemishes.</li>
            <li> But this stuff makes my face feel good and baby soft, especially after shaving</li>
            <li> It really does clean the skin and leaves it feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> gently exfoliates and leaves skin smooth and ready for moisturizing products.  </li>
            <li> Has a slight chemical smell but it is a good non-harsh scrubber.  </li>
            <li> Basically it is a VERY, VERY, VERY gentle exfoliator</li>
            <li> therefore it is very gentle on the skin but the beads still get the cleaning</li>
            <li> This is a very mild exfoliating cleanser, it leaves your skin super soft and smooth, not dry.</li>
            <li> Good cleaner but a little pricey</li>
            <li> , there is little evidence that it is doing me any good</li>
            <li> A parity of foam cleanser, electricity network operators in China website to sell similar paragraph after love is 200 yuan RMB.&lt;br</li>
            <li> polishing effective not very desirable</li>
            <li> Im the first</li>
            <li> it simply makes your skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too fine and doesn&#x27;t remove enough skin for me to quickly get the desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its one of those things where you look in the mirror one day and are surprised by how smooth your skin looks.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a first step to fight off the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works any better than the daily hydrating scrub</li>
            <li> This product has earned my first ever Holy Grail status beauty</li>
            <li> skin has never looked better in my entire life.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth and soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for about 1 month now and my skin looks much cleaner, fresh now.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft and smooth when I got done without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> That being said, when used together they work really well!  </li>
            <li> I really like the ProX brush and cleanser from Olay!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have those issues anymore :) Regular use of this product took care of all those issues!</li>
            <li> Much better price than local stores</li>
            <li> My face texture smoothed out immediately when I first used the cleanser</li>
            <li> I do wish Olay would put more cleaning granules in the facial wash.  </li>
            <li> I turned the tube around to look at the ingredients, and sure enough, sodium.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was brighter after the first use.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a guy.</li>
            <li> use it on my decolletage as well, and it keeps it smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth the $16 I paid.</li>
            <li> Thank you fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the future.  </li>
            <li> This is more like just a regular face wash than something exfoliating.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have those issues anymore :) Regular use of this product took care of all those issues!</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite, especially with the spinning brush.</li>
            <li> And the aftermath is a smoothness and glow that erases all traces of winter&#x27;s once persistent &#x27;flakes&#x27; leaving me with a soft smooth glow that makes applying moisturizer and makeup</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product</li>
            <li> Loved the feel of the cleanser and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Hallelujah, the husband gets to go back to what he was doing originally, and the little woman is in her joy zone.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews on this product, when I saw it on sale at my local store I grabbed it.</li>
            <li> I noticed less break outs which I contribute to the cleanser being able to clean away dirt and oil without drying out my face.  </li>
            <li> Third - results are not so great as I expected for this money.</li>
            <li> My face skin was so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> my skin has become so soft and clean looking...</li>
            <li> The product works wonders, it leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have oily but sensitive skin and this product makes my skin so clean without stripping it.</li>
            <li> You can feel the sand like lotion exfoliating the skin giving you the soft and clean feel.  </li>
            <li> I only need a tiny bit to get a good lather</li>
            <li> and this was so perfect for her, no more  dry face skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s positive review as well as using it with the rest of the proX system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had positive comments from friends and family.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and polished after using this, like I had a really good facial, and yet it isn&#x27;t dried</li>
            <li> It exfoliates incredibly well and is gentle enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Since then it&#x27;s been pretty much status quo.</li>
            <li> Since then it&#x27;s been pretty much status quo.</li>
            <li> the plus side, it does a good job of cleaning -- it gets all my makeup off, including eye makeup (I usually wear mascara and eyeshadow and sometimes liner, and I don&#x27;t have to use a separate eye makeup remover with this cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Olay exfoliating cleanser is as good as, if not better, than the brands found at Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus, etc.  </li>
            <li> But as far as a face wash, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> The last cleansing system I tried was Clinique and this works better and at a decent price</li>
            <li> I bet it is amazing based on other customer reviews!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild enough to use everyday and still effective in exfoliating and the price is right!</li>
            <li> -- I had similar problem with Neutrogena Deep Clean Face Wash, so I guess if you don&#x27;t have problem with that one, this one would be ok.</li>
            <li> Many cleanser either gives me break out and makes my skin too dry and</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have the same great feel as Arbonne, but I actually see a major improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and acne scarring.  </li>
            <li> , that I had a use a large amount.</li>
            <li> Have lived with large pores all my life and gave up years ago in ever reducing them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and still have large pores and breakouts on my face.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser reminds me of Philosophy&#x27;s Microdermabrasion cleanser, they both are clear with the very fine particles that actually do the exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is easily irritated, and this leaves my skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li> my opinion, the most effective way to use this product is to first wet \\&quot;one\\&quot; hand only, then squeeze out a pea size worth of cleanser, rub your hands together and scrub over DRY skin in a circular motion!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a very positive difference in my face&#x27;s skin tone, elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines (although it is not a remarkable difference), and I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, the cleansing beads are small and I think this works well to keep my pores clean.</li>
            <li> too hard on the skin its as good as scrub not</li>
            <li> Even with this minor flaw, I love this cleanser and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have become a huge fan of the Pro-X line, because since I have been using it, my adult acne has completely cleared up and my developing crows feet have receded.  </li>
            <li> I bought the whole Pro X system about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I gently washed my face with it yesterday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a month now, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Note that I have only used this cleanser in conjunction with Olay&#x27;s advanced cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expecting anything else is really the realm of a Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> The grains in this Pro-X exfoliating cleanser really feel abrasive on my skin, in spite of being small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but what I can tell you is that my wife absolutely loves this face cleaning gizmo and the cleanser that goes with it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am prone to break out and this stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether one, two, or all three of these Olay ProX products is the reason for these results, but I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> This product combined with the Pro Scrubber has made a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> but I feel like they&#x27;re not doing much to cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li> I very like this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent much, much more on exfoliating cleansers and have seldom repurchased them.  </li>
            <li> It seems to go really well with the Olay Pro-X Plus in that my face has cleared up and feels so much cleaner and softer.  </li>
            <li> and I swear after just one use my skin felt much softer.</li>
            <li> I really like it but wanted to try the Pro X version.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my face well but is gentle.</li>
            <li> It allows the moisturizer to be absorbed by your skin leaving it dewy and soft.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feel and scent of this face wash.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li> it cleanses very well and has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> When I ran out, I found out how much benefit this cleanser had.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  </li>
            <li> No information on how often or how much to scrub your face when using it.</li>
            <li> may be using too much...</li>
            <li> Cleans well, but drys my face out way too much.</li>
            <li> My whole family has it...</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li> And I use the cleanser six days a week after I work out because my face is really sweaty.  </li>
            <li> It really takes off all your makeup and the residue and/or dirt or oil on your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very watery cleanser.</li>
            <li> The product is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really have problem skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommended using all of the products!</li>
            <li> Olay cleanser really did it for me,it has help my sunspots disapeared so much</li>
            <li> A penny to nickel sized amount gently rubbed in and rinsed.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even more alarming is that because the plastic beads are not biodegradable, toxic chemical pollutants floating in our oceans, attach to the beads.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Not too abrasive and gets really sudsy.  </li>
            <li> Since this product was for my wife, I really can&#x27;t give you a review.</li>
            <li> Not to be missed and if you get the brush it will make a real difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser (with brush) takes off makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Clarisonic system for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not too abrasive and really has made a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this with Olay&#x27;s spinning brush in my morning shower and really like it.  </li>
            <li> BUT it really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Prices the same as stores IF it is free shipping</li>
            <li> Works very well with the Olay brush.</li>
            <li> B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid</li>
            <li> At this time I am only using it approximately 3 times weekly, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I look much younger after washing my face with this product, and my acne is completely GONE -- better than ProActive.</li>
            <li> I was looking into a professional chemical peal, but tried this exfoliating cleaner just to see what it would do &amp; within a week of daily exfoliating, it appears most if not all of my presistent whiteheads are gone.  </li>
            <li> It scrubs without being too harsh and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> I will be returning to the much more expensive but effective exfoliating cleanser Vivant -</li>
            <li> Will purchase more in the  near future.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleaning System, and follow up with Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer in Sensitive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Articles from the New York Times + Chicago Tribune about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illinois is the first state to ban microbeads; CA and NY have proposed bills this year to ban them as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s other exfoliaters at a much lower price and work better.</li>
            <li> I love the product, cleans and leaves skin very soft, does not dry the skin, can be used frequently</li>
            <li> If you want to keep your skin clean, clear, &amp; with a natural glow, this is the product that delivers.</li>
            <li> It has tiny scrubbing beads in it that feel like they really are exfoliating my face and getting it clean.</li>
            <li> micro breads gently massages the face, enough to clean out pores.</li>
            <li> Although I think it&#x27;s a bit more than some other brands.  </li>
            <li> My skin is normal to dry, and this cleanser with the brush gives a clean, fresh finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting the other more pricey hand held cleansing system but after looking at the reviews for the Olay system, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also wondering if perhaps using it every other day rather than every day might be a better idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The micro beads in the cleanser were needed to really deep clean pores.  </li>
            <li> I feel my face really clean when I use it, but I don&#x27;t see any actual results.</li>
            <li> When I clean my face with this stuff, I feel like it is doing just as much as my facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Gives me a deep clean, leaving me with a deep clean.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser with the Olay Cleansing Brush about once a week to remove any make-up residue &amp; to deep clean my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No dull skin with this product!</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for a very strong exfoliating action, I&#x27;d suggest checking out other options.</li>
            <li> The granuals are so small and fine that I don&#x27;t feel the clean or exfoliation</li>
            <li> Many people rave about the skin-renewing benefits of dry brushing using natural bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional product line is truly comparable to the higher priced department store brands, which I also use periodically.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few products since the skin revolution started few years ago, and I find these to be the best so far.</li>
            <li> I look in the mirror and at first think \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li> I have used various other exfoliating products, but I find this one to be both gentle &amp; effective, as well as very affordable.</li>
            <li> It worked to its full potential.</li>
            <li> But when it comes down to it I was looking for a more aggresive scrub and this did not provide what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> New skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of scrubs, and this one is both effective and gentle, as well as affordable, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> So for me, it&#x27;s important to apply this over dry skin.</li>
            <li> With any over the counter cleanser/exfoliating product you should expect it to do a decent job which this product does.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> main use for an exfoliating agent is to help scruff ingrown hair in my beard and neck area to reduce hair bumps.</li>
            <li> Maybe pores shrink as we get older, but I&#x27;m sticking with this cleanser just in case.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, but powerful at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different face washes throughout the years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve picked one and stuck with it consistently.</li>
            <li> younger person (I am in my 60&#x27;s, with combination skin) with oily skin could use it much more frequently, possibly even daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  </li>
            <li> For an exfoliating cleanser, it&#x27;s pretty gentle, but not quite gentle enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both the Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and the Olay Pro-X Plus to anyone who has problems with breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> and i will highly recomend this to every one at my age 45y</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to everyone to try out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years &amp; would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a deep exfoliation, which is nice if you are using other products as well.</li>
            <li> Have been using it once daily for 5 months and my skin is very clear, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> Pro-X seems to be a little better.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t need to use many, just a little...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where I focus my little exfoliator a bit more.  </li>
            <li> It makes my bad skin look flawless....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural girl and don&#x27;t want to fuss too much with my appearance.  </li>
            <li> It can be a very embarrassing situation for adults, but these two product help to clear up my face.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates, yet gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - it&#x27;s been my go to face wash for a few years now.</li>
            <li> You can use this exfoliator everyday, use with the Olay cleansing brush for better exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates and cleans your skin at the same time, leaving a fresh looking face.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a really good scrub this way, it will remove all dead skin cells, make your skin look younger, alive and leaving it ever sooooooo soft!</li>
            <li> I have mild adult acne occasionally and it has lessened by using this as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product, especially if you have the Olay Advanced Cleansing System, which I recently bought and now cannot live without.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and use some expensive but very effective skin products.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> Order at Amazon if you don&#x27;t live close to Walmart.  </li>
            <li> and I need to find a product that would go with my new Olay Pro-X Plus.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become an Olay girl and am always on the lookout for new products.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been slowing trying new things.</li>
            <li> This is a new product to the Olay Pro-X line.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new ones.  </li>
            <li> I have used other high end cleansers (Lancome), but none left my skin looking so smooth and without drying it!  </li>
            <li> I use it with the Pro-X cleansing brush, helps get deep into pores making skin look smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> Use it only at night and feel it really cleans my skin, but in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> My fce felt almost as smooth as it does after a facial at my local day spa.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and really like the cleansing ability of the product, as well as the light exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and, despite the fact that I am a 53-year-old woman, I was still getting blemishes and pimples.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use just any product on my face.</li>
            <li> red blotches to be exact</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> am 52 years old and have normal skin.</li>
            <li> Has cleared my acne and at 51 years old, that is something I have fought since adolescence!</li>
            <li> Keeps my face so soft!</li>
            <li> and you can tell after the first day using this that its starting to exfoliate your skin and bring the dirt to the surface.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> I first starting using this when I bought the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush in or around the Spring of 2012</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and it has cut down on breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product - you only need to use a small amount so it lasts ages.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin too much, but I have an oily compexion to begin with.  </li>
            <li> As an 80+ year old, I&#x27;m not sure I could do any better.</li>
            <li> If you wet your face first, you will not feel the scrub as much.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft when you exfoliate with it, and it helps to clear your face and make it look brighter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique for years and found this to be just as effective in sloughing off the dead and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Love the little hand-held device used to apply it too!</li>
            <li> I bought the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and had a little sample of this.</li>
            <li> On the other hand if you are searching for an every day mild exfoliator then I recommend you purchase.</li>
            <li> and I can clearly see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is supposed to be formulated to be gentle enough to use every day and I have found that to be the case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to give a thumbs up to Amazon for offering this product as a auto ship with at a much lower price then even my local wal-mart.  </li>
            <li> B002UUT392 Olay Professional Pro-X Restorative Cream Cleanser, 5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have been exfoliating for over 20 years and prefer an exfoliator that has enough beads/grit to really feel it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally know much about this</li>
            <li> And for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it my skin feels refreshed and alive.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with acne breakouts, even as an adult</li>
            <li> My face feels soft but not over exfoliated.</li>
            <li> No harsh smell</li>
            <li> I cannot say I like it because I am sensitive to the smell, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> There is considerable amount of that plastic in a tube</li>
            <li> The Olay pro x and Clarisonic brushes will work with natural products just as well as microbeads, and you won&#x27;t be poisoning fish or polluting the water and soil.</li>
            <li> This does the job and does not ever leave my skin irritated or sensitive, and I have&lt;br /&gt;sensitive</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law gave me some Arbonne cleanser which made my skin sooo soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It might be old?</li>
            <li> Face is feels baby soft</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft and looking dewey.  </li>
            <li> I think that one day they will be completely faded away if I continue to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it anyway without the brush and found that it didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> B002UUT38I Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, 6 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> B001JQLNM8 Olay Professional Pro-X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream, 1.7 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive for the apricot scrubs, or the like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is both deep cleaning and gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel so soft and clean--espcially when used with the spin-pro brush.</li>
            <li> had my 51 year old mother and 19 year old sister use it</li>
            <li> Fast service &amp; red&#x27;d.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin fairly soft, and it is unscented.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft &amp; feels cleaner than ever.  </li>
            <li> Complete joke.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have sensitive skin, this is non-irritating for me, &amp; could also be applied using just one&#x27;s fingers rather than the power brush applicator.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t give the same affect.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> B0012J135O Olay Complete Night</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> like that a little goes a long way, making the price a better fit for my tight budget.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling clean without tight skin.</li>
            <li> You can pay a lot more for other similar products, but I don&#x27;t see why you should when this does the same quality cleansing.</li>
            <li> I can use it in shower to remove other makeup like foundation and lip gross etc...and to use to smooth arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your face, or dry face out too much!</li>
            <li> Sloughs off the dead skin cells, and leaves your skin so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product by any means, its just not any different from the lesser priced exfoliator by the same company.</li>
            <li> The cost of this product is a little on the high side for a cleanser, however I did get a really good deal on Amazon and a little goes a long way with the product,  </li>
            <li> Very little is needed and it sinks in nicely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had trouble to clean it afterwards.</li>
            <li> My skin is probably a bit better than average for someone my age, but I was curious what, if anything, this product would do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that after the first month or so, daily use is not really necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that after the first month or so, daily use is not really necessary.</li>
            <li> recently noticed the Olay Pro-X brush that is supposed to be used with this, is only $21.97, it was almost $30 when I first put it in my wish list.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a high quality facial cleanser</li>
            <li> If you live near one, check your local BB&amp;B before purchasing this item from Amazon!</li>
            <li> The sensation I get is what I would expect to feel sandpapering my face with a fine, maybe 600 grit, sandpaper with a little cream mixed in.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is probably my least favorite Pro-X product I have used so far -- I like it, but probably not enough to buy it again since I like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Unbelievable Smooth Cleanser that does not irritate my skin like some products.  </li>
            <li> My sister recently found a new exfoliating cleanser that contains green tea and glycolic acid and says it works much better, although more expensive than the Olay</li>
            <li> I know other reviews have said that it doesn&#x27;t feel rough at all, so this is surely a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product with the new Olay facial bush and it arrived two weeks before the brush.</li>
            <li> Being late for a weekend trip, we had to pack very quickly.</li>
            <li> Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on dry elbows and heels and can see a real difference in these areas.  </li>
            <li> While more expensive than others, this exfoliating cleanser really does the job.  </li>
            <li> in my mid 20s, and it has kept my skin feeling soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I have an Olay battery operated facial scrubber, that I use every morning with the exfoliating cleanser and between the two of them, my face is acne clear with  soft, suple skin.  </li>
            <li> This is better for someone with really sensitive, thin skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I was apprehensive at first, but I was not let down.</li>
            <li> Finally, found a product that I can use on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Well, I can barely see it now!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I bought 2 other Pro X items and they have given me problems - either breakouts or not being absorbed by my skin, but this one is definitely a winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleanser I can say that I can not live without!</li>
            <li> The cleanser by it&#x27;s self is actually a very good exfoliating cleanser that is not to harsh on your face but cleans away the dull dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Just apply a small handful on wet, clean skin and rub in a gentle circular motion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you get the point) with many little scrubbers that are not too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I tried this is because a small bottle comes with the Pro x advanced cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Regular use of this product has given my 69 year old complexion a youthful glow.  </li>
            <li> and I really need to work to spread it over my face because it tries to stay in the shape that I squirted out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> He has had marked improvement on his teen acne.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and even the acne scars are starting to disappear.  </li>
            <li> The Olay cleansers I have tried have always left my skin feeling soft, refreshed, and without overdrying.</li>
            <li> B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]].</li>
            <li> I look far younger than I am.  </li>
            <li> I have tired many fragrance-free products before and none have ever delivered on their claims.  </li>
            <li> She loved it, and was going crazy trying to find the replacement cream for the kit.</li>
            <li> my skin is soft and without any sign of my high-duty mineral sunscreen and make up, which was not happening with any other sensitive skin cleaning lotions I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> A very small amount massaged into the skin produces a smooth surface after rinsing off.</li>
            <li> This has little cleansing grains in it which does a much better job without being too harsh</li>
            <li> /&gt;This removes that dead dull surface layer to reveal the healthy new skin underneath without drying.  </li>
            <li> They absorb toxic chemicals in those waters and can be mistaken by wildlife as food.&lt;br /&gt;There are alternatives to the microbeads that are natural such as ground seeds or nuts (walnut, almond powders might be listed in the facial scrub ingredients).</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanser keep the skin moistured and does not dry up the face after washing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and am surprised to say it really has made a noticeable improvement in the appearance and overall health of my skin, which is now a little lighter and brighter in color and softer in texture.</li>
            <li> I am 38 and have very temperamental skin that flares up due to various reasons.  </li>
            <li> As I have aged, my 40+ year old facial skin has developed a lot of whiteheads on my cheeks, forhead, and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but on the other hand is not exactly a walk in the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But my mind is very curious and sometimes doubts if it really is cleaning because it lacks the foam/lather of a traditional soap.</li>
            <li> I have have dry, flaky skin when I don&#x27;t regularly exfoliate (plus I live in the north).  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product based on other reviews but was thoroughly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product for dry or sensitive skin.......</li>
            <li> Is about a half a teaspoon too much?  </li>
            <li> This cleanser, used daily, keeps you face clear of the dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> product does not seem to have those beads or particles (or at least enough of them in an adequate size to exfoliate my man skin).</li>
            <li> Not to much and not too little of exfoliating &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in this solution.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling so clean its almost dry, which is what I was looking for as my skin has been on oily side lately.</li>
            <li> amazes me about this product is how effectively it cleans and removes dead skin cells without drying out or irritating my face.</li>
            <li> amazes me about this product is how effectively it cleans and removes dead skin cells without drying out or irritating my face.</li>
            <li> Olay ProX products may be a little, tiny bit on the pricey side, but they cost much less here on Amazon.com (which offers a 15% subscription discount to make the prices even less) than many other stores.</li>
            <li> I use a buff puff once a week for a better exfoliation but this alone on the other days was not great.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of other Olay products and like them so far.</li>
            <li> Since you only use a small amount each time, product should last for a reasonable period.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews my expectations were a little high, this product did not seem to work as well on my skin type as I would hope.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way not to use too much at a time, and not to use it too vigorously, as it does remove old dry skin and can cause irritation and redness.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one has *very* small and fine grains in it, so it&#x27;s extremely gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Loooooooooove this facial cleanser!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dry, red, itchy, peeling patches of skin before on my face</li>
            <li> I admit, I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t really like taking the time to use the spinning brush on my face</li>
            <li> I waited this long to write reviews to allow enough time for these ProX products to do what they claim.</li>
            <li> but the tube seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> One tube will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> You never want to get this product near your eyes or you will be flushing your eyes for a half an hour to stop them from stinging.</li>
            <li> I was starting to feel like my skin on my face was dry</li>
            <li> My face was broken out when I started using the cleanser, but it quickly cleared up, and I&#x27;ve not had a breakout since.  </li>
            <li> The only other exfoliating cleanser I have ever used regularly was [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Found I needed this exfoliating cleanser, used with the Pro X Clear, to manage the milia that were continually breaking out (tiny white hard deposits just under the skin)  </li>
            <li> I use this twice a day every day and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I suffered from severe acne for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I simply massage it into skin with my fingertips and occasionally use a small facial pad for extra exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I think it was to harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One thing you must be careful not to use on your eyes area because my eyes area turned in red for days and itched.</li>
            <li> and I have used it for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;can be used everyday.</li>
            <li> I had to call the manufacturer to ask how ofter it should be used because there are no CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS for use.  </li>
            <li> Broken, right at the dispensing hole and cap, so I cannot close the lid.  </li>
            <li> There are tiny little granules in the cleanser which exfoliate moderately well.</li>
            <li> so it lasts longer than other products I&#x27;ve tried of similar size.</li>
            <li> Did not notice a big difference from the other olay exfoliator that is cheaper and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I went online and researched the other ingredients (what a test of your typing skills they are), and found that the third ingredient is what&#x27;s know as a zwitterion (sounds like an other-worldly name for a species of Twitter users, huh?).</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> And it won&#x27;t dry you out.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> My face skin got so dry after using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> cleans without leaving my face feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> good/wet, dry it and then put this onto dry skin, in order for it to lather.&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
            <li> The directions basically say wash your face and pat dry.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve been using moisturizer twice a day, my skin has been really dry for quite a ling time.</li>
            <li> So imagine my surprise when I started noticing dry, flaky spots around my temples and jaw line.</li>
            <li> Dry and flaky?</li>
            <li> I had dry, itchy, peeling patches of skin before on my face</li>
            <li> At least the exfoliating beads are gritty as opposed to some of the round soft beads that are even more useless.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will buy it again or just try using my typical cleansers with my brush to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> but this 6 oz. tube will last a long time when having to use such a small dab to do the job.</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m not prone to break outs</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really clean my face but left a greasy residue that made my face still feel dirty.</li>
            <li> We learned further that once these plastics are washed down the drain, it ends up in the ocean killing marine life.</li>
            <li> although I use such a small amount, I expect my 6 oz tube to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side, I would HIGHLY recommend this product if you have very oily skin like me.</li>
            <li> works well, tube last awhile, only small amount needed.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating particles are small enough, but I don&#x27;t think there is enough exfoliation provided by this cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin was actually softer and looked less lizard like.  </li>
            <li> My niece has very dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to try and stay away from the Sephora brand skin care due to the money I feel I&#x27;m throwing down the drain and have come back to Olay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Chamfer cleanser has granular, wash after little tension, slippery, I use once or twice a week, later will consider buying.</li>
            <li> but the oil gets stuck below the surface creating little tiny blackheads on my nose and whiteheads on my chin.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt softer, smoother and got a little red color after I used it.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week with the little battery operated facial scrubber.</li>
            <li> The last 3 products with exfoliate that I tried were either too creamy and would not wash off, too rough, or did not clean well.  </li>
            <li> and this does not over dry my skin as other scrubs.</li>
            <li> FIrstly the beads in this cleanser are so small and sparse they hardly do any &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t foam at all</li>
            <li> Okay, bad joke on the title.</li>
            <li> My skin actually feels dryer after I use this even though it&#x27;s supposed to be getting rid of a layer of dead skin cells, making my skin softer.</li>
            <li> Its not too rough.</li>
            <li> There is not much foam</li>
            <li> After over four months the tube is now almost empty.</li>
            <li> while longer.be is now almost empty.</li>
            <li> Essentially what it&#x27;s missing is the sodium dodecyl sulfate that creates foam.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few that actually does what it describes.</li>
            <li> initially used it once every few days alternating with a Neutrogena&#x27;s brightening face cleanser, but I may just make the permanent switch once I run out.</li>
            <li> but it is not too rough.  </li>
            <li> This is truly alarming.</li>
            <li> , they make it all the way from our sinks into our lakes and rivers.</li>
            <li> This product worked as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I would not use it daily, probably too harsh, but every other day.</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer stated, this product should last quite some time because less than a dime-sized dose takes care of my face, neck, throat, and hands</li>
            <li> but I had no positive results with this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your face tingly or feeling red and raw after (like apricot scrubs do)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to</li>
            <li> Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser can be used with the Olay brush or with other cleaning face brushes and works just as well when you use the product as a stand</li>
            <li> My face is softer and my acne is is minimal!</li>
            <li> I use this every other night before bed and follow up with the Olay moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and at night after I take off my makeup, followed by other Olay products.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was peeling due to the winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique for Men for over 2 decades and have tried other products from time to time.</li>
            <li> A small amount just wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower every other day or so.  </li>
            <li> I know you have to give it some time, but I have had immediate results from my other Oil of Olay products.</li>
            <li> I use honey and lemon.and other stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fifty-something year-old man and, therefore, not exactly the target group</li>
            <li> Then, I get red blemishes and sometimes even small bruises.</li>
            <li> My face is a giant oil slick.</li>
            <li> You only get a small tester renewal cleanser with your purchase.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve heard it works for a lot of other women just bit myself</li>
            <li> 1 tube usually lasts me several (6+) months.</li>
            <li> A merry go round of skin products later still no significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> there are very few gritty exfoliating bits in the creamy cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it might be a bit drying but haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference between the two products.  </li>
            <li> My skin has always been sensitive, troubled, and oily; as I approach my mid 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I combine this other Olay/Covergirl face products, and have found that my face looks clearer, and less shiny than it has in some time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Remember a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A few years back, I bought her a kit that contained a small tube of this stuff and a battery-operated cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice daily</li>
            <li> Zwitterions are commonly known as inner salts.</li>
            <li> I do not know a ton about facial creams and exfoliators, but the one thing I do think I know is that all of the exfoliators I have tried in the past has some sort of beads or particles in them to scrub away the dead</li>
            <li> this also tones the skin to remove any dark spots.</li>
            <li> Must be stored upside down.  </li>
            <li> But the breakouts never settled down after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic beads, when washed down our drains, are polluting our oceans and waterways.</li>
            <li> This led me down the Olay path of skin care</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep trying other Olay products though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to spend less on my day to day skin care maintenance and save the difference for a laser treatment down the road.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount for each use</li>
            <li> It does have VERY VERY small ones, definitely not enough to exfoliate or scrub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong exfoliant, so if you are used to using exfoliating products, I would recommend you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> and it contained larger beads that were actually less irritating for me; they rolled over my skin instead of feeling microscopically rough.  </li>
            <li> I typically use an exfoliant 4-5 times/week.</li>
            <li> Once we got to check in and unpack, my friend noticed that the exfoliating cleanser had poured all over her black shirt.</li>
            <li> I found a knockoff scrub cleanser at Target that costs a lot less than the Olay</li>
            <li> Gave the half used tube to my daughter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my experience that even with expensive exfoliating cleansers,  NONE put enough granules in their cleansers to properly exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> But they are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My Rosacea flare-ups have become fewer and my skin stays calmer since using this along with the brush and my skin feels smoother and looks less congested (fewer blackheads visible).  </li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and less reddish with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also scent less</li>
            <li> I typically use this 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> With this routine, I have smoother skin and less breakouts and redness.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother, and feels less tight.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few brands expensive and less expensive, I have found this to do the most for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that this product, being a brand name, feels so cheap.</li>
            <li> Skin becomes tight.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again because it dries out my skin, and causes it to feel tight and irritated</li>
            <li> Also my face felt greasy and not clean.</li>
            <li> Does not dry skin and did not find it irritating.  </li>
            <li> I use a little squirt every day on the cleansing brush, this tube has lasted me over a year.</li>
            <li> There was little information about this product and no directions at all.  </li>
            <li> It appears that this was a known issue before it was shipped as there was a little plastic plug inserted into hole.  </li>
            <li> Will last for 3 months at least!</li>
            <li> With that said I needed a little help with my pores now that I am aging.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing, she found real small pieces of plastics and when we checked further into the mystery we found out the name of those plastics; POLYETHYLENE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little embarrassed to review, let alone admit using, this product.</li>
            <li> Any little thing I see coming out, I pick it.</li>
            <li> Works well with their little machine</li>
            <li> I usually just use the procare brush with my other face soap and it exfoliates just as well.</li>
            <li> It really does help with exfoliation, does not have any artificial fragrances</li>
            <li> This dried my face out.</li>
            <li> The beads within the cleanser are extremely harsh.</li>
            <li> I use it with the rotating brush everyday.</li>
            <li> Those looking for a grittier, heavy duty scrub should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Works well removing dead skin and makeup.</li>
            <li> Im a firm believer</li>
            <li> I tried the Dove Exfoliating cleanser from my friend for few times and it worked so well.</li>
            <li> This dried out my face; therefore, I&#x27;m giving it two stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to wash off completely and stings if any accidentally gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sensitive, troubled, and combination.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, the beads in this cleanser are not even ROUND --they</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as harsh as the [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE</li>
            <li> It has a really harsh, artificial-chemical type smell.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m so tired of trying different skin care products!!!)</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, my face is a lot smoother, and isn&#x27;t as dried as before.</li>
            <li> First of all it has very weird scent.</li>
            <li> Not gritty or irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> Had an olay cleanser earlier and was not happy with that one.</li>
            <li> Then a few weeks ago I added a variety of Olay products to do battle.  </li>
            <li> Other face washes are either too creamy feeling or not effective.</li>
            <li> I used this product one time and it made My chin breakout pretty bad...</li>
            <li> It also broke me out pretty bad on my cheeks and a bit on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a skincare product expert due to the fact that I have literally TRIED IT ALL!!!  </li>
            <li> starters, the bottle is well designed and tough (it holds shape) with a sturdy pop-top that makes a robust \\&quot;SNAP\\&quot; when closed.</li>
            <li> However, I feel that there is probably something lacking with this skin product - or my skin is really that bad.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to order (lack or small amount of abrasives).</li>
            <li> ~ it&#x27;s like getting an expensive facial every day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Olay ProX Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, as well as the Olay ProX Skin Tightening Serum and Olay ProX Age Repair Lotion, for the past 2-1/2 months.</li>
            <li> Expensive and low quality.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount does well.</li>
            <li> No more blackheads or whiteheads!&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face is an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day, usually at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li> Dead skin out!</li>
            <li> polyethylene beads are so small, they don&#x27;t get filtered out in the sewage system, and end up being \\&quot;fish food\\&quot;, showing up in marine life, which in turn, we eat.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I got he sam e results as the expensive facial.</li>
            <li> This product is very harsh, which should be noted.  </li>
            <li> I feel bad in giving this product a one because of all the high reviews</li>
            <li> Exfoliates gently, small  beads don&#x27;t scratch delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been on long term steroid therapy combined with winter&#x27;s harsh wind and cold made my face drier than the Sahara Desert.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made me break out incredibly hard after using this.</li>
            <li> It was hard to push out the lotion.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower as I have a hard time rinsing anything like this off my face when washing at a sink.  </li>
            <li> There are little scrubby things in this that make me feel like I am exfoliating my skin without irritating it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 2-3 years and it met my expectation.</li>
            <li> At least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most, if not all, of the product&#x27;s benefits were achieved after about a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for that reason alone that I&#x27;ll keep using it for at least a</li>
            <li> At least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most, if not all, of the product&#x27;s benefits were achieved after about a month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for that reason alone that I&#x27;ll keep using it for at least a while longer.</li>
            <li> but I was not thrilled with this.</li>
            <li> I use this both in the am and pm and use it with the pro-x cleansing system at least 5 times a week.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not amazing either.</li>
            <li> For me, winter flakes are a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> (actually half price)!!!  </li>
            <li> To me, this is NOT AT ALL gritty, but I mean that in a bad way.</li>
            <li> A little expensive but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> However, when we opened it the smell is not good and sounds like an expired product.</li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> To me this is not a good product.</li>
            <li> I know it is very late to leave this comment, but I bought it as a gift to my mom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this product was returned or broken</li>
            <li> At 50, I was still annoyed by blemishes.</li>
            <li> and you can see it for yourself, scary to say the least.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin would break out even WORSE after using this.</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any irritation.  </li>
            <li> It sloughs as needed without tearing up or irritating my face.</li>
            <li> I suffer from cystic acne, but since I started using this product along with the pro x brush, I have noticed a dramatic difference in my face,  my breakouts are disappearing</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this Pro-X Cleanser because I&#x27;d just finished a tube of [[ASIN:B001G7PZRY Olay Definity Pore</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I heard they discontinued the Dove one.</li>
            <li> is startling, and has made me stop using the cleanser</li>
            <li> Not perfect skin, but not a perfect washing routine</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical before buying this one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Seriously!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Olay exfoliating cleansers with horrible results.  </li>
            <li> Even though polyethylene is not poisonous, why ingest artificial plastics?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend for troubled skin!</li>
            <li> Like there was an unpleasant film on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Uses microbeads, bad for the environment.</li>
            <li> I threw it away when I found out (also bad for environment).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so disappointed about this product, and I do not want to buy any cosmetics products on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> However for a exfoliator I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I cannot Rate a product I never got :(</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> Worst cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A parity of foam cleanser, electricity network operators in China website to sell similar paragraph after love is 200 yuan RMB.&lt;br /&gt;Chamfer cleanser has granular, wash after little tension, slippery, I use once or twice a week, later will consider buying.</li>
            <li> I use a little squirt every day on the cleansing brush, this tube has lasted me over a year.</li>
            <li> This dried my face out. Neutrogena scrub worked better for me.</li>
            <li> Finally!! And exfoliating wash that doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m scrubbing my skin with sand paper! My skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> Good exfoliator (made-up that word but you get the point) with many little scrubbers that are not too harsh for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> works great. I have huge pores and greasy skin, and it makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole Pro X system about a month ago.  This is just a refill.  It is a fantastic system.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to it&#x27;s positive review as well as using it with the rest of the proX system. I hate this product. Not only did it irritate my skin, my skin began breaking out in earnest. The beads within the cleanser are extremely harsh. You never want to get this product near your eyes or you will be flushing your eyes for a half an hour to stop them from stinging. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I use this with the olay brush, and it really is amazing. My skin is smooth and it has cut down on breakouts.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling so clean its almost dry, which is what I was looking for as my skin has been on oily side lately.</li>
            <li> Liked regenerist scrub better.</li>
            <li> There was little information about this product and no directions at all.  I gently washed my face with it yesterday am and today my face is still red and sore.  This product is very harsh, which should be noted.  Use with care!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - it&#x27;s been my go to face wash for a few years now. It&#x27;s nice for exfoliating but not harsh or drying. I use it daily with and without my Olay face brush.</li>
            <li> Love this product - great cleanser. I use it with the Pro-X cleansing brush, helps get deep into pores making skin look smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> polishing effective not very desirable</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, my face feels so smooth after.</li>
            <li> Regular use of this product has given my 69 year old complexion a youthful glow.  I use it with the rotating brush everyday. It has noticeably reduced fine lines and colored spots as well as providing a smoother feel.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to order (lack or small amount of abrasives). But I tried it anyway and I am glad I did. I have sensitive skin and this is perfect for it - Not a harsh abrasive like some of the others. It is smooth with just a hint of abrasive feel. A very small amount massaged into the skin produces a smooth surface after rinsing off. Would buy again but this 6 oz. tube will last a long time when having to use such a small dab to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a month now, and I really like it.  Unlike other exfoliating scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one has *very* small and fine grains in it, so it&#x27;s extremely gentle on your skin.  I have sensitive skin that is easily irritated, and this leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you make sure that you cover each area of your face thoroughly, it also does an excellent job of removing makeup/foundation.  I&#x27;ve also tried this with my Clarisonic Mia, and it works great with it since the scrub is so gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be re-purchasing this when mine runs out!</li>
            <li> Ability to use this product daily.  No parabens and no fragrance.  Would prefer to have it in glass jar.</li>
            <li> The Olay facial cleanser is really good! My face feels clean when finished, and cream goes on smoothly. Love the little hand-held device used to apply it too!</li>
            <li> I found a great deal on this product, so I bought it at the same time that I bought my Pro-x advanced cleansing system. Note that I have only used this cleanser in conjunction with Olay&#x27;s advanced cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the bottle is well designed and tough (it holds shape) with a sturdy pop-top that makes a robust \\&quot;SNAP\\&quot; when closed. This reassures me that no water or air is going to get into the bottle and degrade the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much to clean your face because this stuff suds up great. There are tiny little granules in the cleanser which exfoliate moderately well. Those looking for a grittier, heavy duty scrub should look elsewhere. The cleanser itself does not smell that nice, but I suppose that I would prefer there not being any fragrances added to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is supposed to be formulated to be gentle enough to use every day and I have found that to be the case. It is not overly drying or scrubby. Sometimes I get the feeling that it doesn&#x27;t wash off as cleanly as I like, but I have overlooked this and found no evidence [break outs] of there being any cleanser residue on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product, especially if you have the Olay Advanced Cleansing System, which I recently bought and now cannot live without.</li>
            <li> I like it- Its light and not too exfoliating.</li>
            <li> WORKS ABOUT LIKE OTHERS FOR SALE.  HAVE YET TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND THAT YOU CAN AFFORD SO WILL PROBABLY NOT REORDER</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT cleanser and exfoliant for 50+ women like me. It makes my skin look smother and healthier. Vicki</li>
            <li> This is probably the best exfoliator I have ever purchased!  It makes my bad skin look flawless....I have huge pores, acne scars and blotchy skin.  I have used other high end cleansers (Lancome), but none left my skin looking so smooth and without drying it!  This product is so affordable and does a superb job, I am thrilled to have found it.  I highly recommend this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Works well removing dead skin and makeup. A harsher product could cause problems. With any over the counter cleanser/exfoliating product you should expect it to do a decent job which this product does. Expecting anything else is really the realm of a Dermatologist. My 3 sisters and nieces use this product and also love it.</li>
            <li> I have have dry, flaky skin when I don&#x27;t regularly exfoliate (plus I live in the north).  I have been using Philosophy&#x27;s exfoliating facial cleanser for a couple of years and like the grittiness of that cleanser, but find that it was inconsistent in texture (sometimes too gritty, sometimes no grit at all) so I wanted to try something new. To me, this is NOT AT ALL gritty, but I mean that in a bad way. The micro-beads are so micro I don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re there. To give you some perspective I think the St. Ives peach exfoliating cream is too gritty (oww!) and this is not gritty enough, with the Philosophy product being in between. I use a buff puff once a week for a better exfoliation but this alone on the other days was not great. I did end up buying the Olay exfoliating spinning brush and that, with this cleanser, is better. I feel like my flakes are under control and would then give this product 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I came about this product through a free sample that came along with the Olay cleaning brush.  The two were meant to be used as a pair but both can be used separately.  The cleanser by it&#x27;s self is actually a very good exfoliating cleanser that is not to harsh on your face but cleans away the dull dead skin cells.  I noticed less break outs which I contribute to the cleanser being able to clean away dirt and oil without drying out my face.  Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser can be used with the Olay brush or with other cleaning face brushes and works just as well when you use the product as a stand alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a great benefit is that I noticed after I used this cleanser that my face was more able to absorb my moisturizer and as most women know you can really spend some serious cash in that department.  Having a product which I feel makes my face more able to absorb and use more productivity my moisturizer is a BIG plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to give a thumbs up to Amazon for offering this product as a auto ship with at a much lower price then even my local wal-mart.  I save almost $8 a bottle with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I know it is very late to leave this comment, but I bought it as a gift to my mom. However, when we opened it the smell is not good and sounds like an expired product. My mom threw it away immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed about this product, and I do not want to buy any cosmetics products on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I use this product twice daily and love the clean, smooth feel my face has. This is a light soap, not greasy. It has a light fragrance, not unpleasant but not flowery. It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliate. This is the best price I can find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it works. I&#x27;m still handsome as I&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
            <li> works well, tube last awhile, only small amount needed.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! My face is softer and my acne is is minimal!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for about 8 weeks now ~ I love the feel &amp; look of my face, and when I don&#x27;t use it I can tell as my face tends to get an oily sheen that day.  I combine this other Olay/Covergirl face products, and have found that my face looks clearer, and less shiny than it has in some time.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the whole Pro X cleaning system ~ it&#x27;s like getting an expensive facial every day.</li>
            <li> I am not the most well-versed in skin care products to be frank with you. However, I feel that there is probably something lacking with this skin product - or my skin is really that bad. It gets the job done, however, but for the price I think it should be better.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this yet, but I just received this today! Very excited as to see how this works, will put a review after I have used it for about a week:) I bet it is amazing based on other customer reviews!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay Regenerist and Difinity cleansers for years.  Just now started with Pro-X.  Pro-X seems to be a little better.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Decent product. Does not dry out my skin. My skin doesn&#x27;t look extra amazing or anything, but I&#x27;m going to give it some time and then if it does improve after some time, I&#x27;ll come back and update this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with the new Olay facial bush and it arrived two weeks before the brush. By itself I thought it was a good product, but with the bush it is amazing! Use it only at night and feel it really cleans my skin, but in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> The product are plenty for that amount. Although I think it&#x27;s a bit more than some other brands.  Order at Amazon if you don&#x27;t live close to Walmart.  Great site.</li>
            <li> Works well with an exfoliating glove.  Does not dry out my skin too much, but I have an oily compexion to begin with.  I only need a tiny bit to get a good lather so it lasts longer than other products I&#x27;ve tried of similar size.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush with this..put it in my shower and it all works great..my face is clearing up of things that were deep under the skin.  Nice product..what else do you expect from Olay</li>
            <li> While more expensive than others, this exfoliating cleanser really does the job.  I use it alternately with the Olay Regenerist Crean Cleanser and am very pleased with the result.  As an 80+ year old, I&#x27;m not sure I could do any better.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I purchased this based on the male reviewer&#x27;s description of how great it worked for him. I use this every other night before bed and follow up with the Olay moisturizing cream. My skin is bright and very healthy looking. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have become a huge fan of the Pro-X line, because since I have been using it, my adult acne has completely cleared up and my developing crows feet have receded.  Yippee!  This is probably my least favorite Pro-X product I have used so far -- I like it, but probably not enough to buy it again since I like the [[ASIN:B002UUT392 Olay Professional Pro-X Restorative Cream Cleanser, 5 Ounce]] better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser has a nice, gel-like texture.  For an exfoliating cleanser, it&#x27;s pretty gentle, but not quite gentle enough for me.  The grains in it are very fine, but it still feels like sand on my sensitive skin.  I know other reviews have said that it doesn&#x27;t feel rough at all, so this is surely a matter of personal preference.  The only other exfoliating cleanser I have ever used regularly was [[ASIN:B0009EILLM Biore Pore Perfect Pore Unclogging Scrub , 5 oz (141 g)]], and it contained larger beads that were actually less irritating for me; they rolled over my skin instead of feeling microscopically rough.  The grains in this Pro-X exfoliating cleanser really feel abrasive on my skin, in spite of being small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it does a good job of cleaning -- it gets all my makeup off, including eye makeup (I usually wear mascara and eyeshadow and sometimes liner, and I don&#x27;t have to use a separate eye makeup remover with this cleanser).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this product is a nice exfoliator, but I personally prefer the non-exfoliating Pro-X cleanser.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for a good scrub, this one might be for you!</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional product line is truly comparable to the higher priced department store brands, which I also use periodically. This cleanser is one of the best that I have found for my sensitive skin, and it removes every trace of makeup from my face. I learned about this product line from a Consumer Reports study that rated this Olay line very high, and I agree that it is the best value around for skin care.</li>
            <li> had a $5 coupon from Olay and bought this for $15 (20-5) at CVS yesterday.  Love it.  My fce felt almost as smooth as it does after a facial at my local day spa.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not notice a big difference from the other olay exfoliator that is cheaper and works just as well. It is a good product, but the new RX added to the label didn&#x27;t seem to make it any different than the cheaper exfoliator by Olay. It&#x27;s not a bad product by any means, its just not any different from the lesser priced exfoliator by the same company. Fast shipping and no problem with the company who sent it tho!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have been exfoliating for over 20 years and prefer an exfoliator that has enough beads/grit to really feel it.  After reading so many positive reviews on this product, when I saw it on sale at my local store I grabbed it. I put some on my fingers and could tell almost immediately that because of the creamy texture it wasn&#x27;t likely to work for me.  I went ahead and applied it and as suspected there are very few gritty exfoliating bits in the creamy cleanser.  Basically it was a creamy foaming cleanser that gives you about 1 tiny gritty bit per 1/2 square inch.  I used to use DDF acne facial scrub and that stuff was awesome (it kind of felt like a fine sugar scrub and worked great but it was discontinued) but this stuff just doesn&#x27;t contain nearly enough actual exfoliator. At least the exfoliating beads are gritty as opposed to some of the round soft beads that are even more useless. I would like to see about 4 times as many exfoliating beads in this.  I did like the texture of the cream cleanser, how lightly if foamed, as well as how easy it was to rinse off.  But when it comes down to it I was looking for a more aggresive scrub and this did not provide what I was looking for.  However, I will give it credit for being a really good cleanser as it did a great job of getting off all my makeup and not leaving any makeup residue on my skin. And it won&#x27;t dry you out.  Basically it is a VERY, VERY, VERY gentle exfoliator but it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally know much about this but what I can tell you is that my wife absolutely loves this face cleaning gizmo and the cleanser that goes with it. What a teriffic hit of a gift!</li>
            <li> Broken, right at the dispensing hole and cap, so I cannot close the lid.  Must be stored upside down.  It appears that this was a known issue before it was shipped as there was a little plastic plug inserted into hole.  I&#x27;m guessing this product was returned or broken which is why it is on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great light exfoliant and affordable. I use with the pro-x brush to wash my face. I am glad I tried this before buying expensive products.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.  Works well with the Olay pro-x cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and really like the cleansing ability of the product, as well as the light exfoliation.  I use it in the shower and at night after I take off my makeup, followed by other Olay products.  This is a name you can trust and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make it red.  You can pay a lot more for other similar products, but I don&#x27;t see why you should when this does the same quality cleansing. I&#x27;ve used Clinique for years and found this to be just as effective in sloughing off the dead and dry skin.  Give it a try and see.</li>
            <li> Great product: no added perfumes, soft exfoliating beads...my skin is soft and without any sign of my high-duty mineral sunscreen and make up, which was not happening with any other sensitive skin cleaning lotions I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin I used this product one time and it made My chin breakout pretty bad... red blotches to be exact thank goodness it was a sample that came with another product and it was free or I would have been more upset to have to return it to the store..... I do not recommend this product for dry or sensitive skin.......</li>
            <li> Very cheap, with can, after all, the price is not expensive</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my skin. I was extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made me break out incredibly hard after using this. I understand that sometimes this happens when you switch products. But the breakouts never settled down after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threw it in the trash at the halfway point.</li>
            <li> I use it with Olay exfoliating brush. I am happy with the purchase and product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought the facial brush to go with it. I stopped going in for facials. I also bought a really good mask as well. This does not burn your eyes as many products do.</li>
            <li> Everybody should have this. I used it a couple of times a week to exfoliate. It is gentle and gives a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Im the first the admit I dont take great care of my skin...AT ALL! I was starting to feel like my skin on my face was dry and it was peeling due to the winter months. I am prone to break out and this stuff really does the trick. My face feels clean and olay does not cause breakout. My mom has used OLAY for years and years...and she takes great care of her face. Im a firm believer that OLAY products work because people ask if my mom and I are sisters. I now use Olay cleaning products and lotion...I CAN see the difference it makes! Will recommend, will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Olay ProX Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, as well as the Olay ProX Skin Tightening Serum and Olay ProX Age Repair Lotion, for the past 2-1/2 months. I waited this long to write reviews to allow enough time for these ProX products to do what they claim. I have noticed a very positive difference in my face&#x27;s skin tone, elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines (although it is not a remarkable difference), and I am extremely pleased with the results. I have very sensitive skin and, despite the fact that I am a 53-year-old woman, I was still getting blemishes and pimples. Once I started using these products, I no longer got any blemishes or pimples, and none of these ProX products have caused any skin reactions, blotches, irritation, etc. I have used quite a few products since the skin revolution started few years ago, and I find these to be the best so far. Olay ProX products may be a little, tiny bit on the pricey side, but they cost much less here on Amazon.com (which offers a 15% subscription discount to make the prices even less) than many other stores. I&#x27;m not sure whether one, two, or all three of these Olay ProX products is the reason for these results, but I&#x27;m very pleased and I will continue to use these items.</li>
            <li> This product combined with the Pro Scrubber has made a real difference in my skin. I would strongly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve had positive comments from friends and family.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  The grits are so fine that I don&#x27;t think this scrub would damage your skin at all.  After using this my skin for the first time my skin got so smooth that I begged my boyfriend to touch my cheek.  If you are hoping to remove water proof eye makeup, this does nothing to them, but I like that I can use it in shower to remove other makeup like foundation and lip gross etc...and to use to smooth arms and legs.  It doesn&#x27;t have much scent which maybe a great thing for many people, but I sort of miss sweet feminine scent of other Olay products though.  All in all, this is a great addition to my daily skincare ritual.</li>
            <li> I use my CLAIRISONIC every day and love it...I&#x27;m sure Olay&#x27;s works just as well but I had mine before they came out with their version.  This product works just as well as the CLAIRISONIC exfoliater AND IS A LOT CHEAPER!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this Pro-X Cleanser because I&#x27;d just finished a tube of [[ASIN:B001G7PZRY Olay Definity Pore Redefining Scrub, 5 fl oz (150 ml) Bottles (Pack of 2)]] and found it drying and a bit too abrasive. However, this Pro-X Exfoliating Cleanser is perfect: it is a scrub but behaves like a conditioning polish. As a previous reviewer stated, this product should last quite some time because less than a dime-sized dose takes care of my face, neck, throat, and hands (yes, I use it on my hands and have seen improvement on them, too!)</li>
            <li> works.. face feels beautiful</li>
            <li> Unbelievable Smooth Cleanser that does not irritate my skin like some products.  Goes on the face very nicely and works great with the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  At this time I am only using it approximately 3 times weekly, but I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  I have gone to spas and gotten many facials before, and I feel this leaves my face feeling as good as a spa you have to go out to.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Price was pretty good for the size of the bottle. With a lot of face products you don&#x27;t get much for your money, but this product seems to be pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> great results with the face cleaning electric brush</li>
            <li> Worst cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever used. The cleanser comes out of the bottle in clumps and I really need to work to spread it over my face because it tries to stay in the shape that I squirted out of the bottle. There are some beads in the cleanser but I feel like they&#x27;re not doing much to cleanse the skin. My skin actually feels dryer after I use this even though it&#x27;s supposed to be getting rid of a layer of dead skin cells, making my skin softer. I&#x27;m disappointed that this product, being a brand name, feels so cheap.</li>
            <li> The Cleanser was delivered as scheduled, in good condtion.  I am stil using another tue of the product, so the recentl received tube is unopened.  Being familiar with the product and some other Olay items, I know it&#x27;s an excellent and reasonably priced item.  My entire experience with Olay products has been great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care buff and I won&#x27;t go a day without a good cleanser.  This is the only one I use, personally.  It&#x27;s safe for storing in the shower since it&#x27;s plastic, and it&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate while taking a hot shower.  Price is right too and it&#x27;s widely available, which is great because it&#x27;s only 6 ounces and I use one about every two weeks it seems.</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I go back to - it simply makes your skin look and feel better. My make-up looks better after using this wash as well!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have the heavy grit that apricot scrubs have, so it&#x27;s more pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face tingly or feeling red and raw after (like apricot scrubs do) but it&#x27;s still effective. I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!  The fact that it suds up &amp; has scrubbing granules makes me feel cleaner. My face feels silky &amp; smooth after using it.  I will continue to use it &amp; be back to Amazon to purchase it!  No looking all over town to find my skin care products!  They are always right here!  Love Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash. It isn&#x27;t drying and my skin looks great. I also use the ProX moisturizers for day and night, which work well with this wash. There are little scrubby things in this that make me feel like I am exfoliating my skin without irritating it. I use this twice a day every day and it lasts a really long time. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I think whether the product works or not depending on your skin. This Olay cleanser did not work for me. My face skin got so dry after using this cleanser. I tried the Dove Exfoliating cleanser from my friend for few times and it worked so well. My face skin was so clean and soft. Love the Dove one. Unfortunately, I heard they discontinued the Dove one.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product - you only need to use a small amount so it lasts ages.  Leaves your skin feeling beautifully clean.</li>
            <li> I very like this cleanser. It leaves my skin fresh and clean - it doesn&#x27;t turn greasy right away after washing (yes, I had problems like that). With ProX Repair Lotion SPF30 it goes perfectly. Will consider to buy another one.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this item, I found the same product in a local \\&quot;Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond\\&quot; for 9$.  If you live near one, check your local BB&amp;B before purchasing this item from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Noticeable difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I posted something similar as a comment on another review, but I wanted to share this with others who may have similar requirements. I came across this product at Amazon via an internet bargain site (don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allowed to mention which one). I tried it based on the review and comments of some men who&#x27;ve had great success with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main use for an exfoliating agent is to help scruff ingrown hair in my beard and neck area to reduce hair bumps. I typically use an exfoliant 4-5 times/week. I&#x27;ve used Clinique for Men for over 2 decades and have tried other products from time to time. This Olay exfoliant simply isn&#x27;t gritty enough for my use. It&#x27;s too fine and doesn&#x27;t remove enough skin for me to quickly get the desired result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product seems to be high, and I think for many users it is probably perfect--especially given the amount of product provided and price. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a very strong exfoliating action, I&#x27;d suggest checking out other options. I wish I could give 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge! And for such a reasonable price. Works great with the device. Will last for 3 months at least!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I tried the Olay spin brushy thingy with this cleanser, but I love it. My skin is normal to dry, and this cleanser with the brush gives a clean, fresh finish. Its not too rough. I do see an improvement in my skin. Its one of those things where you look in the mirror one day and are surprised by how smooth your skin looks.</li>
            <li> You can use this exfoliator everyday, use with the Olay cleansing brush for better exfoliating. I recommend use of this with the Olay Pro-X wrinkle products (I have aging skin) everything is all good using everything together.  Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 Fl Oz</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as &#x27;exfoliating&#x27; as the smaller tubes therefore it didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural girl and don&#x27;t want to fuss too much with my appearance.  With that said I needed a little help with my pores now that I am aging.  This cleanser is gentle and designed to use everyday, although I plan to use it just twice a week.  My complexion looks more radiant after I use it.  My makeup also goes on smoother.  I would recommend it as a first step to fight off the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I began using this product earlier this year.  I have had acne since I was a teenager.  I have large pores and acne scarring.  The exfoliating cleanser makes my face glow and I love it! I had to call the manufacturer to ask how ofter it should be used because there are no CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS for use.  I was told 2x daily, morning and evening.  If you already have good skin you will be radiant!</li>
            <li> I love the exfoliating brush and I did use the cleanser until I noticed it was made in China. I personally do not feel safe using anything made in China that can be absorbed through my skin or accidentally ingested while washing my face. I still use the exfoliating brush but with a different cleanser.</li>
            <li> It works well with its scrubber or without. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased with spin brush cleaner. I wasn&#x27;t sure about spending big bucks on high end brush cleaner/scrub, so I decided to give this a try and loved it. I am now on auto ship (makes it easy) I have purchased a couple of other Olay products and like them so far. No need for high end products anymore :)</li>
            <li> Expensive and low quality. Will never buy again. There&#x27;s other exfoliaters at a much lower price and work better. I couldn&#x27;t even feel the microbeads.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this cleanser.  Every time I use it my skin feels refreshed and alive.  I use it about every three or four times Ii wash my face and it, in conjunction with Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum and Olay Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser has my skin feeling the smoothest and softest ever.  I&#x27;ve spent much, much more on exfoliating cleansers and have seldom repurchased them.  I will be buying more of this when the time comes.  When I purchased this I bought 2 other Pro X items and they have given me problems - either breakouts or not being absorbed by my skin, but this one is definitely a winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to try and stay away from the Sephora brand skin care due to the money I feel I&#x27;m throwing down the drain and have come back to Olay.  It seems to always be rated highly in any of the lists I see of &amp;#34;best XXXX skin care product&amp;#34; so I see no reason to pay more and I am seeing the results I want with it.  I&#x27;m going to spend less on my day to day skin care maintenance and save the difference for a laser treatment down the road.  I think that is an excellent trade-off for any woman who wants healthy and younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have problems with acne breakouts, even as an adult and I need to find a product that would go with my new Olay Pro-X Plus.  When I purchased my Pro-X Plus, I was given a sample of the Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and it worked wonderfully, so I ordered this larger size.  It seems to go really well with the Olay Pro-X Plus in that my face has cleared up and feels so much cleaner and softer.  I highly recommend both the Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser and the Olay Pro-X Plus to anyone who has problems with breakouts.  It can be a very embarrassing situation for adults, but these two product help to clear up my face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to go with the exfoliating brush by Olay.  I love the way it makes my skin feel and I swear after just one use my skin felt much softer. There is also no scent which I love!</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser. It exfoliates just enough and helps me with breakouts. I use it daily with my Olay brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as grainy as I would like but works well with the Clairsonic electric facial brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an add on with the clensing system. Great product,, works great. Deep cleans the pores and skin feels fresh and clean. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and great price at Amazon...the best price by far.  No need to shop anywhere else. Makes skin shine and works as good as the Clarion which is around 130.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become an Olay girl and am always on the lookout for new products.  I&#x27;ve been using Regenerist daily hydrating scrub for about a year.  I really like it but wanted to try the Pro X version.  I don&#x27;t know if it works any better than the daily hydrating scrub but I like it a lot.  It&#x27;s non-abrasive and you only need a pea-sized amount.  I was afraid it might be a bit drying but haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference between the two products.  I plan to rotate between the two.  Good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After using this cleaner, my skin feel the same as EL products. However, my mom told me it is not ask shinning as before. ?</li>
            <li> Great product. Just a small amount does well. I use this with the electric brush and the cleanser suds up well. I would recommend this to my friends. Remember a small amount goes a long way. It makes my face feel very good.</li>
            <li> I will reorder this. It cleans my face well but is gentle. My face feels soft but not over exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I bought the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and had a little sample of this. It removed all the dirt and makeup from my skin. Now I have clean skin every night! I haven&#x27;t got rid of all my acne and pimples but it&#x27;s definitely improving. I will buy this again!:)</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the Pro-x cleaning system. I have stopped using the spinning brush but i still use this cleanser to wash my face at night. Leaves you feeling clean without tight skin.</li>
            <li> Works great with olay spin brush. Dosent work well as a cleanser alone. Amazon has the lowest price on this item as well.</li>
            <li> Originally saw this on \\&quot;the Doctors\\&quot; recommended by Dr Orden (cosmetic/plastic surgeon). As the next best thing to microdermabrasion in use with the hand held machine and brush.  Works well.  Friends tell me that I have lovely skin, I am 50.</li>
            <li> Olay exfoliating renewal cleanser is a good daily exfoliating. It doesn&#x27;t provide a deep exfoliation, which is nice if you are using other products as well. When used with a brush, it provides a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li> Luv this cleanser...tiny grit, cleans good, face glows!!</li>
            <li> This is a good face scrubber cleanser. I was looking for a facial product, but this is good to use on a nightly basis.</li>
            <li> I might never have tried this, but it came with the Pro-X brush cleansing system so I gave it a whirl.  I&#x27;m 62 and while I have very good skin, my skin is highly sensitive and reactive, and I can&#x27;t use most exfoliators without getting red, inflamed skin.  I&#x27;ve tried other Olay exfoliating cleansers with horrible results.  However, this cleanser is very gentle and mild, and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it.  I don&#x27;t use it daily...more like every 3 or 4 days, and it works well on that basis.  I would buy it again, although I use such a small amount, I expect my 6 oz tube to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This product has earned my first ever Holy Grail status beauty product.&lt;br /&gt;Why?  No more blackheads or whiteheads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin but the oil gets stuck below the surface creating little tiny blackheads on my nose and whiteheads on my chin.  It&#x27;s been a lifelong problem best solved with Retin A for a long time.  Now with this I can give up the Retin A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a mild warming effect when you rub it on.  It has very fine grit in it to polish the skin.  I use it with my Clairsonic.  And with daily once a day use, my blackhead and whitehead problem is finally over.  My skin is smooth and polished after using this, like I had a really good facial, and yet it isn&#x27;t dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked better in my entire life.  It glows, it&#x27;s smooth and soft and creamy. The texture is flawless, pores are invisible.  I look in the mirror and at first think \\&quot;wow my foundation looks great\\&quot;, then realize it&#x27;s just my own skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This removes that dead dull surface layer to reveal the healthy new skin underneath without drying.  Perfection.</li>
            <li> For exfoliating on a regular basis, this product is perfect. It isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin and is best to use at night before you go to bed in combination with a Vitamin C serum. No harsh smell and you only have to use a dime size amount. Also, if you are going to use this product, it is best to get some sore of facial exfoliating brush. Is use the Olay exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li> I use the entire system &amp; nothing has ever cleared my face as good as this stuff has! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year daily and it helps exfoliate my skin, make it softer and overall healthier. I have mild adult acne occasionally and it has lessened by using this as well. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> makes my skin smooth. i use it with the brush cleaner and makes a great combo. Olay products never disappoint me.</li>
            <li> Stickier so it stays on your face for the brush.  The beads are also distributed evenly among the solution so you don&#x27;t get some dollops with a lot of beads and some with none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, price is good, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser for its gentleness and creamy texture. It only takes a very small amount for each use</li>
            <li> Good cleaner but a little pricey</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this exfoliating cleanser based on all positive reviews for it. However for a exfoliator I was a bit disappointed. It did not seem to exfoliate at all. I felt like to even feel like it did something, that I had a use a large amount. A small amount just wasn&#x27;t enough. I will continue to use this, but will probably look for another product after the bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Cleanses very well and I am pleased with this product that cleans my pores better than soap.  It is not perfumed and I like that.</li>
            <li> Great product works great. This product from Olay is the best I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 years and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser.  I use it in conjunction with the Olay rotary brush that comes in the Advanced Cleansing system.  My skin is cleaner and smoother than it has ever been.  The exfoliating effect is perfect to prepare your skin for your favorite moisturizer.  It allows the moisturizer to be absorbed by your skin leaving it dewy and soft.  Helps minimize pores by keeping them clean.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am using this product for about 1 month now and my skin looks much cleaner, fresh now. I have olily skin and this does not over dry my skin as other scrubs.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful  and i will highly recomend this to every one at my age 45y</li>
            <li> I can see and feel how clean this product makes my skin. Very satisfied with its quality. Will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I suffered from severe acne for a long time.  I searched for products that would help.  Then I found this product along with [[ASIN:B000V3J4MQ Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Anti-Blemish Daily Cleanser-5 oz]], and my Acne AND the scars from it cleared up almost overnight! I would recommend Olay products to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and scent of this face wash. However it leaves my face way too oily. I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne for years and have found that i really love a lot of the Olay products so I&#x27;ve been slowing trying new things. I really wanted to love this but by 10 in the morning my face is an oil slick. I guess I have to go back to the Arbonne cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep trying other Olay products though!</li>
            <li> This cleanser goes perfectly with the Olay Pro-x brush. Not too harsh or fragrant, great for every day use. Was delivered very quickly and I already feel results from using it.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub with a rotating brush.  It is working well.  It does not irritate my skin and that&#x27;s improtant to me.</li>
            <li> This dried out my face; therefore, I&#x27;m giving it two stars. I hope it works for others.</li>
            <li> very good.it feels good.</li>
            <li> Nice face cleaner, I use this once a week and it works great with the Olay Pro X set or by itself.</li>
            <li> I use it with my Olay spin brush facial cleaner device. It works and my skin always feels cleaner and looks better after using it. I am not sure if I will buy it again or just try using my typical cleansers with my brush to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have oily skin. Normally I&#x27;m not prone to break outs but after using this product only one time, I began breaking out on my cheeks. Also my face felt greasy and not clean. Like there was an unpleasant film on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the cleansing brush from Olay but my skin just can&#x27;t take this lotion. I tried using my brush with the salicylic acid soap my dermatologist recommended and I thought it worked great. My skin was soft and smooth when I got done without feeling greasy. It seems like most of the exfoliation is more due to the exfoliating brush than the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad this was just a sample that came with my Olay exfoliating system so I&#x27;m not left with a larger bottle that I&#x27;d just have to throw out. I&#x27;m going to stick to my every day soap for now.</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my face feeling clean and smooth. It works very well with the Olay spin brush, together the dual make an effective facial treatment.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a skincare product expert due to the fact that I have literally TRIED IT ALL!!!  I&#x27;ve been wanting the other more pricey hand held cleansing system but after looking at the reviews for the Olay system, I decided to give it a try.  I do believe that this system wouldn&#x27;t be as effective without having this cleanser and using it with that handheld brush.  That being said, when used together they work really well!  This cleanser reminds me of Philosophy&#x27;s Microdermabrasion cleanser, they both are clear with the very fine particles that actually do the exfoliating.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this cleanser but keep in mind that it&#x27;s not for CLEANING your face, it&#x27;s for EXFOLIATING your face and does that part well.  I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s on the fence about trying it, my husband and I both have been using it and we have both seen great results!</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer, smoother and got a little red color after I used it. The color was obviously gone after about an hour but I could tell that the product worked. I would not use it daily, probably too harsh, but every other day. Good product, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Use it every day.  Your face should be exfoliated every day.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Gives you a great clean face I love Olay products and I would buy this product again definitely. Love it</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and use some expensive but very effective skin products.  I struggled for years to find products that would work well with my skin and I did find it in a competitor.  However, I ran out of my skin cleanser when I was on a trip and have no idea what I would do.  I tried this hoping that it would be a great backup and it is.  I used it for three weeks on my vacation and had no adverse effects.  I use it now two or three times a week because it does smooth out my skin while cleaning and exfoliating without having any breakouts or reactions of any kind.  I highly recommend this cleanser and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> love the fact that this leaves my face feeling scrubbed but not looking like it. has definitely helped my skin looked bright</li>
            <li> Works beautifully with my Clarisonic! Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great for daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It works well with the cleansing massage head to clean my face, but it gets a funny plastic smell like the vinyl shower curtain (maybe there are vinyl beads!). There is not much foam and it is easy to rinse off. I cannot say I like it because I am sensitive to the smell, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> At 50, I was still annoyed by blemishes. I started using this product 2 years ago...blemishes gone. I have combination skin,and have tried most cleansers out there, including the natural ones. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling dry, and I am so glad to be  done with blemishes. I have recommended this cleanser to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried it.  I will wait til the end of the bottle to see if I get it again.</li>
            <li> This cleanser came with the oral x pro  brush set and I use it every morning...my skin has become so soft and clean looking...almost a glow</li>
            <li> Being late for a weekend trip, we had to pack very quickly. Once we got to check in and unpack, my friend noticed that the exfoliating cleanser had poured all over her black shirt. After rinsing, she found real small pieces of plastics and when we checked further into the mystery we found out the name of those plastics; POLYETHYLENE. We learned further that once these plastics are washed down the drain, it ends up in the ocean killing marine life. There is considerable amount of that plastic in a tube and you can see it for yourself, scary to say the least. Rubbing your skin with plastics to look good, when you can buy grounds, any coffee grounds shipped from heaven for over $30 a pound, the going price for this plastics by P&amp;G... Amazing what marketing does.</li>
            <li> I have used more than 2 of these and it really does a good scrub job without breaking my face out like others with too much cream in them.</li>
            <li> I really like the ProX brush and cleanser from Olay! I don&#x27;t see the point in paying the huge amount for other types when Olay works so great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Pro X brush for 3 years now, and I love the way it cleans my face. I found a knockoff scrub cleanser at Target that costs a lot less than the Olay cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;What is startling, and has made me stop using the cleanser is the use of MicroBeads in the product. These are polyethylene (look for that or polypropylene in the ingredients), non-biodegradable beads that slip through sewer filtering systems and end up in our rivers and lakes. They absorb toxic chemicals in those waters and can be mistaken by wildlife as food.&lt;br /&gt;There are alternatives to the microbeads that are natural such as ground seeds or nuts (walnut, almond powders might be listed in the facial scrub ingredients). I&#x27;ve started using Suave products that have these.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure Olay will replace microbeads soon, but until then, please try to avoid them. The Olay pro x and Clarisonic brushes will work with natural products just as well as microbeads, and you won&#x27;t be poisoning fish or polluting the water and soil.</li>
            <li> I love the way this cleanser works for me. It works great with my exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Uses microbeads, bad for the environment. I threw it away when I found out (also bad for environment).</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff she uses it with the battery operated scrubbing brush. I bought the kit and have bought replacement brushes and cream.</li>
            <li> Very good product for keeping the dirt off your skin without stripping it.  Recommend lightly using accompanying circulating exfoliating brush periodically for best result.</li>
            <li> My son uses this with the motorized brush Olay sells. He has had marked improvement on his teen acne. Not perfect skin, but not a perfect washing routine either I&#x27;m sure! His skin is much better than it was though.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is a great cleanser! I have had severe acne and this is a great product that cleans well, doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your face, or dry face out too much! I have this product on Amazon subscription on a by-monthly basis. Best price I&#x27;ve found yet!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for cleansing your face.  It lightly exfoliates, and makes your skin brighter and much cleaner looking.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a new product to the Olay Pro-X line. Based on my experience I believe it will be quite popular. Product does not have a scent and is not gritty. Since you only use a small amount each time, product should last for a reasonable period. Skin feels/looks good after using. I am in my 50&#x27;s with dryish skin, but I do not find this product drying.I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The Olay exfoliating cleanser is as good as, if not better, than the brands found at Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus, etc.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am 50+ and this is by far the best exfoliating cleanser I have ever used, and I have used many&lt;br /&gt;over the years. This does the job and does not ever leave my skin irritated or sensitive, and I have&lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin. I highly recommend this product.  I use it in conjunction with the Pro X moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;and the Olay Regenerist Serum.  Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> https://www.facebook.com/5gyres/videos/10153031062208920/</li>
            <li> I have used the ProX system for 3 years now...I love how well it exfoliates my face...feels so smooth...as do my friends/family that I have  gifted this product to.</li>
            <li> Great to use with my Olay Pro X, cleans and scrubs in a perfect way, my face is soft after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Found I needed this exfoliating cleanser, used with the Pro X Clear, to manage the milia that were continually breaking out (tiny white hard deposits just under the skin)  The micro beads in the cleanser were needed to really deep clean pores.  I&#x27;ve seen an 80% difference in the smoothness and tightness of the pores.</li>
            <li> Does not dry up the skin and good for combination skin</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law gave me some Arbonne cleanser which made my skin sooo soft. However, I got sticker shock when I looked to buy some more on-line. Amazon recommended this and I decided to try after reading glowing reviews. It didn&#x27;t have the same great feel as Arbonne, but I actually see a major improvement in my skin. Have lived with large pores all my life and gave up years ago in ever reducing them. Maybe pores shrink as we get older, but I&#x27;m sticking with this cleanser just in case. I simply massage it into skin with my fingertips and occasionally use a small facial pad for extra exfoliation. Have never used the Olay brushes.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep your skin clean, clear, &amp; with a natural glow, this is the product that delivers. I only discovered it about 6 months ago, but I LOVE IT! It does need to be used with the microdermabrasion too. I tan a lot in the warmer weather, so this helps to keep my skin radiant.</li>
            <li> I ordered it together with pro x olay, which I consider a great product, but I did not like this cleanser. Maybe because I&#x27;m preferring vegan products. This is my opinion.</li>
            <li> FIrstly the beads in this cleanser are so small and sparse they hardly do any &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t foam at all and it didn&#x27;t really clean my face but left a greasy residue that made my face still feel dirty. It also broke me out pretty bad on my cheeks and a bit on my forehead.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. worked nice even on my sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I bought the whole Olay system and while I like the rotating brush to cleanse and love the microbead with the pad attachment, I didn&#x27;t find any significant results from using this cleanser. I prefer my own cleanser that foams a bit more and washes away more easily.</li>
            <li> Love this, price is good, love the convenience of auto shop to my home👍🏻</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have sensitive skin and this is the perfect exfoliating cleanser for me. I&#x27;ve seen a big difference on my skin and this product and brand works for me. I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 2-3 years and it met my expectation.</li>
            <li> It was hard to push out the lotion. It might be old? I thought it will be softer after using it and the temperature of this cleanser gets warm but it didn&#x27;t. Although I had the issue getting out, I was able to finish all. Do I buy it again? There are so many to choose from that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t has to be from Olay for me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a St Ives apricot scrub type feel. I love most Olay products though I think a lot of them are overpriced. Ive gone back to the St Ives since it is more effective for me. This is better for someone with really sensitive, thin skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it!!! It keeps her face oil free without drying out her skin!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an olay fragrance-free product and I absolutely love it! I have been using it for two weeks now and I can clearly see the difference in my skin. I no longer breakout or have red blotchy patches on my face. For the first time my skin looks healthy. I have tired many fragrance-free products before and none have ever delivered on their claims.  Finally, found a product that I can use on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen great results, but I wish the scrub was more scrub-like. The granuals are so small and fine that I don&#x27;t feel the clean or exfoliation I want all the time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! Makes my face sooooo smoth and clean,  my husband loves it too I had to get him some for him.</li>
            <li> Okay, so she was driving me nuts. A few years back, I bought her a kit that contained a small tube of this stuff and a battery-operated cleansing brush. She loved it, and was going crazy trying to find the replacement cream for the kit. When I suggested we check Amazon, and we did, she argued with me for an hour that what I found was not the same stuff. \\&quot;Says the same thing on the tube,\\&quot; I sez, \\&quot;let&#x27;s order it.\\&quot; So it arrives, and being the forever skeptic that she is, she gives it the sniff test, the feel test, and finally the use test. Eureka! It was the same. Hallelujah, the husband gets to go back to what he was doing originally, and the little woman is in her joy zone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now and I love it!It cleans without leaving my face feeling dry.  I originally bought it to use with my nutrasonic face cleanser machine but sold it.  Now I use this with my fingers and it works just as good.  Right now, this cleanser is #1 on my list.&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 years old and have normal skin.</li>
            <li> Great customer service, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. It has tiny scrubbing beads in it that feel like they really are exfoliating my face and getting it clean. The fragrance is not bad and it seems to be gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!! Face is feels baby soft</li>
            <li> Love this product cleanse my face well worth buying</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>
            <li> This is a very good exfoliator. I use it once a week with the little battery operated facial scrubber. It does leave your skin feeling smooth. My niece was not so impressed as it broke her face out so it might not be the best choice for teens; works great for me though.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, the cleansing beads are small and I think this works well to keep my pores clean.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  Your face feels so good after using it.  Plus, you get a great shave.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  I use it in the shower every other day or so.  It leaves my face feeling soft and looking dewey.  The exfoliant is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and rejuvenated.  As with any exfoliater, avoid contact  with eyes.</li>
            <li> Loooooooooove this facial cleanser!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dry, red, itchy, peeling patches of skin before on my face but I don&#x27;t have those issues anymore :) Regular use of this product took care of all those issues! Thank you Olay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the most effective way to use this product is to first wet \\&quot;one\\&quot; hand only, then squeeze out a pea size worth of cleanser, rub your hands together and scrub over DRY skin in a circular motion! If you wet your face first, you will not feel the scrub as much. So for me, it&#x27;s important to apply this over dry skin. You&#x27;ll get a really good scrub this way, it will remove all dead skin cells, make your skin look younger, alive and leaving it ever sooooooo soft! YIPPEEEEEEE!</li>
            <li> The only reason I tried this is because a small bottle comes with the Pro x advanced cleaning system. Glad it did though. This stuff is definitley department store quality and lasts forever since you don&#x27;t need a lot. I&#x27;ve also read that it&#x27;s comparable to Philosophy&#x27;s exfoliator. This is one of the best drug store products I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> Not the best exfoliator on the market but it&#x27;s not horrible either. It&#x27;s a unique process in that I need to get my face good/wet, dry it and then put this onto dry skin, in order for it to lather.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: unscented, thick/creamy, can use daily&lt;br /&gt;Con: doesn&#x27;t always lather, pores don&#x27;t seem any cleaner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d possibly buy this again depending on price. I still suggest Purpose daily and the Shiseido Mens exfoliator two to three times per week.</li>
            <li> it is suitable for Pro-X advance cleansing systems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Oil of Olay fan, but this is not their best product. I feel my face really clean when I use it, but I don&#x27;t see any actual results. I know you have to give it some time, but I have had immediate results from my other Oil of Olay products. Maybe it&#x27;s just not the one for me.</li>
            <li> Very good facial cleanser without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I like it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have severe oily skin and have been using this product for 6 months now  it cleanses very well and has not caused any breakouts. It&#x27;s a mild exfoliator so if you are searching for something a bit stronger then I don&#x27;t recommend. On the other hand if you are searching for an every day mild exfoliator then I recommend you purchase. Great size although it&#x27;s a bit pricey you can get 4 months out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This product works great Love OLAY</li>
            <li> it can make your face smooth.&lt;br /&gt;and the price is acceptable...&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t need to use many, just a little... it make your skin smooth and moisture...</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  My skin feels clean and smooth afterwards, ready for moisturizing and make-up, if that&#x27;s your thing.</li>
            <li> I received this in a kit with my motorized facial brush. When I ran out, I found out how much benefit this cleanser had. All the flaky skin came back. This cleanser, used daily, keeps you face clear of the dry, flaky skin. I&#x27;ve used a lot of scrubs, and this one is both effective and gentle, as well as affordable, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Love ol lay makes my sign feel young an clean  always gonna buy there products!! So I would reamen them to others to</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Works almost as well as Roden &amp; Fields Microdermabrasion Paste. I look much younger after washing my face with this product, and my acne is completely GONE -- better than ProActive. If they stop making this stuff I don&#x27;t know what I will do -- I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this for ten years!</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  I use a Retin-A product and my skin gets flaky.  After reading the reviews, I gave this product a try.  It just never seemed to do the job for my skin.  Gave the half used tube to my daughter.  Apparently it works on her gorgeous youthful skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone combination skin and most products are too drying for some part of my face. This works great for me. It does its cleaning job and for the acne I use honey and lemon.and other stuff. But for the cleaning it&#x27;s great. And not ever drying considering I use it 3 time a day</li>
            <li> Much better price than local stores (actually half price)!!!  The product works wonders, it leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> As I have aged, my 40+ year old facial skin has developed a lot of whiteheads on my cheeks, forhead, and around my eyes.  My mom has the same look to her skin, so I figure it is likely some sort of genetic issue.  I was looking into a professional chemical peal, but tried this exfoliating cleaner just to see what it would do &amp; within a week of daily exfoliating, it appears most if not all of my presistent whiteheads are gone.  I will probably stop daily use &amp; maybe use it weekly to keep maintenance.  I use it in the shower as I have a hard time rinsing anything like this off my face when washing at a sink.  I bought the cleanser at Walmart &amp; the \\&quot;Olay scrubbing tool\\&quot; here on Amazon.  Check your local prices on each.</li>
            <li> Love the ProX line... Has cleared my acne and at 51 years old, that is something I have fought since adolescence!</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;d admit it. I&#x27;m a little embarrassed to review, let alone admit using, this product. I&#x27;m a fifty-something year-old man and, therefore, not exactly the target group this product was intended to serve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for any of the men out there approaching geezerdom and wondering about this product, here&#x27;s my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used any type of cream or cleansing product on my face before. Ever. My skin is probably a bit better than average for someone my age, but I was curious what, if anything, this product would do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and am surprised to say it really has made a noticeable improvement in the appearance and overall health of my skin, which is now a little lighter and brighter in color and softer in texture. I use it once a day, usually at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay should provide more instructions. The directions basically say wash your face and pat dry. No information on how often or how much to scrub your face when using it. The sensation I get is what I would expect to feel sandpapering my face with a fine, maybe 600 grit, sandpaper with a little cream mixed in. That description is not meant to be derogatory, because I guess that&#x27;s what a good exfoliating product should feel like. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, but on the other hand is not exactly a walk in the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be using too much...I don&#x27;t know. Is about a half a teaspoon too much?  It&#x27;s difficult to wash off completely and stings if any accidentally gets in your eyes. I&#x27;m also wondering if perhaps using it every other day rather than every day might be a better idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using this cream, and feel confident recommending it to men. Can&#x27;t speak for the ladies, although based on the reviews here they seem to like it, too. It&#x27;s very effective and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is get rid of the very top layer of dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/19/11 EDIT...still using it. After over four months the tube is now almost empty. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that after the first month or so, daily use is not really necessary. At least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most, if not all, of the product&#x27;s benefits were achieved after about a month&#x27;s use. Since then it&#x27;s been pretty much status quo. Which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What amazes me about this product is how effectively it cleans and removes dead skin cells without drying out or irritating my face. It&#x27;s for that reason alone that I&#x27;ll keep using it for at least a while longer.be is now almost empty.

            <li> Love this stuff and found such a great deal on it</li>
            <li> I started using this product because I wanted a clearer complexion. The first few weeks were great.. ** warning ... do  not use more than once a week! After several weeks went by, I noticed my skin getting blemishes. I think it was to harsh for my sensitive skin. I discontinued use and threw away.</li>
            <li> Love this product after use face feels and looks so smooth.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this cleanser feels. My skin feels refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> First time my skin become smooth and velvety after two days of use. I highly recommend to everyone to try out.</li>
            <li> Great scrub and facial cleanser. Removes makeup easily. Excellent EWG rating too!</li>
            <li> Great product for every day use to exfoliate.  Leaves face feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Okay, bad joke on the title. I&#x27;m a man and when I think Olay, I think women&#x27;s products. But this stuff makes my face feel good and baby soft, especially after shaving and my wife loves the feel. A little expensive but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I cannot Rate a product I never got :( when the package arrived it was open like someone ripped the envelope and stole it. Not good I don&#x27;t know if I will ever order from here again I love Amazon but was a rip off. Oh I waited a week to get Nothing</li>
            <li> Safe to use every day. I no longer use moisturizer after my shower because this product cleans and moisturizes. Love it!</li>
            <li> Cleans well, but drys my face out way too much. Skin becomes tight. I have oily skin and this is just killer. I&#x27;ve switched to Cetaphil oily skin cleanser and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a high quality facial cleanser and I&#x27;ve found it with Olay&#x27;s Pro X.  My routine is to cleanse my face in the shower, using a Buff Puff, followed by a retinol serum, then moisturizer.  My skin has always been sensitive, troubled, and oily; as I approach my mid 50&#x27;s the only difference is now it&#x27;s sensitive, troubled, and combination.  I need a cleanser that will thoroughly clean the oily areas without stripping the drier areas.  Olay&#x27;s cleanser does this for me.  My face was broken out when I started using the cleanser, but it quickly cleared up, and I&#x27;ve not had a breakout since.  I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser for more than a month now.  My face texture smoothed out immediately when I first used the cleanser and I&#x27;m happy to say that it&#x27;s stayed that way.  I do wish Olay would put more cleaning granules in the facial wash.  My solution is to use the cleanser lightly with a buff puff.  It&#x27;s been my experience that even with expensive exfoliating cleansers,  NONE put enough granules in their cleansers to properly exfoliate.  Even with this minor flaw, I love this cleanser and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit oily and I&#x27;ve had trouble to clean it afterwards. -- I had similar problem with Neutrogena Deep Clean Face Wash, so I guess if you don&#x27;t have problem with that one, this one would be ok.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Keeps my face so soft!</li>
            <li> feels good for sometime but doesnt do any miracle on my face. I didnt feel any difference after using this neither it does any harm. im thinking why did i but this.</li>
            <li> I feel bad in giving this product a one because of all the high reviews but I had no positive results with this. In fact, my skin would break out even WORSE after using this. So for this reason, i&#x27;m giving it a low rating.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have used it for a year and there is a huge difference in the smoothness, softness and brightness of my skin! I used to have acne because of stress, so I have acnes scars. But they are much less noticeable. I think that one day they will be completely faded away if I continue to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it works best if you use it in the shower. If you put on the cream, and massage it in with the spinner. Then go to the show and  wash your face with the warm water. I have noticed that it helps get rid of blackhead in this method!</li>
            <li> So here it goes,&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic, I swear by this exfoliating cleanser. I pick on my face a lot, aaalloott! Any little thing I see coming out, I pick it. Then, I get red blemishes and sometimes even small bruises. All I have to do is, use this in the night, again in the morning and my blemishes are gone. Dead skin out! Seriously!! My skin looks fresh, radiant...sometimes I feel like I glow.  I go sun tanning a lot, so at times my skin looks un-even, but not anymore. Using this product has made me feel so good.  I have a crease in between my eyebrows. My whole family has it...I could probably swear I was born with it.  It&#x27;s that crease that ppl get when they are upset and they raise their inner eyebrows. Well, I can barely see it now! That&#x27;s where I focus my little exfoliator a bit more.  This stuff is so good, just buy the box package to give it a try! I got mine as a gift, and I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of this whit the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System one for myself and one for my girlfriend, and we both enjoy using this every morning.</li>
            <li> Great end of the day cleanser!  Cleans well, leaves skin feeling great!&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my Clarisonic Mia, which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s mild enough to use everyday and still effective in exfoliating and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Product feels rough on my face and does not do a superb job cleaning.  Makeup residues still deposit on my towel after makeup remover, facial cleanser, and using this product with the Olay brush as instructed.  Maybe it does a good job with exfoliating.  However, given the roughness, I would use it 2-3 times a week max.</li>
            <li> Really has helped complexion, bought two and glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this cleanser some time ago, I didn&#x27;t realize at the time it was supposed to be used with a facial brush. I used it anyway without the brush and found that it didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin. It has bits in it that aren&#x27;t too abrasive, you don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently noticed the Olay Pro-X brush that is supposed to be used with this, is only $21.97, it was almost $30 when I first put it in my wish list. I purchased it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;ve been using moisturizer twice a day, my skin has been really dry for quite a ling time. I noticed right away a difference in the condition of my skin, after using the brush. It feels fantastic, looks shiny and clean, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about using this without the brush that goes with it, you may want to reconsider, especially at this price. This is a great product</li>
            <li> I use this as part of the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. It really does clean and exfoliate well. But my mind is very curious and sometimes doubts if it really is cleaning because it lacks the foam/lather of a traditional soap. Essentially what it&#x27;s missing is the sodium dodecyl sulfate that creates foam. I just keep telling myself that foam doesn&#x27;t &#x3D; clean.</li>
            <li> Oh no microbeads! It works great but had to stop buying after reading about how it is messing with aquatic ecosystems.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few that actually does what it describes. I have acne prone skin and you can tell after the first day using this that its starting to exfoliate your skin and bring the dirt to the surface. I use with the Olay prox cleansing brush. The last cleansing system I tried was Clinique and this works better and at a decent price</li>
            <li> The cost of this product is a little on the high side for a cleanser, however I did get a really good deal on Amazon and a little goes a long way with the product,  so you will end up getting your money&#x27;s worth.  It has a nice creamy consistency with enough granules to exfoliate well without being scratchy. I use it at least twice daily and I have not experienced any irritation.  It makes my skin feel super smooth and realy did reduce my pores. My finer lines and wrinkles have diminished significantly as well, either because they have been buffed off or because my serum is able to absorb better into my skin and work more efficiently I can&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I can tell you that this is a great purchase. It works well on its own in the shower and with the Pro-X Cleansing Device also. The price on Amazon was the best I could find anywhere on the internet, so I recommend purchasing it here too :)</li>
            <li> works great to brighten skin</li>
            <li> Guess what? those \\&quot;scrubby micro beads\\&quot; are made of plastic that damage our waterways and health -- and are now banned in certain states (New York, Illinois), with many more states are following suit. Why? polyethylene beads are so small, they don&#x27;t get filtered out in the sewage system, and end up being \\&quot;fish food\\&quot;, showing up in marine life, which in turn, we eat. Moreover, plastic leaches into water over time. Even though polyethylene is not poisonous, why ingest artificial plastics? Or pollute our lakes and streams? Moreover, the beads in this cleanser are not even ROUND --they are \\&quot;pulverized\\&quot; (see ingredient listing) into irregular shapes so they are like those scratchy apricot scrubs to beget stronger exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Articles from the New York Times + Chicago Tribune about this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illinois is the first state to ban microbeads; CA and NY have proposed bills this year to ban them as well.&lt;br /&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-08/news/chi-governor-signs-bill-making-illinois-first-state-to-ban-microbeads-20140608_1_microbeads-great-lakes-products&lt;br /&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/nyregion/ban-sought-on-microbeads-in-beauty-items.html?_r&#x3D;0&lt;br /&gt;http://www.npr.org/2014/05/21/313157701/why-those-tiny-microbeads-in-soap-may-pose-problem-for-great-lakes&lt;br /&gt;http://ecowatch.com/2014/02/17/new-york-california-legislation-ban-microbeads-cosmetics/</li>
            <li> I love using this with my Olay face scrub brush. It leaves my skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> My face is a giant oil slick. No joke. I&#x27;ve discovered products over the years that help me deal with the oil and shine, but I still struggle with oily (acne-prone) skin. So imagine my surprise when I started noticing dry, flaky spots around my temples and jaw line. Me? Dry and flaky? What the what?! Since I recently started using the [[ASIN:B002UUT38I Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser, 6 Ounce]], it was easy to finger it as the culprit. I turned the tube around to look at the ingredients, and sure enough, sodium. I went online and researched the other ingredients (what a test of your typing skills they are), and found that the third ingredient is what&#x27;s know as a zwitterion (sounds like an other-worldly name for a species of Twitter users, huh?). Zwitterions are commonly known as inner salts. Yay, more salt. On my face. I like the cleanser, I do. I&#x27;m just not going to use it twice/day anymore. I&#x27;ll use it at night when I can follow up with the [[ASIN:B001JQLNM8 Olay Professional Pro-X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream, 1.7 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. I have sensitive skin, so I was apprehensive at first, but I was not let down. It is gentle, but powerful at the same time. And I use the cleanser six days a week after I work out because my face is really sweaty.  I noticed my skin was brighter after the first use. I will be using again, and again.</li>
            <li> I have found MY face wash!  This stuff is the best.  Even though it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side, I would HIGHLY recommend this product if you have very oily skin like me.</li>
            <li> I suffer from cystic acne, but since I started using this product along with the pro x brush, I have noticed a dramatic difference in my face,  my breakouts are disappearing and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new ones.  My skin feels soft and even the acne scars are starting to disappear.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well, leaves skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a guy. Yes, I am a man who wanted to exfoliate his face. I do not know a ton about facial creams and exfoliators, but the one thing I do think I know is that all of the exfoliators I have tried in the past has some sort of beads or particles in them to scrub away the dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not seem to have those beads or particles (or at least enough of them in an adequate size to exfoliate my man skin). When I clean my face with this stuff, I feel like it is doing just as much as my facial cleanser. I want to cleanse THEN exfoliate. Not cleanse then cleanse again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product again. IT NEEDS MORE EXFOLIATING BEADS!!!!</li>
            <li> This does an amazing job at making my skin soft and smooth!  It also helps remove surface blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I love the product, cleans and leaves skin very soft, does not dry the skin, can be used frequently</li>
            <li> I ordered the Olay Pro - X and i would recommend buying the 6 oz. You only get a small tester renewal cleanser with your purchase. Loved this product and very happy with it!</li>
            <li> this makes my skin feels very smooth and health. it looks as though i&#x27;m wearing makeup. well that&#x27;s until the oil and shine sets back in, but it really gives you face a good clean.</li>
            <li> I love all Olay products</li>
            <li> I have bought this renewal cleanser about  2 months ago and I use it about 3x a week. It really does clean the skin and leaves it feeling soft and smooth. No dull skin with this product!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews my expectations were a little high, this product did not seem to work as well on my skin type as I would hope.</li>
            <li> Nothing else has ever made my face feel so clean. And I love that it doesn&#x27;t take very much to get a great clean!</li>
            <li> This is a very good cleanser, but I think it should not be used every night, but a few times a week.  It really takes off all your makeup and the residue and/or dirt or oil on your skin.  It&#x27;s exfoliating and gives a clean and fresh result after washing.</li>
            <li> New skin! I started using this, and finally get the value of an exfoliant. My skin is too sensitive for the apricot scrubs, or the like. This stuff has a consistency I&#x27;d say of baking soda. It scrubs without being too harsh and cleans up nicely. With the Spinning brush, it&#x27;s amazing how quick my skin can regenerate (healing blemishes and demarcation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially used it once every few days alternating with a Neutrogena&#x27;s brightening face cleanser, but I may just make the permanent switch once I run out. Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my decolletage as well, and it keeps it smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I give this five stars because I use it and because it was easy to find and not expensive.  Truth to tell at my age, 77, there is little evidence that it is doing me any good but there is no harm either.  Sounds good to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to find it in stores and couldn&#x27;t find it without the brush that I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you exfoliate then this is a good way to do it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve used it for years &amp; would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I first starting using this when I bought the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush in or around the Spring of 2012 and it was included.  I am now hooked on cleansing my skin with this.  I am 38 and have very temperamental skin that flares up due to various reasons.  Rosacea and occasional acne have always been an issue for me.  My Rosacea flare-ups have become fewer and my skin stays calmer since using this along with the brush and my skin feels smoother and looks less congested (fewer blackheads visible).  I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in pores or fine lines, but there I think there is some.  A little goes a long way...I think I get through a tube in 5-6 months.  It&#x27;s worth  try if you deal with</li>
            <li> My face has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Best exfoliating product in the market, but I am not fond of the smell it has. It smells like plastic. Also needs to be rubbed vigorously to produce lather. Overall a great product. Skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love this face scrub.  Excellent price!!!</li>
            <li> The Olay cleansers I have tried have always left my skin feeling soft, refreshed, and without overdrying. The Olay Exfoliating renewal cleanser is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The micro breads gently massages the face, enough to clean out pores. It&#x27;s not as harsh as the [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]], but still has the properties to refresh my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid 20s, and it has kept my skin feeling soft and clear. This the go-to cleanser in my facewash regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My face has never felt smoother after using this product, I also have the olay brush to go along with it. Love it</li>
            <li> I finally found MY face-wash. I&#x27;m never going to use anything else, ever.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Way better than Proactiv and a million times cheaper. I have the exfoliating tool that goes with it and my acne is gone.</li>
            <li> gently exfoliates and leaves skin smooth and ready for moisturizing products.  Does not dry skin and did not find it irritating.  Will purchase again.  Would recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Many cleanser either gives me break out and makes my skin too dry and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is both deep cleaning and gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that i use it and my sone uses it with great results to our skin. I feel clean and refreshed after use and it lasts!</li>
            <li> Works well, delaying a need for micro abrasion.  You will need the micro eventually, but not monthly, as I had needed before.</li>
            <li> Nice sudsing, and gives the skin a soft, clean feel. My facial skin looks great now. Equivalent to Mary Kay Cosmetics&#x27; quality!</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  Sloughs off the dead skin cells, and leaves your skin so soft and clean.  Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Love.  Another one of my staples.  I keep it in the shower and use it to wash my face.  Have used this for years.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and less reddish with this. Love that it feels gentle but washes wonderfully. Favorite face wash out there.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel so soft and clean--espcially when used with the spin-pro brush.</li>
            <li> Very watery cleanser. I need a lot of it to properly wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to Shiseido, which is a much more pricey product, so may not be a fair comparison but I was not thrilled with this.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be a lot more exfoliating than it is. The exfoliating particles are small enough, but I don&#x27;t think there is enough exfoliation provided by this cleanser. Don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth the $16 I paid.</li>
            <li> The product is better than I expected.  I feel very clean after I used it.  One thing you must be careful not to use on your eyes area because my eyes area turned in red for days and itched. Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years to take off my makeup every night...I love it. It doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li> My niece has very dry skin and this was so perfect for her, no more  dry face skin.  she loves it as do I.</li>
            <li> It leaves the face feeling clean and smooth.  I like it because it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.  It is good with the brush.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for quite a while now.  I really like it.  Works well with their little machine, I keep them in my shower and use several times a week.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again because it dries out my skin, and causes it to feel tight and irritated</li>
            <li> Since the Pro-X System bristles spread the exfoliating cleanser around, you only need a drop of this for each use. I tube this size will last forever!</li>
            <li> Have been using for awhile now.  It keeps my skin great in between my dermabrasion sessions.  I haven&#x27;t bought the exfoliating brush, but I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing one.</li>
            <li> Olay Exfoliating Facial Cleanser is very good and I have used it for quite a long time. My sister recently found a new exfoliating cleanser that contains green tea and glycolic acid and says it works much better, although more expensive than the Olay [[ASIN:B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]]. I believe you get what you pay for, so I decided to try the Skingenixx cleanser, and I am so happy! My skin is smoother and skin tone is more even. The fine lines on my face seem to be disappearing. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product based on other reviews but was thoroughly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;1) It has a really harsh, artificial-chemical type smell.&lt;br /&gt;2) For an exfoliant, there weren&#x27;t many beads in it at all. I don&#x27;t want to have to keep squeezing dollops into my hand to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;3) I didn&#x27;t like the serum: bead ratio, either. If I want a cleanser, I&#x27;ll use a cleanser. If I want a moisturizer, I&#x27;ll use that. It doesn&#x27;t seem very effective to try to combine them all into one product, throw a few particles in there, and call it an exfoliant, too.</li>
            <li> I got a sample with the pro-x cleansing system and absolutely fell in love. This is a great anytime cleanser. I use this both in the am and pm and use it with the pro-x cleansing system at least 5 times a week. It really does help with exfoliation, does not have any artificial fragrances therefore it is very gentle on the skin but the beads still get the cleaning done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my 51 year old mother and 19 year old sister use it and they love it as well. We all have very different skin types but we have all noticed fresher skin in the last 2 months of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend, it is definitely for all skin types!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you fast delivery! Product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I use it with my Olay pro cleansing brush and it is great!!</li>
            <li> Its my first day of using it and its amazing!I can feel and see the difference on my face &amp; i told my husband about it and for him to try for sure he will love it as well!Other than that pretty fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Been using this together with the pro-x system for a while now. Really exfoliates the skin, works great on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> What I wanted, what I needed. For sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;can be used everyday. Fast service &amp; red&#x27;d.&lt;br /&gt;in timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love this line of products. I&#x27;m 31 and I don&#x27;t really have problem skin but this cleanser brightens your skin so well.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates gently, small  beads don&#x27;t scratch delicate skin.  Great to use daily with the olay brush.  Use after using Micro Purifying cleanser</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser!</li>
            <li> Product works as described. I love knowing when going to bed that my face is clean and all the elements from the air and makeup my face feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and still have large pores and breakouts on my face.  My skin is also getting more sensitive and thinner.  This seems to really clean well.  I can feel the exfoliate but it is not too rough.  It also washes off well and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin.  And it does not make my face red or break out.  The last 3 products with exfoliate that I tried were either too creamy and would not wash off, too rough, or did not clean well.  I&#x27;ll re-order this. (I&#x27;m so tired of trying different skin care products!!!)</li>
            <li> Love the Olay ProX Exfoliating Cleanser. Have been using it once daily for 5 months and my skin is very clear, smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products, they&#x27;re inexpensive and I have found them to work well.  I have an Olay battery operated facial scrubber, that I use every morning with the exfoliating cleanser and between the two of them, my face is acne clear with  soft, suple skin.  The exfoliating cleanser is gentle,  but very effective.  (I also remove my makeup every night,  applying Neutrogena face soap to my Olay face scrubber and it effectively removes every bit of makeup, something that I feel is a MUST for nice skin)  I highly recommended using all of the products!</li>
            <li> my second time ordering this product, removes blackheads, nice scrub, no drying, but I don&#x27;t like the container, I wish it was a pump</li>
            <li> Olay cleanser really did it for me,it has help my sunspots disapeared so much,I use it  2 or 3 times a week,my face and skin feels and looks wonderfull.thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> A plus rating.  Just what I wanted and what I ordered.  Will be ordering more in the future.  Excellent product</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper solution to my exfoliation needs, and was hoping this was it. The exfoliating beads are very mild and I do feel like they exfoliate to some extent, but not to the extent I want or need. I will be returning to the much more expensive but effective exfoliating cleanser Vivant - this also tones the skin to remove any dark spots.</li>
            <li> Great companion for Olay Pro-X Cleansing System!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a must have. It exfoliate and cleanses at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;It is suitable for daily use and it is best to finish up with a moisturizer for guys.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with the Olay Cleansing System that I purchased from Amazon.  It exfoliates and cleans your skin at the same time, leaving a fresh looking face.  I learned the hard way not to use too much at a time, and not to use it too vigorously, as it does remove old dry skin and can cause irritation and redness.  It has a pleasant smell and works quite well with the machine.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I cleanse and exfoliate all in one. Gentle enough to use everyday.  I personally think it&#x27;s made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you&#x27;re expecting something exfoliating, this isn&#x27;t it. This is more like just a regular face wash than something exfoliating. I was expecting it to have some kind of sand or beads in it or something. It does have VERY VERY small ones, definitely not enough to exfoliate or scrub. But as far as a face wash, it&#x27;s not bad. It leaves my skin fairly soft, and it is unscented. I was just hoping it would be more exfoliating than it is.</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliating cream. I use it before my moisturizer and works well. As usual Amazon has the best price! You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fine. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. But it&#x27;s not amazing either. It&#x27;s not a very strong exfoliant, so if you are used to using exfoliating products, I would recommend you look elsewhere. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin since using this cleanser, so all in all, I see no reason to buy it again. I&#x27;d rather have something more exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;And work well&lt;br /&gt;The color is also beautiful&lt;br /&gt;My sister and I love it&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> I love this! It exfoliates, yet gentle on my sensitive skin. After using it for a week, my face is a lot smoother, and isn&#x27;t as dried as before. It&#x27;s also scent less so it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Has a slight chemical smell but it is a good non-harsh scrubber.  I use this to refine the pores on the face.  One tube will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to exfoliate nor take off makeup. I think you have to use it with the handheld scrub.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I have tried a few brands expensive and less expensive, I have found this to do the most for me.</li>
            <li> Not to much and not too little of exfoliating &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in this solution. Its just right. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 Fl Oz works great with my Clarisonic Mia Sonic face scrubber. My face looks great!</li>
            <li> This makes your face feel so clean, helps remove black heads, great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different face washes throughout the years and this is the first time I&#x27;ve picked one and stuck with it consistently. Other face washes are either too creamy feeling or not effective. Very happy with this face wash</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the face scrub.  My skin is so soft &amp; feels cleaner than ever.  Will definitely puechase again.</li>
            <li> Bought this with Olay facial cleansing system. First of all it has very weird scent. Second it does not lather good. Third - results are not so great as I expected for this money. You can purchase much more cheaper product and have much more job done.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, it goes great with the olay cleansing system. Gives me a deep clean, leaving me with a deep clean.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating gel. Also it&#x27;s much cheaper on amazon than in most store - it normally goes for 20 + dollars. This has been my most favorite exfoliating cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great service!</li>
            <li> so I have never used a lot of skin products, except for daily mositureer and sun block. I have lovley skin for my age. I went for a facial and the lady told me to srtart using exfoliating scrub. wow! I got he sam e results as the expensive facial. I am also using Aztec healing clay, with great results.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and highly recommended. Not gritty or irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why this has so many good reviews. I did not like this cleanser AT ALL. I didn&#x27;t see nor feel any difference after using this with the brush for days. Complete joke.</li>
            <li> I typically use this 2-3 times a week. More in the summer with sweating etc. Moderately priced but great results. You don&#x27;t need a lot, lasts along time. A penny to nickel sized amount gently rubbed in and rinsed. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Works good and resonable price, love it!</li>
            <li> I had dry, itchy, peeling patches of skin before on my face but I don&#x27;t have those issues anymore :) Regular use of this product took care of all those issues! Thank you Olay!</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite, especially with the spinning brush. It has minimized my breakouts!</li>
            <li> To me this is not a good product. It breaks my face out even more. But I also think it does that because my face doesn&#x27;t like Olay products. But I&#x27;ve heard it works for a lot of other women just bit myself</li>
            <li> Facial and body scrubs that contain plastic micro-beads are disrupting our ecosystem. The plastic beads, when washed down our drains, are polluting our oceans and waterways. What&#x27;s even more alarming is that because the plastic beads are not biodegradable, toxic chemical pollutants floating in our oceans, attach to the beads. Many fish and sea creatures mistake these poisonous pollution clusters as food! And most of us consume fish once to twice a week. Yikes! Though the legislature is passing a bill to ban the use of micro-beads in cosmetic products - the bill won&#x27;t be enforced until 2119!! This is truly alarming. What should we do? Choose scrubs that offer natural, earth-friendly ingredients such as sea salt, volcanic sand or crushed nuts. And reduce fish consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best natural scrubs recommended is baking soda. Just apply a small handful on wet, clean skin and rub in a gentle circular motion.&lt;br /&gt;(hollywoodbeautysecrets.com)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** For the very best face cream that tightens skin is actually virgin coconut oil. I don&#x27;t use the processed. Very little is needed and it sinks in nicely. In a few weeks you will really notice a difference.  Great hair conditioner too.  I use nothing else and I have seen lines reverse big time. I look far younger than I am.  Arm area is smoother too.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It leaves the skin without greasiness</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser with the Olay Cleansing Brush about once a week to remove any make-up residue &amp; to deep clean my pores.&lt;br /&gt;A younger person (I am in my 60&#x27;s, with combination skin) with oily skin could use it much more frequently, possibly even daily.&lt;br /&gt;Although I have sensitive skin, this is non-irritating for me, &amp; could also be applied using just one&#x27;s fingers rather than the power brush applicator.  I have used various other exfoliating products, but I find this one to be both gentle &amp; effective, as well as very affordable.</li>
            <li> Only thing that I have ever used that keeps my face from getting flaky and peely.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser daily on my 56 year old face since receiving it a couple of months ago and I have to say that I am totally pleased with how it leaves my skin feeling so clean and smooth. Winter&#x27;s dryness takes it&#x27;s toll on my face with a flaky dullness that no amount of moisturizing seems to combat, that is until I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I mostly use it with the Olay Professional Pro-X cleansing brush, but sometime with just my hands, and either way,. I find the balance of &#x27;grit&#x27; to lotion in just the right balance for my skin. It sloughs as needed without tearing up or irritating my face. And the aftermath is a smoothness and glow that erases all traces of winter&#x27;s once persistent &#x27;flakes&#x27; leaving me with a soft smooth glow that makes applying moisturizer and makeup a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that a little goes a long way, making the price a better fit for my tight budget. I definitely recommend Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser for anyone that needs to renew their wintered face. For me, winter flakes are a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Smooth and makes skin feel nice and clean.  I use it in the shower each morning so it is easy to stay in routine of each day.  A little expensive but the tube seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great facial wash to go with your pro-x brush.  Not too abrasive and gets really sudsy.  Hubby uses it occasionally without the brush, and he likes it as well.</li>
            <li> Did not know they test on animals before buying.  If I knew that before hand, I would not have bought it.  I like it when I use it with the brush.</li>
            <li> It left my skin with boils .its too hard on the skin its as good as scrub not a cleanser !&lt;br /&gt;I wanna return this?</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser because it is mild yet effective. It rinses off cleanly and leaves my face feeling really good.</li>
            <li> This product works great! It leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft when you exfoliate with it, and it helps to clear your face and make it look brighter!</li>
            <li> Since this product was for my wife, I really can&#x27;t give you a review. She did tell me that it was what she wanted, so&lt;br /&gt;I guess she liked it.</li>
            <li> did not work for my oily skin</li>
            <li> this works very well !!! Made my skin feel clean, fresh and hydrated</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser; use it with my Clarisonic and it cleans my face nicely and my skin feels great. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Need on going usage to review . I like the product and this is my second purchase . I will be happy to comment at a later date.</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleanser I can say that I can not live without! I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use just any product on my face. I first used this with when I got a free sample with my pro x face scrubber macjin. It makes your skin so smooth and so clean. Its almost 25.00 in the stores so Amazon offers it at a great price! If you sign up for auto delivery they take off more money! So worth it!!</li>
            <li> I had been using neutrogena and I am glad I switched.  This has little cleansing grains in it which does a much better job without being too harsh</li>
            <li> Here is the exfoliating product I will use from now on. Gentle on the skin, but so good on the face. Not to be missed and if you get the brush it will make a real difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily but sensitive skin and this product makes my skin so clean without stripping it. I would reccomend this system</li>
            <li> Plastic microbeads and microparticles (&#x27;oxidized polyethylene&#x27;) do not simply wash away and disappear, they make it all the way from our sinks into our lakes and rivers. Even if you don&#x27;t like nature or animals, remember that we all depend on a clean environment for our food and water. For more on this problem, google &#x27;5 Gyres microbeads&#x27; or #banthebead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better ways to exfoliate include using  apricot kernel, sugar or salt scrubs. You can even make some of these in your kitchen. Many people rave about the skin-renewing benefits of dry brushing using natural bristle brushes. Glycolic acid products exfoliate without the danger of hyperpigmentation - in fact they can even out skin tone over time.</li>
            <li> Had an olay cleanser earlier and was not happy with that one. Was skeptical before buying this one. But this one works well for me :)</li>
            <li> as described, good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser in conjunction with the brush for several years now. I have sensitive skin and I have never had a problem with this product. It exfoliates my skin well and 1 tube usually lasts me several (6+) months. I use this about 2-3 times a week. This cleanser (with brush) takes off makeup very well. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin loves this stuff! Great Exfoliator!</li>
            <li> Loved the feel of the cleanser and use it everyday.  Recommended it to friends and family.  Will purchase more in the  near future.</li>
            <li> This product worked as well as expected.</li>
            <li> Only works great with their ProX Cleansing System or a clairsonic. I purchased this without having the ProX System and I didn&#x27;t think it was that great. When I purchased my ProX and realized this was to be used with it, I was sold. It worked to its full potential. Love my Olay products. I also use the regenerist serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2+ years now with its electric brush.  Much cheaper than Clarisonic system for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can use it right in the shower, the cleansing brush</li>
            <li> Always loved Olay products.  Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Nice product.feels like its doing something for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not too abrasive and really has made a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product and I like it so far. It makes my skin feel clean and fresh after every wash. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love all the Olay products and also give them as gifts to family and friends. This is a very mild exfoliating cleanser, it leaves your skin super soft and smooth, not dry. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this with Olay&#x27;s spinning brush in my morning shower and really like it.  I admit, I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t really like taking the time to use the spinning brush on my face BUT it really does make a difference.  I have cheated &amp; tried to use just the cleanser with my fingers/hands but it really doesn&#x27;t give the same affect.  My face is noticeably smoother in texture, looks better when not wearing make up and make up glides on smoother.  I also use Oil of Olay&#x27;s tinted moisturizer w/ SPF 15 which I love!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. You can feel the sand like lotion exfoliating the skin giving you the soft and clean feel.  Would recommend and will buy again</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I only exfoliate 2-3 times a week and this does not irritate my skin like many exfoliators do. It is unscented and works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty economical person and used to rarely spend over $4 on face wash and cleansers. But this stuff...this is GOOD. It exfoliates incredibly well and is gentle enough for everyday use. It&#x27;s not cheap, but a little goes a long ways. I use this with the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleaning System, and follow up with Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer in Sensitive. With this routine, I have smoother skin and less breakouts and redness. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This product comes with zero instructions. None. So it&#x27;s getting 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This is what works well with the face cleaning machines. I can&#x27;t always find this product in local stores.  Prices the same as stores IF it is free shipping</li>
            <li> Works very well with the Olay brush. Has just the right amount of exfoliation for my skin. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> UGH skin!  I have been on long term steroid therapy combined with winter&#x27;s harsh wind and cold made my face drier than the Sahara Desert. A merry go round of skin products later still no significant improvement.  Then a few weeks ago I added a variety of Olay products to do battle.  Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  How could a product that can be purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  Got news for you Olay trumps them.  My skin was actually softer and looked less lizard like.  Loved that it was fragrance free.  Sometimes I overdid the amount I needed so just scooped it up and used it elsewhere.  Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  This led me down the Olay path of skin care and I haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;I added the following to my arsenal[[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]],[[ASIN:B0012J135O Olay Complete Night Fortifying Moisture Cream 2 Oz]], [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on dry elbows and heels and can see a real difference in these areas.  Perhaps I should use it as a body scrub combined with Olay Pro X scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for troubled skin!</li>
            <li> It works okay. I didn&#x27;t realize it used plastic microbeads. I usually just use the procare brush with my other face soap and it exfoliates just as well.</li>
            <li> after purchasing it for about one year.... still using this product and it&#x27;s a very good cleanser... i use it for day and night!</li>
            <li> This cleanser keep the skin moistured and does not dry up the face after washing.  I feel clean and refresh even without putting moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so good.  I use it twice a day, once a day with the Olay brush.  My face is smoother, and feels less tight.</li>
    </ol>
