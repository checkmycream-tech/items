    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Work fine and fit very comfortably. Good to have around during allergy season and for dust-full jobs. You can actually sleep with it too.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly and were just like the description. I initially purchased these for a local Ebola breakout in our town, but they will still come in handy with cleaning or anytime I might get sick.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT &amp; DELIVERY</li>
            <li> These face masks are more comfortable than usual, and when I need to use them, it&#x27;s comfortable for periods of time.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful to wear when I am outdoors mowing in the wind!  I do not feel claustrophobic like some mask have left me feeling!! Will definitely be buying them again!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use them when I clean out the kitty litter box.  Keep all that dust out of my nose which in the past would cause a lot of sneezing and coughing.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;works as advertised</li>
            <li> This product arrived well intact BUT upon breathing thru the product it has a synthetic fragrance within that is not my cup o tea-I wore  outside with sunglasses on a windy/allergy day and upon every exhale it fogged-up my sunglasses (very irritating)  I didn&#x27;t care to wear after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> just what i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I purchased these masks to use when I do yard work.  I&#x27;m a multiple myeloma patent and I wear the mask to help prevent infection.  It seems to do a good job of reducing the dust I inhale while working in the yard and garden.  The price seems appropriate.</li>
            <li> The ones I got were musty/dusty and I threw them all out.</li>
            <li> They are great for the dust while mowing my 3 acres of lawn. The price is also right.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for this cold and flu season. These are easily wearable, breathable, disposable face masks and they are latex free. They don&#x27;t have too much of a chemical smell (a comment I noticed in other face mask reviews) -- and I have a very sensitive sense of smell. On that note, I applied some essential oils to my masks while wearing them so I could enjoy the therapeutic benefit of scent while I was recuperating. Glad to have a quantitiy of these at the ready for the next cold season!</li>
            <li> A good snug fit, and seems much more effective during yard work than my &#x27;painter&#x27;s masks&#x27;.  The ear loops are more comfortable to wear than the &#x27;behind the head bands of other styles, and the nose band adjusts very well to my snozz.  I think that these will suit me very well over the mowing season, especially during fall leave gathering!</li>
            <li> Husband is on home dialysis and face masks are a must.  These are comfortable and offer good protection.</li>
            <li> Love these masks, hands down! I&#x27;ve used many having, Asthma and all, and for comfort and confidence (this keeps out fluid from coughs/sneezes) I&#x27;m using them for life! (no pun intended) I tutor little ones and we all know how they spread germs for many months during the year. A BIG thanks to the manufacture for considering comfort, ease, and durability!</li>
            <li> Excellent fit and nice texture.  You can&#x27;t say much other than I didn&#x27;t get sick, but seriously these are very nice masks.  I honestly think they are the best you can get for the price.</li>
            <li> Comfortable - breathable.  Seem to do the job at a good price.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations.</li>
            <li> These are great when doing dusty cleanup in the basement or garage. They are more comfortable than the &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; style and provide a good seal for normal dusty jobs. I keep a box near my workbench.</li>
            <li> I work at a casino and I bought these to use there and they work great! Better quality than any of the ones I bought at the store!</li>
            <li> perfect for what I needed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most everything in Florida and use these masks to cut down on exposure.  They really work very well for me.</li>
            <li> These saved me from vertigo that is brought on by allergies or a liquid build up&lt;br /&gt;in the ear canal.  It Is now July 17 I live in the north east of Pa, I still wear this when cutting my grass</li>
            <li> okay for light work, light mowing; not for extreme dust situations</li>
            <li> Smells a little but does the job.</li>
            <li> It saves me when I mow the lawn. After 20 years without so much a sneeze, something has flown up my nose this season. These masks prevent that something from entering my nostrils anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable wearing earloop face mask, so comfortable, I forgot I was wearing this mask. It&#x27;s soft, comfortable and resillent on the skin. Breathability is so comfortable, again, I forgot I had it on. The touch is so extremely agreeable and breathing extremely easy, it&#x27;s odorless with excellent filtration and easy to wear. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good masks. They seem to fit my small face.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted them because I was taking care of a neighbor who had pneumonia and would not wear a mask. Coughing her head off.&lt;br /&gt;Now I will be prepared. Since I ordered them too late to save me this time.&lt;br /&gt;I would have ordered one of the other colors maybe next time, but the reviewers said they ran big. Since I have a small face I thought I should stay with these. They are comfortable and I&#x27;m glad I have them.</li>
            <li> These work great for me, I do dog grooming and it keeps the hairs off my face and out of my nose. You can&#x27;t beat the price. Thank you</li>
    </ol>
