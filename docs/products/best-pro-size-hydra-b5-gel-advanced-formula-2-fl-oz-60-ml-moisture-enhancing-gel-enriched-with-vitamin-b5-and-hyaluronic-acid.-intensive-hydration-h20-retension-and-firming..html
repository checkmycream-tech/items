            <li>I have T-zone oily skin and this does not aggravate that - it seems to pull in hydration and leaves a smooth texture upon which you can easily apply make up.  </li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the current interest in products with hyaluronic acid and for the price it seemed like a good bet.  </li>
            <li>I use it morning and night, and love how it really hydrates and works well with my moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then skinceuticals and doing the same great job</li>
            <li>I started using this years ago by the &#x27;other&#x27; brand and loved it</li>

            <li>Love it, it is the very same thing you  get  </li>
            <li>but my last bottle was more like water than gel.  </li>
            <li>and it has turned a funny brown color.  </li>
            <li>It is a light, fast asorbing serum with no fragrence to irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t do what the advertising blurb promises and it makes my skin break out.</li>
            <li>Skin feels very hydrated.</li>
            <li>but it is just so moisturing that i can feel every drops of serum immediately go straight into my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also less of a gel consistency and more like water.  </li>
            <li>I live in CA where they are located</li>
            <li>The gel feels light going on with a slight tightening effect.  </li>
            <li>In just two weeks of use, morning and night, today my husband noticed that the prominent winkle between my eyes was less obvious.  </li>
            <li>One little drop before my moisturizer makes a huge difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my soon-to-be-50 skin soft, hydrated, and supple.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is so hydrated and soft.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Because of my training I have some knowledge of skin care and this is the best hydrating gel I have found. It leaves my soon-to-be-50 skin soft, hydrated, and supple. The ingrdients are exactly the same and in the same amounts as the Skincentuals product but costs less than half! It is a light, fast asorbing serum with no fragrence to irritate sensitive skin. Do yourself a favor and try this if you need a good hydrating moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the current interest in products with hyaluronic acid and for the price it seemed like a good bet.  In just two weeks of use, morning and night, today my husband noticed that the prominent winkle between my eyes was less obvious.  While in my late 50&#x27;s I work at keeping a good skin regimen and have only a few prominent wrinkles, so for him to make an unsolicited comment - well, that speaks volumes.  The gel feels light going on with a slight tightening effect.  Works great under make up.  This is the first Product Review I have even written on Amazon and it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m truly impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it, it is the very same thing you  get  at  the  Dr. office  for  alot less  1oz at  dr  was   72.36 put  this  on  right  side  of  face  for  2 weeks  put  other  one  from  Dr.  on  left  side of  face   after  2 weeks   could tell   they  are  just  alike am  very  very happy  with  this product and ordering  was  so  easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and feel it does help with filling.  I would have given it a 5 ranking but my last bottle was more like water than gel.  Not sure why it was so watery but it seemed to work the same.  Great under any additional products it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any issues with absorption.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE. IF I COULD BATH IN THIS STUF I WOULD. I HAD BAD ACNE AND USED THIS ALONG WITH THE OTHER PRODUCTS AND IT WORKED</li>
            <li> I had been using SkinCeuticals for many years until I found this product.  The quality is just like the one SkinCeuticals has.  However, the price is in different range.  I am very happy about this product and I am using the 2nd bottle already.</li>
            <li> This gel absorbs well and hydrates beautifully. No sticky or greasy feeling afterwards which is what I look for. I started off just trying this company&#x27;s Vit C and Phyto + products and loved those so much I wanted to try this. Much better value and quality than Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the branded product and gave this a chance. Definitely more economical and still does the trick! Hydrating!</li>
            <li> I had tried the Skinceuticals version of hydrating B5 gel and loved it…that is everything but the price. This product works just like that one, and it is affordable. I use it morning and night, and love how it really hydrates and works well with my moisturizers. I bought it as a gift for friends who also love it.</li>
            <li> Thank God the price is affordable and why shouldn&#x27;t every woman have a chance to look her best and afford quality products.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t do what the advertising blurb promises and it makes my skin break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year. It has become a staple I won&#x27;t do without. I&#x27;m 40 year old, female that struggles with acne and wrinkles. One little drop before my moisturizer makes a huge difference in the texture of my skin. I have plump toned skin. It is especially awesome to use after a peel or any other aggressive skin treatment.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product ! Have been using for over 2 years now experiencing noticeable reduction in wrinkles &amp; fine lines. Skin feels very hydrated. The best Hyaluronic Acid product for your money !</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for over a year and loves it - same quality as the leading brand at half the price.</li>
            <li> I incorporate this with my skincare.  Now my skin is so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, and THE BEST HA available!</li>
            <li> I doubt this product is anything more than water.  I purchased a Skinceuticals brand B5 gels and I loved it, but it was expensive.  So I tried this brand and it was terrible.  I bought mine in June and it has turned a funny brown color.  It&#x27;s also less of a gel consistency and more like water.  There&#x27;s no way this product is actually what they advertise it to be.</li>
            <li> I know this brand when I was searching skinceuticals on the web, every reviews are saying it&#x27;s perform the same but at much lower price so I give it a try. I have a very dry and sensitive skin but it is just so moisturing that i can feel every drops of serum immediately go straight into my skin. The ingredients are natural that it don&#x27;t give me any breakout. i got so many compliments from my friends and they have alreday follow me to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone of you. It is a must have skin care and I would suggest to buy this larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I am hope that they would even offer the 240ml size!</li>
            <li> I am 52 with very dry skin. This product is fabulous. Silky elegant feel. I use it over the Vit C 20% and under my own moisturizer. I am a repeat purchaser and this product is really great - and at a great price, too.</li>
            <li> I started using this years ago by the &#x27;other&#x27; brand and loved it but I just can&#x27;t justify that price anymore.  Found this brand and tried the one-ounce - I was so pleased I just bought the two-ounce.  I love the hygenic eye-dropper delivery system and it&#x27;s thick like a serum yet light-weight so a little goes a long way - I bought the one-ounce in late July and am still working on that bottle.  I have T-zone oily skin and this does not aggravate that - it seems to pull in hydration and leaves a smooth texture upon which you can easily apply make up.  I live in CA where they are located so delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> What it doesn&#x27;t do:  create pimples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does do:  Hydrate and soften skin, when used with a product such as Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Skinceuticals version as it seems more moisturizing, but this is slightly less expensive. If you are wanting a better brand go to Skinceuticals</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, just as expected. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then skinceuticals and doing the same great job</li>
