            <li>, the color is amazing and the quality too , also it has a good value !</li>
            <li>Beautiful right out of the box!!!</li>
            <li>To hide the thining, or to just feel confident and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Iam very pleased with my purchace.</li>
            <li>and I was more impressed by how real it looked.</li>
            <li>I am a first time wig user and i would say this is about as good as it gets!</li>
            <li>The quality is nice, better than most wigs, but i don&#x27;t know if its heat resistant and</li>
            <li>I am wearing it to the mall with my friend today :)</li>
            <li>I definetly plan on buying more of my wigs from Hollywood_hair4u.</li>
            <li>Wish I could have found more to like.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality wig, especially for the price that I paid.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s great (:</li>
            <li>I purchased a wig cap to go with it which may explain why no problems with fit.</li>
            <li>It was amazing how fast they ordered it.</li>
            <li>The color is light ash blond.</li>
            <li>it was so cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>In my professional opinion, I think this style is best suited  for girls who have smaller noses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and doesn&#x27;t seem too apt to tangle or knot like rougher wig materials can be.</li>
            <li>This would be good for Halloween, but if your looking for a daily wig, i don&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Arrived in great condition and with a simple shake and wash was ready to go.</li>
            <li>Mono-Skin part top makes the blend easier to cover your natural hair color under the cap.</li>
            <li>A clear examination of this wig is: Very durable, strong, thick, beautiful colar, perfect fit, very similar to human hair.</li>
            <li>It came super fast!</li>
            <li>The wig is all right</li>
            <li>Super thick looking, awesome blonde color.</li>
            <li>The color and style look exactly as they do in the photo.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>Second wig aand love them both</li>
            <li>The hair feels so real and is so pretty.</li>
            <li>Love it cap just a bit small color is lovely and soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this wig for haloween to dress up as Lady Gaga, and it is better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Shipping was decently fast though.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I get complements on it and every one thinks its my real hair.</li>
            <li>Please take it from me, a women who has much experience with fashion &amp; durable wigs.</li>
            <li>It is my 2nd favorite next to my $5,000 follea which says TONS!</li>
            <li>My main issue was how itchy the wig was when I wore it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely consider buying more wigs in the future!</li>
            <li>This wig is high in quality.</li>
            <li>First thing i noticed was that the actual wig itself wont fit over my head properly - My hair is semi thick, but still, there is not enough room inside to fit all of my hair and sit on my head comfortably...</li>
            <li>In certain lightings the net will show through around the back or top but barely enough to be noticed.</li>
            <li>I just had to lightly shake the wig then smooth it down on the sides and pull the bangs forward a little.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to WOW them with...</li>

            <li> I have ordered many wigs, but the part was very poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li> It looks long because the mannequin had has a very short neck.</li>
            <li> The hair is not as long as it looks in the photo.</li>
            <li> We would definitely buy other wigs from Hollywood Hair 4u.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is a pole-dancer and the wig stayed put, the hair moved naturally and she seemed saucier than usual due to the effects of blonde hair on one&#x27;s attitude.</li>
            <li> The part and bangs are weird and need work in order to look anything near normal.</li>
            <li> The inside is rough with scratchy lace.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and recieved it a few days later</li>
            <li> im not willing to ruin one of my curling irons to find out.</li>
            <li> The wig is so thin that you can clearly see the cap underneath.  </li>
            <li> Did have to cut the bangs a little.</li>
            <li> And it has the small plastic hooks and loops on the inside for changing the size.</li>
            <li> but the hair seems dull to me.</li>
            <li> For quite some time, because of thinning hair, then having chemotherapy for my cancer, I have been wearing wigs for approximately 3 years.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how fake it looked, but I did like the color.  </li>

            <li> Received wig color beautiful but it needs to be trimmed for me. Made a mistake &amp; didn&#x27;t buy pins &amp; cap. Going to order now.</li>
            <li> The wig looks a lot like the picture with one exception, it&#x27;s alot thinner than the one that is pictured.  The wig is so thin that you can clearly see the cap underneath.  I would never wear it.  Luckly, I bought it for a mannequin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this wig for haloween to dress up as Lady Gaga, and it is better than I expected it to be. Although the color is slighly darker than the picture shows. Overall, it&#x27;s great (:</li>
            <li> First thing i noticed was that the actual wig itself wont fit over my head properly - My hair is semi thick, but still, there is not enough room inside to fit all of my hair and sit on my head comfortably...even if i adjust the straps. The hair is not as long as it looks in the photo. It looks long because the mannequin had has a very short neck. The quality is nice, better than most wigs, but i don&#x27;t know if its heat resistant and im not willing to ruin one of my curling irons to find out. This would be good for Halloween, but if your looking for a daily wig, i don&#x27;t recommend this one. Shipping was decently fast though.</li>

We would definitely buy other wigs from Hollywood Hair 4u.</li>
            <li> i bought this wig for homecoming and i got it 3 DAYS after i ordered it.! It was amazing how fast they ordered it. I am a first time wig user and i would say this is about as good as it gets! Not that i would know, but it fits perfectly and stays put. I just have to use A LOT of hairspray to make my wig cao stay put. Otherwise that it was absolutley perfect. I am wearing it to the mall with my friend today :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful right out of the box!!! This hair is think and gorgeous! It is my 2nd favorite next to my $5,000 follea which says TONS!</li>
            <li> It came super fast! You could not ask for better service, however the product was not wonderful. The wig is all right but the hair seems dull to me. The color is light ash blond. The part and bangs are weird and need work in order to look anything near normal. My main issue was how itchy the wig was when I wore it. I could not keep it on for an hour. The inside is rough with scratchy lace. The wig was also longer than the picture shown.</li>
            <li> i lovethis wig , it beautifull , the color is amazing and the quality too , also it has a good value !</li>
            <li> Buying a wig online is always a bit of buyer-beware purchase but this one turned out to be great! The color and style look exactly as they do in the photo. I just had to lightly shake the wig then smooth it down on the sides and pull the bangs forward a little. It&#x27;s very soft and doesn&#x27;t seem too apt to tangle or knot like rougher wig materials can be. In certain lightings the net will show through around the back or top but barely enough to be noticed. And it has the small plastic hooks and loops on the inside for changing the size. I definetly plan on buying more of my wigs from Hollywood_hair4u.</li>
            <li> I got my wig today in a record amount of time,  but...it was so cheap looking.  I have ordered many wigs, but the part was very poorly constructed.  I am keeping the wig, but never again.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I didn&#x27;t like how fake it looked, but I did like the color.  Wish I could have found more to like.</li>
            <li> Love it cap just a bit small color is lovely and soft</li>
            <li> My wife loves this wig. She loves the fullness and the length. She will keep in touch with you. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Fits well.  Exactly like the picture.  Did have to cut the bangs a little.</li>
            <li> Needed this for a costume for a dinner party. Arrived in great condition and with a simple shake and wash was ready to go. Mono-Skin part top makes the blend easier to cover your natural hair color under the cap.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Second wig aand love them both</li>
            <li> Very good quality wig, especially for the price that I paid. I would definitely consider buying more wigs in the future!</li>
            <li> Saw this wig in the pictures and for the price I was impressed. I ordered it and recieved it a few days later and I was more impressed by how real it looked. I have worn it 3 times already and I get complements on it and every one thinks its my real hair. It is comfortable to wear. The hair feels so real and is so pretty. I am so happy I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Super thick looking, awesome blonde color. If you are looking for something to WOW them with...this will do it! Great value. You may need to trim the bangs to suit your face. In my professional opinion, I think this style is best suited  for girls who have smaller noses.</li>
            <li> This wig is high in quality. Iam very pleased with my purchace.Please take it from me, a women who has much experience with fashion &amp; durable wigs. For quite some time, because of thinning hair, then having chemotherapy for my cancer, I have been wearing wigs for approximately 3 years. To hide the thining, or to just feel confident and beautiful. A clear examination of this wig is: Very durable, strong, thick, beautiful colar, perfect fit, very similar to human hair. Also because of ordering from Amazon I never had to leave my home, which some women may feel hesitant to leave the house, because of personal reasons......Amazon has made it easy!Thanks you for the quality Amazon!!!</li>
