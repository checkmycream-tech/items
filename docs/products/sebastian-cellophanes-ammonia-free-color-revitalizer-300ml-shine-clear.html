            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful and every where I go people compliment my hair color, and the shine.  </li>
            <li>that if you have this product applied by a licensed hairdresser the outcome will be beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Great for sealing and strengthening hair follicles.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Worked great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great bodifier, and adds shine and preserves color.</li>
            <li>However, the results I get with this product using a heated cap at home aren&#x27;t great and are gone in a matter of days.</li>
            <li>Tried it and was happy with result.</li>
            <li>I am truly happy with how the product works on my hair without leaving a residue.</li>
            <li>I wish Sebastian would advertise more so that everyone would know about this excellent product.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it, now that daughter told me where to purchase it</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Way better try than any salon treatment!  </li>
            <li>(the shine makes the grays look really nice).</li>
            <li>Use at your own risk.........</li>
            <li>They are TRULY ammonia free, and they have saved me more than once when a salon (or two in a row!!)</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>LOVE these cellophanes.</li>
            <li>Then one day I remembered this product, went online and was pleased to find out it was being sold through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I mention this because if you use it immediately after a relaxer, it will be a more permanent color.  </li>
            <li>But it really is a healthy hair alternative for people with hair problems, that want (or in my case) need hair color.  </li>
            <li>I use them between salon visits to keep my hair looking healthy and shinny.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply this replacement by myself, and saved a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>Hair is slicker and glossier with more body.  </li>
            <li>Or, your gonna love this one instead of trying to save money and use this product yourself, go to a stylist instead.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely,  Alpha Critic</li>
            <li>I love it, and I will save hundreds buying it here.</li>
            <li>I use very gentle non-toxic shampoo and conditioner to help keep my hair in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Love how easy it is to use even with a relaxer.</li>
            <li>Easy to use at home.</li>
            <li>Easy transaction.</li>
            <li>This product leaves m hair strong and shiny.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what you need to enhance your own color because of the shine it gives you.  </li>
            <li>Shiny and covered my little gray strands perfectly.  </li>
            <li>From the reviews I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get the expected shine, but over all it a great product.</li>
            <li>and I do use a mild relaxer on my hair.</li>
            <li>It may require a professional salon heater/dryer to work, or maybe the clear gloss is just not that great a product.</li>
            <li>It covered my gray completely and my hair is healthy and shiny for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>The fit was as promised, packaging was sturdy, and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>For heavens sake, there is a reason why these agents are so rare and unpopular--</li>
            <li>Oh, I also purchased the clear and used it according to directions on my daughters long and beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>By the way I used golden brunette.</li>
            <li>It came out a reddish brown with golden highlights.</li>
            <li>Yes it does, but the salon applies a cream (or you can use vaseline) around the hair line, ears, back of neck which effectively allows the stain on the skin to be wiped off easily.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Fortunately a salon near me had the product however they had never used it as a full colour treatment.</li>
            <li>It gives your hair lots of shine and makes it soft and easy to manager.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but this is not heavy.</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>I though it would help seal the dry ends and make it more manageable</li>
            <li>I really like using cellophanes at home.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after I used this product.  </li>
            <li>Hair even looks healther it fells silky soft when being washed and also when dry :)</li>
            <li>I know it is geared toward High End salons and High Fashion.</li>
            <li>A must have for those of us who want to stay natural, and want the straight look without a relaxer.</li>
            <li>ave used this product before but not in clear, worked very well.</li>
            <li>Unlike regular haircoloring agents on the market, these unique formulations stain your skin (on your fingers, forehead, scalp)very deeply and semi-permanently.</li>
            <li>You can get about 5 uses from a single tube so it is economical as well.</li>
            <li>but I like sticking with the clear.</li>
            <li>But whether you use it as a masque or for styling, it seems to help seal the hair and preserve color (I use the clear version.)</li>
            <li>Buy the clear.  </li>
            <li>I want to go gray naturally, but I like a clear gloss just to give my hair shine and richness</li>
            <li>Dear Consumer,    Please note that this product is to be used by a PROFESSIONAL hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>Wow there&#x27;s a thought.    </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d spring for a professional treatment in my salon rather than buy this product again.</li>
            <li>finally i can take care my hair now thank you so much</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a black color available, so I purchased this and mixed with semi-permanent color EZ Glam.</li>
            <li>To be a non professional and attempt to use this product your results will be self inflicted and you will get stained everywhere and receive mixed results.    </li>
            <li>I have long naturally curly hair which I straighten or curl or blow out.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have long naturally curly hair which I straighten or curl or blow out.  </li>
            <li> I have pale ash blonde hair (L&#x27;Oreal 8.5) and used the clear cellophane.  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the right mix of colour for me as I combined a dark and lighter brown together.</li>
            <li> I sustained some minor hail damage during a storm, and my side view window was cracked.  </li>
            <li> This rinse is not as harsh and leaves my hair feeling soft and glossy.  </li>
            <li> I apply it at the same time I give my self a little at home facial</li>
            <li> I am extremely allergic to any regular hair dyes and it was suggested to try this product.</li>
            <li> I was literally in tears because nothing I used covered my gray hair and everything made my hair dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> You use less, obviously, as a styling finish.</li>
            <li> Repeated rubbing with alcohol, baby oil, soap, and any other solvent that my skin would tolerate resulted in a reduction of coloration on my fingertips after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Three weeks later, my hair is still flat iron straight even through rain and bad weather.  </li>
            <li> I can cover the mess with these and get through it until it grows out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> After trying permanent color once , I decided I would never ever do that again because it&#x27;s way to harsh, but this does the job and keeps my hair healthier.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly and was totally disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li> And least forever.</li>
            <li> Made my hair thick and shinny.</li>
            <li> We cut a piece of hair for a before and after comparison and I can tell you with all scientific certainty that the result was subtle to the point of unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> My hair was in worse condition than before this product.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, it is almost impossible to use the darker shades without making your scalp and face edges black.</li>

            <li> I have used cellopanes in yrs before and I loved it, now that daughter told me where to purchase it (Amazon) I immediately order it on line. It gives your hair lots of shine and makes it soft and easy to manager. It does come in different colors but I like sticking with the clear. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use at home. Made my hair thick and shinny. You can get about 5 uses from a single tube so it is economical as well.</li>
            <li> Unlike regular haircoloring agents on the market, these unique formulations stain your skin (on your fingers, forehead, scalp)very deeply and semi-permanently. Therefore, it is almost impossible to use the darker shades without making your scalp and face edges black. Repeated rubbing with alcohol, baby oil, soap, and any other solvent that my skin would tolerate resulted in a reduction of coloration on my fingertips after a couple of days. I was not foolish enough to ever apply them to my hair as this would have been a disaster after my finger-play. For heavens sake, there is a reason why these agents are so rare and unpopular-- they suck. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. Oh, I also purchased the clear and used it according to directions on my daughters long and beautiful hair. We cut a piece of hair for a before and after comparison and I can tell you with all scientific certainty that the result was subtle to the point of unnoticeable. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE these cellophanes. They are TRULY ammonia free, and they have saved me more than once when a salon (or two in a row!!) had WRECKED my hair. I can cover the mess with these and get through it until it grows out.</li>
            <li> Affordable. Shipment came on time and intact. My hairdresser put it in two days after receiving it. Three weeks later, my hair is still flat iron straight even through rain and bad weather.  A must have for those of us who want to stay natural, and want the straight look without a relaxer. Great for sealing and strengthening hair follicles.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had forgotten about  cellophanes for years and had been using permanent hair color.  I was literally in tears because nothing I used covered my gray hair and everything made my hair dry and brittle.  Then one day I remembered this product, went online and was pleased to find out it was being sold through Amazon.  It covered my gray completely and my hair is healthy and shiny for the first time in years! I am African American and I do use a mild relaxer on my hair. I mention this because if you use it immediately after a relaxer, it will be a more permanent color.  Which is what I wanted. It is beautiful and every where I go people compliment my hair color, and the shine.  I am so thankful that this product exists, without it I considered wearing a wig. I wish Sebastian would advertise more so that everyone would know about this excellent product.  I know it is geared toward High End salons and High Fashion. But it really is a healthy hair alternative for people with hair problems, that want (or in my case) need hair color.  By the way I used golden brunette. It came out a reddish brown with golden highlights. Please NEVER stop making this product!</li>
            <li> I really like using cellophanes at home. I use them between salon visits to keep my hair looking healthy and shinny. I get complements on my hair all the time and this is one of the reasons why. Very easy to use. I apply it at the same time I give my self a little at home facial so I kill two beauty birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy transaction.</li>
            <li> I sustained some minor hail damage during a storm, and my side view window was cracked.  I was able to apply this replacement by myself, and saved a lot of money.  The fit was as promised, packaging was sturdy, and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I have pale ash blonde hair (L&#x27;Oreal 8.5) and used the clear cellophane.  Followed the directions implicitly.  Worked great.  Hair is slicker and glossier with more body.  No brass, no discoloration.  I will use this product again and again.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I have fine hair, but this is not heavy. It&#x27;s a great bodifier, and adds shine and preserves color. You can also use it as a blow-drying styling product--leaving it in/on the hair, no washing off. You use less, obviously, as a styling finish. But whether you use it as a masque or for styling, it seems to help seal the hair and preserve color (I use the clear version.)</li>
            <li> Excellent!  It makes my hair so shiny!</li>
            <li> I want to go gray naturally, but I like a clear gloss just to give my hair shine and richness (the shine makes the grays look really nice). However, the results I get with this product using a heated cap at home aren&#x27;t great and are gone in a matter of days. It may require a professional salon heater/dryer to work, or maybe the clear gloss is just not that great a product. I&#x27;ll move on to trying a different product next time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair at all. I used a heating cap for 20 minutes</li>
            <li> Dear Consumer,    Please note that this product is to be used by a PROFESSIONAL hairdresser.  Trust me when I type to you that if you have this product applied by a licensed hairdresser the outcome will be beautiful.  To be a non professional and attempt to use this product your results will be self inflicted and you will get stained everywhere and receive mixed results.    If you feel you have what it takes...go to the website and LEARN how the product is to be executed    Or, your gonna love this one instead of trying to save money and use this product yourself, go to a stylist instead.  Wow there&#x27;s a thought.    Use at your own risk.........and yes I am a hairdresser.    Sincerely,  Alpha Critic</li>
            <li> I have been using the Cellophane Laminates for over 5 years to colour my hair. I am extremely allergic to any regular hair dyes and it was suggested to try this product. Fortunately a salon near me had the product however they had never used it as a full colour treatment. It took a few tries to get the right mix of colour for me as I combined a dark and lighter brown together. It lasts about 2 months. There have been comments about how it stains. Yes it does, but the salon applies a cream (or you can use vaseline) around the hair line, ears, back of neck which effectively allows the stain on the skin to be wiped off easily.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who is allergic, or who does not like the &#x27;burning&#x27; sensation the traditional hair dyes creates, try this out with a professional.&lt;br /&gt;To Sebastian..why are you not screaming the benefits of this product for people with allergies, or for cancer patients who should not colour their hair for a year after any chemo treatment?</li>
            <li> This product leaves m hair strong and shiny. I have had several compliments from people who have no idea that I have used this treatment.</li>
            <li> This rinse is not as harsh and leaves my hair feeling soft and glossy.  Love how easy it is to use even with a relaxer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after I used this product.  I think I&#x27;d spring for a professional treatment in my salon rather than buy this product again.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! I though it would help seal the dry ends and make it more manageable and it did.  Hair even looks healther it fells silky soft when being washed and also when dry :)</li>
            <li> Tried it and was happy with result. Hair is manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> finally i can take care my hair now thank you so much</li>
            <li> I really like this! There wasn&#x27;t a black color available, so I purchased this and mixed with semi-permanent color EZ Glam. My hair came out great! Shiny and covered my little gray strands perfectly.  I like that even after wash, my hair hair was still shiny. After trying permanent color once , I decided I would never ever do that again because it&#x27;s way to harsh, but this does the job and keeps my hair healthier.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it. And least forever.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser charges me $40 a pop for this treatment. I love it, and I will save hundreds buying it here.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I was excited to try this product.  I have long naturally curly hair which I straighten or curl or blow out.  I used this product twice to give it a try.  I followed the instructions exactly and was totally disappointed with the results.  My hair was in worse condition than before this product.  I use very gentle non-toxic shampoo and conditioner to help keep my hair in good condition.  So it had to be this product that caused the dryness to my hair.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE CURLY HAIR.</li>
            <li> Way better try than any salon treatment!  Buy the clear.  Its exactly what you need to enhance your own color because of the shine it gives you.  Won&#x27;t change your hair color!</li>
            <li> ave used this product before but not in clear, worked very well. Didn&#x27;t get the expected shine, but over all it a great product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT. BIGGER THAN I THOGHT</li>
            <li> Sebastian makes the best product.  I am truly happy with how the product works on my hair without leaving a residue.</li>
