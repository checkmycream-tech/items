            <li> My friend just love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Price was half of what the manufacture was charging and you could not buy it in the department store.  Easy to use spray bottle with a magnetic cap - good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is amazing. The ladies love it!</li>
            <li> The best smelling cologne in years.  Love the fresh light scent.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this scent while shopping at a department store.  The price in the department store was almost double what was listed on amazon.com.  If you purchase this scent, you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> Would definitely reorder this product.  Has a really good scent that my husband loves.  Very good price compared to the store.</li>
            <li> They sent me the &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; instead of the green.  An RA at this price was a hassle so I just kept it.</li>
            <li> Spicy floral arrangement, chicks dig it</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Rocks. Usually when I wear a cologne, it gives me a headache, but this sent is light and fresh. My girlfriend loves it and I always get compliments when I&#x27;m out and about about my scent.</li>
            <li> It was a present, they like it.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery great.</li>
            <li> One of our Grandsons showed an interest in this for Christmas and he was very pleased that we gave it to him!  Upon his recommedation, I would recommend it to any friends who are interested.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear Penguin Rocks, at least one person a day asks me what that fragrance is.  It smells so freaking good!!!</li>
            <li> Sophisticated, mature, elegant. This by at first is a little bit of s turn off. But after a couple of hours the drydown it&#x27;s amazing. Ambit last forever, 9 to 10 hours a day easy. Very masculine, lots of tobacco notes with a sweet vanilla background.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a sample of Penguin Rocks on one arm &amp; sprayed my favorite cologne/ Drakkar on the other.  At the end of a hot/steamy day the Rocks was still smelling good, the Drakkar faded.  I am now a Rocks fan &amp; have ordered my bottle via Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent.  Much cheaper on Amazon than the Dept Store.</li>
            <li> We really liked the product &amp; we recieved it very quickly.  Would recommend this product or company to future buyers.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought me this cologne and i was very pleased. It has a fantastic scent that both her and i love. However, it does not seem to last very long. It smells very good for the first 10-30 minutes. After that, it just seems to fade away. 2 hours after putting it on, my girlfriend got right next to my neck and told me she couldn&#x27;t smell anything. while it smells very good, i won&#x27;t be getting this again after i run out. it just simply doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> A WONDERFUL COLOGNE WITH PERFECT NOTES! LOVE THE SCENT.  IT &amp;#34;ROCKS&amp;#34; UNDER THE PENGUIN LABEL. tHE BOTTLE IS UNIQUELY DESIGNED WITH A MAGNETIC CAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MUNSINGWEAR HAS A WINNER, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS BEING DISCONTINUED.</li>
