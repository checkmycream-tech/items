            <li>very nice, quality package.  </li>
            <li>Top quality, best set I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>The most awesome grooming kit ever.</li>
            <li>They fit in the bag perfectly as well and the bag looks great.  </li>
            <li>I paid over $100 for this set a couple of years ago, and at that price point I did not think the value was that good.</li>
            <li>Nice weight to the tools and great precision.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loved them.  </li>
            <li>One superb kit with strong and nice steelpices.</li>
            <li>The nail scissor is exceptional.</li>
            <li>These are beautifully crafted, with a good angle to make them easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;-Nail file.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love this kit!  </li>
            <li>The leather case is very nice; supple leather and strong zipper.</li>
            <li>Words can&#x27;t express how amazing the set is.</li>
            <li>and if I&#x27;m paying this much I hope my kit is perfect-</li>
            <li>Nice leather case.</li>
            <li>The set was nice but not up to its price.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and they felt so nice that I decided to buy a kit for myself.</li>
            <li>The large nail clipper is also very good.  </li>
            <li>I travel a lot and wanted a nice kit for my nails to keep them in top condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything I&#x27;ve used so far has performed perfectly.</li>
            <li>Clippers are very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Best nail care tools I&#x27;ve ever used, very high quality worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My value on this set would be $30, and not a penny more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Top quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but after having lost some many nail clippers, the price and the quality is what prevents me from leaving them lying around and keeping better care of this set.</li>
            <li>Excellent grooming kit that will last for a life time.  </li>
            <li>I have owned the vaunted German brand and they are impressive.  </li>
            <li>I have been consistently impressed with their attention to the metal, construction and especially edge-honing of each of these.</li>
            <li>Outstanding in every detail.</li>
            <li>A billionaire can&#x27;t buy better.</li>
            <li>but this set isn&#x27;t better than a drug store manicure set</li>
            <li>This is a top class product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I got these for my fiance-- wonderful basic kit of all of the essentials, and I was BLOWN AWAY by the quality and sharpness!</li>
            <li>This many not be a problem for you, but I prefer a curved clipper.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s priceless even though it will probably last longer than me.</li>
            <li>simply better than any clippers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>Get the best and it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>This kit includes very useful items you may not use often, but are nice to have.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost!!</li>
            <li>So very cool.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I would have been better off spending $50 on a really good mixed set of cutters and scissors.</li>
            <li>With this set, as soon as you slide the clippers out of the case you notice a quality difference, that is confirmed many times over when you put them to use.</li>
            <li>so they reach everywhere easily</li>
            <li>Just needed to be slightly larger but still great</li>
            <li>Even my wife and mom are seriously in awww of it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>These are a great investment if you&#x27;re looking for something that will last.  </li>
            <li>As far as the kit, good kit at this price point, like I stated.</li>
            <li>The quality is outstanding, case is great and the edge on everything is as sharp as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clippers are excellent and cleanly cut the nails with very little pressure.</li>
            <li>I certainly was for many years, figuring any one set was just as good as the next.</li>
            <li>Amazing, old school Quality.</li>
            <li>Nice snapping action to the clippers.</li>
            <li>The file is not bad, but again, about $7.</li>
            <li>BUT the clever files attached to each clipper allow me to file the sharp corners and edges to perfect rounded edges!</li>
            <li>Everything in this kit is surgically sharp with great precision.  </li>
            <li>Sharp blades cut very nicely.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a present - it&#x27;s in a very nice leather case and the tools are high quality.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the fine grade of steel</li>
            <li>They just feel like precision instruments in your hand, and cut/clip clean and crisp...</li>
            <li>Not to mention- a lot of cheap nose clippers I&#x27;ve used leave a smell thanks to the metal, and these don&#x27;t have that issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tweezers are worth about $3.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not stabbing yourself.</li>
            <li>I do not believe the price was worth the $80</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth every Penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for someone who wants a nice, complete set without having to spend the prices that you would with Soligen.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The kit is a bit pricey but it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The back of these clippers has a large pad that helps you hold them, they&#x27;re gorgeous and very tactile.</li>
            <li>First time that I decided to buy a high end grooming kit, and it was definitely worth it, the tools in this kit for nail clipping are fantastic in handling and operation.</li>
            <li>The case is real leather and everything fits in nicely and compacted, you don&#x27;t not have any issues when you open and remove each tool as it is well laid out.</li>
            <li>Very modern looking.</li>
            <li>My husband, who is a tool addict, likes it very much and hides it away after each use because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;so nice.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>All of the other items in the kit are of the same quality as is the very nice case with a full zipper.</li>
            <li>This set is lovely enough that you&#x27;ll be thinking about where it&#x27;s going to go in your will when you pass it on.</li>
            <li>The whole family loves it!</li>
            <li>Super high quality blades.</li>
            <li>Sharp, solid, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the German set was not available and the reviews were very good.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, these are completely straight whereas the larger ones are curved.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set but not worth the premium price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Well, to be honest, all the blades are samurai sword sharp!  </li>
            <li>They are nice in the hand and operate in a smoothly like a well made machine.&lt;br /&gt;The other items in this kit are not quite the same quality.  </li>
            <li>I also have a Zwilling Ultra Slim nail clipper, it looks great and slim, but it doesn&#x27;t stay sharp for a long time (</li>
            <li>I was looking for a kit that was &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and although this kit would be fine for a woman the tools are definitely the manliest ones I&#x27;ve seen without buying something hokey.  </li>
            <li>VERY HIGH QUALITY SET WITH LEATHER CASE.  </li>
            <li>If you really like this set please let me know why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: November 8th 2015&lt;</li>
            <li>The rest of the kit isn&#x27;t much though.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It has a straight face.  </li>
            <li>The leather case is supple and high-quality, and the tools are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This set is very well made.  </li>
            <li>Very well made including pouch.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal.</li>
            <li>The moment you unzip the heavy zipper on this lovely leather case, you realize that your money was worth it.</li>
            <li>The tools are cleverly crafted and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Recently though, I&#x27;ve been on an &amp;#34;attainable luxury&amp;#34; kick, acquiring the best items I can find for small, simple things (like grooming tools) that I use frequently.</li>
            <li>They would compare to a decent $10 clipper.</li>
            <li>The leather case is very soft and holds everything together very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this manufacturers clippers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like the kit a lot, and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The clippers are very sharp and make a very clean cut.</li>
            <li>Real soft leather and</li>
            <li>Very fine quality, but not sure if the price is favorable.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance as a Christmas gift after looking all over the place for a nice, reasonably priced Solingen set that would include the three pieces he specified that he wanted (big clippers, small clippers, scissors).  </li>
            <li>Light weight and sharp.</li>
            <li>Smelling the new leather alone is a treat.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off going to CVS and getting all the components for $25 and getting a few professional manicures.</li>
            <li>Now with the price almost half of what I paid I would give this a 4 star review, but since I did pay a lot more I only raised it by one star ...</li>
            <li>The quality far surpasses my expectations.</li>
            <li>The clippers and scissors alone are so worth the money I spent for everything.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are nice, but not great.</li>
            <li>From the supple leather to the stupidly amazing clip action, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li>These are also curved and rather gently which I like, these actually don&#x27;t have a nail file like the smaller version.</li>
            <li>The clippers included in this set are at least as sharp and easy to use as my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are scissors, not worth much.</li>
            <li>Though I was not familiar with Seki Edge, I decided to order this set based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>These nail clippers have straight cutting blades, so they are easy to re-sharpen.</li>
            <li>even when it&#x27;s still new, it isn&#x27;t as sharp as Seki Edge), now it&#x27;s in my drawer somewhere.</li>

            <li> BUT the clever files attached to each clipper allow me to file the sharp corners and edges to perfect rounded edges!</li>
            <li> Everything in this kit is surgically sharp with great precision.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades cut very nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a present - it&#x27;s in a very nice leather case and the tools are high quality.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the fine grade of steel</li>
            <li> They just feel like precision instruments in your hand, and cut/clip clean and crisp...</li>
            <li> Not to mention- a lot of cheap nose clippers I&#x27;ve used leave a smell thanks to the metal, and these don&#x27;t have that issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tweezers are worth about $3.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not stabbing yourself.</li>
            <li> I do not believe the price was worth the $80</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth every Penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for someone who wants a nice, complete set without having to spend the prices that you would with Soligen.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The kit is a bit pricey but it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The back of these clippers has a large pad that helps you hold them, they&#x27;re gorgeous and very tactile.</li>
            <li> First time that I decided to buy a high end grooming kit, and it was definitely worth it, the tools in this kit for nail clipping are fantastic in handling and operation.</li>
            <li> The case is real leather and everything fits in nicely and compacted, you don&#x27;t not have any issues when you open and remove each tool as it is well laid out.</li>
            <li> Very modern looking.</li>
            <li> My husband, who is a tool addict, likes it very much and hides it away after each use because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;so nice.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> All of the other items in the kit are of the same quality as is the very nice case with a full zipper.</li>
            <li> This set is lovely enough that you&#x27;ll be thinking about where it&#x27;s going to go in your will when you pass it on.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves it!</li>
            <li> Super high quality blades.</li>
            <li> Sharp, solid, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the German set was not available and the reviews were very good.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, these are completely straight whereas the larger ones are curved.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set but not worth the premium price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Well, to be honest, all the blades are samurai sword sharp!  </li>
            <li> They are nice in the hand and operate in a smoothly like a well made machine.&lt;br /&gt;The other items in this kit are not quite the same quality.  </li>
            <li> I also have a Zwilling Ultra Slim nail clipper, it looks great and slim, but it doesn&#x27;t stay sharp for a long time (</li>
            <li> I was looking for a kit that was &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and although this kit would be fine for a woman the tools are definitely the manliest ones I&#x27;ve seen without buying something hokey.  </li>
            <li> VERY HIGH QUALITY SET WITH LEATHER CASE.  </li>
            <li> If you really like this set please let me know why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: November 8th 2015&lt;</li>
            <li> The rest of the kit isn&#x27;t much though.</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It has a straight face.  </li>
            <li> The leather case is supple and high-quality, and the tools are very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This set is very well made.  </li>
            <li> Very well made including pouch.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal.</li>
            <li> The moment you unzip the heavy zipper on this lovely leather case, you realize that your money was worth it.</li>
            <li> The tools are cleverly crafted and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Recently though, I&#x27;ve been on an &amp;#34;attainable luxury&amp;#34; kick, acquiring the best items I can find for small, simple things (like grooming tools) that I use frequently.</li>
            <li> They would compare to a decent $10 clipper.</li>
            <li> The leather case is very soft and holds everything together very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this manufacturers clippers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the kit a lot, and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very sharp and make a very clean cut.</li>
            <li> Real soft leather and</li>
            <li> Very fine quality, but not sure if the price is favorable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance as a Christmas gift after looking all over the place for a nice, reasonably priced Solingen set that would include the three pieces he specified that he wanted (big clippers, small clippers, scissors).  </li>
            <li> Light weight and sharp.</li>
            <li> Smelling the new leather alone is a treat.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off going to CVS and getting all the components for $25 and getting a few professional manicures.</li>
            <li> Now with the price almost half of what I paid I would give this a 4 star review, but since I did pay a lot more I only raised it by one star ...</li>
            <li> The quality far surpasses my expectations.</li>
            <li> The clippers and scissors alone are so worth the money I spent for everything.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are nice, but not great.</li>
            <li> From the supple leather to the stupidly amazing clip action, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> These are also curved and rather gently which I like, these actually don&#x27;t have a nail file like the smaller version.</li>
            <li> The clippers included in this set are at least as sharp and easy to use as my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are scissors, not worth much.</li>
            <li> Though I was not familiar with Seki Edge, I decided to order this set based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> These nail clippers have straight cutting blades, so they are easy to re-sharpen.</li>
            <li> even when it&#x27;s still new, it isn&#x27;t as sharp as Seki Edge), now it&#x27;s in my drawer somewhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) You keep buying $25 kits that keep breaking and or flat out</li>
            <li> done-- just probably won&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> SHOULD LAST A VERY LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> a wood carver and pocket knife enthusiast, I have bought other edge tools from Japanese companies several times before.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars only because performance versus price is not what I had expected...</li>
            <li> The tweezers in particular are not nearly as nice as other luxury Japanese made clippers.</li>
            <li> The fingernail clippers have a flat cut blade, rather than curved, so it&#x27;s hard to cut to a natural curve.</li>
            <li> The clipper heads are a bit beefy, and need some finesse for fine clipping, the scissors are not precise for heavy cutting, toenail shears are working well.</li>
            <li> Truth be told, you would probably be just fine using less expensive grooming tools.</li>
            <li> Terrific, but be careful really sharp!  </li>
            <li> These finger/toe-nail clippers are sharp and they stay sharp for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I have hair cutting scissors by the same company which are really worth the money</li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> Search Green Bell Manicure set, and the prices range from $45 to $140 for the same set.</li>
            <li> Also has a thin nail file down the back, although this nail file can only be used while the clippers are closed, whereas the one for the smaller clippers is used when they&#x27;re open, odd but it works.&lt;br /&gt;-Nose</li>
            <li> The cutting edges meet precisely and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> went from two to three stars on this product due to the price decrease.</li>
            <li> case.&lt;br /&gt;The tools are of quality metal with a sharp edge.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are samurai sward sharp.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll find a time when I need to use the other tools.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I got from every other clipper I have used throughout my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking at other items from Seki.</li>
            <li> These tools are extremely sturdy.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> Heavy weight with very sharp, precise cutting edges.  </li>
            <li> You want something you can literally hand down to your grandchildren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I marked it down by 1 star as the scissors are dull and too thick to be of use.</li>
            <li> Well made and very sharp in a lether case.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Seriously puts The Art of Shaving kit to shame (not even in the same league).</li>
            <li> The clippers do not make that typical \\&quot;snap\\</li>
            <li> Everything is tight and very sharp.</li>
            <li> only complaint (hence the four stars) is the small clipper.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much trouble I was having with the run-of-the-mill clippers I had been using, until I tried these out.  </li>
            <li> not sure if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> No more jagged toe nails getting hung up in socks.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this just is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this a bit of a star off as I had a very small decorative defect in my kit-</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have yet to be disappointed with a Japanese edge tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cutting edge of the clippers is very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Whether you have tough nails or prefer the old-school method, these scissors feel surgical-grade.</li>
            <li> Whether or not I do find a time is largely irrelevant to me.  </li>
            <li> The file in any of these sets are basically useless - use a nail emery board instead, but in a pinch it will do.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is, however, very expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this because the German set was not available and the reviews were very good. I can honestly say that I would have been better off spending $50 on a really good mixed set of cutters and scissors. I love the case (hence two stars) but the tools are mediocre, in my opinion. My value on this set would be $30, and not a penny more. Sorry, but this just is not worth it. The clippers are nice, but not great. They do tend to cut the nail versus break it, but I still need to file my nails. So if they break or cut, and I need to file, then what&#x27;s the difference? They would compare to a decent $10 clipper. The file is not bad, but again, about $7. The scissors are scissors, not worth much. Tweezers are worth about $3. I would have been better off going to CVS and getting all the components for $25 and getting a few professional manicures. If you really like this set please let me know why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: November 8th 2015&lt;br /&gt;I went from two to three stars on this product due to the price decrease. I paid over $100 for this set a couple of years ago, and at that price point I did not think the value was that good. Now with the price almost half of what I paid I would give this a 4 star review, but since I did pay a lot more I only raised it by one star ... not sure if that makes sense. As far as the kit, good kit at this price point, like I stated.</li>
            <li> Very modern looking. Sharp blades cut very nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and craftsmanship.  Worth the price.  Timely delivery</li>
            <li> VERY HIGH QUALITY SET WITH LEATHER CASE.  SHOULD LAST A VERY LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers clip without effort. I highly recommend this manufacturers clippers. The rest of the kit isn&#x27;t much though.</li>
            <li> Super high quality blades. The leather case is very nice; supple leather and strong zipper.</li>
            <li> Sharpest nail/toe clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Cut like butter.</li>
            <li> The moment you unzip the heavy zipper on this lovely leather case, you realize that your money was worth it. Smelling the new leather alone is a treat. Every piece is excellent, beautiful, and works wonderfully. I wish I could give this a bit of a star off as I had a very small decorative defect in my kit- and if I&#x27;m paying this much I hope my kit is perfect- but that&#x27;s as nitpicky as I can possibly be about this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included (left-to-right):&lt;br /&gt;-Small nail clippers. Interestingly, these are completely straight whereas the larger ones are curved. There&#x27;s a nail file built into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;-Nail scissors. Whether you have tough nails or prefer the old-school method, these scissors feel surgical-grade. I like that the spring mechanism pulls out for storage, and a button fastener. Curved.&lt;br /&gt;-Large nail clippers. These are also curved and rather gently which I like, these actually don&#x27;t have a nail file like the smaller version. The back of these clippers has a large pad that helps you hold them, they&#x27;re gorgeous and very tactile. Also has a thin nail file down the back, although this nail file can only be used while the clippers are closed, whereas the one for the smaller clippers is used when they&#x27;re open, odd but it works.&lt;br /&gt;-Nose hair clippers. Finally, nose clippers that work. Thanks to the fine grade of steel they&#x27;re thinner so they reach everywhere easily, they work correctly, and they still have enough of a safety bubble on the end so you&#x27;re not stabbing yourself. I really like these. Not to mention- a lot of cheap nose clippers I&#x27;ve used leave a smell thanks to the metal, and these don&#x27;t have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;-Tweezers. These are beautifully crafted, with a good angle to make them easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;-Nail file. With two different patterns, one rougher and one smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love. This set is lovely enough that you&#x27;ll be thinking about where it&#x27;s going to go in your will when you pass it on. Top quality.</li>
            <li> Sharp, solid, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Best nail care tools I&#x27;ve ever used, very high quality worth every penny. No more jagged toe nails getting hung up in socks.</li>
            <li> Very good quality but I marked it down by 1 star as the scissors are dull and too thick to be of use.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product with great looks. A great gift for a man. It&#x27;s like a woman&#x27;s jewelry box, but for men. It&#x27;s pricey, but after having lost some many nail clippers, the price and the quality is what prevents me from leaving them lying around and keeping better care of this set.</li>
            <li> Terrific, but be careful really sharp!  The whole family loves it!</li>
            <li> Excellent grooming kit that will last for a life time.  Well made and very sharp in a lether case.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> excellent product ..... excellent service .... Thanks</li>
            <li> I have owned the vaunted German brand and they are impressive.  But nothing can compete with these clippers.  The quality is outstanding, case is great and the edge on everything is as sharp as can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a wood carver and pocket knife enthusiast, I have bought other edge tools from Japanese companies several times before.  I have been consistently impressed with their attention to the metal, construction and especially edge-honing of each of these. I have yet to be disappointed with a Japanese edge tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am equally impressed with these Seki clippers and nail tools.  Outstanding in every detail.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers received in the set were not as shown in the pics. Set is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. I do not believe the price was worth the $80+ premium cost. Nice leather case. Appears the price has drop $15+.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably like &amp;#34;why in the world would I spend $100 on this?&amp;#34;. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You keep buying $25 kits that keep breaking and or flat out suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The kit you buy rusted on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) You want something you can literally hand down to your grandchildren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is bar none unreal quality. A billionaire can&#x27;t buy better. Seriously. From the supple leather to the stupidly amazing clip action, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The kit arrived beautifully packaged. The individual pieces of the kit each have the heft of a quality tool. The cutting edges meet precisely and are very sharp. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it for personal grooming. It&#x27;s the H. O. Studley of nail kits.- E Ward</li>
            <li> very nice, quality package.  You do need to pull the clippers out acrocc the zipper, seems backwards but that is how it works.</li>
            <li> The set was nice but not up to its price. I have hair cutting scissors by the same company which are really worth the money but this set isn&#x27;t better than a drug store manicure set</li>
            <li> This grooming kit have some of the sharpest and best steel I ever encountered.</li>
            <li> This is a top class product.  Real soft leather and the tools are great graftmanship.  Stuff that will last all your life.  I love it.</li>
            <li> These finger/toe-nail clippers are sharp and they stay sharp for a long long time. I owned this Seki Edge for over two years now and they still cut nails like butter. These nail clippers have straight cutting blades, so they are easy to re-sharpen. I also have a Zwilling Ultra Slim nail clipper, it looks great and slim, but it doesn&#x27;t stay sharp for a long time (even when it&#x27;s still new, it isn&#x27;t as sharp as Seki Edge), now it&#x27;s in my drawer somewhere.</li>
            <li> Top quality, best set I have ever owned. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and wanted a nice kit for my nails to keep them in top condition. This was perfect. The clippers are very sharp and make a very clean cut. I would buy these as a gift</li>
            <li> Best I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> The kit covers my personal grooming needs in a quality leather case.&lt;br /&gt;The tools are of quality metal with a sharp edge.  I would recommend this kit.  I expect to have it the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Stupendous!  I didn&#x27;t realize how much trouble I was having with the run-of-the-mill clippers I had been using, until I tried these out.  The scissors are samurai sward sharp.  Well, to be honest, all the blades are samurai sword sharp!  Flawless and effortless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite frankly, I just use the clippers and scissors.  Maybe I&#x27;ll find a time when I need to use the other tools.  Whether or not I do find a time is largely irrelevant to me.  The clippers and scissors alone are so worth the money I spent for everything.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I got these for my fiance-- wonderful basic kit of all of the essentials, and I was BLOWN AWAY by the quality and sharpness! If you are looking for no-nonsense and quality, go with this. However, if you&#x27;re saving money I&#x27;d say one of the 20$ ones will get the job done-- just probably won&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> These are some of the sharpest nail maintenance tools I have used.  The nail scissor is exceptional. The large nail clipper is also very good.  The file in any of these sets are basically useless - use a nail emery board instead, but in a pinch it will do.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint (hence the four stars) is the small clipper.  It has a straight face.  This many not be a problem for you, but I prefer a curved clipper.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very nice set, and perfect for travel and at home.</li>
            <li> Just needed to be slightly larger but still great</li>
            <li> The most awesome grooming kit ever. Seriously puts The Art of Shaving kit to shame (not even in the same league). Words can&#x27;t express how amazing the set is. Worth every Penny. I treat this set like it&#x27;s priceless even though it will probably last longer than me. Japanese Steel! So very cool. Even my wife and mom are seriously in awww of it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> This is a quality kit and is the best clippers that I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, however, very expensive.</li>
            <li> Xmas gift for my husband and he loves them.  He was tired of buying cheap clippers at the drug store and then they would not hold up. He is very happy with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set but not worth the premium price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Amazing, old school Quality.</li>
            <li> Truth be told, you would probably be just fine using less expensive grooming tools. I certainly was for many years, figuring any one set was just as good as the next. Recently though, I&#x27;ve been on an &amp;#34;attainable luxury&amp;#34; kick, acquiring the best items I can find for small, simple things (like grooming tools) that I use frequently. With this set, as soon as you slide the clippers out of the case you notice a quality difference, that is confirmed many times over when you put them to use. They just feel like precision instruments in your hand, and cut/clip clean and crisp... simply better than any clippers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance as a Christmas gift after looking all over the place for a nice, reasonably priced Solingen set that would include the three pieces he specified that he wanted (big clippers, small clippers, scissors).  Though I was not familiar with Seki Edge, I decided to order this set based on the positive reviews.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.  The leather case is supple and high-quality, and the tools are very sturdy.  He&#x27;s been using it often and seems happy with it.  I&#x27;d recommend it for someone who wants a nice, complete set without having to spend the prices that you would with Soligen.</li>
            <li> This is a quality set of tools.  I don&#x27;t think you will be replacing these in your life time.</li>
            <li> Everything in this kit is surgically sharp with great precision.  To me, this is like buying great knives for the kitchen.  Get the best and it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This set is very well made.  Heavy weight with very sharp, precise cutting edges.  Clippers are very comfortable to hold. Case is sturdy. I anticipate that this set will last for decades. Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The clippers and nail file are designed and work well.  The cutting edge of the clippers is very sharp.  I like the kit a lot, and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The tools in this kit are of the highest quality and precision I have used.  The kit is a bit pricey but it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift, so I can&#x27;t rate it yet!</li>
            <li> One superb kit with strong and nice steelpices.</li>
            <li> This kit is incredible. The quality far surpasses my expectations. Everything is tight and very sharp. The clippers do not make that typical \\&quot;snap\\&quot; I got from every other clipper I have used throughout my life. This kit includes very useful items you may not use often, but are nice to have. The last grooming kit you&#x27;ll buy. I&#x27;m looking at other items from Seki.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very well made including pouch. Nice weight to the tools and great precision. Nice snapping action to the clippers.</li>
            <li> The leather case is very soft and holds everything together very well.&lt;br /&gt;Everything I&#x27;ve used so far has performed perfectly.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a present - it&#x27;s in a very nice leather case and the tools are high quality.  My husband, who is a tool addict, likes it very much and hides it away after each use because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;so nice.&amp;#34;  He&#x27;s happy, and I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> First time that I decided to buy a high end grooming kit, and it was definitely worth it, the tools in this kit for nail clipping are fantastic in handling and operation. Light weight and sharp. The case is real leather and everything fits in nicely and compacted, you don&#x27;t not have any issues when you open and remove each tool as it is well laid out.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost!! These are a great investment if you&#x27;re looking for something that will last.  I have bought several different kits at varying price ranges and I wish I would have just invested in these to start with.  My husband loves it and they felt so nice that I decided to buy a kit for myself.</li>
            <li> Very Impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> I love this set. I purchased this after trying another brand that cost over twice the price (you don&#x27;t always get what you pay for). The clippers are excellent and cleanly cut the nails with very little pressure. All of the other items in the kit are of the same quality as is the very nice case with a full zipper.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made kit, excellent shipping and packaging. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this kit!  I wish I could afford to buy another one for the office.  These tools are extremely sturdy.  Both nail clippers and the cuticle clippers are the best quality I&#x27;ve ever picked up..  They fit in the bag perfectly as well and the bag looks great.  I haven&#x27;t used the scissors but everything has been perfect.  Be careful.  They are extremely sharp.  I was looking for a kit that was &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and although this kit would be fine for a woman the tools are definitely the manliest ones I&#x27;ve seen without buying something hokey.  These are the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have been a Solingen folding clipper user for the last 20 years.  I lost my clipper and decided to replace my unit with this set.  The clippers included in this set are at least as sharp and easy to use as my old clippers.  They are nice in the hand and operate in a smoothly like a well made machine.&lt;br /&gt;The other items in this kit are not quite the same quality.  The tweezers in particular are not nearly as nice as other luxury Japanese made clippers.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loved them.  She said she thought it was a stupid gift to give my mom, for Christmas, but once she tried my mom&#x27;s she was raving about them.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very fine quality, but not sure if the price is favorable. Search Green Bell Manicure set, and the prices range from $45 to $140 for the same set. I&#x27;ll keep it. The fingernail clippers have a flat cut blade, rather than curved, so it&#x27;s hard to cut to a natural curve. BUT the clever files attached to each clipper allow me to file the sharp corners and edges to perfect rounded edges! The tools are cleverly crafted and very sturdy. Diamond cut file surfaces and perfect hinged fittings are wonderful. The packaging and instructions are in Japanese, but not necessary for my needs. The clipper heads are a bit beefy, and need some finesse for fine clipping, the scissors are not precise for heavy cutting, toenail shears are working well. I give it 4 stars only because performance versus price is not what I had expected...</li>
