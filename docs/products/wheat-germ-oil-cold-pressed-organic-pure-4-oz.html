            <li> I mix this with coconut oil, you only need a small amount of both even if you have thick hair like me.</li>

            <li> Nice, pure oil that soaks into my face rapidly. I added a few drops of essential oil to boost it and am pleased with it. I quit using expensive face cream preparations and use this instead - I cannot tell a difference...</li>
            <li> i used this on my natural hair, I FELL IN LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!! IT MOISTURIZED AND SOFTENED MY 4C HAIR ALL IN ONE!! WORKS GREAT AS A PREPOO AND DEEP CONDITIONER!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after doing research on different oils. I am natural and oils/conditioners are my hair&#x27;s best friends. I can honestly say I am not disappointed with this product. I mix this with coconut oil, you only need a small amount of both even if you have thick hair like me. The only thing I would like is if they sold it in a bigger quantity. Other than that it is a great product with a great seller. It arrives nicely packaged and literally 3 days after I purchased it. I will definitely be purchasing from this buyer again!</li>
            <li> I have only recently received this product but so far everything is as advertised.  I plan on updating my review once I&#x27;ve used for a couple of months.  Good company and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> nice oil, i will order from them again.</li>
            <li> I feel a little uneasy that this product isn&#x27;t sealed and has no label other then the one on the front.  For all I know it could be a mix of the cheapest oils.  For all I know it can be and is exactly what it says and I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just more scared of items than most, but I thought you should know what to expect before ordering.  It kind of has a vegetable oil smell to it.  I was planning on using it as an SPF on my skin, but I have kind of sensitive skin so I&#x27;ll probably try it on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use in mixing massage oils.  Got the product super quick and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet but it is as described. Shipping was within the specified time. The bottle is larger than I expected. I will modify my review when I use the product. Packaging was appropriate to product size.</li>
            <li> This is my first buying from this vendor/brand and I must say the product is truly everything it entails. Great product with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i liked it very much. it made my skin nice and smooth. I used on my hair as well. It was great.</li>
            <li> Needed wheat germ oil to mix with other oils for fingernail improvement.  Appears to be doing the job.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest.  The bottle size could be half the size.</li>
            <li> This bottle is going to last me FOREVER. It doesn&#x27;t do a good job of moisturizing my hair on its own so I found out. But it&#x27;s not supposed to, it contains protein its meant to strengthen, not moisturize. Mixed with other oils it gives my hair a good strength and moisture balance. Plus, it&#x27;s supposed to promote hair growth, I&#x27;m still waiting on the verdict for that.</li>
            <li> Love it, mix it with my deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Blends well with my other oils.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality, nice-smelling oil.</li>
            <li> I use for hair. Very thick</li>
            <li> I was happy with this purchase, my expectations were met and I would buy again from this seller. I bought one for myself and one for my daughter so we could treat dry winter skin and this product does this well. Thanks:0)</li>
