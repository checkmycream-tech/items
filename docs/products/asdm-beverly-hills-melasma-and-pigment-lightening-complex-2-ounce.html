            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that lighter/newer spots have started to fade to the point where my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin color is more prevalent.</li>
            <li>I will update review after I&#x27;ve given it more time.</li>
            <li>On days I know I will be out in the sun for most of the day, I don&#x27;t apply in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is quite a bit in the bottle and one pump is more than sufficient for both of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>What I have noticed is my skin is looking brighter and more even.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to see some results</li>

            <li>I am excited to see where things will be in 7-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad and does not impede with make up application.</li>
            <li>But so far now I can see it works, as many things</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other lightening serums that cost more (Obagi, Murad, etc.).</li>

            <li>This is very gentle and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>For the spots that are fading, I do notice my skin peeling slightly along the edges of the spot (kind of like it&#x27;s sloughing the old skin).</li>
            <li>so I am always really cautious with new products, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>I feel thus far, the results have been gradual yet positive.  </li>
            <li>The product has no smell that I can tell, and it is not thick or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>, I recommend this product to anybody, but to be aware that results might be different depending of skin type and cause of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>this product has significantly &amp; very noticeably help fade huge patches of freckles that had developed on my face due to constant sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no issue with irritation.</li>
            <li>I also like that so far, I&#x27;ve had no adverse reaction to the serum.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>For the few dark brown spots on my face, this worked better than the prescription my Dermatologist (hydro quinine) gave to me.  </li>
            <li>even though i was skeptical about this product, i took a risk &amp; purchased &amp; honestly am so thrilled i did.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the cream !!!</li>
            <li> Wow!  For the few dark brown spots on my face, this worked better than the prescription my Dermatologist (hydro quinine) gave to me.  This is very gentle and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I have even used it on my eyelids and the back of my hands.  Within the first week, the brown spots became very light brown.  I am impressed!  The product has no smell that I can tell, and it is not thick or sticky.  Great all around. My skin is light/fair, just FYI!</li>
            <li> even though i was skeptical about this product, i took a risk &amp; purchased &amp; honestly am so thrilled i did. this product has significantly &amp; very noticeably help fade huge patches of freckles that had developed on my face due to constant sun exposure. everyone&#x27;s skin &amp; situation is unique so obviously there&#x27;s no guarantee for it working for everyone but after trying many at home methods to rid myself of these dark patches, this product really has done the work i was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Amazing results in one month. See before and after pictures... Amazing!</li>
            <li> To me it was a waste of money.  Didn&#x27;t help also gave me red spots on my arms.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very effective and economical product for those with skin issues. A definite recommendation for all looking for skin care product.</li>
            <li> Packed very professionally and time frame on arrival was good. I have not noticed any difference though. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks. Has no smell and is a thin and light formular. Will keep using and update.</li>
            <li> This product is very good when use with a peeling or exfoliator. Patient is very needed when you have hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Yes it did. However, it seemed to slow down a bit after awhile.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I received it last month.  I feel thus far, the results have been gradual yet positive.  I will not have a final analysis of this product until I give it more time on my skin.  Of course, I am hoping for the best result.  Give me another 3 to 4 months, then I will have a final determination about the efficacy of this product!!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Not working yet!  Stay tuned!</li>
            <li> Helps, but slowly. Its taking time but I can wait....</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the product. I have sensitive skin and have had no issue with irritation. I have melasma around the apples of my cheeks. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed that lighter/newer spots have started to fade to the point where my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin color is more prevalent. I use less concealer than I would have before. Older/darker spots have faded, but are still noticeable. I will update review after I&#x27;ve given it more time. For the spots that are fading, I do notice my skin peeling slightly along the edges of the spot (kind of like it&#x27;s sloughing the old skin). It&#x27;s not bad and does not impede with make up application. You would only notice it if you were staring up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I struggled with the order in which to apply the products. I also use Mary Kay regimen for moisturizing. So, I settled with the following. At night, I use the MK serum first, then this lightening serum, and then the moisturizer. Allowing each product to dry/absorb about 30 sec in between. In the morning, I use this product and then my moisturizer/SPF. On days I know I will be out in the sun for most of the day, I don&#x27;t apply in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other lightening serums that cost more (Obagi, Murad, etc.). Clearly, the active lightening ingredient is the hydroquinone. What I like about this product is the price and the amount of product you get. There is quite a bit in the bottle and one pump is more than sufficient for both of my cheeks. I also like that so far, I&#x27;ve had no adverse reaction to the serum.</li>
            <li> I have bee using this serum for a week and I have seen excellent results in just 2 week. My melasma has been very bad for many years i do not expect that this problem will resolve in a week of 2 of use, but months and my skin will not clear compleatly. . But so far now I can see it works, as many things no everything works the same for everybody. But I am saving hundreds of dollars with this treatment, I recommend this product to anybody, but to be aware that results might be different depending of skin type and cause of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Suffered from dark spots on my cheeks... I was very excited to see some results and I did..... This stuff really work!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had heavy dark spot on my face and  after used the half of bottle, I can see that my dark spot faded gradually.. Thanks ADSM Beverly Hills.</li>
            <li> Does work! I had a dark pigment on my upper lip, probably from waxing and sun exposure. I thought I&#x27;d never get rid of it, but after using this only a couple weeks it&#x27;s gone! :)  Now i&#x27;m trying it to help fade post acne marks and it&#x27;s working for that too. would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Made my spots darker. I knew this was a risk, but took the chance. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different. Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> Made my dark spots darker</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have been using this for 2 weeks. I apply a thin layer all over my face at night to target redness and minor sun damage. I have sensitive skin so I am always really cautious with new products, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems. What I have noticed is my skin is looking brighter and more even. I am excited to see where things will be in 7-8 weeks.  The ingredients list is simple and the cream is unscented.</li>
