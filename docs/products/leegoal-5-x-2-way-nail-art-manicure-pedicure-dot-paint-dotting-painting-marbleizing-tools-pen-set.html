            <li>These are exactly the same type of dotting tools you&#x27;d get at a beauty supply store for far less than you&#x27;d pay at a register.  </li>

            <li> The size of the dots on one end of each tool is the same. So, really, you only get 5 different sizes in all. This is not what I was expecting, but for the price it&#x27;s not too bad. There are still more sizes than I usually use when I do my nails! It took about 2 weeks for them to ship to me from China. Compared to what I&#x27;ve found at stores like Sally Beauty these are a GREAT deal! I would recommend them to friends :)</li>
