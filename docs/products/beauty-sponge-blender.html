            <li>/&gt;Blendazzle shipped super fast and offered excellent order follow</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference!</li>
            <li>and I have never had such a perfect application of my foundation before.</li>
            <li>When you think you are done you wring out one more time.</li>
            <li>You can do as many layers as you want with this sponge.</li>
            <li>I am glad this is reusable and washable.</li>
            <li>When I use this I can put my makeup on a lot faster and it looks a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I love this blending sponge for even application of foundation.  </li>
            <li>I love my foundation again.  </li>
            <li>I have 3 kids, need I say more.</li>
            <li>I realized that I  didn&#x27;t need to watch so many videos to figure it out , but it didn&#x27;t hurt to have some insight.</li>
            <li>I was able to get even coverage</li>
            <li>Received one of these sponges and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>and I love the outcome.</li>
            <li>My foundation looked flawless and the sponge cleaned up easily enough.</li>
            <li>I love how it evenly distributes the foundation &amp; because of it&#x27;s ergonomic feature</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this product at a discount price for an honest review.  </li>
            <li>The foundation glides on very smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it because the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and does not soak up the foundation like most sponges do</li>
            <li>I was a bit iffy due to the price but the product seriously impressed me.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other sponges and this one is the best one I have used.</li>
            <li>I watched many You Tube video tutorials and was familiar the application of foundation using this type of sponge.</li>
            <li>Using the sponge was easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>which is perfect for getting in those little creases that are missed by my brush.</li>
            <li>This must be how the professionals get such great results.</li>
            <li>I did get them either free or lower price.</li>
            <li>I use it: Gently dampen your Blendazzle-Sponge in warm water, allowing it to fully expand.</li>
            <li>but I have to smooth it with a sponge.</li>
            <li>It helps spread my makeup evenly and makes my face feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great product overall</li>
            <li>To clarify, I don&#x27;t use my fingers because I end up getting more on my fingers than in my face and it just doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh.  </li>
            <li>I had free shipping</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great sponge</li>
            <li>For a flawless application, use the Blendazzle-Sponge in a rolling motion to gently bounce or stipple your foundation or concealer over larger areas of your face including cheeks, forehead, and chin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to clean and the texture of blendazzle is so smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t like it so much that I think it&#x27;s really worth 14 dollars, when I can use my own fingers for free.</li>
            <li>So I have been looking for a great dupe for the original Beauty Blender for a while now, and I have recived quite a few knock offs that are just okay</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it is very easy to clean, so, it&#x27;s saved me from buying more sponges constantly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...and it is super easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Color is bright pink so its easy to find in the drawer or makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply my foundation ( a combination of liquid and compact mixed together) easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I did it quite quickly too.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to use baby shampoo to clean, but I just used hand soap because it was convenient and the eyeshadow came right out.  </li>
            <li>The sponge helped smooth out the pigment and give an even coat over my whole face with no streaks or missed areas!</li>
            <li>This Blendazzle Makeup Blending Sponge is my new favorite go to item in my cosmetic case!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist I have tried a lot of applicators and this is by far my absolute favorite!....</li>
            <li>The best sponge that has worked with my makeup and skin type so far, hands down!</li>
            <li>The review is my personal experience with the blending sponge and my own thoughts and opinions on the product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look fresh and dewey like it used to.  </li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my absolute favorite beauty blender dupe and I high recommend it!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s economical.  </li>
            <li>While the bigger, rounded side made dabbing on the foundation quick and easy!</li>
            <li>In fact liked it so much I ordered an additional sponge for a back up.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product due to the time saving qualities.  </li>
            <li>little sponge will probably shave off a good chunk of that time.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>Clean up was so simple, just wash with a light soap</li>
            <li>Now if this is your first time using a sponge then re-wet it and repeat process.</li>
            <li>So you apply your concealer or foundation in a dot method all over the face first.</li>
            <li>I went the sponge with my first use ( I soaked the sponge from soaking up your foundation.)</li>
            <li>and the coverage is so much better than when I use my fingers or one of those drugstore white sponges (which just seem to soak up all the foundation).  </li>
            <li>Very girly and fun.</li>
            <li>I would clean this with a soft cleanser once every couple of days.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t ever use liquid foundation without this little guy again, plus it looks so cute on my bathroom vanity!</li>
            <li>The only thing I might tweak a bit is to make the pointy part (top) of the sponge a little bit narrower , because I still had to go into the wee tiny creases around my nose to perfect the coverage but that would not deter me personally from repurchasing this sponge.</li>
            <li>I love the hot pink color too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks flawless with less touch ups throughout the day and definitely looks more natural since I use less product with that sponge...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bigger in size than the beauty blender at sephora, but I have found that this is actually better for gripping.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t want bacteria to build up in the sponge.</li>
            <li>soaked up too much of my liquid foundation and never seemed to apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li>and it does a much nicer job of applying my foundation evenly and without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this makeup sponge!</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge.</li>
            <li>It was much quicker with the sponge.  </li>
            <li>I love the pink color.</li>
            <li>It really stands out.</li>
            <li>I found this to be such a handy tool and will be using this sponge instead of my regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I have switched to powder makeup, because my skin as been fairly oily lately and the powder seems to help, and this sponge just blends it all in</li>
            <li>it went on very easily (liquid foundation) and blended in smoothly, i did not even have to use that much makeup, just a thin layer.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and durable so should last a long time.</li>
            <li>especially like that it washes clean</li>
            <li>It is so soft and feels so good against my skin but doesn&#x27;t disintegrate under pressure like some make up sponges I have used it the past.</li>
            <li>and I can be confidant that I am only applying fresh foundation each time I use it and not any residual product from the precious usage like was left on my old sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was scared it would be no better than the disposable kind you get at the drugstore, but it is nicer.</li>
            <li>so I can get coverage on more area in less time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for both makeup pros and makeup enthusiasts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone that likes to blend their makeup evenly on their face.  </li>
            <li>You use a little more foundation when you use a sponge</li>
            <li>The sponge didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;drink up&amp;#34; the foundation either which is great because that cuts down on waste</li>
            <li>I was actually getting ready to go to Ulta and spend another $30-40 on a new foundation when a friend told me about the new blending sponge she bought on Amazon and said I should try this first.  </li>
            <li>finally hit the jackpot with this beauty blender, it has small pores and the foundation glides across my face instead of being absorbed into the sponge and me losing my precious foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product not only kept the make up off my hands and clothes but it gave me such a smooth, polished look.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using such an applicator.</li>
            <li>I use less makeup and the end result is a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I wet it a little bit and it helps spread out the foundation nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft on my face, has a squeeze to it but also keeps shape</li>
            <li>I am sure if you are around the makeup world you have at least heard of this product or what it does.</li>
            <li>Next, gently squeeze to remove excess the liquid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s soft and squishy</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot believe how soft this sponge is also.</li>
            <li>You can dampen the sponge first if you like and it will conserve foundation or use it dry.  </li>
            <li>I was getting very tired of my liquid foundation that I was using because it just wasn&#x27;t looking good on me anymore.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and dampened it first, which made it double in size, making it larger for quicker coverage.  </li>
            <li>I honestly think I ended up using less foundation than I usually do with a brush.</li>
            <li>I guess its worth the price because it works fairly well, but I wished it was a little less expensive.</li>

            <li> The sponge helped smooth out the pigment and give an even coat over my whole face with no streaks or missed areas!</li>
            <li> This Blendazzle Makeup Blending Sponge is my new favorite go to item in my cosmetic case!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I have tried a lot of applicators and this is by far my absolute favorite!....</li>
            <li> The best sponge that has worked with my makeup and skin type so far, hands down!</li>
            <li> The review is my personal experience with the blending sponge and my own thoughts and opinions on the product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look fresh and dewey like it used to.  </li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my absolute favorite beauty blender dupe and I high recommend it!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s economical.  </li>
            <li> While the bigger, rounded side made dabbing on the foundation quick and easy!</li>
            <li> In fact liked it so much I ordered an additional sponge for a back up.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product due to the time saving qualities.  </li>
            <li> little sponge will probably shave off a good chunk of that time.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> Clean up was so simple, just wash with a light soap</li>
            <li> Now if this is your first time using a sponge then re-wet it and repeat process.</li>
            <li> So you apply your concealer or foundation in a dot method all over the face first.</li>
            <li> I went the sponge with my first use ( I soaked the sponge from soaking up your foundation.)</li>
            <li> and the coverage is so much better than when I use my fingers or one of those drugstore white sponges (which just seem to soak up all the foundation).  </li>
            <li> Very girly and fun.</li>
            <li> I would clean this with a soft cleanser once every couple of days.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever use liquid foundation without this little guy again, plus it looks so cute on my bathroom vanity!</li>
            <li> The only thing I might tweak a bit is to make the pointy part (top) of the sponge a little bit narrower , because I still had to go into the wee tiny creases around my nose to perfect the coverage but that would not deter me personally from repurchasing this sponge.</li>
            <li> I love the hot pink color too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> My makeup looks flawless with less touch ups throughout the day and definitely looks more natural since I use less product with that sponge...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger in size than the beauty blender at sephora, but I have found that this is actually better for gripping.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t want bacteria to build up in the sponge.</li>
            <li> soaked up too much of my liquid foundation and never seemed to apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li> and it does a much nicer job of applying my foundation evenly and without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this makeup sponge!</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge.</li>
            <li> It was much quicker with the sponge.  </li>
            <li> I love the pink color.</li>
            <li> It really stands out.</li>
            <li> I found this to be such a handy tool and will be using this sponge instead of my regular foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I have switched to powder makeup, because my skin as been fairly oily lately and the powder seems to help, and this sponge just blends it all in</li>
            <li> it went on very easily (liquid foundation) and blended in smoothly, i did not even have to use that much makeup, just a thin layer.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and durable so should last a long time.</li>
            <li> especially like that it washes clean</li>
            <li> It is so soft and feels so good against my skin but doesn&#x27;t disintegrate under pressure like some make up sponges I have used it the past.</li>
            <li> and I can be confidant that I am only applying fresh foundation each time I use it and not any residual product from the precious usage like was left on my old sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was scared it would be no better than the disposable kind you get at the drugstore, but it is nicer.</li>
            <li> so I can get coverage on more area in less time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for both makeup pros and makeup enthusiasts.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone that likes to blend their makeup evenly on their face.  </li>
            <li> You use a little more foundation when you use a sponge</li>
            <li> The sponge didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;drink up&amp;#34; the foundation either which is great because that cuts down on waste</li>
            <li> I was actually getting ready to go to Ulta and spend another $30-40 on a new foundation when a friend told me about the new blending sponge she bought on Amazon and said I should try this first.  </li>
            <li> finally hit the jackpot with this beauty blender, it has small pores and the foundation glides across my face instead of being absorbed into the sponge and me losing my precious foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product not only kept the make up off my hands and clothes but it gave me such a smooth, polished look.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using such an applicator.</li>
            <li> I use less makeup and the end result is a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I wet it a little bit and it helps spread out the foundation nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is so soft on my face, has a squeeze to it but also keeps shape</li>
            <li> I am sure if you are around the makeup world you have at least heard of this product or what it does.</li>
            <li> Next, gently squeeze to remove excess the liquid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and squishy</li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot believe how soft this sponge is also.</li>
            <li> You can dampen the sponge first if you like and it will conserve foundation or use it dry.  </li>
            <li> I was getting very tired of my liquid foundation that I was using because it just wasn&#x27;t looking good on me anymore.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and dampened it first, which made it double in size, making it larger for quicker coverage.  </li>
            <li> I honestly think I ended up using less foundation than I usually do with a brush.</li>
            <li> I guess its worth the price because it works fairly well, but I wished it was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> , they usually are very porous and absorb a lot of my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quality material and seems like it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you use it wet, it doesn&#x27;t soak up all of your foundation which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> The feel is different from other product but had no problems applying the product then using the sponge to blend everything in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little soft pink beauty</li>
            <li> Then I let it air dry..</li>
            <li> The cost was half of what I&#x27;d pay for the same type of sponge at Ulta or Sephora and with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> Now remember you will sheer the product just a little by using this method.</li>
            <li> I use it wet to apply my concealer and liquid foundations</li>
            <li> So what you do is you wet it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Start in the center of your face and blend outward.</li>
            <li> Use the narrow end of the Blendazzle -Sponge to reach smaller areas including the sides of your nose and under your eyes.</li>
            <li> This product removed my dead skin that my daily face washing was not removing.  </li>
            <li> , i was worried that the wet texture would smear my makeup or make it look streaky.</li>
            <li> SO with Blendazzle&#x27;s sponge, a little foundation goes a long way with this sponge!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easier to hold onto with my arthritic fingers</li>
            <li> have been using another companies flat oblong makeup sponge, but was never entirely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It is very comparable to the infamous</li>
            <li> I wet it and dried it out</li>
            <li> The Blendazzle -Sponge should feel slightly damp.</li>
            <li> Unless you press firmly and not lightly into the skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tear of have little pieces missing like some of my sponges have done in the past.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad either ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use make up sponges because I feel like they waste my product.  </li>
            <li> Just spend the 20 or so and get the real thing, all the cheap wannabes are horrible, hard, and completely useless.</li>
            <li> I also used it to blend my eyeshadow which I usually spend a lot of time blending with a brush.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick sponge unlike the cheaper versions.</li>
            <li> it was a cheaper alternative to the expensive beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I use it for every application and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know if germs when you are sick can stay in the sponge even though you are cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I hate when I get makeup and foundation all over my hands.</li>

            <li> I hate when I get makeup and foundation all over my hands. This product not only kept the make up off my hands and clothes but it gave me such a smooth, polished look. This must be how the professionals get such great results. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I use this sponge to apply foundation, highlights and blush. This tool has replaced all my brushes!  I highly recommend this product...and it is super easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sponge!!! I use it wet to apply my concealer and liquid foundations and I can see a huge difference! My makeup looks flawless with less touch ups throughout the day and definitely looks more natural since I use less product with that sponge... It&#x27;s also super easy to clean. I would recommend this product to anyone!!! Perfect for beginners in applying makeup and professionals...</li>
            <li> The Blendazzle is my favorite addition to my makeup bag! Gone are the days of lines and streaks. I use less makeup and the end result is a smooth finish. I am one very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I have tried a lot of applicators and this is by far my absolute favorite!.... It&#x27;s a little bigger in size than the beauty blender at sephora, but I have found that this is actually better for gripping. It blends any foundation or concealer PERFECTLY! It&#x27;s super easy to clean and the texture of blendazzle is so smooth. I highly recommend this product for both makeup pros and makeup enthusiasts. The price isn&#x27;t bad either ;)</li>
            <li> Amazing blending sponge to apply liquid foundation! I followed the directions that came with the sponge and I have never had such a perfect application of my foundation before. The sponge helped smooth out the pigment and give an even coat over my whole face with no streaks or missed areas! It is so soft on my face, has a squeeze to it but also keeps shape well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pointed tip on the one side made it easy for applying makeup around my nose, eyes and mouth! While the bigger, rounded side made dabbing on the foundation quick and easy! The rounded side is larger so I can get coverage on more area in less time. Clean up was so simple, just wash with a light soap *I use baby shampoo* and rinse. Then I let it air dry..I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had used it after it was cleaned up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blending sponge is also good for putting on highlighter and blending out my bronzing powder. I found this to be such a handy tool and will be using this sponge instead of my regular foundation brush. I received this product at a discount for purpose of testing, an honest and unbiased review. The review is my personal experience with the blending sponge and my own thoughts and opinions on the product.</li>
            <li> My wife used this today when she received it and loves it.  Quality material and seems like it will last a long time.  If I need another one I know where I will be buying it.</li>
            <li> I am sure if you are around the makeup world you have at least heard of this product or what it does. For those of you who haven&#x27;t let me tell you. It is a shrunk sponge when you get it. It comes in a plastic container to protect it from germs. So what you do is you wet it thoroughly. Then you wring and wring and wring out all the water. When you think you are done you wring out one more time. Now if this is your first time using a sponge then re-wet it and repeat process. I found by doing this my sponge worked wonderfully. Now you have damp beauty sponge. So you apply your concealer or foundation in a dot method all over the face first. Then take your beauty sponge and in a dabbing motion work the product in the skin. You can do as many layers as you want with this sponge. Now remember you will sheer the product just a little by using this method. Unless you press firmly and not lightly into the skin. What you do next is. I would clean this with a soft cleanser once every couple of days. You really don&#x27;t want bacteria to build up in the sponge. Another thing you might not think of is replacing your sponge after 3-4 months. I would think of this like a mascara. You replace those every 3-4 months. You don&#x27;t know if germs when you are sick can stay in the sponge even though you are cleaning it. I like to change out sponges and mascaras every quarter. I am pleasantly happy with this. The feel is different from other product but had no problems applying the product then using the sponge to blend everything in. I am glad this is reusable and washable. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! I did get them either free or lower price.</li>
            <li> Sponges make your makeup go on smoother and easier.  This sponge is shaped where it will go into the creases around your nose, eyes, etc. Your skin will look flawless.  You use a little more foundation when you use a sponge but it is worth it because the results are amazing.  You can dampen the sponge first if you like and it will conserve foundation or use it dry.  When I use this I can put my makeup on a lot faster and it looks a lot better.  When I use my fingers I am going over the same areas multiple times to blend it in, where with this you go over it once and you are done.  It is easy to clean and durable so should last a long time. This tool should be in everyone&#x27;s makeup bag!  I received a discounted product in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was a cheaper alternative to the expensive beauty blender. Just spend the 20 or so and get the real thing, all the cheap wannabes are horrible, hard, and completely useless.</li>
            <li> This Blendazzle Makeup Blending Sponge is my new favorite go to item in my cosmetic case!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using another companies flat oblong makeup sponge, but was never entirely pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;It soaked up too much of my liquid foundation and never seemed to apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;NOT SO with Blendazzle&#x27;s sponge, a little foundation goes a long way with this sponge!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easier to hold onto with my arthritic fingers and it does a much nicer job of applying my foundation evenly and without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that it washes clean and I can be confidant that I am only applying fresh foundation each time I use it and not any residual product from the precious usage like was left on my old sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Blendazzle shipped super fast and offered excellent order follow up.&lt;br /&gt;Giving this Makeup Blending Sponge by Blendazzle my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> One of the best blending sponges I have used. I am very impressed with this sponge. I was a bit iffy due to the price but the product seriously impressed me. It is a thick sponge unlike the cheaper versions. I went the sponge with my first use ( I soaked the sponge from soaking up your foundation.) I figured it would leave a puddle of water with my foundation when applying but that just wasn&#x27;t the case. Needless to say I use it for every application and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I like this makeup sponge. I was scared it would be no better than the disposable kind you get at the drugstore, but it is nicer. If you use it wet, it doesn&#x27;t soak up all of your foundation which is a definite plus. It provides even coverage and the pointy end is great for under the eyes and on the sides of the nose. However, I don&#x27;t like it so much that I think it&#x27;s really worth 14 dollars, when I can use my own fingers for free. I don&#x27;t regret taking the chance in buying it though. It&#x27;s a bit cheaper than the Beauty Blender and from what I have read about the BB, this is of similar quality.</li>
            <li> The Blendazzle sponge is the perfect tool for stippling and an airbrushed-looking application. With its versatile egg shape, you can reach every area of your face effortlessly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: Gently dampen your Blendazzle-Sponge in warm water, allowing it to fully expand. Next, gently squeeze to remove excess the liquid. The Blendazzle -Sponge should feel slightly damp. For a flawless application, use the Blendazzle-Sponge in a rolling motion to gently bounce or stipple your foundation or concealer over larger areas of your face including cheeks, forehead, and chin. Start in the center of your face and blend outward. Use the narrow end of the Blendazzle -Sponge to reach smaller areas including the sides of your nose and under your eyes. Can also be used dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need a flawless look? I highly recommend this makeup sponge! I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review. Opinions stated are 100% mine!</li>
            <li> I guess its worth the price because it works fairly well, but I wished it was a little less expensive. Otherwise it would be a 5* for me!</li>
            <li> I love this blending sponge for even application of foundation.  I wet it a little bit and it helps spread out the foundation nicely.  No steaks.  Helps with corners around nose and mouth, under eyes. Doesn&#x27;t soak in the product.  Very nice Makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> I like to apply my foundation with a brush but I have to smooth it with a sponge. I was really excited to receive this product at a discount price for an honest review.  I have purchased other sponges and this one is the best one I have used. It is very comparable to the infamous Beauty Blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s soft and squishy which is perfect for getting in those little creases that are missed by my brush. It doesn&#x27;t tear of have little pieces missing like some of my sponges have done in the past. I really like this sponge. It&#x27;s almost identical to the Beauty Blender at a smaller price. If you are in the market for a great beauty sponge, this one is your best bet.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It helps spread my makeup evenly and makes my face feel smooth.  I have actually noticed a difference in the way my skin feels.  This product removed my dead skin that my daily face washing was not removing.  I will buy again, when this one wears out!</li>
            <li> I received this Blendazzle sponge a week ago and just now had a chance to use it this morning when applying my foundation. This sponge is very soft, feels wonderful on the skin! The foundation glides on very smoothly and easily. The tip of the sponge is great to use for the under eyes and corners of the eyes. Very easy to use. The best feature is how the Blendazzle&#x27;s application gives a flawless look to the skin! Great product overall and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> I had been using a brush to apply my foundation but, at times, it would leave brush marks that I would have to pat out.  This wonderful sponge....no brush marks!  To clarify, I don&#x27;t use my fingers because I end up getting more on my fingers than in my face and it just doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh.  This is great!!</li>
            <li> I love this blending sponge!  It makes my makeup go on flawlessly and the coverage is so much better than when I use my fingers or one of those drugstore white sponges (which just seem to soak up all the foundation).  I was getting very tired of my liquid foundation that I was using because it just wasn&#x27;t looking good on me anymore.  It didn&#x27;t look fresh and dewey like it used to.  I was actually getting ready to go to Ulta and spend another $30-40 on a new foundation when a friend told me about the new blending sponge she bought on Amazon and said I should try this first.  The cost was half of what I&#x27;d pay for the same type of sponge at Ulta or Sephora and with Amazon Prime I had free shipping so I tried it.  So glad I did!  I love my foundation again.  Won&#x27;t ever use liquid foundation without this little guy again, plus it looks so cute on my bathroom vanity!</li>
            <li> My Wife spends probably a 10th of her lifetime doing makeup and hair.&lt;br /&gt;This little sponge will probably shave off a good chunk of that time.&lt;br /&gt;She Loves It!</li>
            <li> The best sponge that has worked with my makeup and skin type so far, hands down! I am really in love with this thing! I have switched to powder makeup, because my skin as been fairly oily lately and the powder seems to help, and this sponge just blends it all in once I get done applying it all with the brushes. I love having a natural look and this is the best thing to help with that.. I will definitely be ordering more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use make up sponges because I feel like they waste my product.  This sponge did not.  I followed the instructions and dampened it first, which made it double in size, making it larger for quicker coverage.  I also used it to blend my eyeshadow which I usually spend a lot of time blending with a brush.  It was much quicker with the sponge.  The instructions say to use baby shampoo to clean, but I just used hand soap because it was convenient and the eyeshadow came right out.  I squeezed it in my towel to get excess water out.  Very pleased with this product due to the time saving qualities.  I have 3 kids, need I say more.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using such an applicator. I watched many You Tube video tutorials and was familiar the application of foundation using this type of sponge. Using the sponge was easy I realized that I  didn&#x27;t need to watch so many videos to figure it out , but it didn&#x27;t hurt to have some insight. I was able to apply my foundation ( a combination of liquid and compact mixed together) easily and smoothly. I honestly think I ended up using less foundation than I usually do with a brush. I was able to get even coverage and I did it quite quickly too. The sponge didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;drink up&amp;#34; the foundation either which is great because that cuts down on waste The only thing I might tweak a bit is to make the pointy part (top) of the sponge a little bit narrower , because I still had to go into the wee tiny creases around my nose to perfect the coverage but that would not deter me personally from repurchasing this sponge. Overall it&#x27;s a great sponge and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Received one of these sponges and fell in love with it. In fact liked it so much I ordered an additional sponge for a back up. It is so soft and feels so good against my skin but doesn&#x27;t disintegrate under pressure like some make up sponges I have used it the past. I love the hot pink color too. Very girly and fun. This definitely will be found in my make-up bag.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful blending makeup sponge. It&#x27;s super soft. It glides so effortlessly over my face and blends everything so evenly. It goes into all the groves and corners of my nose perfectly and smoothly. It applies my makeup so evenly and I love the outcome. It&#x27;s so easy to use. It&#x27;s just a little soft pink beauty sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe how soft this sponge is also. I think this sponge is amazing. I love the pink color. It really stands out. This beauty sponge is perfect for applying my makeup and so easy to use. I highly recommend it for anyone that likes to blend their makeup evenly on their face.  I received a discount on this product through a promotion. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a beauty blender but I decided to give this one a go. I wet it and dried it out, i was worried that the wet texture would smear my makeup or make it look streaky. Not at all! it went on very easily (liquid foundation) and blended in smoothly, i did not even have to use that much makeup, just a thin layer. My foundation looked flawless and the sponge cleaned up easily enough. I can&#x27;t believe I did not try one of these before, it is so simple and it is going to save me money on foundation since I do not have to use as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note - i received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> So I have been looking for a great dupe for the original Beauty Blender for a while now, and I have recived quite a few knock offs that are just okay, they usually are very porous and absorb a lot of my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally hit the jackpot with this beauty blender, it has small pores and the foundation glides across my face instead of being absorbed into the sponge and me losing my precious foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my absolute favorite beauty blender dupe and I high recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very easy applicator.  Washes up nicely to reuse over and over again. Color is bright pink so its easy to find in the drawer or makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used triangle sponges for years &amp; tried this product about 2 weeks ago and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It glides on smoothly and does not soak up the foundation like most sponges do so it&#x27;s economical.  I love how it evenly distributes the foundation &amp; because of it&#x27;s ergonomic feature, I don&#x27;t have to fumble with it like I did with triangle sponges.  Furthermore, it is very easy to clean, so, it&#x27;s saved me from buying more sponges constantly.  A must have in every woman&#x27;s make up kit!</li>
            <li> I love the way this sponge applies my make up,  flawlessly and evenly.  I won&#x27;t be applying another make-up without my blendazzle!</li>
