            <li>It is very nice when worn alone</li>
            <li>The name Touch of Light describes this perfectly.</li>
            <li>This luminizer has a great very light smooth consistency, amazing shine, and works perfectly on my darker complexion.</li>
            <li>great product, greater prince!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Double-Z</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and it gives it a nice shimmer</li>
            <li>&amp; I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Not glittery at all, just a nice shimmer.</li>
            <li>but it does give you a nice inconspicuous glow.</li>
            <li>This goes on nicely but truly illuminates the face.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bit more glitter to it</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s okay for my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love using this  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>But blends easily.</li>
            <li>Recommend to try as it is cheap and easy in use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that it is fine for an evening out or when you want to sparkle..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sparkly and has more of a golden tone to it which works</li>
            <li>Looks great but doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li>I originally found this product in CVS</li>
            <li>I really like the touch of light face glow</li>
            <li>I like the touch of sparkle this adds as you get a natural glow as if when you are expecting or in love.  </li>
            <li>I use this product last year love it and was not able to get it in the store,  my sisters love the way my face look with the glow, I got 4 in my last oder and gave them to my 4 sisters, is a fantatic product, my sisters and i love the product.. and a great price.</li>
            <li>other than that, looks nice on my skin</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>a fairly dark rose color.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims: adds a touch of light / illumination to facial skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;it would have been much easier to use the fingers</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot and believe it can work on a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li>it is very creamy and very blendable.  </li>
            <li>Of course you can go lighter or heavier with it, depends on how much you wanna shine.  </li>
            <li>I put a littlebit on my cheeks and tip of my nose and looks fresh and young.</li>
            <li>I apply under my eyes and swipe out to my cheeks;before blending I swipe any excess down my nose to have a more balanced outcome.  </li>
            <li>I personally had no glittery residue &amp; it just gave my skin a dewy, soft light which minimized the look of my age spots &amp; evened out my skin tone....</li>
            <li>bc its a product you wanna place around the area and make it fade away softly</li>
            <li>Looks fantastic and natural on pale and on tanned .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blend this completely so that it disappears into my skin but enough to have the &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>A little really does go along way.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way for sure when you receive this small tube baby.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way for sure when you receive this small tube baby.</li>
            <li> Really pretty shimmer, a little darker then expected.</li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops with my daily moisturizer &amp; I don&#x27;t even need a foundation.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail only to discover it was half used....</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this as another reviewer stated it left glittery residue on her face.</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday as part of my daily make up regimen- with or without powder or foundation.  </li>
            <li> , I use it everyday mixed with some moisturizer because it is not very creamy.</li>
            <li> effect that gives a brighter look (awake in other words).</li>
            <li> It was a little too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> so I always wear liquid bronzer or tinted moisturizers to give my face a little color.</li>
            <li> it gives you that little bit of life you need  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> This works well for a natural face not a real caked on makeup or thick foundation base, but this on some powder based foundation will take the matte to a natural place.</li>
            <li> Hard to blend.</li>
            <li> Just put a very small amount on to start, and build it up.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle glow not a oily shine.  </li>
            <li> Not a good one.</li>
            <li> Too bad its a Limited Edition</li>
            <li> This product came in a broken package.</li>
            <li> And when you try to add it to a bottle of your makeup its very difficult to mix.</li>
            <li> I looked terrible!  </li>

            <li> I originally found this product in CVS and then they either stopped carrying it or can&#x27;t keep it in stock.  I wear this everyday as part of my daily make up regimen- with or without powder or foundation.  It just gives my complexion a lift either way.  It&#x27;s not sparkly and has more of a golden tone to it which works b/c I have reddish/pink and gold undertones in my complexion.  I apply under my eyes and swipe out to my cheeks;before blending I swipe any excess down my nose to have a more balanced outcome.  I don&#x27;t blend this completely so that it disappears into my skin but enough to have the &amp;#34;lighted&amp;#34; effect that gives a brighter look (awake in other words).</li>
            <li> Love it. Use in my makeup kit</li>
            <li> Really pretty shimmer, a little darker then expected. a fairly dark rose color. But blends easily. Not glittery at all, just a nice shimmer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. Hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I really like the touch of light face glow, I use it everyday mixed with some moisturizer because it is not very creamy. I have fair skin and it gives it a nice shimmer, I do not wear foundation so I always wear liquid bronzer or tinted moisturizers to give my face a little color. I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I like the touch of sparkle this adds as you get a natural glow as if when you are expecting or in love.  It is a subtle glow not a oily shine.  This works well for a natural face not a real caked on makeup or thick foundation base, but this on some powder based foundation will take the matte to a natural place.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Too bad its a Limited Edition</li>
            <li> a bit darker than I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Looks fantastic and natural on pale and on tanned . Recommend to try as it is cheap and easy in use.</li>
            <li> i like it, glow tone but it sticks into your hands, so no fingers use aplicators.&lt;br /&gt;it would have been much easier to use the fingers bc its a product you wanna place around the area and make it fade away softly</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s very thick. And when you try to add it to a bottle of your makeup its very difficult to mix. Otherwise it does add illluminate your foundation without it being to shiny.  I was expecting a bit more glitter to it but it does give you a nice inconspicuous glow.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for sure when you receive this small tube baby. Gives my face that dewy look I always go for whether it&#x27;s spring or fall. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this product last year love it and was not able to get it in the store,  my sisters love the way my face look with the glow, I got 4 in my last oder and gave them to my 4 sisters, is a fantatic product, my sisters and i love the product.. and a great price.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s okay for my opinion.</li>
            <li> Looks great but doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail only to discover it was half used....other than that, looks nice on my skin</li>
            <li> This luminizer has a great very light smooth consistency, amazing shine, and works perfectly on my darker complexion. It lasts pretty much all day. Just put a very small amount on to start, and build it up. I really like it a lot and believe it can work on a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly.  It was a little too dark for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims: adds a touch of light / illumination to facial skin</li>
            <li> I saw a photo of myself when at a party with this makeup on...I looked terrible!  Orangey looking...</li>
            <li> This product came in a broken package. Not a good one.</li>
            <li> I love using this  it is very creamy and very blendable.  I use it when I am contouring and highlighting my face.  A little really does go along way.  Of course you can go lighter or heavier with it, depends on how much you wanna shine.  It is very nice when worn alone as well  it gives you that little bit of life you need  I definatley recommend trying it.  The price for it is a very fair price as well</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this as another reviewer stated it left glittery residue on her face. I just received this &amp; I LOVE IT! I&#x27;m 50 &amp; my skin has lost some brightness &amp; this stuff is great for adding just that. The name Touch of Light describes this perfectly. I personally had no glittery residue &amp; it just gave my skin a dewy, soft light which minimized the look of my age spots &amp; evened out my skin tone....I mixed a few drops with my daily moisturizer &amp; I don&#x27;t even need a foundation. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This goes on nicely but truly illuminates the face.  I&#x27;m thinking that it is fine for an evening out or when you want to sparkle..</li>
            <li> Does not blend and stays glaringly streaked on the cheek. I threw it away after one attempt.</li>
            <li> when i try to blend it, it sometimes cracks. it&#x27;s not something i would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I put a littlebit on my cheeks and tip of my nose and looks fresh and young.</li>
            <li> Great Seller &amp; I like this product</li>
            <li> Great highlighter! Glad I bought this one! great product, greater prince!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Double-Z</li>
