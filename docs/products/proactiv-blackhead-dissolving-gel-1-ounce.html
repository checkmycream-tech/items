    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with product.</li>
            <li>but I have a friend that has used this product with great results</li>
            <li>for me not as good as advertised</li>
            <li>and there sgin is like a lot of young adots its great there happy with there</li>
            <li>This is one more try to get rid of them.....</li>
            <li>Sure wish I would have read this in the ad before ordering it.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells pretty nice, not like chemicals</li>
            <li>This blackheads gel has really work and I will recommend it to many people.  </li>
            <li>You just pay FULL PRICE FOR ABOUT A TEASPOON FULL.</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price tag</li>
            <li>The first time I use it I see improvements in two days</li>
            <li>I really love the regular Proactive kit, that is a miracle for me.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s more geared toward people like me that have an actual problem with a lot of blackheads and not just one or two popping up once in awhile.</li>
            <li>After the first night I could see results but now, there are large patches on my nose</li>
            <li>So getting my hair done, my eyebrows waxed and a facial every month was becoming a $300+ excursion after tips, parking, etc.</li>
            <li>I really cannot believe how well this</li>
            <li>I bought the whole kit + blackhead dissolver + a few more items for 30 dollars</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy myself a few more bottles because it&#x27;s really working for me.</li>
            <li>have not used it long enough to be really sure.  </li>
            <li>thatare just clear.</li>
            <li>So far, it hasn&#x27;t lived up to it&#x27;s promises</li>
            <li>I know I have a long way to go and that there&#x27;s no guarantee it will remove all my blackheads, but it&#x27;s the first product that&#x27;s ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>It surprised me how well this stuff works.</li>
            <li>and it really is the only product that&#x27;s ever worked on me.</li>
            <li>The answer to problem skin for all ages 10 - 100 yrs old.</li>
            <li>would get facials and facialists would recommend super expensive products to help fight the blackheads, but I was told by more than one person the only thing that will rid me of blackheads is going for facials frequently and letting them extract.</li>
            <li>And even then the facialist couldn&#x27;t get them all and the next time I&#x27;d go new ones would replace the ones that were removed from the time before.</li>
            <li>a complete cure probably isn&#x27;t likely.</li>
            <li>Someone told me they were extremely harsh and powerful</li>
            <li>had heard good and bad things about Proactiv products.</li>

            <li> I choose to sleep with it because my blackheads, as I stated above, are really embedded into my skin and a lot of times facialists have a hard time extracting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way, in New York (not sure if it&#x27;s the same in all states)</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed that my pores got smaller and my black heads became less visible, but they didn&#x27;t disappear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a small 1 oz. tube, but since you&#x27;re only supposed to use it sparingly</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help that I worked outside in construction from my late teens to mid</li>
            <li> We aren&#x27;t seeing the results expected.</li>
            <li> Also its way overpriced for such a small sample size bottle</li>
            <li> This product was for my daughter and it isn&#x27;t working like we hoped other Proactive products have.</li>
            <li> It was like an endless cycle.</li>
            <li> I have never used any other proactiv products before.</li>
            <li> I would hands down recommend this product to anyone who has blackheads.</li>
            <li> Yep I got black heads on my nose.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really review this product because I&#x27;m afraid to use it now that I have it.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel harsh or sting or anything like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, and it&#x27;s a very thin gel, so it doesn&#x27;t feel thick and gross on your face.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t help it and while it never looked bad from far away, close up</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so expensive on amazon, so a few stars less for the ridiculous price.  </li>
            <li> This product didnt help my blackheads at all and actualy made me breakout worse.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Which hurts and is extremely unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Hate them.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Results far quicker than I expected.  Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet but I have a friend that has used this product with great results</li>
            <li> So far, it hasn&#x27;t lived up to it&#x27;s promises</li>
            <li> I bought the whole kit + blackhead dissolver + a few more items for 30 dollars so I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so expensive on amazon, so a few stars less for the ridiculous price.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, 2-3 times a week and this stuff works in some ways.  I definitely noticed that my pores got smaller and my black heads became less visible, but they didn&#x27;t disappear.  So if you&#x27;re looking for an improvement, you&#x27;ll get it but a complete cure probably isn&#x27;t likely.</li>
            <li> This blackheads gel has really work and I will recommend it to many people.  The first time I use it I see improvements in two days</li>
            <li> Must use for about a month to see results</li>
            <li> This product didnt help my blackheads at all and actualy made me breakout worse. It is basically just salicylic acid which can irritated skin a lot. Also its way overpriced for such a small sample size bottle</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too expensive for the size. We aren&#x27;t seeing the results expected. I really love the regular Proactive kit, that is a miracle for me. This product was for my daughter and it isn&#x27;t working like we hoped other Proactive products have.</li>
            <li> for me not as good as advertised</li>
            <li> Yep I got black heads on my nose.  Hate them.  This is one more try to get rid of them.....,Does it work?  have not used it long enough to be really sure.  But my nose has not pealed off and the &amp;#34;Big one&amp;#34; has not come back so there is hope.</li>
            <li> i would like to say i got it for my grankids becus there that age and there sgin is like a lot of young adots its great there happy with there sgine so im plesd withe theproactiv all that i have got thank you</li>
            <li> I really cannot believe how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background info: I&#x27;ve been prone to blackheads since I was a teenager. Nothing helped. I have super oily skin and they just would get embedded in my nose and cheeks, basically my t-zone. I couldn&#x27;t help it and while it never looked bad from far away, close up it is noticeable. It didn&#x27;t help that I worked outside in construction from my late teens to mid 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get facials and facialists would recommend super expensive products to help fight the blackheads, but I was told by more than one person the only thing that will rid me of blackheads is going for facials frequently and letting them extract. Which hurts and is extremely unpleasant. And even then the facialist couldn&#x27;t get them all and the next time I&#x27;d go new ones would replace the ones that were removed from the time before. It was like an endless cycle. By the way, in New York (not sure if it&#x27;s the same in all states) a facial is around $120 for an hour. So getting my hair done, my eyebrows waxed and a facial every month was becoming a $300+ excursion after tips, parking, etc. Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard good and bad things about Proactiv products. Someone told me they were extremely harsh and powerful and she didn&#x27;t like them. I have never used any other proactiv products before. I ordered the dissolving blackhead gel just to see if it worked. If not, I&#x27;m out $36, no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the gel now for about 3 weeks. You&#x27;re only supposed to use it 1-2 times a week and you&#x27;re supposed to wash it off after 5 minutes. I choose to sleep with it because my blackheads, as I stated above, are really embedded into my skin and a lot of times facialists have a hard time extracting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say this gel is a miracle is an understatement. I cannot believe the difference I&#x27;m seeing on my skin. It&#x27;s really unbelievable. After the first night I could see results but now, there are large patches on my nose thatare just clear. I know I have a long way to go and that there&#x27;s no guarantee it will remove all my blackheads, but it&#x27;s the first product that&#x27;s ever worked for me. Also, it smells pretty nice, not like chemicals and it doesn&#x27;t feel harsh or sting or anything like that. It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything, and it&#x27;s a very thin gel, so it doesn&#x27;t feel thick and gross on your face. I would hands down recommend this product to anyone who has blackheads. It surprised me how well this stuff works. The downside is that $36 is pricey for the size you&#x27;re getting. It&#x27;s only a small 1 oz. tube, but since you&#x27;re only supposed to use it sparingly and 1-2 times a week, it can last awhile. I&#x27;m going to buy myself a few more bottles because it&#x27;s really working for me. Before I purchased this product, I did look at the reviews and I saw some people saying it doesn&#x27;t work for them. I guess it works for some people and for some others it doesn&#x27;t. Maybe skin type matters or maybe it&#x27;s more geared toward people like me that have an actual problem with a lot of blackheads and not just one or two popping up once in awhile. I&#x27;m really not sure. I do know that it&#x27;s worked for me and I will recommend it to everyone I know. It&#x27;s worth the price tag and it really is the only product that&#x27;s ever worked on me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really review this product because I&#x27;m afraid to use it now that I have it. The tube says on it, not to use it if you are prone to spider veins on your face. Well, I am. So I haven&#x27;t used it at all. Sure wish I would have read this in the ad before ordering it.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin from getting oily and makes pores smaller.</li>
            <li> The answer to problem skin for all ages 10 - 100 yrs old.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive. You get about a &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size of something from places that want you to &#x27;try&#x27; their product. You just pay FULL PRICE FOR ABOUT A TEASPOON FULL.</li>
    </ol>
