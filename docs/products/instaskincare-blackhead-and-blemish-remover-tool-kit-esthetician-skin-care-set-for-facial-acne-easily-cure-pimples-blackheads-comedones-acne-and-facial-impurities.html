            <li>All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and washed them good and dipped in alcohol before first use.</li>
            <li>By submitting this review I honestly attest that it&#x27;s my true opinion and was not a purchased review or opinion.</li>
            <li>So after they were washed and hubby sharpened the lancet took, they are perfect............ especially for the price they are well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>instructions were included but the set did come with a guide &amp;#34;Top 10 Ideas for Clear and Healthy Skin&amp;#34; which had some good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item.</li>
            <li>or so each and some are cheaply made</li>
            <li>received this item at a free or discounted price for my unbiased and person review/opinion.</li>
            <li>It also works were for preventative measures if you use immediately after a shower and lightly run over your face.</li>
            <li>This is very nice toolkit for facial care.</li>
            <li>LOVING this Blemish Kit so far!!</li>
            <li>and they come in a very nice leather case that zips closed.</li>
            <li>100% stainless steel, easy to clean an sanitize.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping nice presentation love all the different sizes of tools to use.</li>
            <li>InstaSkincare Blackhead and Blemish Remover has given me new options that are better for my skin.</li>
            <li>The InstaSkincare Blackhead and Blemish Remover is a nice addition to my facial routine.</li>
            <li>So useful.</li>
            <li>A nicely made zippered case with a set of 5 different double-ended skin tools for removing blackheads, pimples etc.</li>
            <li>The instruments are very good the black case is very durable so far.</li>
            <li>, (One I got at Walmart broke the first time I used it, the loop just fell out of the handle).</li>
            <li>I though at first was dirt gathered in the pattern of the handles and around where the wires and loops are attached to the handles.</li>
            <li>They recommend you to sanitize them before first use anyway of course.</li>
            <li>I thought the fine quality of the metal would have been a little better.....</li>
            <li>I am still not quite sure when to use a flat head vs the rounded head, so if one does not work I try another.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to be patient, and to allow hot water or steam to open the pores first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice little set of blackhead and blemish remover tools.</li>
            <li>I really like this item</li>
            <li>The tools are made from 100% stainless steel and guaranteed not to rust.</li>
            <li>Each is Stainless Steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sturdy, Stainless steel.</li>
            <li>The tools are stainless steel and they are rust resistant.</li>
            <li>They come in small handy</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Have to admit, had more tools than I knew what to do with, but after a little research, I found it has everything I need for me and my teenagers.</li>
            <li>Makes keeping my skin clear so much easier.</li>
            <li>I can see myself in a product from use, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
            <li>Could also be useful in helping remove thorns or splinters if these are protruding above the skin surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Husband fixed it right up easily with a small grinder and sharpened it.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m in my early 40s, my skin is still blemish prone.</li>
            <li>Without makeup, you can see that it&#x27;s far from the truth.</li>
            <li>but I like that this is a complete set.</li>
            <li>Each tool is double ended and very durable, and well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also helpful not to use too much force, it&#x27;s not necessary to bruise</li>
            <li>A good little set at a lower price currently than I have seen them in local stores, where a single tool can run $4-$6 each.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I only gave it 4 stars is this, easily fixed, by me after I received it already.</li>
            <li>I then looked very close and took a sharp knife and scraped this off a spot and rubbed it in between my fingers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the deep, hard, core filled</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s helpful to use these after a bath or long shower when the skin pores are open.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a nice set to have in case of emergencies but disappointed because I have no idea which tool is to be used for what.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is a black leather like material with a red velvet type material liner.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work exactly as expected</li>
            <li> They also have built-in grips on the center to help when you need to apply</li>
            <li> Then with a blackhead in the middle of the loop I press down and while pushing down drag across the skin.</li>
            <li> First the lancet tool was dull, really dull, no way was that popping a pimple.</li>
            <li> The InstaSkincare Blackhead and Blemish Remover has helped me remove some of those rough looking lumps and bumps, so the makeup is hiding less and less</li>
            <li> I pressed down and to the slide and the blackheads pop out with ease.</li>
            <li> Using this left a knot on my head that lasted a few weeks, and I didnt press hard at all.</li>
            <li> , I had 1 black head remover</li>
            <li> It was a black, silver dust</li>
            <li> size of the case is like a slightly elongated case for eyeglasses.</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little bit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have actual acne, but I have random blackheads here and there.</li>
            <li> I started to wash them and noticed I got a small splinter, metal splinter in my finger.</li>
            <li> I am one that usually pops pimples and blackheads by squeezing them with my hands.</li>
            <li> This would usually lead to scabs and then scares.</li>
            <li> No more trying to remove blackheads with your fingernails.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5ec021a953476d6a1f1b35b6ce844585]]This set looks similar to the one used by my esthetician. The kit comes without any instructions, however I saw how my esthetician uses them so I had an idea of what to do. I am still not quite sure when to use a flat head vs the rounded head, so if one does not work I try another. Before each use I sterilize it with rubbing alcohol. Then with a blackhead in the middle of the loop I press down and while pushing down drag across the skin. It does hurt a little bit. These loops work better than trying to squeeze blackheads with your finger nail because instead of squeezing it presses down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes 5 different tools each one has two different loops. They come in small handy case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is provided InstanSkincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> The pieces are made good, but the problem is they don&#x27;t work as advertised, to top it up there is no instructions, to explain the function of each piece.&lt;br /&gt;It was my understanding that there will be a booklet about skin care with the order, but no,&lt;br /&gt;A good quality of pointed tweezers work by far better than any of the pieces in the kit, that is something that I was using before I order the kit and I am going back to that.</li>
            <li> LOVING this Blemish Kit so far!!</li>
            <li> Love these.  Makes keeping my skin clear so much easier.</li>
            <li> Using this left a knot on my head that lasted a few weeks, and I didnt press hard at all.</li>
            <li> The InstaSkincare Blackhead and Blemish Remover is a nice addition to my facial routine. Even though I&#x27;m in my early 40s, my skin is still blemish prone. I don&#x27;t have actual acne, but I have random blackheads here and there. I also have tons of whiteheads. Not the kind that you can mash and they pop out easily. It&#x27;s the deep, hard, core filled kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaSkincare Blackhead and Blemish Remover has given me new options that are better for my skin. My set did not include any instructions, but I&#x27;ve been trying to figure it out by trial and error which tools work best for each particular need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in my pictures, my makeup makes my skin look almost flawless. Without makeup, you can see that it&#x27;s far from the truth. The InstaSkincare Blackhead and Blemish Remover has helped me remove some of those rough looking lumps and bumps, so the makeup is hiding less and less these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had instructions been included, I would have been able to give the InstaSkincare Blackhead and Blemish Remover kit a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li> I thought the fine quality of the metal would have been a little better.....</li>
            <li> I really like this item, I had 1 black head remover but I like that this is a complete set. This set will defiantly be used often in my house by my husband and myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this with a coupon code</li>
            <li> Be carefull and learn how to use them</li>
            <li> Great value set and will do exactly what it is supposed to do. 100% stainless steel, easy to clean an sanitize. The case is a black leather like material with a red velvet type material liner. Each tool is double ended and very durable, and well made. Considering if you bought each tool separate with no case, they are between 5-18 bucks or so each and some are cheaply made, (One I got at Walmart broke the first time I used it, the loop just fell out of the handle). These are made well and will not fall apart. I would recommend this set based on the above information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave it 4 stars is this, easily fixed, by me after I received it already. First the lancet tool was dull, really dull, no way was that popping a pimple. Husband fixed it right up easily with a small grinder and sharpened it. Second mine had tool residue all over them from the tool work shaping them and putting them together. It was a black, silver dust I though at first was dirt gathered in the pattern of the handles and around where the wires and loops are attached to the handles. I started to wash them and noticed I got a small splinter, metal splinter in my finger. I then looked very close and took a sharp knife and scraped this off a spot and rubbed it in between my fingers and yes it was all tiny tiny  pieces of metal dust/shavings. It rinsed off with water....... I went ahead and washed them good and dipped in alcohol before first use. They recommend you to sanitize them before first use anyway of course. So after they were washed and hubby sharpened the lancet took, they are perfect............ especially for the price they are well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

            <li> It didn&#x27;t work exactly as expected but I do have to take the extra step of steaming my face then I can give a better review. I have watched videos of doctors using the tool and it seems blackheads come out easier for them. May be the steaming step- we&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> This is a nice little set of blackhead and blemish remover tools. There are 5 tools with each having a different use at each end (so technically there are 10 tools in all) and they come in a very nice leather case that zips closed. The tools are made from 100% stainless steel and guaranteed not to rust. They also have built-in grips on the center to help when you need to apply pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No instructions were included but the set did come with a guide &amp;#34;Top 10 Ideas for Clear and Healthy Skin&amp;#34; which had some good points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a nice set to have in case of emergencies but disappointed because I have no idea which tool is to be used for what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping nice presentation love all the different sizes of tools to use.</li>
            <li> This is very nice toolkit for facial care. Have to admit, had more tools than I knew what to do with, but after a little research, I found it has everything I need for me and my teenagers. Especially like the carry/travel case! Purchased thru discounted promotion for unbiased evaluation.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with breakouts since I was a teenager. I am one that usually pops pimples and blackheads by squeezing them with my hands. This would usually lead to scabs and then scares. Using the InstaSkincare Blackhead and Blemish Remover tool kit, I have been able to remove blackheads without causing scabs. Using this kit is more sanitary than using you hands as well, and helps prevent infections. I am very satisfied with the InstaSkincare blackhead and blemish remover, and would recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer :&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a free or discounted price for my unbiased and person review/opinion. By submitting this review I honestly attest that it&#x27;s my true opinion and was not a purchased review or opinion.</li>
            <li> So useful. Helps remove blackheads with out pinching and damaging skin. Wonderful!!</li>
            <li> A nicely made zippered case with a set of 5 different double-ended skin tools for removing blackheads, pimples etc. Could also be useful in helping remove thorns or splinters if these are protruding above the skin surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon photo gives a very accurate idea of what you receive and what each tool is like. Each is Stainless Steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re easy to use. It&#x27;s helpful to use these after a bath or long shower when the skin pores are open. It&#x27;s also helpful not to use too much force, it&#x27;s not necessary to bruise yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of the case is like a slightly elongated case for eyeglasses. It&#x27;s a handy way to keep track of the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each tool is a slightly different size, shape and length. They work. It&#x27;s important to be patient, and to allow hot water or steam to open the pores first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. A good little set at a lower price currently than I have seen them in local stores, where a single tool can run $4-$6 each. So the set of 5 is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful as you research and comparison shop online.</li>

I pressed down and to the slide and the blackheads pop out with ease. No more trying to remove blackheads with your fingernails. This is a great item to have.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the instructive document that was supposed to be included.  Don&#x27;t know how to use the kit.</li>
