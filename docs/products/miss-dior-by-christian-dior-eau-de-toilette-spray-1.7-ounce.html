    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>It is simply wonderful!</li>
            <li>Today it&#x27;s a wonderful scent</li>
            <li>Perfect perfume for those who like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great purchase!</li>
            <li>This seems to respond a great deal to body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>I like the backwash of patchouli oil, but the orange essence makes this great.  </li>
            <li>Although I did not smell or use it, I can tell it is good from her face.</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous fragrance with notes of jasmine, mandarin, and patchouli.</li>
            <li>Very pleased</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The rose oil is not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>I do not like rose perfumes.</li>
            <li>I had tried Miss Dior in a department store and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I was able to find it on Amazon and for the great price of 1+59 dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance was exactly what I wanted beautiful</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The scent stays all day without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews on here, I would just make sure you know which scent</li>
            <li>This should be good for the hot summer days that are coming up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this perfume since the first time I smelled it.</li>
            <li>smells feminine, clean and will attract anybody!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bold and sexy without being overpowering like many of Chanel&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li>Love the scent it is fresh, clean  and sexy.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li>This is a great price considering ordering it from the magazine would have cost double!</li>
            <li>They both smell great but are definitely different.</li>
            <li>I first came across this perfume in a magazine and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>&quot;  Many like the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Miss Dior (Miss Dior Chérie) because of its fruitier, more zesty scent that has hints of jasmine, Mandarin oranges and even a sprinkle of vanilla that seems more \\&quot;modern\\&quot; in comparison to the 1947 original Miss Dior that was a heavier, more gardenia heavy scent.  </li>
            <li>(cause of course, they don&#x27;t participate in the Super Saver Shipping program.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>She likes it very much.</li>
            <li>The scent is actually more powerful when you&#x27;re perspiring a little bit (was pretty strong when I exercised at the end of the day).  </li>
            <li>Got here when it said it was going to, will definitely be adding to my wish list again :-)</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more reminiscent of the product description (orange, patchouli, etc.).  </li>
            <li>It was cheaper than sephora, I appreciated that!</li>
            <li>It smells exact and my boyfriend loves it on me.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that if you are looking for the class \\&quot;Miss Dior\\&quot; you need to look at \\&quot;Miss Dior Originale, Eau de Toilette!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I had received a sample of this back at Christmas time from Sephora and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I am using it but next time I will pay more at the store.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, completely sealed and the fragrance was true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Updated on 9/24/12&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has changed the product description to include the following statment \\&quot;Dior has changed the name of Miss Dior Ch&amp;eacute;rie to Miss Dior, and the original Miss Dior to Miss Dior Classic or Miss Dior Original\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;While I do not know if this an accurate statement of Dior&#x27;s recent changes, but be aware that if they are still selling this product as a \\&quot;Miss Dior CHERIE\\&quot; rebrand; IT DOES NOT SMELL LIKE Miss Dior CHERIE!</li>
            <li>I milked it all the way until August until I had enough free funds to buy a real bottle of it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this as a gift for your lady or even just to treat yourself ( ladies!)</li>
            <li>(I say that because some people complain about receiving what they believe are knockoffs--this was the real deal)</li>
            <li>I was actually flying home from Europe and was wasting time in the Duty Free shop when I came across this perfume.</li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY if you are looking for the original Miss Dior Eau de Toilette product by Christian Dior.</li>
            <li>Although the Cherie smells nice enough, it  is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>This is a stronger scent, but it&#x27;s still appropriate for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Worth the money to try it before you purchase a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>I think this was the old Miss Dior not the new one!</li>
            <li>If it is possible for you to get a sample before committing to buying a full-sized bottle, use it for a few days and see how it responds to your own body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Simple, pretty and not to old or young...</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and smells just like i expected!</li>
            <li>This one actually lasted through a whole work day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really do like the long-lasting aspect of this, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it for awhile, on the off chance that the second day was just an anomaly.  </li>
            <li>The scent is soft and my husband loves it on me.</li>
            <li>It pairs well with big events and intimate dinners.</li>
            <li>The perfume I received was NOT the same as is advertised on the main product page.</li>
            <li>First time Amazon has let me down.</li>

            <li> And you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This review is for the current product (as of April 2014 when I started using it); I am not familiar with the old version mentioned in some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive</li>
            <li> I had heard from other reviews that it was the same- just renamed.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer than any other eau de toilette from any other brand I&#x27;ve tried lately (I&#x27;m trying to find a new perfume for myself).  </li>
            <li> They do not smell at all the same, so count me disappointed that I now a) have no perfume to wear and b) am stuck paying at least twelve dollars more to have it fulfilled by a marketplace seller who will then charge me an additional five to ten dollars to ship it</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed recently when I purchased Miss Dior Eau de Toilette that they had rebranded \\&quot;Miss Dior Chérie\\&quot; into \\&quot;Miss Dior\\&quot; and the REAL Miss Dior into \\&quot;Miss Dior Originale, Eau de Toilette.\\</li>
            <li> Yesterday, it reminded me a little bit of men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> I used this perfume for a few days and I&#x27;m not sure what to think.  </li>
            <li> Failed too and there is no constant odor</li>
            <li> Perfumes are expensive so my criteria is a lasting smell.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting one and get the other, you will definitely be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, they either have the wrong items on the shelf, the wrong picture, or the order selectors can&#x27;t read.</li>
            <li> They were wrong.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent! Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> I had this on my wishlist and a dear friend of mine purchased it for me for valentine&#x27;s day. It is simply wonderful! smells feminine, clean and will attract anybody! not too overpowering either. I would highly recommend this as a gift for your lady or even just to treat yourself ( ladies!) you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells amazing. Got here when it said it was going to, will definitely be adding to my wish list again :-)</li>
            <li> I first came across this perfume in a magazine and fell in love with it. This is a great price considering ordering it from the magazine would have cost double! Arrived quickly and smells just like i expected! Very pleased</li>
            <li> I used this perfume for a few days and I&#x27;m not sure what to think.  This review is for the current product (as of April 2014 when I started using it); I am not familiar with the old version mentioned in some of the other reviews.  Two things are definitely in this product&#x27;s favor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It lasts longer than any other eau de toilette from any other brand I&#x27;ve tried lately (I&#x27;m trying to find a new perfume for myself).  This one actually lasted through a whole work day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The scent is actually more powerful when you&#x27;re perspiring a little bit (was pretty strong when I exercised at the end of the day).  This should be good for the hot summer days that are coming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now here&#x27;s what&#x27;s giving me pause.  This seems to respond a great deal to body chemistry.  It actually smelled different on me yesterday than it did today.  Yesterday, it reminded me a little bit of men&#x27;s cologne.  Today it&#x27;s a wonderful scent that&#x27;s more reminiscent of the product description (orange, patchouli, etc.).  I&#x27;ve never used a fragrance that changed like that before, and it&#x27;s giving me pause about buying a larger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the long-lasting aspect of this, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it for awhile, on the off chance that the second day was just an anomaly.  If it is possible for you to get a sample before committing to buying a full-sized bottle, use it for a few days and see how it responds to your own body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Perfect perfume for those who like this fragrance. It arrived on time, completely sealed and the fragrance was true. (I say that because some people complain about receiving what they believe are knockoffs--this was the real deal)</li>
            <li> The scent is soft and my husband loves it on me. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Simple, pretty and not to old or young...I get compliments from everyone on this. It pairs well with big events and intimate dinners.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted! It came in a timely manner! Completely satisfied! It was cheaper than sephora, I appreciated that! It smells exact and my boyfriend loves it on me. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Ordered blooming bouquet. Does not smell the same. I think this was the old Miss Dior not the new one!</li>
            <li> I picked it and send it to one of my friend. She likes it very much. Although I did not smell or use it, I can tell it is good from her face.</li>
            <li> Failed too and there is no constant odor</li>
            <li> The fragrance was exactly what I wanted beautiful</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous fragrance with notes of jasmine, mandarin, and patchouli. It&#x27;s bold and sexy without being overpowering like many of Chanel&#x27;s fragrances. This is a stronger scent, but it&#x27;s still appropriate for everyday wear. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume since the first time I smelled it. I was actually flying home from Europe and was wasting time in the Duty Free shop when I came across this perfume. I tried it on and it was over from there. I&#x27;ve never been without since. It&#x27;s a little more expensive but it&#x27;s totally worth it. The scent stays all day without being overwhelming. And you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on so the bottle lasts a long time. I definitely would recommend others to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews on here, I would just make sure you know which scent you&#x27;re definitely getting when you order. They both smell great but are definitely different. If you are expecting one and get the other, you will definitely be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lots of complements on the smell , I ordered 2 bottles</li>
            <li> My nose doesn&#x27;t work like it once did, but if he likes, so do I. Why fool around with anybody else&#x27;s nose.</li>
            <li> Love the scent it is fresh, clean  and sexy. Would buy it again and again! Love it ! Worth the money to try it before you purchase a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> The perfume I received was NOT the same as is advertised on the main product page. DO NOT BUY if you are looking for the original Miss Dior Eau de Toilette product by Christian Dior.</li>
            <li> I like the backwash of patchouli oil, but the orange essence makes this great.  The rose oil is not overbearing.  I do not like rose perfumes.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed recently when I purchased Miss Dior Eau de Toilette that they had rebranded \\&quot;Miss Dior Chérie\\&quot; into \\&quot;Miss Dior\\&quot; and the REAL Miss Dior into \\&quot;Miss Dior Originale, Eau de Toilette.\\&quot;  Many like the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Miss Dior (Miss Dior Chérie) because of its fruitier, more zesty scent that has hints of jasmine, Mandarin oranges and even a sprinkle of vanilla that seems more \\&quot;modern\\&quot; in comparison to the 1947 original Miss Dior that was a heavier, more gardenia heavy scent.  I think this scent is a bit younger, ligher, and fresher. It is well suited for women as a daytime wear.  Just be aware that if you are looking for the class \\&quot;Miss Dior\\&quot; you need to look at \\&quot;Miss Dior Originale, Eau de Toilette!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of this back at Christmas time from Sephora and fell in love with it. I milked it all the way until August until I had enough free funds to buy a real bottle of it. I was so excited that I was able to find it on Amazon and for the great price of 1+59 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they either have the wrong items on the shelf, the wrong picture, or the order selectors can&#x27;t read. Two times in a row I received Miss Dior by Christian Dior, NOT Miss Dior CHERIE by Christian Dior. They do not smell at all the same, so count me disappointed that I now a) have no perfume to wear and b) am stuck paying at least twelve dollars more to have it fulfilled by a marketplace seller who will then charge me an additional five to ten dollars to ship it (cause of course, they don&#x27;t participate in the Super Saver Shipping program.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated on 9/24/12&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has changed the product description to include the following statment \\&quot;Dior has changed the name of Miss Dior Ch&amp;eacute;rie to Miss Dior, and the original Miss Dior to Miss Dior Classic or Miss Dior Original\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;While I do not know if this an accurate statement of Dior&#x27;s recent changes, but be aware that if they are still selling this product as a \\&quot;Miss Dior CHERIE\\&quot; rebrand; IT DOES NOT SMELL LIKE Miss Dior CHERIE!</li>
            <li> I had tried Miss Dior in a department store and really liked it. Went on Amazon to order at a lower price. I ordered Miss Dior but Miss Dior Cherie was sent. I had heard from other reviews that it was the same- just renamed. So I tried it. They were wrong. Although the Cherie smells nice enough, it  is not what I expected. I know that once the box is opened, it cannot be returned. I am using it but next time I will pay more at the store. First time Amazon has let me down.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for every woman. It is not to over bearing yet it lasts all day. It is on the sweeter side but I do wear it at night as well. Even after a shower the smell lingers. Perfumes are expensive so my criteria is a lasting smell. Can&#x27;t beat this one.</li>
