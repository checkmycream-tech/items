            <li>Serum is light and unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth when it dries.</li>
            <li>It can offer protection to your face against free radicals that cause damage.</li>
            <li>if you use sunscreen your skin will still suffer from free radicles and all the damage they inflict.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just 3 weeks into using this, and my skin definitely looks great immediately after using.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous serums on the market and The Oz Code has been the best by far!  </li>
            <li>I am worth it!</li>
            <li>It does go on smooth and feels good, but no obvious results yet.</li>
            <li>soaks in quickly leaves skin smooth</li>
            <li>Great price, too....and arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nothing special and there are MUCH better, more reputable products out there for half the price.  </li>
            <li>This time, I washed my face and quickly rubbed The OZ code on the scratch</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more when I run out!</li>
            <li>I’ve been using it for a little under three weeks now and my skin feels great</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum for Face by The OZ Code is a user friendly product and you just need to follow the directions to experience positive results.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and tightens facial skin and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It takes someone who knows their own skin to care for it properly.</li>
            <li>What surprised me the most is the sun damage I&#x27;ve had on my chest for 25 years seems to have improved.</li>
            <li>do have on exciting thing to share with you:  </li>
            <li>Very good customer service including an email with instructions for use.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see any visible difference</li>
            <li>I received the product right on schedule as promised.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this serum but give it more than a week or two if you are a wee bit older?</li>
            <li>recommend it to all who want to get rid of wrinkles in a natural and easy way.</li>
            <li>I’m pretty sure that I will see further improvement too.</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin looks smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I put more on before going to bed and the next morning my cheek still felt sore</li>
            <li>this is good to use topically because our capillaries deliver nutrients last to the face.</li>
            <li>The ingredients of Best Vitamin C Serum for Face have played a major role behind its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>For wrinkles and fine lines, it&#x27;s really the only thing that works.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for all your help.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and seen no difference.</li>
            <li>and I must say it really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I am still just using the product don&#x27;t really see the difference yet.  </li>
            <li>I used each of them for three weeks straight</li>
            <li>For example, you need to wash your facein a normal way, allow it to dry and apply a thin layer of Best Vitamin C serum over the desired area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, and although my face doesn&#x27;t appear less wrinkled and more youthful, it is softer and smoother</li>
            <li>I will definitely come back for more when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>I particularly like</li>
            <li>First of all, it is totally natural and organic product, free of alcohol and parabens, which is a necessary condition for my cosmetics and second of all – it helps my skin better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it daily for 2 weeks now and it has significantly lightened the pigmented spots on my face!  </li>
            <li>I got this serum to help lighten dark spots on my face and also to prevent wrinkles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I really have not noticed much change in my skin, but I have only been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>My energetic standard poodle pup scratched my face the other day, from cheek to chin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference at first but have recently thought that my skin has a glow about it....</li>
            <li>Thanks for following up</li>
            <li>All these ingredients are taken from natural sources and they do not have the ability to create any harmful side effects.</li>
            <li>I am 65, with a skin od a forty-year old woman</li>
            <li>Then you can let the serum dry for few minutes and apply your favorite cream or moisturizer after it has completely</li>
            <li>The most notable&lt;br /&gt;difference, however, is that this serum seriously addresses the dryness of my skin; my face remains hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li>For example, this product stimulates the synthesis of collagen, which can assist your skin to appear vibrant and younger.</li>
            <li>Along with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Hyaluronic acid can be found in this product as key main ingredients.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve facial lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday &amp; feel like I am doing the right thing for my skin!</li>
            <li>Within an hour the scratch was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The Oz Code is absorbed immediately and takes only a few drops for overall application.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love that the products are combined into one serum.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Nothing short of a miracle. I was given a bottle from my sister in law because she thought it could help my skin. At first, I was a bit embarrassed and kind of pissed off that she would give it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try, and I am shocked! I have been using it for a couple weeks now and my skin looks much different. It is brighter, the wrinkles that were starting to form on either side of my eyes have all but disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can visibly see a difference in the mirror, not to mention friends and family making comments about my youthful appearance. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very good customer service including an email with instructions for use.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see any visible difference but it does make&lt;br /&gt;my skin feel smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I have had the serum for awhile but just started using it today. So I don&#x27;t know how well it works yet.  My concern is did I read all the offer fine print.  I hope I am not on auto shipment where I have to try to contact someone to stop getting serum every month.  Was there a time limit to stop auto ship or is this a one time sale as I hoped?</li>
            <li> Betty, I just picked it up from the post office. Thank you so much for all your help. I can&#x27;t rate because I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li> Receive this product a week ago.  Says I should see a difference in 4 weeks. Serum is light and unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Purchased just 2 weeks ago. I see it making a bit of a difference. So far so good. I will continue to purchase &amp;#34;The Oz Code&amp;#34; and hope for more improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed! I was recommended this by a friend who swears it’s the best they have used; so I gave it a try and I have to say that it is pretty good stuff.  I’ve been using it for a little under three weeks now and my skin feels great and my wrinkles are less visible too. I’m pretty sure that I will see further improvement too. Really great product, highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> so far, i am happy with the product.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know, yet!!!  Thanks for following up</li>
            <li> My purchase experience was great. I received the product right on schedule as promised. Love the serum and how it makes my skin feel. I will definitely come back for more when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and seen no difference. I would not buy it again, I am trying something else.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change as yet.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 9 days and note NO difference. I am hopeful that it will diminish the small wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months,  I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference at first but have recently thought that my skin has a glow about it....a radiance that wasn&#x27;t there previously... I believe it is due to this product... I have used another vitamin C serum with a cost of $88 per ounce (the least expensive price that I have found for this brand name product) for a year or two now and have not seen the results with that product... I would highly recommend trying this serum but give it more than a week or two if you are a wee bit older? like myself (64).</li>
            <li> nothing special... disappointed</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it everyday &amp; feel like I am doing the right thing for my skin! My skin feels and looks so much better! The serum makes my face feel amazing.  This has become one of my favorite products. I&#x27;m addicted to this face serum. Goes on nice and smooth and absorbs very fast. This serum worked like a liquid time machine, or liquid fountain of youth. It makes my skin feel smooth when it dries. I&#x27;ve used this for one week and I must say it really works.</li>
            <li> Good product, fair price</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with it. Don&#x27;t think it has made me beautiful, but who knows what a few more months on it will do!  Face feels good anyway!</li>

            <li> So far, so good:  after only 2 weeks of using The Oz Code, there is a definite improvement in the texture of my skin.  The most notable&lt;br /&gt;difference, however, is that this serum seriously addresses the dryness of my skin; my face remains hydrated all day.  I particularly like&lt;br /&gt;that The Oz Code is absorbed immediately and takes only a few drops for overall application. If the improvements continue over time,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> I saw an older woman with beautiful flawless skin and I asked her what&#x27;s her secret. She told me Vitamin C serum. I purchased &amp;#34;the OZ code&amp;#34; because of the great reviews. I love to put this on at night before bed to get all the benefits. In the morning my skin looks smooth and soft. I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;the OZ code for about 2 weeks and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous serums on the market and The Oz Code has been the best by far!  I have only been using it daily for 2 weeks now and it has significantly lightened the pigmented spots on my face!  I can also feel a difference in the texture on my skin due to the hyaluronic acid which hydrates compared to other Vit C serums.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve facial lines and wrinkles.  It is amazing and tightens facial skin and wrinkles.  It is the best product I have used and I am very pleased with the results.  Thank you.  I also received my order in just two days, before the scheduled delivery date.</li>
            <li> I am still just using the product don&#x27;t really see the difference yet.  It does go on smooth and feels good, but no obvious results yet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product very long but so far I am very happy with it.  I appreciate the personal e-mails from Betty Hope.</li>
            <li> A good vitamin C serum is something that many of us are looking for. This one is good because it is honest and open about its ingredients. It takes someone who knows their own skin to care for it properly. If you know anything about skincare, you know that vitamins C and E are absolutely essential. For wrinkles and fine lines, it&#x27;s really the only thing that works. It&#x27;s by a credible brand, made in the USA, and in an FDA-certified facility, which makes any customer feel very confident in their product. It works wonders! I&#x27;m so tired of buying those over $100 products that claim to have vitamin C and E. I&#x27;m finally getting this one for myself!</li>
            <li> I got this serum to help lighten dark spots on my face and also to prevent wrinkles and fine lines.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have definitely noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. It looks much clearer and brighter and I am very happy with the results!  I will definitely be getting more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I love this product! First of all, it is totally natural and organic product, free of alcohol and parabens, which is a necessary condition for my cosmetics and second of all – it helps my skin better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. Plus, it is very easy to use and suitable for all types of skin.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to all who want to get rid of wrinkles in a natural and easy way.</li>
            <li> I am inclined to think the reviews on this product are dishonest ad fluff.  If you look, they&#x27;re all written within a day of each other...skipped a bit, the more written within another 2-day window. They all claim miracles, all rate 5 stars...I&#x27;m not buying it.  I took the bait and tried it...it&#x27;s nothing special and there are MUCH better, more reputable products out there for half the price.  I had no visible results and my face felt dry and tight.  At least I learned my lesson...study between the lines on reviews folks. Check dates, and if something seems to good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li> Recently I found out that even (and sometimes ESPECIALLY) if you use sunscreen your skin will still suffer from free radicles and all the damage they inflict.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best ways to reverse the damage is with serums like this. I bought this one as well as two others. I used each of them for three weeks straight and then switched.&lt;br /&gt;This was the best one hands down. I could definitely tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad  my search is over. I will never buy another brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just 3 weeks into using this, and my skin definitely looks great immediately after using. Feels nice on my skin. What surprised me the most is the sun damage I&#x27;ve had on my chest for 25 years seems to have improved. Great price, too....and arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Does brighten face. this is good to use topically because our capillaries deliver nutrients last to the face. Thus, little Vit. C is delivered via internally. There are other brands that are not as expensive that do just as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many serums, but this one is everything I wanted! Who needs to spend hundreds of dollars on expensive serums, when you can get The Oz Code for a fraction? It is truly the ultimate Wizard of OZ serum! They should send me a year supply just for saying this! I am worth it! I am 65, with a skin od a forty-year old woman and I love the feeling! KUDOS TO THE WIZARD!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, and although my face doesn&#x27;t appear less wrinkled and more youthful, it is softer and smoother feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have on exciting thing to share with you:  My energetic standard poodle pup scratched my face the other day, from cheek to chin.  He&#x27;s done it before and the scratch lasted days.  This time, I washed my face and quickly rubbed The OZ code on the scratch and you know what?  It didn&#x27;t turn red.  Within an hour the scratch was barely noticeable.  I put more on before going to bed and the next morning my cheek still felt sore but there were no visible marks.</li>
            <li> good under moisturizer.  soaks in quickly leaves skin smooth</li>
            <li> I really have not noticed much change in my skin, but I have only been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product works very good! In my opinion I think it&#x27;s best to do a good exfoliating scrub first and then apply product at night.</li>
