            <li>either lol.</li>
            <li>this is a great product that works fantastically for me.</li>
            <li>When I work out, I augment this deodorant with some Herban Cowboy (http://www.amazon.com/Herban-Cowboy-Deodorant-Maximum-Protection/dp/B004153MG4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418209560&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;herban+cowboy+deodorant) and it works great until I shower again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, I have noticed that I have practically no B.O.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really great for getting rid of body</li>
            <li>This stuff has been great though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t this these work that great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great because my shirts aren&#x27;t getting stained at the armpits anymore.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>THIS is not an attractive trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have slippery hands and can hang onto it without ever dropping it, great.  </li>
            <li>This was a great value, works well, was what I was looking for</li>
            <li>When this product was working it worked great.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s happy with it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy knowing that he is not putting chemicals in his body.  </li>
            <li>For the price this deodorant is a great value.  </li>
            <li>This is a very effective deodorant that does not have any fragrance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find the &amp;#34;Mens&amp;#34; version of this on Amazon at the best price I have seen in many years.</li>
            <li>After using it for about a month, I&#x27;m in shock on how amazing it is that I don&#x27;t smell BO from the underarms!  </li>
            <li>just perfect, healthy deodorant with out any danger chemicals</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  the Greatest safe Deodorant Stick</li>
            <li>The nice thing is that you may still use the pieces!  </li>
            <li>and it works perfect for me :)</li>
            <li>I tried this and from day one it worked great, it&#x27;s amazing just apply it after your shower</li>
            <li>If you read the comment by Arthur (below), he speaks some good sense.  </li>
            <li>and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be good for OVER a year because I got mine about a year ago</li>
            <li>I have nothing but good things to say about this product.</li>
            <li>Use this after your showers and you are good for 24hr min.</li>
            <li>but that is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>I think using Crystal requires a good routine because I can never tell if I&#x27;m covered (no scent to clue you in)</li>
            <li>As others have stated, this product works surprisingly well, however it is a bit misleading.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for years; i think it is the best product available.</li>
            <li>I have used Crystal deodorant for about 7 years now and have always loved it.  </li>
            <li>One of my sons even attended a concert and came home very impressed with being stink free...</li>
            <li>I heard some good things about this stuff, and like that it doesn&#x27;t have any Aluminum Chlorohydrate, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The container isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>Loving it and no smell whatsoever, its great.</li>
            <li>I have armpits that require alot of protection, this sounded good.</li>
            <li>this good for me?&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>and it is good....</li>
            <li>I feel good that it does not have any of the harmful chemicals that store brands have.  </li>
            <li>I feel good that it does not have any of the harmful chemicals that store brands have.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff at a good price.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it in search of the perfect unscented deodorant not to mention it looked like a unique and inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super awesome...</li>
            <li>This works Perfectly fine!!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m using Nasanta Magnesium Deodorant and it works great, lasts all day (and more), is unscented, and doesn&#x27;t leave me paranoid about body</li>
            <li>If you have severe BO, this might not work for you, but I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this works amazing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more than happy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The best time to apply it is when you are right out of the shower and your body is still damp.  </li>
            <li>find that it works best when applied right after a shower.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>what is not to love!</li>
            <li>The packaging is very nice and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Simply amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent and truly amazing product, would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Kind of wierd to use, takes time to get use to it</li>
            <li>The reason is that moisture is needed for an effective application.</li>
            <li>Do your own research before buying.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say it works well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the difference between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s kind?</li>
            <li>I tried this after making my own for about a year.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>This product has worked perfectly for her never having an issue, and that my friends is a modern miracle.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t do anything except absorb the smell of your pits so that it reapplies your own BO over and over.</li>
            <li>I think this stuff is going to kind of vary case to case.</li>
            <li>Odor controlled without a perfume smell - nice.</li>
            <li>I even got my husband his own and it is working for him.  </li>
            <li>I have used this stick for over a year and it is still effective for even a couple of sweaty days at work.</li>
            <li>Write your own review if you believe otherwise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m ready to call this the best value in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I keep that &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; in a plastic bag and take it with me on vacation; my own travel size deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to just not have any odor to deal with.</li>
            <li>Since my wife uses Downey fabric softener when she washes, my t-shirts have a nice fragrance to them.  </li>
            <li>I first bought the Body Spray, but the spray/pump was too positionally sensitive &amp; must be held perfectly upright - not the best design, but I&#x27;d the product &amp;</li>
            <li>and I find it as effective or even more effective than the popular deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Takes getting use to since it has to be &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; to put it on, but it drys quickly &amp; works great just like the Crystal Rock Body Spray - -</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it knowing it is natural and doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in it!</li>
            <li>and it looks like it has many more months of use!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing stuff I have ever come across.</li>
            <li>If I can use this, most people will be thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Awesome, natural alternative.</li>
            <li>I find it best to not wipe under my arms after applying and let the water absorb/evaporate naturally so that the salt crystals aren&#x27;t wiped</li>
            <li>As far as I know, your body needs to perspire anyway, of course you don&#x27;t need to stink while doing it, so it is best to stick to deodorant anyway.  </li>
            <li>Works great, feels great and doesnt leave white on my clothing</li>
            <li>This is a great product that does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>work better than others on me, but I&#x27;ve never been overly impressed, even if initial application goes on well and smells nice.</li>
            <li>use chemical anymore, try this fine product!</li>
            <li>product is excellent and works beautifully to prevent odor no matter how intense the workout or the emotional experience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great natural and safe alternative!</li>
            <li>sure you apply it correctly</li>
            <li>Works well, but must be reapplied much more often than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>This is very possibly the best deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I kept moving it around and around and around to be SURE it was going on.  </li>
            <li>Also, does not irritate my underarms as many did.</li>
            <li>Now, using the Potassium Alum version, I&#x27;m getting much better results in the form of longer-lasting odor protection (though still NOT as long-lasting as a chemical deodorant).  </li>
            <li>I judged between the reviews and realized most people like the crystal deodorant more, so I gave it a shot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most deodorants</li>
            <li>And most importantly, Amazon&#x27;s price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>It is ok.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with deodorants for many years because of sensitivity to the ingredients which leads to swelling and itching of the armpits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The truth of the matter is people want to believe this works much better than it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The truth of the matter is people want to believe this works much better than it does.</li>
            <li>of water or more.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t how this works for others because it sure doesn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t resist the sweat to escape rather it absorbs the toxic particles of your sweat to make a better aroma.</li>
            <li>I rub it around my pit a lot more than the one or two swipes</li>
            <li>I love the fact i wont apply any chemical product on my body.</li>
            <li>This works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It also happens to be the most practical deodorant you can buy considering a stick</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about three months now and I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>You are ok with using Potassium Alum.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I am OK with my armpits sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You are ok with using Potassium Alum.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I choose to use it because I rather use one ingredient than many</li>
            <li>I found it easier to study one ingredient, Potassium Alum, and feel safe using it.  </li>
            <li>When I apply I do more than three swipes.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get all around your armpit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put the top on and put it on my shelf.  </li>
            <li>When I apply I do more than three swipes.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get all around your armpit.</li>
            <li>Once I am done I put the top on and put it on my shelf.  </li>
            <li>My armpits have never been more odorless.</li>
            <li>It works better than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>actually was quite impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>and I might be erring on more coverage than I need</li>
            <li>What more can I say?&lt;br</li>
            <li>What more do I have to say?  </li>
            <li>Works better than nothing, which is what I wanted since my armpits seem allergic to everything.</li>
            <li>I have used the crystal deodorant for more than 2 years with no problems.</li>
            <li>Does not work as well as antiperspirants at preventing unwanted smell but works much better than not using it.</li>
            <li>sure...</li>
            <li>synthesized salt is safe to use.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, and will certainly last year or longer.</li>
            <li>Most of the time no odor.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for more than 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;Will.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a healthy alternative to deodorant.  </li>
            <li>This makes for a better deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It for sure works.</li>
            <li>* Need to reapply more often (lasts 9-5 but need to apply again in the evening for me)</li>
            <li>A healthy alternative.  </li>
            <li>It works and better yet it does not have any overwhelming perfume, doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts, and makes breakfast in the morning for me.</li>
            <li>, There are better products in the market.</li>
            <li>unless you like that sorta thing :)</li>
            <li>Works well if you wash or shower each day or more often.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a deodorant that will work all day</li>
            <li>Works ok on days without strenuous exercise.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.   </li>
            <li>I rub it around my pit a lot more than the one or two swipes</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>and I have always had irritation with most deodorants/anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li>I do not think that anything that goops and gobs  to absorb sweat or stops you from perspiring is healthy for your body.  </li>
            <li>I now buy it online sine most stores o not carry it.</li>
            <li>Most of them adopted this product and one or two told me that it didn&#x27;t work well for them.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product lasts for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this forever unless something better arrives.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works well, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet, as most others have done.</li>
            <li>No smelly pits, and no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my salt stick for over 8 months now and love it.</li>
            <li>One stick lasts more that a year.  </li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works great.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t bother me any more however.</li>
            <li>I was glad that I tried it out.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great purchase and I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Just be gentle with it when applying, and hopefully you can avoid the housing issues I experienced.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I think the stick works better though.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff ..</li>
            <li>I like that way better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirants, many deodorants &amp; soaps, but I don&#x27;t react to this product at all.</li>
            <li>An interesting point-</li>
            <li>I love crystal deodarants and have used them for probably 15 or more years.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>This works ok</li>
            <li>Works well, no smell, no horrible additives.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s used to the types that are scented and &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; more substantial.  </li>
            <li>He likes that format much better.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Works great for the whole day.</li>
            <li>I love using rock/crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li>but it is still better than the clothes staining.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even noticed that if l forget it, I&#x27;m still safe.</li>
            <li>perhaps I&#x27;m applying more liberally than most?</li>
            <li>No &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; me with this product.......and, safe to use.  </li>
            <li>Really, this is a great product, and if you don&#x27;t mind that you will sweat but not stink, this is for you.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is safe, and does the job.  </li>
            <li>, glad it was here on Amazon</li>
            <li>that makes me smell like a flower and their ad campaigns promise to make you smell like alpha-males. :)</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Sure, a crystal?</li>
            <li>It basically was, well, a smooth &#x27;rock&#x27; vs. a nice twisty applicator.</li>
            <li>In fact - and I can&#x27;t verify this - it seemed the more fragrance-y coverup products I used, the stronger my &#x27;stank&#x27; got.</li>
            <li>Crystal Body Deodorant Stick WORKS EVEN BETTER to control odor.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I also have a bit of a sensitivity to many deodorants.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Which means that unless you&#x27;re using distilled or RO water, the water you put on the crystal will hurt you more than the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought this .</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Does a better job of stopping wetness than those without aluminum.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, better than Mitchum.</li>
            <li>, if you are the type who likes a scent on your deodorant, use this product and then spray some Axe or something like that on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I like the none screw up version much better because the screw up crank will break and become brittle.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, apply it right after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Very economical !</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Your underarms need to be very clean, and they need to not smell when you apply this stick.  </li>
            <li>So, I conclude that this is great for a normal, non sweaty day, but I wouldnt trust it during a workout.    </li>
            <li>This works great for normal use.  </li>
            <li>The first two times it worked good.</li>
            <li>As of now, the product is pretty good for what it does.</li>
            <li>I work an outdoor job in the heat, and even at that it provided pretty good odour protection.  </li>
            <li>Way better than reeking of BO or reeking of strongly scented deodorant.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to apply, is perfect for people with sensitive skin, and does not leave any residue/stickiness.</li>
            <li>Do a quick Google search for ammonium alum, along with a search for the ingredient list in this deodorant, and make your own judgment.</li>
            <li>It is super effective if you maitain a reduced level of hair under your arm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this a few days now, honestly this is the best working deodorant I&#x27;ve come across, this is how any deodorant should be hence the word De-Odorizer.</li>
            <li>This product is a very effective deodorant even in the heat and humidity of the Dominican Republic where I live.  </li>
            <li>I kind of wish this deodorant had some kind of scent to it, for maybe it would help my particular case, but I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I have emailed the manufacturer about once a year for five years, pleading with them to secure the crystal to the bottom inside of the container with better adhesive.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s intention is to be a deodorant, not an antiperspirant to reduce sweat, it greatly helps to eliminate odor by using all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>There is no smell whatsoever and so far works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, which is great.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even sure if it got applied the first time to be honest.</li>
            <li>First deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever been able to effectively use.</li>
            <li>I found that for me it works best if I coat the body side of my armpit only and go over about 3-4 times with mild pressure.</li>
            <li>and I can not say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>It is as good as or better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, plus it&#x27;s natural and a lot milder than anything else.    </li>
            <li>Very mild, I haven&#x27;t had any sort of reaction to it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to drop - if it falls, the salt crystal shatters.</li>
            <li>: Make sure you are completely clean before applying.</li>
            <li>It is as good as or better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, plus it&#x27;s natural and a lot milder than anything</li>
            <li>Very mild, I haven&#x27;t had any sort of reaction to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy to break it when you drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I used to get about 3 wearing out of them easy with anti-perspirant, now 3 is pushing it.  </li>
            <li>I have even discovered that since I no longer am concerned with rashes or goofy smells, I can apply it to help combat odors elsewhere on my body such as my crotch and soles of my feet to great</li>
            <li>The cons to this product are that it easily comes out of it&#x27;s container.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy.</li>
            <li>THE CHAIN IS A STRONG AS THE WEAKEST LINK  </li>
            <li>Some reviewers have said it&#x27;s not that great, but to make this product effective, you MUST apply it to wet skin and not just where the hair in the armpit is.</li>
            <li>There is some strong evidence of a link -- for instance, in 1988, a truck driver accidentally dumped 20 tons of aluminum sulfate in to a town&#x27;s drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy to say that I am now free of plugging my pores and spreading Aluminum and other toxic chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>love it.. and no bad chemicals</li>
            <li>This product works fine.</li>
            <li>Is not irritating, is a great deodorant but be aware -</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine as a deodorant but has irritated my skin after two uses.  </li>
            <li>As deodorants go this one has not smell which is fine</li>
            <li>They work fine, but I drop them and then lose valuable deodorant to the bathroom tile as corners of the blocks would chip off and disintegrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For winter, this product was fine.  </li>
            <li>The cheap plastic container the salt rock is in was cracked when I got it, but it still works fine.    </li>
            <li>For best results, put on the product and dry with a hair dryer right after to seal in the salts.</li>
            <li>think it is best when put on right out of the shower and applied before you are completely dry</li>
            <li>For best performance, I suggest running a little water over the end of the stick while tilting the stick downward as to not wash away the rest of the stick.</li>
            <li>a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great solid form of the spray.</li>
            <li>These 2 products are fantastic and I am going to be a customer for life.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>, my husband is allergic to aluminum in regular deodorant so this is great for him too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not a miracle 48 hour odor free product, but it won&#x27;t fill your underarms with chemicals.</li>
            <li>I always have two containers available in case</li>
            <li>This type of mineral deodorant does a great job at battling the various odors that can develop during the day.</li>
            <li>Both say it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I found that if one end gets cracked, or has ridges, just use it lightly; and over time it will get smooth again.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Stick deodorant.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy smelling like myself, not</li>
            <li>But the second day I was happy.</li>
            <li>Your body is supposed to sweat, so this allows it to do so freely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, it works, and it gives you bragging rights.</li>
            <li>This does have alum in it, so if you do want aluminum free, you should look for an organic stick.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not a scent I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t mind that its fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Twice, the deodorant mineral stick fell out of the cheaply designed plastic dispenser, both times it hit the sink and shattered.  </li>
            <li>Add on to it that this &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; should last a year, and you&#x27;ve got a great product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>because although it seemed to work decently for that month, I don&#x27;t think he liked the way it was designed (too easy to break, could be slippery when grabbing after a shower).</li>
            <li>and I thought that I smelled better than when I use nothing but not as good as a standard deodorant.</li>
            <li>I think the original packaging would be just fine.</li>
            <li>For me the secrets to successful use were: apply immediately after a shower (as soon as I was dried-off); moisten the stone sufficiently so that it really glides on your full under-arm areas; and then of course wear clean fresh clothing afterward.</li>
            <li>followed the instructions and made sure to put it on right after taking a shower.</li>
            <li>AND it seems to be a better anti-perspirant than right guard spray that I have been using for 30 years.</li>
            <li>Much better than deodorant if you have the right body chemistry for it.</li>
            <li>Also this Deodorant seems to last forever, So not only is it more effective, and healthier, but also more cost effective!</li>
            <li>This product really really REALLY works!!!</li>
            <li>It is very economical: one stick lasts a year or two.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, and I was very sceptical, but it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>(I think I&#x27;m at almost a year on my first stick) and most importantly, it WORKS.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After working for years at a major consumer packaged good company with a famous and market leading deoderant/antiperspirant brand that can be found on every drugstore/supermarket store, I became aware firsthand of the chemicals used in those products their toxicity to the body.  </li>
            <li>It works as it should maybe not as strong as those deodorants with all the chemicals, but good enough.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s do to the changes of my work, but I can not find a way to keep this working more consistently for me throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It works very well! :)</li>
            <li>I originally paired this with Sweat Block, which I applied once every week (with a couple of Benadryl...).</li>
            <li>It worked like magic -- I could consistently put it on every day and neither I nor my fiancée noticed any rancid stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am on the original stick still.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great for me, has no perfume or scent, doesn&#x27;t leave any stains or marks like &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorants and antiperspirants do, and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>I smell fine, but they shirts don&#x27;t have the salt on them(of course) and seem to grow bacteria fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure for some people this is ideal, for me, I am left looking for another natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>My wife says I don&#x27;t have significant BO.</li>
            <li>I have not minded the original &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This works great and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Ensure your underarms are clean.   </li>
            <li>As all our lifestyles are all different, it is up to you to find the most effective way or day of the time to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the aluminum compounds in antiperspirants, the phthalates in the fragrance of deodorants, and the persistent residue always left by the products I found most effective.  </li>
            <li>It dries clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do not think I will ever go back to the most popular deo again</li>
            <li>Since the Crystals block the bateria that develops from the mosture that interfaces with the hair under the armpits, when you cut the hair back, it makes the salts more effective.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of water on the surface, and it glides right on and works perfectly all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I have used Crystal Body Deodorant stick for many years &amp; they last a really long time!  </li>
            <li>This Will be my deodorant for when I do not need to smell special like sports etc.</li>
            <li>It takes care of the stank and truely fights bacteria without any harmful chemicals.    </li>
            <li>Be generous and be sure to cover the whole area.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I purchased one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>My natural deodorant of choice worked moderately well, but I decided to search for something better and I&#x27;d heard great things about mineral deodorants.</li>
            <li>That boy&#x27;s pits could muster up a stank that could choke out a full grown moose without deodorant.</li>
            <li>, this one seems to be good for two days every with tub or shower daily.</li>
            <li>so it is much healthier than the chemical laden deoderants most people use.</li>
            <li>However, my job isn&#x27;t very physically demanding although I do have to move around a fair amount during the day.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is cool.</li>
            <li>the same deodorant stick for a year is a good thing.</li>
            <li>This is all natural salts and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>As I am an office desk worker most of the time, it works very well for me.    </li>
            <li>I bought this as a trial-as I wasn&#x27;t sure it would really work.  </li>
            <li>but he said he still needs a true deodorant.</li>
            <li>I work full time in sales and do a lot of DIY.</li>
            <li>We gave it a good try for a week and finally had to toss.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try a deodorant that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Also, Young Living sells good natural deodorant as well, but you need a referral to buy from them and they are more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The full chemical name of potassium alum is potassium aluminum sulfate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With store bought brands, they are so full of scents that any underarm smell you have goes away immediately after application.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s all natural and a cool shaped rock</li>
            <li>so far, great product (after 2 weeks use - we&#x27;ll see if it really lasts a year ;) )</li>
            <li>my only issue is... it should have a textured dispenser, cause it works best when you apply it to a wet armpit, but it easily slips out of your hands.</li>
            <li>In my case, this is a great alternative to the chemicals in the more common mass market products.  </li>
            <li>bought this very hesitantly but was happy to find it actually works.</li>
            <li>I have found if I moisten the crystal before I use it that it glides on and the moisture dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>There have been some sticks that caused a mild to severe reaction, but not with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>super product.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is nice because it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, and is good on sensitive or irritated skin, but it just doesn&#x27;t keep my dry, even in cooler weather.</li>
            <li>Considering it lasts for a year, that is a tremendous value.</li>
            <li>Need to apply for a while to get adequate protection.</li>
            <li>I make 40-60 quick strokes over each underarm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not disappearing quickly and I&#x27;ve used it for a year.</li>
            <li>Gave up on it and got the Gilette clear gel that works wonders and is dispensed very easily.</li>
            <li>I commute into Manhattan, and the commute can get you very hot and sweaty</li>
            <li>Hoped these would be a suitable replacement -- not so far.</li>
            <li>Excellent deodorant due to its totally natural content.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat a lot anyway, unless I am working out or very hot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months, but many say it can last well over a year, which is a great value.</li>
            <li>After making significant changes in the way I eat (eating more natural)</li>
            <li>but I have found that I sweat less with this product and the smell of my perspiration has been greatly reduced as well.  </li>
            <li>Thought it was a bit odd and would never work, but works great.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and works better than the many deodorants that I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this seller and this product highly!!!</li>
            <li>it has to be a lot cheaper than regular sticks because I bought another one and it must be more than eight months!</li>
            <li>I make is a point to keep my under arm hair short rather than maintaining a manly bush that doesn&#x27;t impress my wife and trust me, your wife and or girlfriend did not fall in love with you because of the amount of hair you have under your arms!</li>
            <li>so for me, one morning application lasts the whole day just fine.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really create a smooth &amp;#34;after feel&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have heard that some people have more alum-resistant body flora, but for me, this is a clear winner.</li>
            <li>and it is simple and effective to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the negatives, for me, not just for that, but for the fact that I no longer suffer from any irritation or \\&quot;itching\\&quot; under the arms from chemical anti-perspirants.  </li>
            <li>but so far it works great and keeps odor away for the entire day for me with one application.</li>
            <li>have come up with my own way of using it that is a bit different than the instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw Crystal Body Deodorant here on Amazon and decided it would be worth the price to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>But now that i know he feels fresh a daisy</li>
            <li>I think it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I put it on immediately after showering and rarely have a problem.  </li>
            <li>I rarely even sweat, but if I do, it never smells.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>If you have hair under your arms, you probably will better off with the gel version of this product because the stone isn&#x27;t rubbing directly against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is on the more sensitive side</li>
            <li>Worth a try in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most people who have found this product, I have tended to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I suggested my wife try mine as she has used everything know to man and women without much success.</li>
            <li>I then thought this would be a good test, so I wet it, put it on, and waited.  </li>
            <li>I started getting a rash with the popular deodorants and finally tried this.  </li>
            <li>I have seen broken cases before but this one was perfect.</li>
            <li>Love the natural aspect of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I liked the concept of a natural salt deodorant, but my husband very reluctantly used it.  </li>
            <li>We have, however, been trying the salt spray on deodorant by Naturally Fresh.</li>
            <li>After using this kind of deodorant, I will not go back to the regular kind.</li>
            <li>On days I don&#x27;t shower I just get it wet under the faucet, it works just as good.</li>
            <li>During that transition time between walking in and taking off my layers, I sweat buckets, and it&#x27;s kind of gross to see my shirts.</li>
            <li>In my personal opinion on this product, in my own review, I believe it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product lasts forever and is all natural.</li>
            <li>Nice change from traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li>This stuff has no scent and keeps me minty fresh all day.</li>
            <li>But, just to be clear for most of you.  </li>
            <li>That fact alone makes it 100% worth it to me.tore brands but lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>That fact alone makes it 100% worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Sweating is natural and should not be blocked like most deodorants say they do.</li>
            <li>After doing some research online, I came to the conclusion that Crystal would not ruin my shirts, and it is more of a natural product because it is basically just a composition of minerals.  </li>
            <li>So far I love it.  </li>
            <li>Paid a very reasonable price for this product and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The price is fine and it looks like it will last for a long time so the price is actually great.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it completely eliminates it!</li>
            <li>other reviewers have said though, I have found the key to getting it to work the best is to apply it immediately after a shower.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Right after applying, you can notice a decrease in BO.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t smell for a while if you use this right when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I apply this product right after the shower</li>
            <li>I did put it on right after a shower each morning</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on when right after my shower in the morning before drying off.</li>
            <li>I normally apply it right after I get out of the shower in the morning, so it&#x27;s perfectly fine with me.</li>
            <li>I noticed I smelled less than pleasant.  </li>
            <li>gave this a shot for about a couple of months, as I like to try new things every now and then, especially if they have a fair amount of positive feedback, and I like products that are on the more natural side.</li>
            <li>I read such positive reviews so this sounded amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing how long they would have lasted if they worked for me.</li>
            <li>Works great no stains Need to use it as directed doesn&#x27;t work like an ordinary deorodant.</li>
            <li>If it takes a whole year to actually finish the stick/rock as others have said, then I can qualify this purchase as the best money I have spent..   </li>
            <li>main problem is that the more you sweat the more your pores are open to absorbing whatever chemicals you use.</li>
            <li>I try to get ready relatively quick.</li>
            <li>After using regular deoderants my whole life, going over to this from Crystal is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I honest to goodness shaved my pits as a final ditch effort and it really made no difference.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and lasts far longer than one year, if you don&#x27;t drop it.  </li>
            <li>Success depends on your personal biology, I&#x27;m sure some people have resistant strains of bacteria and this just won&#x27;t work for some.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I initially thought that this was great, but then I discovered that I don&#x27;t generally *need that much anti-perspirant / deodorizer in the first place, and</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re allergic to normal deodorants or just wanna use a safe and all natural deodorant order this!</li>
            <li>product works fine; no stinging or rash so far (1 week).</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, lasts a really long time</li>
            <li>So after taking a good shower you apply it (wetting the rock a little and liberally spreading it across your under arms)</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that even if it takes a second application on the hottest days it will be better than the chemical deodorants.</li>
            <li>if the plastic container was designed better than it wouldn&#x27;t be such a problem.</li>
            <li>First time user</li>
            <li>First, let me say, it does not work as well as chemical deodorants.  </li>
            <li>So, be forewarned, if you&#x27;re expecting it to perform exactly like your chemical deodorant that you are giving up, it won&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li>Not a deal breaker, but be aware.    </li>
            <li>So, my advice to you is to find this stuff at a local pharmacy, and make sure it&#x27;s the Potassium Alum version.  </li>
            <li>Never apply it without first taking a shower.</li>
            <li>Most deodorants you have to apply daily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty suspicious guy</li>
            <li>I guess the advantage is that it provides more applications than regular stick deoderant.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that I am on a Ketogenic Diet.</li>
            <li>My bag is often thrown in the trunk of my car, where it gets hot.</li>
            <li>My brother had horrid knots under his arms from regular deoderant because of the aluminum content - he was extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>When you first start using this.</li>
            <li>My daughter dropped it and the container cracked the first day too.</li>
            <li>Do be aware though that this is a deodorant not and anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>If you are OK with the five things above I think you will like the product.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any reason to disbelieve what others have said about it lasting more than a year.</li>
            <li>Not that great, the stick broke after 2 or 3 weeks use, and it does not last all day long.</li>
            <li>so I can use all the gifted colognes I&#x27;ve received in the last couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first crystal, I used off and on over the course of a year.  </li>
            <li>but I have to apply more often than regular deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I am willing to trade in extra two minutes for better health</li>
            <li>After many years of regular antiperspirants became quite allergic to them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how much it costs now, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Stuck in hot humid airports.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used urban cowboy and toms of Maine and this is way better.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have recommended this product to many of my friends who had similar issues.</li>
            <li>The crystal is not held in the case with a lot of force, so as you shake the water off, you might shake the crystal out of the tube, and when it hits the ground it will most likely shatter.</li>
            <li>This happened to me with my first stick, and I had to order another one.    </li>
            <li>I have tried many different roll-on and spray products and always got a rash on my armpits.  </li>
            <li>Works really well and has no scent!</li>
            <li>Ok, this is the third time I use</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands &amp; types of deodorants to find one that does not irritate my arm pits.</li>
            <li>First off it is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>I only use it when I want to be sure I won&#x27;t stain my shirt.</li>
            <li>Also, if I am sweating for more than an hour, my body odor starts to come back.  </li>
            <li>most currently marketed US products (compounds of the ?propylene glycol and aluminum/zirconium ?</li>
            <li>I tried to apply more because I thought maybe I just wasn&#x27;t using enough.</li>
            <li>and I would just run water over them first</li>
            <li>After walking in the hot sun</li>
            <li>The first deodorant that I have used that didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>It works for me even in hot, humid weather.  </li>
            <li>THANKS CRYSTAL BRAND!</li>
            <li>I only need it once per day unless I shower more thanonce that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At the first drop, the lid and turning dial broke.</li>
            <li>and im still on my first one since jan 2014.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well to fight odor but not wetness.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural deodorant and it was so cheap</li>
            <li>First stick it under the water in the sink.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for everyone in the family and it work for the first month.  </li>
            <li>As long as it is applied properly, works great.</li>
            <li>My first thought was &#x27;These guys haven&#x27;t smelled</li>
            <li>When I first received my crystal deodorant I applied it as directed and went to the gym.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s simply salt and nothing more.</li>
            <li>First off, I barley feel like it is even there.</li>
            <li>Get the THAI stone of $1 more, i thought this should work the same</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason that most people try to avoid aluminum in deodorant is because of its possible link to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</li>
            <li>First deodorant my husband has found that works to control odor and does NOT irraratate his arm pits.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first thing I will say is after a couple decades of using a &amp;#34;sport gel&amp;#34; deodorant, this one took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>package but this one is better priced for the same contents.</li>
            <li>I never realized these very powerful natural odor neutralizers existed.</li>
            <li>You are a clean person that showers daily and uses soap to clean your body</li>
            <li>You are a clean person that showers daily and uses soap to clean your body/</li>
            <li>(and he&#x27;s super into Cross Fit).</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant experience in this day and age to buy something that has lasting value and does not have to be thrown away after a short period of use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also fits in the traditional spot on my Ogio locker bag pouch, which was another pleasant surprise as I do not need a second travel size</li>
            <li>It can be hard to believe that something like this is very effective until you try it.</li>
            <li>I live in South Florida (a true testing ground for any deoderant) and this stuff holds up all day.  </li>
            <li>My hubby even chose to switch over from conventional deodorant and it works better than ANYTHING else he&#x27;d ever tried (and he&#x27;s tried &#x27;em all!)</li>
            <li>Such a simple solution, but by far the most effective.  </li>
            <li>Doctor since I was getting a rash from every other kind of deodorant.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t really care about the different chemicals that are in most deodorant sticks.</li>
            <li>I was getting armpit stains from wearing the Old Spice and wanted something more natural</li>
            <li>It really does last a year or more.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this, I put it on right after a shower and then went golfing in the high heat (95F).  </li>
            <li>After over several months that reached well into the Rocky Mountain summer of using only it once a day immediately after an early morning shower, the answer to that for me was a surprising “Yes it certainly does, quite effectively, when properly used.”</li>
            <li>This product might have a high rating, but you have to consider the kind of people who go for this product - this is more a selective group and not really a representation of the public at large, despite being on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to me that a product like this, which seems to be the most natural and hence least harmful of any of them, works so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine in addition to many other types without success.     </li>
            <li>so I do not have much body odor in the first place</li>
            <li>It really works in these hot and humid summer days.</li>
            <li>After many years of using the typical \\&quot;speed stick\\&quot; deodorant, I would get a mild rash or burning in my armpit area.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it and would highly recommend it.    </li>
            <li>I now leave the top off of this stick so it can dry between uses.  </li>
            <li>Fragile and tends to easily slip out of plastic holder after a month or so.</li>
            <li>So nice not to be using chemicals, one less thing to worry about exposing your body to.</li>
            <li>I used to be brand loyal to Old Spice antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>it runs out too quick, yeah its natural, but i would wear this to sleep rather then go out in a night of clubbing.</li>
            <li>Maybe this isn&#x27;t necessary, but I tend to smell easily</li>
            <li>Good long lasting odor control   3)</li>
            <li>This one in particular is nice because I have broken more blocks than I have finished</li>
            <li>Made from a certain type of mineral salts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>It certainly could not hurt to avoid them.</li>
            <li>However, that was after more than a year of daily use, and I&#x27;m promptly replacing it with a new one, so I&#x27;m still giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li>If you shower at night and want to reapply in the morning, use some wet wipes or a clean, damp wash cloth to clean your arm pits again before you reapply.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>/&gt;Brands get away with it because there in minimal regulation on ingredients used in their products and the chemicals they use are super cheap for them to buy.  </li>
            <li>Works best if applied right after showering to wet armpits, or wet the crystal, and give it a good 10-12 up and down strokes, then dry completely with a hair dryer (or by flapping your arms, which takes forever)!  </li>
            <li>But short of a using this on a commute from hell, this works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Personally I can use this during the summer just fine.  </li>
            <li>Either way, works just as well as any other deodorant without the strong fragrantly smell!</li>
            <li>this, I put it directly on clean, wet skin (right out of the shower before toweling off) and it works wonders!</li>
            <li>My wife said that she can notice a huge difference and has actually thought about switching herself.</li>
            <li>I received the product fast.</li>
            <li>I stopped using deodorant after I got an infection in my armpit because normal deodorant seemed to irritate it and after reading up on normal deodorants I found many articles about the potentially harmful chemicals found in them.</li>
            <li>This really works and has no odor at all.</li>
            <li>the whole cylinder of salt fell out and shattered on the floor.</li>
            <li>Very misleading.  </li>
            <li>This really works though, and as one sweaty man to another</li>
            <li>This deodorant has worked very well for me for years now.</li>
            <li>this way it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>My thanks to the manufacturer for bringing this to market.</li>
            <li>It burns my armpits but for his furry versions, it works really well.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>(Yes, they still have anti-perspirant gels, but they used to have a straight deodorant gel too.)  </li>
            <li>This Crystal Body Deodorant really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really sweat much either.  </li>
            <li>I still sweat just as much as before but there is no odor.</li>
            <li>find the crystal deodorant works very well.  </li>
            <li>But if you shower every day anyway, or you&#x27;re planning on leaving the country for an extended period of time, really consider this product.</li>
            <li>I never knew I could sweat so much while simultaneously smelling like nothing.</li>
            <li>For me, it also keeps me from sweating as much.  </li>
            <li>but it is really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Even though it says that there is no Aluminum in this product there absolutely is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think so.&amp;#34; But really... think so.</li>
            <li>Very prompt service.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to wet it before use.</li>
            <li>You have to wet it to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>This is like really wearing nothing at all.  </li>
            <li>I use the crystal daily and it works to keep me odor free.  </li>
            <li>I would never have believed it but it really works to cancel odors.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Wet the top of the stick and re-wet it to apply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>how much I put</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wet the crystal before you apply it.</li>
            <li>Really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li>(Yes, they still have anti-perspirant gels, but they used to have a straight deodorant gel too.)</li>
            <li>This Crystal Body Deodorant really does the trick.</li>
            <li>weeks, no matter how much I try to bathe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would probably be ok to share an almost empty one but rinse it well before you do.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really does prevent any odor.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t deteriorated much at all.</li>
            <li>Really itchy armpits.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li>The real test will be when it comes to summer as that is the height of BO season.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried one of these crystals before, you really should consider it.</li>
            <li>I use this after my morning shower, and I&#x27;ll go with no odor the whole day.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to use compared to the crystal I have used before that was not in a package like this.</li>
            <li>I really wonted to like the Crystal Body Deodorant Stick to work.</li>
            <li>It really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t really care what color the package is.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>To him it didn&#x27;t seem like a salt rock was doing much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, the label says &amp;#34;For Men&amp;#34; and has some shirtless muscular dude flexing on the label to convince you how manly it is or something, but let&#x27;s be real...</li>
            <li>If I haven&#x27;t worked out or sweated much you might go two days, but I tend to use it</li>
            <li>crystal doesn&#x27;t really work to kill existing odor.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>And after all that effort, it really doesn&#x27;t work; not even close.  </li>
            <li>I know it says it&#x27;s for men, but it should say &amp;#34;For REAL men.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>After that it stopped working for us, it started burning the under arm to much.  </li>
            <li>, I really wanted to stick with the rock.  </li>
            <li>Wipe it around the whole area.</li>
            <li>My son LOVES this deodorant...and it really works...even in sweaty sports situations.  </li>
            <li>it is highly recommended!</li>
            <li>When I think about how much money I used to spend on some pricey P&amp;G product often, I cringe.</li>
            <li>And, for that reason, I&#x27;ve relegated it to the medicine cabinet where it will serve me well for the occasions I run out of real, unnatural, dependable deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive too.</li>
            <li>I switched over to powdered deodorant which no longer stained my shirts or irritated my armpits but none of the ones I tried did much to mask my odor</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Is chemical deodorant REALLY that</li>
            <li>is why it worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I tried this and really, really wanted it to be a replacement for my Anti-Persperant Deoderant stick.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>no white residue oderles havent had to put more during the day really relieved with the idea of no harsh chemicals on my armpits anymore</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one of those people who have switched from the standard mainstream stuff, going to more natural based products tend to have a bit of an adjustment curve.</li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to some ingredient in most deodorants and antiperspirants several years ago.</li>
            <li>Definitely works better than my old one.</li>
            <li>no small at all!!</li>
            <li>and I do not want my deodorant to smell different than my cologne if I choose to wear cologne, which I very rarely choose to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could just nurse it along, but it is just a dang salt stick and not expensive, so at that point I toss it and order a new one.  </li>
            <li>It just pops right out if you tilt it too far.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper and better for you than all that other smelly stuff.</li>
            <li>This same brand has other good deodorants that are easier to apply, including wipes and roll-ons.</li>
            <li>Natural, odorant free, safe and long lasting!</li>
            <li>If highly active or on super hot days, this product may not be 100% effective at keeping body odor stink at bay, but on 95% of the days, I have had absolutely no problem.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;ll take some getting used to - most of my other deodorants (not</li>
            <li>first thing I used was hand sanitizer, and sure enough, I finally found the relief I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I still have the original stick and have only had to increase the height by 1 click.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any other deodorant that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting my husband one of these when his normal stuff is gone!</li>
            <li>Until now, I thought the 5-day deodorant pads worked better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I started using it 15 years ago in an effort to avoid aluminum and found it works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>No complaints from family, friends or coworkers regarding the efficacy of the product, and they would not hesitate to tell someone to clean up their act when necessary.</li>
            <li>But not with this salt crystal deodorant; I can be as active and confident in my activities as when wearing non-natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Label states that it should only be used on clean skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works fine, and lasts a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a solid job preventing odor and goes on clean.  </li>
            <li>You also might have to apply it about 2-3 times a day, but this is depending on many factors such as diet, activity, general body chemistry, etc., etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do about 12 to 15 full up and full down swipes per armpit.</li>
            <li>I do about 12 to 15 full up and full down swipes per armpit.</li>
            <li>everything went well, complete and fully functional thank you very much ..... was a pleasure doing business with you .....&lt;</li>
            <li>I have tried all the natural, no scent, easy on the skin products, and this was one of the only ones I found that worked.</li>
            <li>By late evening, I notice that I may sometimes begin to develop a slight odor, but it does an excellent job of protection all day.</li>
            <li>I mean that the most popular deodorants (Old Spice, even Dove) will make me break out in a red, smelly rash for days, sometimes</li>
            <li>I am fortunate enough to live a particularly stress-free life.</li>
            <li>The one downside - the effects will not last a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally made the switch to the crystal full time.  </li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant that hasn&#x27;t irritated my husband-</li>
            <li>It works, not worth the hassle to return, but could have been packaged better.</li>
            <li>Same holds true for my son.</li>
            <li>But in the first two days I noticed the redness under my arms is completely gone away.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see it lasting a full year.</li>
            <li>I am a big guy and sweet all the time.</li>
            <li>I bought mine with full intentions of sending back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Remember to store it upside down, or in a couple months you won&#x27;t be able to screw the stick up for application, as the crystals lodge between the plastic cover and stick.</li>
            <li>I work outdoors in the heat and this has not let me down in many years.  </li>
            <li>has hardly even worn down at all, so on top of working well for me, it seems very cost effective.</li>
            <li>Once you wet the stick, the product goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>This works better than my typical deodorant in regards of order protection.</li>
            <li>My underarms stay dry and odor free all day.  </li>
            <li>I have to use it as much as my older stick</li>
            <li>This is a decent item, with drawbacks.  </li>
            <li>I recently took a trip to the local drug store chain (that starts with a \\&quot;C\\&quot;) and found this deodorant on the shelf, for slightly more money, but it was the Potassium Alum version.  </li>
            <li>Others may not like the fact that you have to wet it for it to work, but in my book it&#x27;s far better than using an aluminum deodorant that may give me cancer.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a solid &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; of deodorant so wasn&#x27;t sure how to actually use this.  </li>
            <li>More then likely I will only use this deodorant for the rest of my life</li>
            <li>This product works for me exactly as it says, even on a hot, humid southern day no smell at days end.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s absolutely no scent to this stuff which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I found this product only marginally effective with not much to like about the packaging.</li>
            <li>contextualize that statement, I&#x27;m neither a particularly sweaty or odoriferous guy.</li>
            <li>If I sound surprised in the headline, I actually am - will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Finally if this is not working for you you may need to wash you pits more thoroughly when you shower and or trim back some of the hair.</li>
            <li>As as you age, you start to be a little more aware of using natural like products as opposed to chemical laden ones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by the generally positive feedback of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I am excited by the fact that it lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Next, I am sitting here right now, two days without a shower or reapplying my deodorant with armpits that smell of absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li>I also use it myself and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for mineral salt deodorant.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Yesterday, for example, the high was 48 degrees.</li>
            <li>a grown man who has no time to smell like a junior high runt</li>
            <li>I have used natural deodorant for the past ten years and I have had pretty good results.</li>
            <li>i slowly but surely started noticing after using the product that it would fade so easily that it would literally last for up to maybe 20 minutes, and</li>
            <li>It certainly does keep any foul odors away for nearly all of the day.</li>
            <li>It certainly stops odor and is natural, so there&#x27;s not a ton to dislike.</li>
            <li>I decided to throw my Old Spice Pure Sport away.</li>
            <li>gave your underarm a little more motion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a scented spray version of this product, but it&#x27;ll run you a little more</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to do something strenuous, I might recommend using a touch of \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Deodorant For Men\\&quot; with Herbal Cowboy or something else over it, as Burt&#x27;s Bees is sticky on it&#x27;s own and can be hard to get out of clothes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to do something strenuous, I might recommend using a touch of \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Deodorant For Men\\&quot; with Herbal Cowboy or something else over it, as Burt&#x27;s Bees is sticky on it&#x27;s own and can be hard to get out of clothes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made a little cardboard shim to settle it down and it worked great.</li>
            <li>However not so much for my wife or my 29 year old son.  </li>
            <li>It is natural, does not cost that much, what do you have to lose.</li>
            <li>So the question for me clearly was, “Does the product work dependably as claimed as an underarm deodorant under long-term reasonable conditions?”  </li>
            <li>I spent the day sitting comfortably in a climate controlled office, didn&#x27;t exert myself or sweat whatsoever, and drank 6-7 glasses of ice water throughout the day.</li>
            <li>He goes to a Parkour class after school and his whole body is completely drenched in sweat afterwards</li>
            <li>For a couple dollars it was worth a try, especially if it had worked and lasted a year.  </li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about this working when I bought it, but so far, I&#x27;ve been highly impressed.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I was in a college science class when I learned the harmful ingredient, known as aluminum, in most deodorants can possibly cause cancer with long term use.</li>
            <li>Normal deodorant</li>
            <li>Normally, take a shower in the morning, put on deodorant, office all day, workout in the evening after which I&#x27;ll stink and take another shower in the evening.  </li>
            <li>Also because of the application process it will last a while and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to last a long workout session, but for normal daily use/activity, a great product that doesn&#x27;t have chemicals or ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce and that actually works.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product that has become my everyday, go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li>Good idea behind it, but it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>It works if you follow the directions and apply right after you shower and wet the stone first.  </li>
            <li>I said earlier, I use it right after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Put it on right after toweling off after shower and you have just enough dampness for the crystal to glide on.</li>
            <li>The plastic tends to crack easily but more importantly the salt will break into sharp shards that are useless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Love that the container is not pink (I believe that is the only difference between the original and this men&#x27;s version).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I can say that it is clean, fragance-free and lasts all day long..</li>
            <li>I was originally introduced to alum when I started wet shaving the with a DE razor about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I believe that the 1 year estimate is accurate, based on how much I have left and how long I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>I live in the caribbean and we have just two seasons here: summer and hell.</li>
            <li>but I do live in Florida</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it, now.</li>
            <li>and think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;new age\\&quot; hippy dippy product, just give it a try.</li>
            <li>After using this, and asking my girlfriend, &amp;#34;What do you think of my new deodorant?&amp;#34; she replied &amp;#34;What deodorant?&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>You cannot ever drop it, or you&#x27;ll be buying a new one because it shatters.  </li>
            <li>I live in Miami</li>
            <li>popular and most selling deos are also anti-perspirants.&lt;br /&gt;Their modus operandi is to stop you from perspiring so you wont smell bad but would smell like the deo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too bad to have to kluge-up a good product like this...container fairly securely.</li>
            <li>The shape of this Crystal stick makes it easy to apply -and feels like a typical roll-on.</li>
            <li>Fully wet the crystal with clean water and apply it liberally to your underarms, I re-wet it between arms.</li>
            <li>Even though I sweat a tiny bit more, the sweat has absolutely no smell.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay more for pink packaging, this is the same thing.</li>
            <li>but I had to be extra careful to keep feeling confident.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wet it enough before applying so</li>
            <li>They do a decent job of inhibiting odor-causing bacteria while still allowing you to sweat naturally.</li>
            <li>story short: This product works, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a natural, safe alternative to conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li>I was usually able to find just a plain deodorant without anti-perspirant, but over the past few years they are becoming more scarce.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers here I can testify it is a natural deodorant that works fine.  </li>
            <li>It feels very natural, and I no longer have any feeling of dryness, or irritation in and around my armpits.</li>
            <li>Thus, I highly recommend using the clear &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and a bunch of allergies, and this stuff didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Just because something is “natural” does not mean you should put it on or in your body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants in the past.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this and WOW!</li>
            <li>This has been working for me pretty well, but I definitely will never be using crystal by itself again.</li>
            <li>This has been working for me pretty well, but I definitely will never be using crystal by itself again.</li>
            <li>Other products residues would prevent my skin from breathing properly and would result in MORE sweat when I wasn&#x27;t working out or our in the heat</li>
            <li>It actually holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, this summer I decided to try something not usually found in a supermarket or convenience store and looked to Amazon reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both the &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;womens&amp;#34; version of this product, and they both work exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>My family and I recently relocated to Singapore from Houston, and the weather here is hot and humid year around.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what type of person this works for, but isn&#x27;t me that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>In the end I went back to anti-perspirant because of the hot summer days.</li>
            <li>, I am in the shower every AM and pretty nutty about personal hygiene.  </li>
            <li>and I sweat pretty easily especially in this summer heat, but even after mowing the lawn, no smell!</li>
            <li>[if you’re not careful the stone can dislodge from the container and could very well shatter if it hits the sink, tub, or floor].</li>
            <li>i used this product the first day i got it, BIG MISTAKE!</li>
            <li>I wish there was a natural product that prevented sweating under pits, but 5 stars for order protection!</li>
            <li>The first week until the regular deodorant was completely scrubbed off my underarms, yes, after that, never!</li>
            <li>I freshen up in the afternoon, usually with Brut deodorant stick, on most days.  </li>
            <li>Further, it actually feels more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; under my arms without any residue there - and there is no material left on my clothes either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone camping and used this stuff on the first day and not stunk until the 3rd or 4th day.</li>
            <li>, over 20 years later, they are finding a higher incidence of Alzheimer’s in the people of this town.</li>
            <li>The first seller backed out because it suddenly did not have the item in stock.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a solid form of a mineral rock</li>
            <li>Going on my second year with my first one.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit worried I would spent my bucks on this product at the beginning, specially because it is more expensive to bring this to Panama by a special mail service.    </li>
            <li>But honestly it would have been the same with other regular deodorant...</li>
            <li>I previously used Tom&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>There is a reason chemical deodorants were developed, and they DO work better than this, so if you have no problems with your gel stick, or whatever, this is definitely NOT better.  </li>
            <li>where it&#x27;s been 95 degrees or more for the past 3 months with humidity near 1,000,000% I can put it on in the morning and not go to bed stinky.     </li>
            <li>I actually used it for the first time, went to the driving range and was totally surprised at the result.</li>
            <li>And not only is it not bad for you, it actually works.</li>
            <li>I do wish the packaging were more durable for such a long lasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>Unfortunately that feeling doesn&#x27;t seem to last long (couple hours at best).</li>
            <li>Also, mine came in contact with a sink full of water with other soaking times and it literally vanished.  </li>
            <li>so whether I used this or not, the result was more or less the same.</li>
            <li>The only think is that you have to be careful not to let it fall, it will break easily.  </li>
            <li>When I got pregnant, my homemade deodorant, which had been working great, stopped working, the body odor was bad all the time and even my husband&#x27;s regular deodorant couldn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on easy enough but you have to wonder if you are using too much water to wet the end or not enough.  </li>
            <li>and I have a hard time buying that it does more than not using deodorant at all, except for</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that a hard rock was going to combat my B.O. :-)</li>
            <li>I have used Mennen for more years than I can remember, but I more frequently have been getting bad rashes from using it.</li>
            <li>It has always worked perfectly and I cannot remember the last time I smelled bad from sweat.</li>
            <li>I have not used this product yet but is the same thing as another product I have used and it works very well and is all natural.</li>
            <li>My Face Natural Deodorant I was trying wasn&#x27;t doing anything.  </li>
            <li>This natural stick is what everyone should use.</li>
            <li>but so far its done what It promised</li>
            <li>It works well for razor burn, and then I discovered it can also be used for a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>This intrigued me, because I have sensitive skin and found that anti-perspirants caused irritation.  </li>
            <li>Remember, the rock will probably last the whole year.   </li>
            <li>I have used anti-perspirant deodorant for all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a complete fix for me.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>He can now apply deodorant to his underarms without it stinging like his old ones used to.</li>
            <li>But, I tried it again the next day, this time without much activity, and I intentionally smelled my pits throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Thought this was all natural</li>
            <li>I wanted all natural vegan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell you, its still masculine.</li>
            <li>I even went scientific on this and applied it to only one arm for an extended amount of time and didn&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li>Stick deodorants have PCBs that are linked to breast cancer and this is totally natural, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>However, I understand BO is a direct result of the bacteria that feeds on elements in our sweat, and this product eliminates the growth of said bacteria in the area it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also pleased that I don&#x27;t have to expose myself to the harmful elements found in common antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My husband and I were looking for natural alternatives as far as deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with how much coverage is necessary</li>
            <li>It does not mask my natural scent at all.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always surprised.  </li>
            <li>It states \\&quot;100% Natural Mineral Salts\\&quot; and \\&quot;No</li>
            <li>I want to like this stick so much, but after two weeks of feeling like I constantly need to check myself to see</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just naturally when I will start to stink</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 61 year \\&quot;old guy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>After using this a whole year I had to come back and downgrade my review.</li>
            <li>but I think there&#x27;s to much chemicals in our daily lives.</li>
            <li>It is all natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not anti-perspirant, you will sweat, but no harsh chemicals either.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals and does not leave armpit stains on my shirts.</li>
            <li>finally figured out that underarm bacteria is the primary cause of body odor, and for some reason, daily showers just weren&#x27;t enough to fight the bacteria.  </li>
            <li>but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t completely help</li>
            <li>I used chemical spray deodorant with anti-perspirant before this and frequently developed itchy sore rashes on my armpits.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are natural mineral salts...</li>
            <li>As far as reducing body odor, when my wife got home from work this evening, she asked me if I had already mode the lawn.</li>
            <li>She was surprised that I had, and made a comment on the fact that I was not stinky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;No chemicals and all natural.</li>
            <li>If you were to really max one of these out, I&#x27;m guessing that it will last for a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Natural.</li>
            <li>and I would prefer to use something natural, but</li>
            <li>It turns out that is a sensitive part of the skin, that is why some medications are delivered via underarm applicator!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that its natural and not chemical based.</li>
            <li>Male,70 yr old, 70in tall.</li>
            <li>Have been using natural mineral salt for deodorant for years and this one is the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li>But, I guess not for now still looking for something natural.</li>
            <li>I guess that comes along with the territory of using any all natural deoderant that doesn&#x27;t conatin aluminum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this is not heavy duty stuff.</li>
            <li>I shattered 2 so far when they hit the floor.</li>
            <li>This is a natural product and truly natural products do not keep your body from doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>You might be surprised.</li>
            <li>makes my husband smell-free and it is not sticky and natural.</li>
            <li>Plus it is all natural.</li>
            <li>As far as protection for just going out etc, it works fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am allergic to every deodorant I have tried, even all the natural ones like Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with a natural shampoo and toothpaste as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just switched to old spice where this is not a problem, and old spice doesn&#x27;t ruin my shirts either.</li>
            <li>I found that I had to re-wet the tip a couple times to get complete coverage of my armpits.</li>
            <li>Still using it a year later, definitely recommend for those who aren&#x27;t heavy sweaters (may be good for them too, cannot personally attest to that).</li>
            <li>not bad, last long...</li>
            <li>The next day my skin was fine, no redness or itching like some of the other deodorants I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell like your natural clean self, maybe a little bit of cologne.  </li>
            <li>the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that you can just put it right on out of the shower because you have a bit of moisture still on you, so no need to wet it then.  </li>
            <li>I do put it on right after showering while my underarms are still wet.</li>
            <li>Not 24 hours, but if you groom your armpit, this little boy will last pretty much the whole working day.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>You have to be patient and really shake it out to prevent this, but if your like me there are other things you would rather be doing than getting ready in the morning, so</li>
            <li>It just simply wasn&#x27;t, it would last a whole day if I wasn&#x27;t doing any physical activity, but if I went for a walk, or worked outside in the yard, things got stinky fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I swipe the Crystal up and down my underarm 20 to 30 times quickly.</li>
            <li>You will pay a lot more and a little of this does go a long way.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not going to have the usual cologne mixed with your own aroma coming from your armpits but rather a neutral body scent mixed with whatever soap you use.  </li>
            <li>Sure, I don&#x27;t smell, and that&#x27;s cool, but I get to smugly smirk at those rubbing weird white gunk on their pits, or spraying some spray that smells like horny 14 year olds.</li>
            <li>If I was a construction worked in Texas pouring concrete in the middle of August, I&#x27;d be more understanding, but I suggest you try the alternatives out there if you do anything other than spend your time in a coma.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a pain in the ass to put on without getting drips, it&#x27;s also not safe for granite counter tops and to top it off</li>
            <li>I am a male and in general I don&#x27;t really smell a lot.</li>
            <li>She uses Tom&#x27;s of Main as she has to have a deodorant, but I keep it simple.</li>
            <li>Other deodorants I&#x27;ve used (right guard, Brute, Speed Stick) would leave me with some B.O at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>and I must say Im pleased, had it for 2 days now but have yet to use it under more harsh circunstances since its quit cold and havent sweat that much so</li>
            <li>The third time unfortunately, I did shower, and had to go to clinical skills, so I made sure to wet the top of the rock with water and spread it on me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Experiment to figure out how much pressure is needed and how long to apply for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to diminish the odor created by normal daily perspiration.</li>
            <li>And by all means wet it, under hot water, before applying it.</li>
            <li>You do have to wet it first.</li>
            <li>it takes a few days to get full effectiveness but from then on you are well protected without the use of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars simply because it DOES work, and it&#x27;s certainly not as bad as other deodorants on the market.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make it through a full day if I&#x27;m golfing (in the desert) or hit the gym hard but a normal day,</li>
            <li>Hint: if the stone comes loose a small piece of friction tape around the perimeter of the very bottom of the stone will lock it into the container fairly securely.</li>
            <li>I started developing a rash from the baking soda in my recipe and after trying multiple new recipes nothing compared to the power of baking soda/coconut oil.</li>
            <li>After talking to several friends and roommate who have used it at some point in their life, they all agree with me.pplied it to only one arm for an extended amount of time and didn&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li>I really believe this will last for the entire year if not longer.  </li>
            <li>Being a physically active and athletic older adult male (running, weightlifting, tai-chi, etc) I really wondered if this product was even worth trying since it contains virtually none of the typical deodorant antiperspirant chemicals of</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes the smell was gone completely, and I stayed fresh the rest of the day and night.  </li>
            <li>--it simply doesn&#x27;t work after a few hours in a comfortable environment.</li>
            <li>By and large, you&#x27;re going to get a mix of hippies, open minded people and new agers - not those who have been using axe, old spice or other mainstream</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband as he has very sensitive skin and tends to break out in a rash several months after using deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The block started smelling a bit after using it for deodorant, but it wasn&#x27;t anything major.</li>
            <li>no other smells to compete with my cologne.</li>
            <li>This Crystal Body Deodorant Stick is exactly the same stuff that&#x27;s sold in the purple plastic case; it&#x27;s only labeled differently to appeal to men (or people who don&#x27;t want a purple container).</li>
            <li>No other deodorant has even come close</li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s a major Zumba person going sometimes twice a day.  </li>
            <li>I simply apply right out of the shower with wet underarms</li>
            <li>(I don’t have a strong body odor), but it&#x27;s a noticeable smell which regular deodorant usually covers up.</li>
            <li>I originally got this stick because I hate the way deodorant can cause pit stains on nice shirts, so I figured this would not do that.</li>
            <li>Works, not as well as traditional deodorants, but decently all the same.</li>
            <li>Not that other deodorants don&#x27;t work, but of the half dozen or so I&#x27;ve tried the past few years, I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>Not that other deodorants don&#x27;t work, but of the half dozen or so I&#x27;ve tried the past few years, I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>I was smell free and have been for the past several months now!</li>
            <li>Two pictures clearly showed that the only ingredient is Potassium Alum (an actual natural ingredient), however that is not the case.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but I&#x27;d rather not use something that tries to pull a fast one on me with something else.</li>
            <li>So, I used an old shaving alum block for a while, until it started to break apart, then began the search for a specific alum deodorant and was recommended this.    </li>
            <li>All in all, though, I&#x27;m a big fan of natural and holistic remedies.  </li>
            <li>I took this into consideration going into this product, as it&#x27;s only a salt stick, and even for natural things this is far different from the others out there.</li>
            <li>From time to time I try to switch back to newer deodorants that are supposed to be for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Aluminum Chlorohydrate\\&quot; but upon closer inspection of the ingredient list on the back, it lists \\&quot;Natural Mineral Salts,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a number occasions when my deodorant has let me done; apparently it&#x27;s a fact of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay maybe I exaggerated with that last revelation but it works really well</li>
            <li>The only small problem with this salt crystal is that it takes some extra more time applying than with regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perspiration is a natural human body function</li>
            <li>, one tip is you have to apply liberally when wet, I do pretty much my entire side and up my arm</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re a like me and only sweat moderately with normal body odor, this product should work</li>
            <li>To get rid of these cracks, you just have to keep using it, and it will slow smooth out again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are like me and take minimal showers, every 2-3 days/ only after the gym and such i recommend having this and another gentle normal deoderant for inbetween days or when not wearing white t-shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now on my second order of this deodorant, as the first one had the crystal sent into the sink and shattered into a number of pieces due to the plastic body giving out during use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strange adjusting to using it instead of more traditional antiperspirants or deodorants that just rub on with a single swipe.</li>
            <li>This is one has a masculine clear bottle while the cheaper one is a pink purple bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me several unexpected benefits were that it is total fragrance-free itself — if you use a preferred scented bath soap that’s how you’ll smell, it is completely stain-free to clothing, and the manufacturers aren’t exaggerating when they imply one stick will last a year — possibly longer.</li>
            <li>It will last all day if you are not active.</li>
            <li>I did try it one day before my shower, to see what would happen, and it actually made the smell worse instead of better.    </li>
            <li>It definitely wasn&#x27;t as effective when I was just applying it at random times, EG while already sweaty/smelly.  </li>
            <li>Regular deodorants cause me major rash problems.</li>
            <li>I do reapply the stick before any major physical activity.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine doing the same program spent 25 dollars on 6 sticks of regular higher end deodorant assuming each stick would last&#x27;em 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Apply to wet skin right out of the shower and don&#x27;t wet the stone.</li>
            <li>One thing to note, when you use this product, you have to apply it when you are right out of the shower (still wet), and you have to wet this deodorant in the sink also before applying it, or else it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>If it lasts half that long it will be worth it in savings alone.</li>
            <li>Even if the thing shatters, you can still usually salvage enough large pieces to use while you&#x27;re waiting for your new stick to arrive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the chemistry or any of that, but it does what it says it will and apparently will last forever.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it was a fungal thing similar to athletes foot.</li>
            <li>For the first few days everything worked as promised, there was no smell.</li>
            <li>It might sound silly, but slowing down 3-5 times more to apply deodorant without getting wet gets on your nerves just a bit, especially if it doesn&#x27;t provide results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But to me this “lack” can also be viewed as a plus since subjecting my body to the potential contamination of absorbing these complex non-metabolizable chemicals never seemed very smart, especially as I got older (and maybe a little wiser, who knows?).</li>
            <li>Put it on when clean, wet it, give it a few days to get acclimated.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The tabs that slide the crystal up and down became worn too much to slide into the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also make sure to press down hard on 5 or 10 of those strokes.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t live an &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; lifestyle by any means, I did develop concern about my periodic underarm rashes and the chemical buildup that occurs when using typical deodorants daily on those sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to this product, I have had zero breakouts under my arms and seldom even have itchy underarms at all.</li>
            <li>A brand of deodorant I had used for years was discontinued, so since I was trying a new brand anyway, I thought I&#x27;d try something a little healthier/more natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about that yet, but I can certainly tell that it is going to last considerably longer than the store brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about that yet, but I can certainly tell that it is going to last considerably longer than the store brands.  </li>
            <li>Sweated, and was pretty much the only one in my party that didn&#x27;t smell at the end of the day (this sealed the deal for me btw)&lt;br /&gt;Got married and ran around NYC (another humid day) in a tux sweating like mad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marked all of my yellowed shirts I owned prior to using this deodorant with a black dot on the tag and bought a new set of white shirts.</li>
            <li>it is just like any other normal deodorant in the fact that is deodorizes and keeps you from sweating.  </li>
            <li>it is just like any other normal deodorant in the fact that is deodorizes and keeps you from sweating.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to subject my 10 year old son to all the chemicals in an antiperspirant and the natural deodorants</li>
            <li>They boast that it lasts &amp;#34;one year&amp;#34;, yet in only a few months, when more than half of the product is left, the adhesive comes loose, the crystal falls out, and shatters all over the floor like glass.  </li>
            <li>Although this is NOT an antiperspirant I think that the other chemical filled deodorants actually cause excessive</li>
            <li>This solid stick has worked extremely well to keep me from becoming offensive, at least from a scent standpoint.</li>
            <li>I probably apply a little too much when I use it, but I want to ensure I&#x27;m getting it on since I can&#x27;t feel that it is there.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make you smell good, just STOPS you from smelling bad.</li>
            <li>Too bad to have to kluge-up a good product like this...</li>

            <li> So it worked great in those conditions.    </li>
            <li> That being said, this is what I use 95% of the time and it works great, lasts forever and wont give me cancer.</li>
            <li> My wife suggested Crystal and it works great, lasts for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> This product works great.  </li>

            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> This deodorant is great.  </li>
            <li> Works great for me.</li>
            <li> great alternative produce that&#x27;s also a great value.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> either lol.</li>
            <li> this is a great product that works fantastically for me.</li>
            <li> When I work out, I augment this deodorant with some Herban Cowboy (http://www.amazon.com/Herban-Cowboy-Deodorant-Maximum-Protection/dp/B004153MG4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418209560&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;herban+cowboy+deodorant) and it works great until I shower again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, I have noticed that I have practically no B.O.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really great for getting rid of body</li>
            <li> This stuff has been great though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t this these work that great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great because my shirts aren&#x27;t getting stained at the armpits anymore.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> A great product.</li>
            <li> THIS is not an attractive trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have slippery hands and can hang onto it without ever dropping it, great.  </li>
            <li> This was a great value, works well, was what I was looking for</li>
            <li> When this product was working it worked great.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s happy with it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy knowing that he is not putting chemicals in his body.  </li>
            <li> For the price this deodorant is a great value.  </li>
            <li> This is a very effective deodorant that does not have any fragrance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find the &amp;#34;Mens&amp;#34; version of this on Amazon at the best price I have seen in many years.</li>
            <li> After using it for about a month, I&#x27;m in shock on how amazing it is that I don&#x27;t smell BO from the underarms!  </li>
            <li> just perfect, healthy deodorant with out any danger chemicals</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  the Greatest safe Deodorant Stick</li>
            <li> The nice thing is that you may still use the pieces!  </li>
            <li> and it works perfect for me :)</li>
            <li> I tried this and from day one it worked great, it&#x27;s amazing just apply it after your shower</li>
            <li> If you read the comment by Arthur (below), he speaks some good sense.  </li>
            <li> and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be good for OVER a year because I got mine about a year ago</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this product.</li>
            <li> Use this after your showers and you are good for 24hr min.</li>
            <li> but that is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> I think using Crystal requires a good routine because I can never tell if I&#x27;m covered (no scent to clue you in)</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this product works surprisingly well, however it is a bit misleading.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years; i think it is the best product available.</li>
            <li> I have used Crystal deodorant for about 7 years now and have always loved it.  </li>
            <li> One of my sons even attended a concert and came home very impressed with being stink free...</li>
            <li> I heard some good things about this stuff, and like that it doesn&#x27;t have any Aluminum Chlorohydrate, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The container isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Loving it and no smell whatsoever, its great.</li>
            <li> I have armpits that require alot of protection, this sounded good.</li>
            <li> this good for me?&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> and it is good....</li>
            <li> I feel good that it does not have any of the harmful chemicals that store brands have.  </li>
            <li> I feel good that it does not have any of the harmful chemicals that store brands have.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff at a good price.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it in search of the perfect unscented deodorant not to mention it looked like a unique and inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super awesome...</li>
            <li> This works Perfectly fine!!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using Nasanta Magnesium Deodorant and it works great, lasts all day (and more), is unscented, and doesn&#x27;t leave me paranoid about body</li>
            <li> If you have severe BO, this might not work for you, but I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> , I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this works amazing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more than happy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The best time to apply it is when you are right out of the shower and your body is still damp.  </li>
            <li> find that it works best when applied right after a shower.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> what is not to love!</li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent and truly amazing product, would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Kind of wierd to use, takes time to get use to it</li>
            <li> The reason is that moisture is needed for an effective application.</li>
            <li> Do your own research before buying.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say it works well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the difference between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s kind?</li>
            <li> I tried this after making my own for about a year.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> This product has worked perfectly for her never having an issue, and that my friends is a modern miracle.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything except absorb the smell of your pits so that it reapplies your own BO over and over.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is going to kind of vary case to case.</li>
            <li> Odor controlled without a perfume smell - nice.</li>
            <li> I even got my husband his own and it is working for him.  </li>
            <li> I have used this stick for over a year and it is still effective for even a couple of sweaty days at work.</li>
            <li> Write your own review if you believe otherwise.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m ready to call this the best value in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I keep that &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; in a plastic bag and take it with me on vacation; my own travel size deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to just not have any odor to deal with.</li>
            <li> Since my wife uses Downey fabric softener when she washes, my t-shirts have a nice fragrance to them.  </li>
            <li> I first bought the Body Spray, but the spray/pump was too positionally sensitive &amp; must be held perfectly upright - not the best design, but I&#x27;d the product &amp;</li>
            <li> and I find it as effective or even more effective than the popular deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Takes getting use to since it has to be &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; to put it on, but it drys quickly &amp; works great just like the Crystal Rock Body Spray - -</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it knowing it is natural and doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> and it looks like it has many more months of use!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing stuff I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> If I can use this, most people will be thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Awesome, natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I find it best to not wipe under my arms after applying and let the water absorb/evaporate naturally so that the salt crystals aren&#x27;t wiped</li>
            <li> As far as I know, your body needs to perspire anyway, of course you don&#x27;t need to stink while doing it, so it is best to stick to deodorant anyway.  </li>
            <li> Works great, feels great and doesnt leave white on my clothing</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> work better than others on me, but I&#x27;ve never been overly impressed, even if initial application goes on well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> use chemical anymore, try this fine product!</li>
            <li> product is excellent and works beautifully to prevent odor no matter how intense the workout or the emotional experience.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great natural and safe alternative!</li>
            <li> sure you apply it correctly</li>
            <li> Works well, but must be reapplied much more often than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> This is very possibly the best deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I kept moving it around and around and around to be SURE it was going on.  </li>
            <li> Also, does not irritate my underarms as many did.</li>
            <li> Now, using the Potassium Alum version, I&#x27;m getting much better results in the form of longer-lasting odor protection (though still NOT as long-lasting as a chemical deodorant).  </li>
            <li> I judged between the reviews and realized most people like the crystal deodorant more, so I gave it a shot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most deodorants</li>
            <li> And most importantly, Amazon&#x27;s price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> It is ok.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with deodorants for many years because of sensitivity to the ingredients which leads to swelling and itching of the armpits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The truth of the matter is people want to believe this works much better than it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The truth of the matter is people want to believe this works much better than it does.</li>
            <li> of water or more.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t how this works for others because it sure doesn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t resist the sweat to escape rather it absorbs the toxic particles of your sweat to make a better aroma.</li>
            <li> I rub it around my pit a lot more than the one or two swipes</li>
            <li> I love the fact i wont apply any chemical product on my body.</li>
            <li> This works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It also happens to be the most practical deodorant you can buy considering a stick</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three months now and I am extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> You are ok with using Potassium Alum.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I am OK with my armpits sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You are ok with using Potassium Alum.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I choose to use it because I rather use one ingredient than many</li>
            <li> I found it easier to study one ingredient, Potassium Alum, and feel safe using it.  </li>
            <li> When I apply I do more than three swipes.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to get all around your armpit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put the top on and put it on my shelf.  </li>
            <li> When I apply I do more than three swipes.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to get all around your armpit.</li>
            <li> Once I am done I put the top on and put it on my shelf.  </li>
            <li> My armpits have never been more odorless.</li>
            <li> It works better than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> actually was quite impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> and I might be erring on more coverage than I need</li>
            <li> What more can I say?&lt;br</li>
            <li> What more do I have to say?  </li>
            <li> Works better than nothing, which is what I wanted since my armpits seem allergic to everything.</li>
            <li> I have used the crystal deodorant for more than 2 years with no problems.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as antiperspirants at preventing unwanted smell but works much better than not using it.</li>
            <li> sure...</li>
            <li> synthesized salt is safe to use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, and will certainly last year or longer.</li>
            <li> Most of the time no odor.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for more than 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;Will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a healthy alternative to deodorant.  </li>
            <li> This makes for a better deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It for sure works.</li>
            <li> * Need to reapply more often (lasts 9-5 but need to apply again in the evening for me)</li>
            <li> A healthy alternative.  </li>
            <li> It works and better yet it does not have any overwhelming perfume, doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts, and makes breakfast in the morning for me.</li>
            <li> , There are better products in the market.</li>
            <li> unless you like that sorta thing :)</li>
            <li> Works well if you wash or shower each day or more often.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a deodorant that will work all day</li>
            <li> Works ok on days without strenuous exercise.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.   </li>
            <li> I rub it around my pit a lot more than the one or two swipes</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> and I have always had irritation with most deodorants/anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> I do not think that anything that goops and gobs  to absorb sweat or stops you from perspiring is healthy for your body.  </li>
            <li> I now buy it online sine most stores o not carry it.</li>
            <li> Most of them adopted this product and one or two told me that it didn&#x27;t work well for them.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product lasts for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this forever unless something better arrives.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet, as most others have done.</li>
            <li> No smelly pits, and no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my salt stick for over 8 months now and love it.</li>
            <li> One stick lasts more that a year.  </li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works great.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t bother me any more however.</li>
            <li> I was glad that I tried it out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great purchase and I would absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just be gentle with it when applying, and hopefully you can avoid the housing issues I experienced.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I think the stick works better though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ..</li>
            <li> I like that way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirants, many deodorants &amp; soaps, but I don&#x27;t react to this product at all.</li>
            <li> An interesting point-</li>
            <li> I love crystal deodarants and have used them for probably 15 or more years.</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> This works ok</li>
            <li> Works well, no smell, no horrible additives.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used to the types that are scented and &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; more substantial.  </li>
            <li> He likes that format much better.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> Works great for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I love using rock/crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li> but it is still better than the clothes staining.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed that if l forget it, I&#x27;m still safe.</li>
            <li> perhaps I&#x27;m applying more liberally than most?</li>
            <li> No &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; me with this product.......and, safe to use.  </li>
            <li> Really, this is a great product, and if you don&#x27;t mind that you will sweat but not stink, this is for you.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is safe, and does the job.  </li>
            <li> , glad it was here on Amazon</li>
            <li> that makes me smell like a flower and their ad campaigns promise to make you smell like alpha-males. :)</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Sure, a crystal?</li>
            <li> It basically was, well, a smooth &#x27;rock&#x27; vs. a nice twisty applicator.</li>
            <li> In fact - and I can&#x27;t verify this - it seemed the more fragrance-y coverup products I used, the stronger my &#x27;stank&#x27; got.</li>
            <li> Crystal Body Deodorant Stick WORKS EVEN BETTER to control odor.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I also have a bit of a sensitivity to many deodorants.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> Which means that unless you&#x27;re using distilled or RO water, the water you put on the crystal will hurt you more than the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought this .</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Does a better job of stopping wetness than those without aluminum.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, better than Mitchum.</li>
            <li> , if you are the type who likes a scent on your deodorant, use this product and then spray some Axe or something like that on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I like the none screw up version much better because the screw up crank will break and become brittle.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, apply it right after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Very economical !</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Your underarms need to be very clean, and they need to not smell when you apply this stick.  </li>
            <li> So, I conclude that this is great for a normal, non sweaty day, but I wouldnt trust it during a workout.    </li>
            <li> This works great for normal use.  </li>
            <li> The first two times it worked good.</li>
            <li> As of now, the product is pretty good for what it does.</li>
            <li> I work an outdoor job in the heat, and even at that it provided pretty good odour protection.  </li>
            <li> Way better than reeking of BO or reeking of strongly scented deodorant.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to apply, is perfect for people with sensitive skin, and does not leave any residue/stickiness.</li>
            <li> Do a quick Google search for ammonium alum, along with a search for the ingredient list in this deodorant, and make your own judgment.</li>
            <li> It is super effective if you maitain a reduced level of hair under your arm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few days now, honestly this is the best working deodorant I&#x27;ve come across, this is how any deodorant should be hence the word De-Odorizer.</li>
            <li> This product is a very effective deodorant even in the heat and humidity of the Dominican Republic where I live.  </li>
            <li> I kind of wish this deodorant had some kind of scent to it, for maybe it would help my particular case, but I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I have emailed the manufacturer about once a year for five years, pleading with them to secure the crystal to the bottom inside of the container with better adhesive.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s intention is to be a deodorant, not an antiperspirant to reduce sweat, it greatly helps to eliminate odor by using all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> There is no smell whatsoever and so far works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, which is great.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even sure if it got applied the first time to be honest.</li>
            <li> First deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever been able to effectively use.</li>
            <li> I found that for me it works best if I coat the body side of my armpit only and go over about 3-4 times with mild pressure.</li>
            <li> and I can not say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> It is as good as or better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, plus it&#x27;s natural and a lot milder than anything else.    </li>
            <li> Very mild, I haven&#x27;t had any sort of reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to drop - if it falls, the salt crystal shatters.</li>
            <li> : Make sure you are completely clean before applying.</li>
            <li> It is as good as or better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, plus it&#x27;s natural and a lot milder than anything</li>
            <li> Very mild, I haven&#x27;t had any sort of reaction to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too easy to break it when you drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I used to get about 3 wearing out of them easy with anti-perspirant, now 3 is pushing it.  </li>
            <li> I have even discovered that since I no longer am concerned with rashes or goofy smells, I can apply it to help combat odors elsewhere on my body such as my crotch and soles of my feet to great</li>
            <li> The cons to this product are that it easily comes out of it&#x27;s container.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy.</li>
            <li> THE CHAIN IS A STRONG AS THE WEAKEST LINK  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers have said it&#x27;s not that great, but to make this product effective, you MUST apply it to wet skin and not just where the hair in the armpit is.</li>
            <li> There is some strong evidence of a link -- for instance, in 1988, a truck driver accidentally dumped 20 tons of aluminum sulfate in to a town&#x27;s drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very happy to say that I am now free of plugging my pores and spreading Aluminum and other toxic chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> love it.. and no bad chemicals</li>
            <li> This product works fine.</li>
            <li> Is not irritating, is a great deodorant but be aware -</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine as a deodorant but has irritated my skin after two uses.  </li>
            <li> As deodorants go this one has not smell which is fine</li>
            <li> They work fine, but I drop them and then lose valuable deodorant to the bathroom tile as corners of the blocks would chip off and disintegrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For winter, this product was fine.  </li>
            <li> The cheap plastic container the salt rock is in was cracked when I got it, but it still works fine.    </li>
            <li> For best results, put on the product and dry with a hair dryer right after to seal in the salts.</li>
            <li> think it is best when put on right out of the shower and applied before you are completely dry</li>
            <li> For best performance, I suggest running a little water over the end of the stick while tilting the stick downward as to not wash away the rest of the stick.</li>
            <li> a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great solid form of the spray.</li>
            <li> These 2 products are fantastic and I am going to be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> , my husband is allergic to aluminum in regular deodorant so this is great for him too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a miracle 48 hour odor free product, but it won&#x27;t fill your underarms with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I always have two containers available in case</li>
            <li> This type of mineral deodorant does a great job at battling the various odors that can develop during the day.</li>
            <li> Both say it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I found that if one end gets cracked, or has ridges, just use it lightly; and over time it will get smooth again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy smelling like myself, not</li>
            <li> But the second day I was happy.</li>
            <li> Your body is supposed to sweat, so this allows it to do so freely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, it works, and it gives you bragging rights.</li>
            <li> This does have alum in it, so if you do want aluminum free, you should look for an organic stick.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a scent I enjoy.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mind that its fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Twice, the deodorant mineral stick fell out of the cheaply designed plastic dispenser, both times it hit the sink and shattered.  </li>
            <li> Add on to it that this &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; should last a year, and you&#x27;ve got a great product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> because although it seemed to work decently for that month, I don&#x27;t think he liked the way it was designed (too easy to break, could be slippery when grabbing after a shower).</li>
            <li> and I thought that I smelled better than when I use nothing but not as good as a standard deodorant.</li>
            <li> I think the original packaging would be just fine.</li>
            <li> For me the secrets to successful use were: apply immediately after a shower (as soon as I was dried-off); moisten the stone sufficiently so that it really glides on your full under-arm areas; and then of course wear clean fresh clothing afterward.</li>
            <li> followed the instructions and made sure to put it on right after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> AND it seems to be a better anti-perspirant than right guard spray that I have been using for 30 years.</li>
            <li> Much better than deodorant if you have the right body chemistry for it.</li>
            <li> Also this Deodorant seems to last forever, So not only is it more effective, and healthier, but also more cost effective!</li>
            <li> This product really really REALLY works!!!</li>
            <li> It is very economical: one stick lasts a year or two.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, and I was very sceptical, but it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> (I think I&#x27;m at almost a year on my first stick) and most importantly, it WORKS.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After working for years at a major consumer packaged good company with a famous and market leading deoderant/antiperspirant brand that can be found on every drugstore/supermarket store, I became aware firsthand of the chemicals used in those products their toxicity to the body.  </li>
            <li> It works as it should maybe not as strong as those deodorants with all the chemicals, but good enough.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s do to the changes of my work, but I can not find a way to keep this working more consistently for me throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It works very well! :)</li>
            <li> I originally paired this with Sweat Block, which I applied once every week (with a couple of Benadryl...).</li>
            <li> It worked like magic -- I could consistently put it on every day and neither I nor my fiancée noticed any rancid stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am on the original stick still.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me, has no perfume or scent, doesn&#x27;t leave any stains or marks like &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorants and antiperspirants do, and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I smell fine, but they shirts don&#x27;t have the salt on them(of course) and seem to grow bacteria fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure for some people this is ideal, for me, I am left looking for another natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> My wife says I don&#x27;t have significant BO.</li>
            <li> I have not minded the original &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This works great and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Ensure your underarms are clean.   </li>
            <li> As all our lifestyles are all different, it is up to you to find the most effective way or day of the time to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the aluminum compounds in antiperspirants, the phthalates in the fragrance of deodorants, and the persistent residue always left by the products I found most effective.  </li>
            <li> It dries clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do not think I will ever go back to the most popular deo again</li>
            <li> Since the Crystals block the bateria that develops from the mosture that interfaces with the hair under the armpits, when you cut the hair back, it makes the salts more effective.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of water on the surface, and it glides right on and works perfectly all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I have used Crystal Body Deodorant stick for many years &amp; they last a really long time!  </li>
            <li> This Will be my deodorant for when I do not need to smell special like sports etc.</li>
            <li> It takes care of the stank and truely fights bacteria without any harmful chemicals.    </li>
            <li> Be generous and be sure to cover the whole area.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I purchased one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> My natural deodorant of choice worked moderately well, but I decided to search for something better and I&#x27;d heard great things about mineral deodorants.</li>
            <li> That boy&#x27;s pits could muster up a stank that could choke out a full grown moose without deodorant.</li>
            <li> , this one seems to be good for two days every with tub or shower daily.</li>
            <li> so it is much healthier than the chemical laden deoderants most people use.</li>
            <li> However, my job isn&#x27;t very physically demanding although I do have to move around a fair amount during the day.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is cool.</li>
            <li> the same deodorant stick for a year is a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is all natural salts and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> As I am an office desk worker most of the time, it works very well for me.    </li>
            <li> I bought this as a trial-as I wasn&#x27;t sure it would really work.  </li>
            <li> but he said he still needs a true deodorant.</li>
            <li> I work full time in sales and do a lot of DIY.</li>
            <li> We gave it a good try for a week and finally had to toss.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try a deodorant that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Also, Young Living sells good natural deodorant as well, but you need a referral to buy from them and they are more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The full chemical name of potassium alum is potassium aluminum sulfate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With store bought brands, they are so full of scents that any underarm smell you have goes away immediately after application.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s all natural and a cool shaped rock</li>
            <li> so far, great product (after 2 weeks use - we&#x27;ll see if it really lasts a year ;) )</li>
            <li> my only issue is... it should have a textured dispenser, cause it works best when you apply it to a wet armpit, but it easily slips out of your hands.</li>
            <li> In my case, this is a great alternative to the chemicals in the more common mass market products.  </li>
            <li> bought this very hesitantly but was happy to find it actually works.</li>
            <li> I have found if I moisten the crystal before I use it that it glides on and the moisture dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> There have been some sticks that caused a mild to severe reaction, but not with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> super product.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is nice because it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, and is good on sensitive or irritated skin, but it just doesn&#x27;t keep my dry, even in cooler weather.</li>
            <li> Considering it lasts for a year, that is a tremendous value.</li>
            <li> Need to apply for a while to get adequate protection.</li>
            <li> I make 40-60 quick strokes over each underarm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not disappearing quickly and I&#x27;ve used it for a year.</li>
            <li> Gave up on it and got the Gilette clear gel that works wonders and is dispensed very easily.</li>
            <li> I commute into Manhattan, and the commute can get you very hot and sweaty</li>
            <li> Hoped these would be a suitable replacement -- not so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent deodorant due to its totally natural content.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat a lot anyway, unless I am working out or very hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months, but many say it can last well over a year, which is a great value.</li>
            <li> After making significant changes in the way I eat (eating more natural)</li>
            <li> but I have found that I sweat less with this product and the smell of my perspiration has been greatly reduced as well.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was a bit odd and would never work, but works great.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day long and works better than the many deodorants that I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this seller and this product highly!!!</li>
            <li> it has to be a lot cheaper than regular sticks because I bought another one and it must be more than eight months!</li>
            <li> I make is a point to keep my under arm hair short rather than maintaining a manly bush that doesn&#x27;t impress my wife and trust me, your wife and or girlfriend did not fall in love with you because of the amount of hair you have under your arms!</li>
            <li> so for me, one morning application lasts the whole day just fine.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really create a smooth &amp;#34;after feel&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have heard that some people have more alum-resistant body flora, but for me, this is a clear winner.</li>
            <li> and it is simple and effective to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the negatives, for me, not just for that, but for the fact that I no longer suffer from any irritation or \\&quot;itching\\&quot; under the arms from chemical anti-perspirants.  </li>
            <li> but so far it works great and keeps odor away for the entire day for me with one application.</li>
            <li> have come up with my own way of using it that is a bit different than the instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw Crystal Body Deodorant here on Amazon and decided it would be worth the price to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> But now that i know he feels fresh a daisy</li>
            <li> I think it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I put it on immediately after showering and rarely have a problem.  </li>
            <li> I rarely even sweat, but if I do, it never smells.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> If you have hair under your arms, you probably will better off with the gel version of this product because the stone isn&#x27;t rubbing directly against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is on the more sensitive side</li>
            <li> Worth a try in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most people who have found this product, I have tended to have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I suggested my wife try mine as she has used everything know to man and women without much success.</li>
            <li> I then thought this would be a good test, so I wet it, put it on, and waited.  </li>
            <li> I started getting a rash with the popular deodorants and finally tried this.  </li>
            <li> I have seen broken cases before but this one was perfect.</li>
            <li> Love the natural aspect of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of a natural salt deodorant, but my husband very reluctantly used it.  </li>
            <li> We have, however, been trying the salt spray on deodorant by Naturally Fresh.</li>
            <li> After using this kind of deodorant, I will not go back to the regular kind.</li>
            <li> On days I don&#x27;t shower I just get it wet under the faucet, it works just as good.</li>
            <li> During that transition time between walking in and taking off my layers, I sweat buckets, and it&#x27;s kind of gross to see my shirts.</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion on this product, in my own review, I believe it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product lasts forever and is all natural.</li>
            <li> Nice change from traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li> This stuff has no scent and keeps me minty fresh all day.</li>
            <li> But, just to be clear for most of you.  </li>
            <li> That fact alone makes it 100% worth it to me.tore brands but lasts a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> That fact alone makes it 100% worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Sweating is natural and should not be blocked like most deodorants say they do.</li>
            <li> After doing some research online, I came to the conclusion that Crystal would not ruin my shirts, and it is more of a natural product because it is basically just a composition of minerals.  </li>
            <li> So far I love it.  </li>
            <li> Paid a very reasonable price for this product and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The price is fine and it looks like it will last for a long time so the price is actually great.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it completely eliminates it!</li>
            <li> other reviewers have said though, I have found the key to getting it to work the best is to apply it immediately after a shower.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Right after applying, you can notice a decrease in BO.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t smell for a while if you use this right when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I apply this product right after the shower</li>
            <li> I did put it on right after a shower each morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on when right after my shower in the morning before drying off.</li>
            <li> I normally apply it right after I get out of the shower in the morning, so it&#x27;s perfectly fine with me.</li>
            <li> I noticed I smelled less than pleasant.  </li>
            <li> gave this a shot for about a couple of months, as I like to try new things every now and then, especially if they have a fair amount of positive feedback, and I like products that are on the more natural side.</li>
            <li> I read such positive reviews so this sounded amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing how long they would have lasted if they worked for me.</li>
            <li> Works great no stains Need to use it as directed doesn&#x27;t work like an ordinary deorodant.</li>
            <li> If it takes a whole year to actually finish the stick/rock as others have said, then I can qualify this purchase as the best money I have spent..   </li>
            <li> main problem is that the more you sweat the more your pores are open to absorbing whatever chemicals you use.</li>
            <li> I try to get ready relatively quick.</li>
            <li> After using regular deoderants my whole life, going over to this from Crystal is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I honest to goodness shaved my pits as a final ditch effort and it really made no difference.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and lasts far longer than one year, if you don&#x27;t drop it.  </li>
            <li> Success depends on your personal biology, I&#x27;m sure some people have resistant strains of bacteria and this just won&#x27;t work for some.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I initially thought that this was great, but then I discovered that I don&#x27;t generally *need that much anti-perspirant / deodorizer in the first place, and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re allergic to normal deodorants or just wanna use a safe and all natural deodorant order this!</li>
            <li> product works fine; no stinging or rash so far (1 week).</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, lasts a really long time</li>
            <li> So after taking a good shower you apply it (wetting the rock a little and liberally spreading it across your under arms)</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that even if it takes a second application on the hottest days it will be better than the chemical deodorants.</li>
            <li> if the plastic container was designed better than it wouldn&#x27;t be such a problem.</li>
            <li> First time user</li>
            <li> First, let me say, it does not work as well as chemical deodorants.  </li>
            <li> So, be forewarned, if you&#x27;re expecting it to perform exactly like your chemical deodorant that you are giving up, it won&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li> Not a deal breaker, but be aware.    </li>
            <li> So, my advice to you is to find this stuff at a local pharmacy, and make sure it&#x27;s the Potassium Alum version.  </li>
            <li> Never apply it without first taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Most deodorants you have to apply daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty suspicious guy</li>
            <li> I guess the advantage is that it provides more applications than regular stick deoderant.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that I am on a Ketogenic Diet.</li>
            <li> My bag is often thrown in the trunk of my car, where it gets hot.</li>
            <li> My brother had horrid knots under his arms from regular deoderant because of the aluminum content - he was extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> When you first start using this.</li>
            <li> My daughter dropped it and the container cracked the first day too.</li>
            <li> Do be aware though that this is a deodorant not and anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> If you are OK with the five things above I think you will like the product.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen any reason to disbelieve what others have said about it lasting more than a year.</li>
            <li> Not that great, the stick broke after 2 or 3 weeks use, and it does not last all day long.</li>
            <li> so I can use all the gifted colognes I&#x27;ve received in the last couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first crystal, I used off and on over the course of a year.  </li>
            <li> but I have to apply more often than regular deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I am willing to trade in extra two minutes for better health</li>
            <li> After many years of regular antiperspirants became quite allergic to them.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how much it costs now, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Stuck in hot humid airports.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used urban cowboy and toms of Maine and this is way better.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have recommended this product to many of my friends who had similar issues.</li>
            <li> The crystal is not held in the case with a lot of force, so as you shake the water off, you might shake the crystal out of the tube, and when it hits the ground it will most likely shatter.</li>
            <li> This happened to me with my first stick, and I had to order another one.    </li>
            <li> I have tried many different roll-on and spray products and always got a rash on my armpits.  </li>
            <li> Works really well and has no scent!</li>
            <li> Ok, this is the third time I use</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands &amp; types of deodorants to find one that does not irritate my arm pits.</li>
            <li> First off it is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I only use it when I want to be sure I won&#x27;t stain my shirt.</li>
            <li> Also, if I am sweating for more than an hour, my body odor starts to come back.  </li>
            <li> most currently marketed US products (compounds of the ?propylene glycol and aluminum/zirconium ?</li>
            <li> I tried to apply more because I thought maybe I just wasn&#x27;t using enough.</li>
            <li> and I would just run water over them first</li>
            <li> After walking in the hot sun</li>
            <li> The first deodorant that I have used that didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> It works for me even in hot, humid weather.  </li>
            <li> THANKS CRYSTAL BRAND!</li>
            <li> I only need it once per day unless I shower more thanonce that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At the first drop, the lid and turning dial broke.</li>
            <li> and im still on my first one since jan 2014.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well to fight odor but not wetness.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural deodorant and it was so cheap</li>
            <li> First stick it under the water in the sink.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for everyone in the family and it work for the first month.  </li>
            <li> As long as it is applied properly, works great.</li>
            <li> My first thought was &#x27;These guys haven&#x27;t smelled</li>
            <li> When I first received my crystal deodorant I applied it as directed and went to the gym.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s simply salt and nothing more.</li>
            <li> First off, I barley feel like it is even there.</li>
            <li> Get the THAI stone of $1 more, i thought this should work the same</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason that most people try to avoid aluminum in deodorant is because of its possible link to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</li>
            <li> First deodorant my husband has found that works to control odor and does NOT irraratate his arm pits.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first thing I will say is after a couple decades of using a &amp;#34;sport gel&amp;#34; deodorant, this one took some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> package but this one is better priced for the same contents.</li>
            <li> I never realized these very powerful natural odor neutralizers existed.</li>
            <li> You are a clean person that showers daily and uses soap to clean your body</li>
            <li> You are a clean person that showers daily and uses soap to clean your body/</li>
            <li> (and he&#x27;s super into Cross Fit).</li>
            <li> It is a pleasant experience in this day and age to buy something that has lasting value and does not have to be thrown away after a short period of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also fits in the traditional spot on my Ogio locker bag pouch, which was another pleasant surprise as I do not need a second travel size</li>
            <li> It can be hard to believe that something like this is very effective until you try it.</li>
            <li> I live in South Florida (a true testing ground for any deoderant) and this stuff holds up all day.  </li>
            <li> My hubby even chose to switch over from conventional deodorant and it works better than ANYTHING else he&#x27;d ever tried (and he&#x27;s tried &#x27;em all!)</li>
            <li> Such a simple solution, but by far the most effective.  </li>
            <li> Doctor since I was getting a rash from every other kind of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t really care about the different chemicals that are in most deodorant sticks.</li>
            <li> I was getting armpit stains from wearing the Old Spice and wanted something more natural</li>
            <li> It really does last a year or more.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, I put it on right after a shower and then went golfing in the high heat (95F).  </li>
            <li> After over several months that reached well into the Rocky Mountain summer of using only it once a day immediately after an early morning shower, the answer to that for me was a surprising “Yes it certainly does, quite effectively, when properly used.”</li>
            <li> This product might have a high rating, but you have to consider the kind of people who go for this product - this is more a selective group and not really a representation of the public at large, despite being on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to me that a product like this, which seems to be the most natural and hence least harmful of any of them, works so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine in addition to many other types without success.     </li>
            <li> so I do not have much body odor in the first place</li>
            <li> It really works in these hot and humid summer days.</li>
            <li> After many years of using the typical \\&quot;speed stick\\&quot; deodorant, I would get a mild rash or burning in my armpit area.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it and would highly recommend it.    </li>
            <li> I now leave the top off of this stick so it can dry between uses.  </li>
            <li> Fragile and tends to easily slip out of plastic holder after a month or so.</li>
            <li> So nice not to be using chemicals, one less thing to worry about exposing your body to.</li>
            <li> I used to be brand loyal to Old Spice antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> it runs out too quick, yeah its natural, but i would wear this to sleep rather then go out in a night of clubbing.</li>
            <li> Maybe this isn&#x27;t necessary, but I tend to smell easily</li>
            <li> Good long lasting odor control   3)</li>
            <li> This one in particular is nice because I have broken more blocks than I have finished</li>
            <li> Made from a certain type of mineral salts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> It certainly could not hurt to avoid them.</li>
            <li> However, that was after more than a year of daily use, and I&#x27;m promptly replacing it with a new one, so I&#x27;m still giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li> If you shower at night and want to reapply in the morning, use some wet wipes or a clean, damp wash cloth to clean your arm pits again before you reapply.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brands get away with it because there in minimal regulation on ingredients used in their products and the chemicals they use are super cheap for them to buy.  </li>
            <li> Works best if applied right after showering to wet armpits, or wet the crystal, and give it a good 10-12 up and down strokes, then dry completely with a hair dryer (or by flapping your arms, which takes forever)!  </li>
            <li> But short of a using this on a commute from hell, this works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Personally I can use this during the summer just fine.  </li>
            <li> Either way, works just as well as any other deodorant without the strong fragrantly smell!</li>
            <li> this, I put it directly on clean, wet skin (right out of the shower before toweling off) and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> My wife said that she can notice a huge difference and has actually thought about switching herself.</li>
            <li> I received the product fast.</li>
            <li> I stopped using deodorant after I got an infection in my armpit because normal deodorant seemed to irritate it and after reading up on normal deodorants I found many articles about the potentially harmful chemicals found in them.</li>
            <li> This really works and has no odor at all.</li>
            <li> the whole cylinder of salt fell out and shattered on the floor.</li>
            <li> Very misleading.  </li>
            <li> This really works though, and as one sweaty man to another</li>
            <li> This deodorant has worked very well for me for years now.</li>
            <li> this way it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> My thanks to the manufacturer for bringing this to market.</li>
            <li> It burns my armpits but for his furry versions, it works really well.</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> (Yes, they still have anti-perspirant gels, but they used to have a straight deodorant gel too.)  </li>
            <li> This Crystal Body Deodorant really does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really sweat much either.  </li>
            <li> I still sweat just as much as before but there is no odor.</li>
            <li> find the crystal deodorant works very well.  </li>
            <li> But if you shower every day anyway, or you&#x27;re planning on leaving the country for an extended period of time, really consider this product.</li>
            <li> I never knew I could sweat so much while simultaneously smelling like nothing.</li>
            <li> For me, it also keeps me from sweating as much.  </li>
            <li> but it is really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Even though it says that there is no Aluminum in this product there absolutely is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so.&amp;#34; But really... think so.</li>
            <li> Very prompt service.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to wet it before use.</li>
            <li> You have to wet it to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> This is like really wearing nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> I use the crystal daily and it works to keep me odor free.  </li>
            <li> I would never have believed it but it really works to cancel odors.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Wet the top of the stick and re-wet it to apply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how much I put</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wet the crystal before you apply it.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> (Yes, they still have anti-perspirant gels, but they used to have a straight deodorant gel too.)</li>
            <li> This Crystal Body Deodorant really does the trick.</li>
            <li> weeks, no matter how much I try to bathe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would probably be ok to share an almost empty one but rinse it well before you do.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> It really does prevent any odor.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t deteriorated much at all.</li>
            <li> Really itchy armpits.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> The real test will be when it comes to summer as that is the height of BO season.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried one of these crystals before, you really should consider it.</li>
            <li> I use this after my morning shower, and I&#x27;ll go with no odor the whole day.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to use compared to the crystal I have used before that was not in a package like this.</li>
            <li> I really wonted to like the Crystal Body Deodorant Stick to work.</li>
            <li> It really works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t really care what color the package is.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> To him it didn&#x27;t seem like a salt rock was doing much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, the label says &amp;#34;For Men&amp;#34; and has some shirtless muscular dude flexing on the label to convince you how manly it is or something, but let&#x27;s be real...</li>
            <li> If I haven&#x27;t worked out or sweated much you might go two days, but I tend to use it</li>
            <li> crystal doesn&#x27;t really work to kill existing odor.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> And after all that effort, it really doesn&#x27;t work; not even close.  </li>
            <li> I know it says it&#x27;s for men, but it should say &amp;#34;For REAL men.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> After that it stopped working for us, it started burning the under arm to much.  </li>
            <li> , I really wanted to stick with the rock.  </li>
            <li> Wipe it around the whole area.</li>
            <li> My son LOVES this deodorant...and it really works...even in sweaty sports situations.  </li>
            <li> it is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> When I think about how much money I used to spend on some pricey P&amp;G product often, I cringe.</li>
            <li> And, for that reason, I&#x27;ve relegated it to the medicine cabinet where it will serve me well for the occasions I run out of real, unnatural, dependable deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> I switched over to powdered deodorant which no longer stained my shirts or irritated my armpits but none of the ones I tried did much to mask my odor</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Is chemical deodorant REALLY that</li>
            <li> is why it worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> I tried this and really, really wanted it to be a replacement for my Anti-Persperant Deoderant stick.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> no white residue oderles havent had to put more during the day really relieved with the idea of no harsh chemicals on my armpits anymore</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those people who have switched from the standard mainstream stuff, going to more natural based products tend to have a bit of an adjustment curve.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to some ingredient in most deodorants and antiperspirants several years ago.</li>
            <li> Definitely works better than my old one.</li>
            <li> no small at all!!</li>
            <li> and I do not want my deodorant to smell different than my cologne if I choose to wear cologne, which I very rarely choose to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could just nurse it along, but it is just a dang salt stick and not expensive, so at that point I toss it and order a new one.  </li>
            <li> It just pops right out if you tilt it too far.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper and better for you than all that other smelly stuff.</li>
            <li> This same brand has other good deodorants that are easier to apply, including wipes and roll-ons.</li>
            <li> Natural, odorant free, safe and long lasting!</li>
            <li> If highly active or on super hot days, this product may not be 100% effective at keeping body odor stink at bay, but on 95% of the days, I have had absolutely no problem.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;ll take some getting used to - most of my other deodorants (not</li>
            <li> first thing I used was hand sanitizer, and sure enough, I finally found the relief I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I still have the original stick and have only had to increase the height by 1 click.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any other deodorant that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting my husband one of these when his normal stuff is gone!</li>
            <li> Until now, I thought the 5-day deodorant pads worked better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I started using it 15 years ago in an effort to avoid aluminum and found it works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> No complaints from family, friends or coworkers regarding the efficacy of the product, and they would not hesitate to tell someone to clean up their act when necessary.</li>
            <li> But not with this salt crystal deodorant; I can be as active and confident in my activities as when wearing non-natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Label states that it should only be used on clean skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works fine, and lasts a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a solid job preventing odor and goes on clean.  </li>
            <li> You also might have to apply it about 2-3 times a day, but this is depending on many factors such as diet, activity, general body chemistry, etc., etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do about 12 to 15 full up and full down swipes per armpit.</li>
            <li> I do about 12 to 15 full up and full down swipes per armpit.</li>
            <li> everything went well, complete and fully functional thank you very much ..... was a pleasure doing business with you .....&lt;</li>
            <li> I have tried all the natural, no scent, easy on the skin products, and this was one of the only ones I found that worked.</li>
            <li> By late evening, I notice that I may sometimes begin to develop a slight odor, but it does an excellent job of protection all day.</li>
            <li> I mean that the most popular deodorants (Old Spice, even Dove) will make me break out in a red, smelly rash for days, sometimes</li>
            <li> I am fortunate enough to live a particularly stress-free life.</li>
            <li> The one downside - the effects will not last a full 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally made the switch to the crystal full time.  </li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant that hasn&#x27;t irritated my husband-</li>
            <li> It works, not worth the hassle to return, but could have been packaged better.</li>
            <li> Same holds true for my son.</li>
            <li> But in the first two days I noticed the redness under my arms is completely gone away.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see it lasting a full year.</li>
            <li> I am a big guy and sweet all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought mine with full intentions of sending back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Remember to store it upside down, or in a couple months you won&#x27;t be able to screw the stick up for application, as the crystals lodge between the plastic cover and stick.</li>
            <li> I work outdoors in the heat and this has not let me down in many years.  </li>
            <li> has hardly even worn down at all, so on top of working well for me, it seems very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Once you wet the stick, the product goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> This works better than my typical deodorant in regards of order protection.</li>
            <li> My underarms stay dry and odor free all day.  </li>
            <li> I have to use it as much as my older stick</li>
            <li> This is a decent item, with drawbacks.  </li>
            <li> I recently took a trip to the local drug store chain (that starts with a \\&quot;C\\&quot;) and found this deodorant on the shelf, for slightly more money, but it was the Potassium Alum version.  </li>
            <li> Others may not like the fact that you have to wet it for it to work, but in my book it&#x27;s far better than using an aluminum deodorant that may give me cancer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a solid &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; of deodorant so wasn&#x27;t sure how to actually use this.  </li>
            <li> More then likely I will only use this deodorant for the rest of my life</li>
            <li> This product works for me exactly as it says, even on a hot, humid southern day no smell at days end.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no scent to this stuff which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I found this product only marginally effective with not much to like about the packaging.</li>
            <li> contextualize that statement, I&#x27;m neither a particularly sweaty or odoriferous guy.</li>
            <li> If I sound surprised in the headline, I actually am - will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Finally if this is not working for you you may need to wash you pits more thoroughly when you shower and or trim back some of the hair.</li>
            <li> As as you age, you start to be a little more aware of using natural like products as opposed to chemical laden ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the generally positive feedback of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I am excited by the fact that it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Next, I am sitting here right now, two days without a shower or reapplying my deodorant with armpits that smell of absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I also use it myself and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for mineral salt deodorant.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Yesterday, for example, the high was 48 degrees.</li>
            <li> a grown man who has no time to smell like a junior high runt</li>
            <li> I have used natural deodorant for the past ten years and I have had pretty good results.</li>
            <li> i slowly but surely started noticing after using the product that it would fade so easily that it would literally last for up to maybe 20 minutes, and</li>
            <li> It certainly does keep any foul odors away for nearly all of the day.</li>
            <li> It certainly stops odor and is natural, so there&#x27;s not a ton to dislike.</li>
            <li> I decided to throw my Old Spice Pure Sport away.</li>
            <li> gave your underarm a little more motion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a scented spray version of this product, but it&#x27;ll run you a little more</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to do something strenuous, I might recommend using a touch of \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Deodorant For Men\\&quot; with Herbal Cowboy or something else over it, as Burt&#x27;s Bees is sticky on it&#x27;s own and can be hard to get out of clothes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to do something strenuous, I might recommend using a touch of \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Deodorant For Men\\&quot; with Herbal Cowboy or something else over it, as Burt&#x27;s Bees is sticky on it&#x27;s own and can be hard to get out of clothes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made a little cardboard shim to settle it down and it worked great.</li>
            <li> However not so much for my wife or my 29 year old son.  </li>
            <li> It is natural, does not cost that much, what do you have to lose.</li>
            <li> So the question for me clearly was, “Does the product work dependably as claimed as an underarm deodorant under long-term reasonable conditions?”  </li>
            <li> I spent the day sitting comfortably in a climate controlled office, didn&#x27;t exert myself or sweat whatsoever, and drank 6-7 glasses of ice water throughout the day.</li>
            <li> He goes to a Parkour class after school and his whole body is completely drenched in sweat afterwards</li>
            <li> For a couple dollars it was worth a try, especially if it had worked and lasted a year.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this working when I bought it, but so far, I&#x27;ve been highly impressed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I was in a college science class when I learned the harmful ingredient, known as aluminum, in most deodorants can possibly cause cancer with long term use.</li>
            <li> Normal deodorant</li>
            <li> Normally, take a shower in the morning, put on deodorant, office all day, workout in the evening after which I&#x27;ll stink and take another shower in the evening.  </li>
            <li> Also because of the application process it will last a while and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to last a long workout session, but for normal daily use/activity, a great product that doesn&#x27;t have chemicals or ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce and that actually works.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product that has become my everyday, go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li> Good idea behind it, but it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> It works if you follow the directions and apply right after you shower and wet the stone first.  </li>
            <li> I said earlier, I use it right after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Put it on right after toweling off after shower and you have just enough dampness for the crystal to glide on.</li>
            <li> The plastic tends to crack easily but more importantly the salt will break into sharp shards that are useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Love that the container is not pink (I believe that is the only difference between the original and this men&#x27;s version).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I can say that it is clean, fragance-free and lasts all day long..</li>
            <li> I was originally introduced to alum when I started wet shaving the with a DE razor about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I believe that the 1 year estimate is accurate, based on how much I have left and how long I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I live in the caribbean and we have just two seasons here: summer and hell.</li>
            <li> but I do live in Florida</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it, now.</li>
            <li> and think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;new age\\&quot; hippy dippy product, just give it a try.</li>
            <li> After using this, and asking my girlfriend, &amp;#34;What do you think of my new deodorant?&amp;#34; she replied &amp;#34;What deodorant?&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> You cannot ever drop it, or you&#x27;ll be buying a new one because it shatters.  </li>
            <li> I live in Miami</li>
            <li> popular and most selling deos are also anti-perspirants.&lt;br /&gt;Their modus operandi is to stop you from perspiring so you wont smell bad but would smell like the deo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad to have to kluge-up a good product like this...container fairly securely.</li>
            <li> The shape of this Crystal stick makes it easy to apply -and feels like a typical roll-on.</li>
            <li> Fully wet the crystal with clean water and apply it liberally to your underarms, I re-wet it between arms.</li>
            <li> Even though I sweat a tiny bit more, the sweat has absolutely no smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay more for pink packaging, this is the same thing.</li>
            <li> but I had to be extra careful to keep feeling confident.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wet it enough before applying so</li>
            <li> They do a decent job of inhibiting odor-causing bacteria while still allowing you to sweat naturally.</li>
            <li> story short: This product works, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a natural, safe alternative to conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li> I was usually able to find just a plain deodorant without anti-perspirant, but over the past few years they are becoming more scarce.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers here I can testify it is a natural deodorant that works fine.  </li>
            <li> It feels very natural, and I no longer have any feeling of dryness, or irritation in and around my armpits.</li>
            <li> Thus, I highly recommend using the clear &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and a bunch of allergies, and this stuff didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Just because something is “natural” does not mean you should put it on or in your body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants in the past.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this and WOW!</li>
            <li> This has been working for me pretty well, but I definitely will never be using crystal by itself again.</li>
            <li> This has been working for me pretty well, but I definitely will never be using crystal by itself again.</li>
            <li> Other products residues would prevent my skin from breathing properly and would result in MORE sweat when I wasn&#x27;t working out or our in the heat</li>
            <li> It actually holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, this summer I decided to try something not usually found in a supermarket or convenience store and looked to Amazon reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;womens&amp;#34; version of this product, and they both work exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> My family and I recently relocated to Singapore from Houston, and the weather here is hot and humid year around.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what type of person this works for, but isn&#x27;t me that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> In the end I went back to anti-perspirant because of the hot summer days.</li>
            <li> , I am in the shower every AM and pretty nutty about personal hygiene.  </li>
            <li> and I sweat pretty easily especially in this summer heat, but even after mowing the lawn, no smell!</li>
            <li> [if you’re not careful the stone can dislodge from the container and could very well shatter if it hits the sink, tub, or floor].</li>
            <li> i used this product the first day i got it, BIG MISTAKE!</li>
            <li> I wish there was a natural product that prevented sweating under pits, but 5 stars for order protection!</li>
            <li> The first week until the regular deodorant was completely scrubbed off my underarms, yes, after that, never!</li>
            <li> I freshen up in the afternoon, usually with Brut deodorant stick, on most days.  </li>
            <li> Further, it actually feels more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; under my arms without any residue there - and there is no material left on my clothes either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone camping and used this stuff on the first day and not stunk until the 3rd or 4th day.</li>
            <li> , over 20 years later, they are finding a higher incidence of Alzheimer’s in the people of this town.</li>
            <li> The first seller backed out because it suddenly did not have the item in stock.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much a solid form of a mineral rock</li>
            <li> Going on my second year with my first one.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit worried I would spent my bucks on this product at the beginning, specially because it is more expensive to bring this to Panama by a special mail service.    </li>
            <li> But honestly it would have been the same with other regular deodorant...</li>
            <li> I previously used Tom&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> There is a reason chemical deodorants were developed, and they DO work better than this, so if you have no problems with your gel stick, or whatever, this is definitely NOT better.  </li>
            <li> where it&#x27;s been 95 degrees or more for the past 3 months with humidity near 1,000,000% I can put it on in the morning and not go to bed stinky.     </li>
            <li> I actually used it for the first time, went to the driving range and was totally surprised at the result.</li>
            <li> And not only is it not bad for you, it actually works.</li>
            <li> I do wish the packaging were more durable for such a long lasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that feeling doesn&#x27;t seem to last long (couple hours at best).</li>
            <li> Also, mine came in contact with a sink full of water with other soaking times and it literally vanished.  </li>
            <li> so whether I used this or not, the result was more or less the same.</li>
            <li> The only think is that you have to be careful not to let it fall, it will break easily.  </li>
            <li> When I got pregnant, my homemade deodorant, which had been working great, stopped working, the body odor was bad all the time and even my husband&#x27;s regular deodorant couldn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on easy enough but you have to wonder if you are using too much water to wet the end or not enough.  </li>
            <li> and I have a hard time buying that it does more than not using deodorant at all, except for</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that a hard rock was going to combat my B.O. :-)</li>
            <li> I have used Mennen for more years than I can remember, but I more frequently have been getting bad rashes from using it.</li>
            <li> It has always worked perfectly and I cannot remember the last time I smelled bad from sweat.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet but is the same thing as another product I have used and it works very well and is all natural.</li>
            <li> My Face Natural Deodorant I was trying wasn&#x27;t doing anything.  </li>
            <li> This natural stick is what everyone should use.</li>
            <li> but so far its done what It promised</li>
            <li> It works well for razor burn, and then I discovered it can also be used for a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> This intrigued me, because I have sensitive skin and found that anti-perspirants caused irritation.  </li>
            <li> Remember, the rock will probably last the whole year.   </li>
            <li> I have used anti-perspirant deodorant for all of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a complete fix for me.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> He can now apply deodorant to his underarms without it stinging like his old ones used to.</li>
            <li> But, I tried it again the next day, this time without much activity, and I intentionally smelled my pits throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Thought this was all natural</li>
            <li> I wanted all natural vegan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you, its still masculine.</li>
            <li> I even went scientific on this and applied it to only one arm for an extended amount of time and didn&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li> Stick deodorants have PCBs that are linked to breast cancer and this is totally natural, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> However, I understand BO is a direct result of the bacteria that feeds on elements in our sweat, and this product eliminates the growth of said bacteria in the area it&#x27;s applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also pleased that I don&#x27;t have to expose myself to the harmful elements found in common antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My husband and I were looking for natural alternatives as far as deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting with how much coverage is necessary</li>
            <li> It does not mask my natural scent at all.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always surprised.  </li>
            <li> It states \\&quot;100% Natural Mineral Salts\\&quot; and \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> I want to like this stick so much, but after two weeks of feeling like I constantly need to check myself to see</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just naturally when I will start to stink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 61 year \\&quot;old guy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After using this a whole year I had to come back and downgrade my review.</li>
            <li> but I think there&#x27;s to much chemicals in our daily lives.</li>
            <li> It is all natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not anti-perspirant, you will sweat, but no harsh chemicals either.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals and does not leave armpit stains on my shirts.</li>
            <li> finally figured out that underarm bacteria is the primary cause of body odor, and for some reason, daily showers just weren&#x27;t enough to fight the bacteria.  </li>
            <li> but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t completely help</li>
            <li> I used chemical spray deodorant with anti-perspirant before this and frequently developed itchy sore rashes on my armpits.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Ingredients are natural mineral salts...</li>
            <li> As far as reducing body odor, when my wife got home from work this evening, she asked me if I had already mode the lawn.</li>
            <li> She was surprised that I had, and made a comment on the fact that I was not stinky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No chemicals and all natural.</li>
            <li> If you were to really max one of these out, I&#x27;m guessing that it will last for a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Natural.</li>
            <li> and I would prefer to use something natural, but</li>
            <li> It turns out that is a sensitive part of the skin, that is why some medications are delivered via underarm applicator!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that its natural and not chemical based.</li>
            <li> Male,70 yr old, 70in tall.</li>
            <li> Have been using natural mineral salt for deodorant for years and this one is the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li> But, I guess not for now still looking for something natural.</li>
            <li> I guess that comes along with the territory of using any all natural deoderant that doesn&#x27;t conatin aluminum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this is not heavy duty stuff.</li>
            <li> I shattered 2 so far when they hit the floor.</li>
            <li> This is a natural product and truly natural products do not keep your body from doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> You might be surprised.</li>
            <li> makes my husband smell-free and it is not sticky and natural.</li>
            <li> Plus it is all natural.</li>
            <li> As far as protection for just going out etc, it works fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am allergic to every deodorant I have tried, even all the natural ones like Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with a natural shampoo and toothpaste as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just switched to old spice where this is not a problem, and old spice doesn&#x27;t ruin my shirts either.</li>
            <li> I found that I had to re-wet the tip a couple times to get complete coverage of my armpits.</li>
            <li> Still using it a year later, definitely recommend for those who aren&#x27;t heavy sweaters (may be good for them too, cannot personally attest to that).</li>
            <li> not bad, last long...</li>
            <li> The next day my skin was fine, no redness or itching like some of the other deodorants I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell like your natural clean self, maybe a little bit of cologne.  </li>
            <li> the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that you can just put it right on out of the shower because you have a bit of moisture still on you, so no need to wet it then.  </li>
            <li> I do put it on right after showering while my underarms are still wet.</li>
            <li> Not 24 hours, but if you groom your armpit, this little boy will last pretty much the whole working day.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You have to be patient and really shake it out to prevent this, but if your like me there are other things you would rather be doing than getting ready in the morning, so</li>
            <li> It just simply wasn&#x27;t, it would last a whole day if I wasn&#x27;t doing any physical activity, but if I went for a walk, or worked outside in the yard, things got stinky fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I swipe the Crystal up and down my underarm 20 to 30 times quickly.</li>
            <li> You will pay a lot more and a little of this does go a long way.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not going to have the usual cologne mixed with your own aroma coming from your armpits but rather a neutral body scent mixed with whatever soap you use.  </li>
            <li> Sure, I don&#x27;t smell, and that&#x27;s cool, but I get to smugly smirk at those rubbing weird white gunk on their pits, or spraying some spray that smells like horny 14 year olds.</li>
            <li> If I was a construction worked in Texas pouring concrete in the middle of August, I&#x27;d be more understanding, but I suggest you try the alternatives out there if you do anything other than spend your time in a coma.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a pain in the ass to put on without getting drips, it&#x27;s also not safe for granite counter tops and to top it off</li>
            <li> I am a male and in general I don&#x27;t really smell a lot.</li>
            <li> She uses Tom&#x27;s of Main as she has to have a deodorant, but I keep it simple.</li>
            <li> Other deodorants I&#x27;ve used (right guard, Brute, Speed Stick) would leave me with some B.O at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> and I must say Im pleased, had it for 2 days now but have yet to use it under more harsh circunstances since its quit cold and havent sweat that much so</li>
            <li> The third time unfortunately, I did shower, and had to go to clinical skills, so I made sure to wet the top of the rock with water and spread it on me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Experiment to figure out how much pressure is needed and how long to apply for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to diminish the odor created by normal daily perspiration.</li>
            <li> And by all means wet it, under hot water, before applying it.</li>
            <li> You do have to wet it first.</li>
            <li> it takes a few days to get full effectiveness but from then on you are well protected without the use of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars simply because it DOES work, and it&#x27;s certainly not as bad as other deodorants on the market.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make it through a full day if I&#x27;m golfing (in the desert) or hit the gym hard but a normal day,</li>
            <li> Hint: if the stone comes loose a small piece of friction tape around the perimeter of the very bottom of the stone will lock it into the container fairly securely.</li>
            <li> I started developing a rash from the baking soda in my recipe and after trying multiple new recipes nothing compared to the power of baking soda/coconut oil.</li>
            <li> After talking to several friends and roommate who have used it at some point in their life, they all agree with me.pplied it to only one arm for an extended amount of time and didn&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li> I really believe this will last for the entire year if not longer.  </li>
            <li> Being a physically active and athletic older adult male (running, weightlifting, tai-chi, etc) I really wondered if this product was even worth trying since it contains virtually none of the typical deodorant antiperspirant chemicals of</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes the smell was gone completely, and I stayed fresh the rest of the day and night.  </li>
            <li> --it simply doesn&#x27;t work after a few hours in a comfortable environment.</li>
            <li> By and large, you&#x27;re going to get a mix of hippies, open minded people and new agers - not those who have been using axe, old spice or other mainstream</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as he has very sensitive skin and tends to break out in a rash several months after using deodorant.  </li>
            <li> The block started smelling a bit after using it for deodorant, but it wasn&#x27;t anything major.</li>
            <li> no other smells to compete with my cologne.</li>
            <li> This Crystal Body Deodorant Stick is exactly the same stuff that&#x27;s sold in the purple plastic case; it&#x27;s only labeled differently to appeal to men (or people who don&#x27;t want a purple container).</li>
            <li> No other deodorant has even come close</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s a major Zumba person going sometimes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I simply apply right out of the shower with wet underarms</li>
            <li> (I don’t have a strong body odor), but it&#x27;s a noticeable smell which regular deodorant usually covers up.</li>
            <li> I originally got this stick because I hate the way deodorant can cause pit stains on nice shirts, so I figured this would not do that.</li>
            <li> Works, not as well as traditional deodorants, but decently all the same.</li>
            <li> Not that other deodorants don&#x27;t work, but of the half dozen or so I&#x27;ve tried the past few years, I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> Not that other deodorants don&#x27;t work, but of the half dozen or so I&#x27;ve tried the past few years, I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> I was smell free and have been for the past several months now!</li>
            <li> Two pictures clearly showed that the only ingredient is Potassium Alum (an actual natural ingredient), however that is not the case.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but I&#x27;d rather not use something that tries to pull a fast one on me with something else.</li>
            <li> So, I used an old shaving alum block for a while, until it started to break apart, then began the search for a specific alum deodorant and was recommended this.    </li>
            <li> All in all, though, I&#x27;m a big fan of natural and holistic remedies.  </li>
            <li> I took this into consideration going into this product, as it&#x27;s only a salt stick, and even for natural things this is far different from the others out there.</li>
            <li> From time to time I try to switch back to newer deodorants that are supposed to be for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Aluminum Chlorohydrate\\&quot; but upon closer inspection of the ingredient list on the back, it lists \\&quot;Natural Mineral Salts,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a number occasions when my deodorant has let me done; apparently it&#x27;s a fact of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay maybe I exaggerated with that last revelation but it works really well</li>
            <li> The only small problem with this salt crystal is that it takes some extra more time applying than with regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perspiration is a natural human body function</li>
            <li> , one tip is you have to apply liberally when wet, I do pretty much my entire side and up my arm</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re a like me and only sweat moderately with normal body odor, this product should work</li>
            <li> To get rid of these cracks, you just have to keep using it, and it will slow smooth out again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are like me and take minimal showers, every 2-3 days/ only after the gym and such i recommend having this and another gentle normal deoderant for inbetween days or when not wearing white t-shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m now on my second order of this deodorant, as the first one had the crystal sent into the sink and shattered into a number of pieces due to the plastic body giving out during use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strange adjusting to using it instead of more traditional antiperspirants or deodorants that just rub on with a single swipe.</li>
            <li> This is one has a masculine clear bottle while the cheaper one is a pink purple bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me several unexpected benefits were that it is total fragrance-free itself — if you use a preferred scented bath soap that’s how you’ll smell, it is completely stain-free to clothing, and the manufacturers aren’t exaggerating when they imply one stick will last a year — possibly longer.</li>
            <li> It will last all day if you are not active.</li>
            <li> I did try it one day before my shower, to see what would happen, and it actually made the smell worse instead of better.    </li>
            <li> It definitely wasn&#x27;t as effective when I was just applying it at random times, EG while already sweaty/smelly.  </li>
            <li> Regular deodorants cause me major rash problems.</li>
            <li> I do reapply the stick before any major physical activity.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine doing the same program spent 25 dollars on 6 sticks of regular higher end deodorant assuming each stick would last&#x27;em 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Apply to wet skin right out of the shower and don&#x27;t wet the stone.</li>
            <li> One thing to note, when you use this product, you have to apply it when you are right out of the shower (still wet), and you have to wet this deodorant in the sink also before applying it, or else it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> If it lasts half that long it will be worth it in savings alone.</li>
            <li> Even if the thing shatters, you can still usually salvage enough large pieces to use while you&#x27;re waiting for your new stick to arrive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the chemistry or any of that, but it does what it says it will and apparently will last forever.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it was a fungal thing similar to athletes foot.</li>
            <li> For the first few days everything worked as promised, there was no smell.</li>
            <li> It might sound silly, but slowing down 3-5 times more to apply deodorant without getting wet gets on your nerves just a bit, especially if it doesn&#x27;t provide results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But to me this “lack” can also be viewed as a plus since subjecting my body to the potential contamination of absorbing these complex non-metabolizable chemicals never seemed very smart, especially as I got older (and maybe a little wiser, who knows?).</li>
            <li> Put it on when clean, wet it, give it a few days to get acclimated.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> The tabs that slide the crystal up and down became worn too much to slide into the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also make sure to press down hard on 5 or 10 of those strokes.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t live an &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; lifestyle by any means, I did develop concern about my periodic underarm rashes and the chemical buildup that occurs when using typical deodorants daily on those sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to this product, I have had zero breakouts under my arms and seldom even have itchy underarms at all.</li>
            <li> A brand of deodorant I had used for years was discontinued, so since I was trying a new brand anyway, I thought I&#x27;d try something a little healthier/more natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about that yet, but I can certainly tell that it is going to last considerably longer than the store brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about that yet, but I can certainly tell that it is going to last considerably longer than the store brands.  </li>
            <li> Sweated, and was pretty much the only one in my party that didn&#x27;t smell at the end of the day (this sealed the deal for me btw)&lt;br /&gt;Got married and ran around NYC (another humid day) in a tux sweating like mad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marked all of my yellowed shirts I owned prior to using this deodorant with a black dot on the tag and bought a new set of white shirts.</li>
            <li> it is just like any other normal deodorant in the fact that is deodorizes and keeps you from sweating.  </li>
            <li> it is just like any other normal deodorant in the fact that is deodorizes and keeps you from sweating.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to subject my 10 year old son to all the chemicals in an antiperspirant and the natural deodorants</li>
            <li> They boast that it lasts &amp;#34;one year&amp;#34;, yet in only a few months, when more than half of the product is left, the adhesive comes loose, the crystal falls out, and shatters all over the floor like glass.  </li>
            <li> Although this is NOT an antiperspirant I think that the other chemical filled deodorants actually cause excessive</li>
            <li> This solid stick has worked extremely well to keep me from becoming offensive, at least from a scent standpoint.</li>
            <li> I probably apply a little too much when I use it, but I want to ensure I&#x27;m getting it on since I can&#x27;t feel that it is there.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you smell good, just STOPS you from smelling bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad to have to kluge-up a good product like this...</li>
            <li> I bought the men&#x27;s version as it was the exact same as the women&#x27;s except the label is black instead of pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider myself normal - no body odor problems, typically smelly</li>
            <li> Still, this rock/crystal version might not be useful for heavy perspiration, but I haven´t tried other formats.    </li>
            <li> Mitchum, Certain Dry and others that worked for a short time but usually left me itching and irritated, and sweating after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 33 year old active male.  </li>
            <li> Caution: don&#x27;t run water directly on it or it will eventually create sharp points.</li>
            <li> also use this product because my skin breaks out with other deodorants, even the sensitive skin varieties.  </li>
            <li> I get out and towel dry my body, BUT, I do not dry my armpits.  </li>
            <li> but for some strange reason it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Once I did not wet it enough before putting it on so it did not really go on.  </li>
            <li> The second drop went into the toilet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll still last a long time and no&lt;br /&gt;more white stains on my shirts.</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff last a long time, it does eliminate underarm odor.</li>
            <li> It worked partially for the first few months</li>
            <li> decent for hairless people, but you have to rub the dead skin off, as this thing makes a layer of skin stick together instead of falling off microscopically.</li>
            <li> I started with a small stick to test it and have been ordering the large size sense.  </li>
            <li> but I was tired of using the white flaky deodorant and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try, thinking \\&quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure this won&#x27;t work but for less than 7 dollars it won&#x27;t kill me if it doesn&#x27;t and at least it&#x27;s not toxic\\&quot;     Lo and behold</li>
            <li> It was hard to believe at first</li>
            <li> no matter how hot the summer day is, or how hard you exercise.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have any scent to it (as advertised), so I&#x27;m not sure that it really was of any use as a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The crystal stick will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, I can tell this deodorant will last a long time.</li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line:  non-poisonous, long lasting, and keeps the stink away.</li>
            <li> how long this deodorant will last</li>
            <li> Long lasting and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> Turns out it last so long they don&#x27;t get money from selling you them.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover up odor and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> For something that should take ten seconds, this takes way too long.</li>
            <li> These last a long time.</li>
            <li> I do not know if the chemicals I&#x27;m regular deodorant are harmful long term or not.</li>
            <li> It has been in the 90&#x27;s here lately, and I do not stink at the end of the day and my underarms are relatively dry in comparison to Right Guard.</li>
            <li> It will last you long but it does not do what it is suppose to do!</li>
            <li> I originally switched to natural deodorant to avoid all the harsh, unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> This product works well and seems like it will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I wear it daily and from time to time I will have a very minor odor but that is just life.</li>
            <li> It seems like this will last a very long time too.  </li>
            <li> I think he could care less about using a natural product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any less sweating, but there is no odor, no staining of your clothes, and no messy residue.</li>
            <li> and then I apply it all around under the arms and make maybe twenty movements (with the regular paste or dry deodorant</li>
            <li> I have always purchased it from local retailers and could only find the pink colored container.</li>
            <li> The stick is a heavy block contained within a fragile clear plastic case.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works for me, but I am not a super stinky guy in general.</li>
            <li> This actually keeps me dry all day long.</li>
            <li> The disadvantage is you have to clean up well before using it, unlike your common deodorants that you can literally keep in your car and just apply whenever you feel a little stinky.  </li>
            <li> I was so irritated by this malfunction, I set this product under my sink as back up plan if I run low the other brand of crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have tried other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products and they left me stinking after a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely continue using it, but I&#x27;m not against trying other products for the aforementioned reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really works -- hard to believe.  </li>
            <li> Great product I have been using this for about a month now and have very little bad things to say about it.</li>
            <li> I have average body odor, applied as directed to my underarms, daily, and used it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> No more burning underarms from regular deodorants like Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> I decided to switch to Deodorant only and ditch Antiperspirant, but I was still slathering myself in Propylene Glycol, dyes and fragrances for no apparent reason other than my consumer brainwashing dictating that was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon closer inspection when I received this thing, it states &amp;#34;(Ammonium Alum)&amp;#34; which is not a natural ingredient despite advertisement.</li>
            <li> In the long run I think that would be a plus though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll check myself after a few hours from time to time to ensure it is still working and am always surprised to discover there is no odor at all.</li>
            <li> While you do have to wet the stick prior to applying it to your underarms, this doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit.</li>
            <li> Working out, yard work, long day at work.</li>
            <li> Same as the pink version (which appears to be marketed towards women).</li>
            <li> I have never broke using normal deodorant so not sure why I did with this product.</li>
            <li> but as long as I apply it once a day it seems to work.  </li>
            <li> Like that it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This product has a long life too...</li>
            <li> One stick lasts a long time&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I think I save money from what I spent on traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li> Traveled 4 days on long haul flights.  </li>
            <li> but it lasts a long time--usually a year or so.</li>
            <li> I plan to reorder although I will have to wait for a year as it lasts that long.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son because he is in the military and wanted a deodorant only product.</li>
            <li> I only left 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days.</li>
            <li> formerly used the cyrstal deodorant that comes in the pink container.</li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s power is relative to the amount you sweat, so this could only last a few hours, depending on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crystal Body Deodorant for years and saw the \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; version, which is the same as the pink packaging.  </li>
            <li> few years ago a friend of mine owned a health food store and recommended an early version of this product.</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of the mineral salts.</li>
            <li> Has no smell and feels strange when putting it on..</li>
            <li> works only under minimal activity.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> After one week of normal use, I&#x27;ve cracked the top and base of the packaging</li>
            <li> Half a star off for a little to much &#x27;play&#x27; in the applicator.</li>
            <li> bought this item not for smell but because other deodorants cause severe yellowing in white shirts for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the other brand next time, to see if they attach the salt cylinder to the plastic housing in some way.</li>
            <li> The plastic packaging is fragile and if it chips it can get sharp and cause irritation in the armpit.</li>
            <li> Same goes for a lot of other things when dealing with marble and granite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (same problem as other users report),</li>
            <li> When I used to use the stones, they would occasionally slip out of my hand while wet and shatter into a thousand pieces on the floor!</li>
            <li> Based on how little has been used, this one purchase will likely last years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually saving money since I&#x27;m not buying deodorant every other week now.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t last all day if your exercising or doing some other strenuous activity that gets you sweating</li>
            <li> I am usually very skeptical about organic and new age, really to the point where I steer well clear of anything remotely hippy-ish.</li>
            <li> The deodorant stick itself lasts a very long time, even when you use it every day.</li>
            <li> We put it on after our showers but don&#x27;t dry your pits.  </li>
            <li> After showering, I will dry myself except for my armpit.</li>
            <li> I splash it under my arms and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry without all the chemicals and staining.</li>
            <li> Once my body is dry, I apply the product to my armpits.  </li>
            <li> you happen to dry your armpit when you get out of the shower</li>
            <li> I can literally let my workout shirt dry</li>
            <li> After you dry off, immediately apply the crystal (after wetting it).&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> Either that or put it on immediately after showering but before you dry off.</li>
            <li> Use immediately after a shower and allow armpits to air dry.</li>
            <li> so, after my morning shower, I don&#x27;t dry my underarms and immediately put the deodorant on.  </li>
            <li> I feel dry for about 10-12 hours.  </li>
            <li> If you apply immediately after a shower I would just lightly dry your pits before applying this.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t dry out if I leave the cap off.</li>
            <li> I stayed mostly dry all day, not irritated and not embarrassed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really dry and in order to apply it you need to put some cream or water</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just apply it to dry skin as if it were a gel, because it is not a gel.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical; now all I can really say is \\&quot;wow,</li>
            <li> According to ammoniumalum.com, \\&quot;A mineral salt, also known as aluminum ammonium sulfate, is a white crystalline double sulfate of aluminium that is chemically synthesized and manufactured to be used in  industrial application and everyday consumer products.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Looks like a stick will last months if not a year, for the price of a commercial gel anti-perspirant that lasts a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for everyone to at least try.</li>
            <li> My shirts were destroyed and my underarms were like a pale olive drab yellow relative to the rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> True, there might be a little bit of sweat, but at least it does not smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use conventional deodorant for a month and move back to this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to conventional.</li>
            <li> Too different from conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li> I keep an almost empty container in my vehicle and it tends to dry out and crack after being in the heat for too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t think this does nothing or that it&#x27;s complete crap, but it really just doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it could take care tiny nicks on my face after the occasional poor shave (as potassium alum is a natural astringent), however this thing is just unnatural trash.</li>
            <li> It was quite strange taking a chunk of minerals getting them wet and applying to your armpit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dry my pits after the shower and just apply it dry to my wet skin liberally.</li>
            <li> When I take 2 pills of Chlorofresh every night, Not only is the additional odor that I am producing due to diet completely eradicated but also the noxious odor I would generally produce from frustrating or stressful days combined with especially long and strenous workouts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the performance of the deodorant I&#x27;ve ordered several other Crystal Rock products in other configurations.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product at first until my wife got some for my teenage son.</li>
            <li> You have to wet it to apply, or just don&#x27;t dry your pits after you shower</li>
            <li> only half day, i have to apply twice a day.</li>
            <li> will easily last you a year (I&#x27;d say 2 and a half is about</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s because Crystal only slightly works, or</li>
            <li> On some days where I&#x27;m out in the heat or sweating extra, I&#x27;ve noticed by the end of the day a slight smell of BO..</li>
            <li> Previous deodorants with in 3 weeks would start to show yellow stains.   </li>
            <li> You have to wet it to apply, or just don&#x27;t dry your pits after you shower</li>
            <li> I have found that if you rub it for any less time or forget to use it, it actually takes a couple of days to work again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other fancy deodorants but all had failed the ultimate test of tough conditions such as sweating from workouts etc.  </li>
            <li> What I mean is that your body takes some adjustment until it \\&quot;gets into the swing of things\\&quot; with a new product.</li>
            <li> Getting it wet beforehand is a slight nuisance, but not a big deal.   </li>
            <li> Lasting Time - I sweat quite a bit less than the average male and also have very minimal body odor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe in spending $10 for a bar of shower soap, but this little gem seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ... apply carefully, as it did sting the arm a little outside the prescribed area.</li>
            <li> From personal experience, just one of these things will last for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s basically a rock, just get it wet and rub liberally on your pits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to wet the rock before applying...</li>
            <li> You need the water on your skin for the rock to get wet.  </li>
            <li> Apply it while your underarms are still wet.</li>
            <li> take a shower, leave your armpits wet and apply it thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> So if you aren&#x27;t going to take a shower before wearing you still need to wipe your armpits with a wet cloth, or a cleaning</li>
            <li> It last throughout the day even after heavy gym sessions, until I take a shower at night.</li>
            <li> You wet it and rub it on.</li>
            <li> I wet my underarm at the sink instead of wetting the Crystal under running water.</li>
            <li> I wet it and apply it and</li>
            <li> It seems contradictory, but remember to wet it before using, and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> The will claim there really is no difference between using Potassium Alum and potassium aluminum chlorate (which is found in antiperspirants).  </li>
            <li> You need to apply it to wet skin or hold the tip under the faucet to wet the stick and then apply it.</li>
            <li> really no smelly body odor anymore after my workout?</li>
            <li> Also eliminates wet underarm stains during the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few products where their advertisement is actually an understatement.</li>
            <li> others have mentioned, you need to either have damp armpits from the shower or wet the stone.</li>
            <li> Armpits must be wet to apply.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> (so I leave the pits wet and then apply this immediately).  </li>
            <li> and it is not sticky or wet.  </li>
            <li> Just wet it and apply under arms.</li>
            <li> your armpit needs to be wet</li>
            <li> Works, just give it some time and wet it before applying.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no scent&lt;</li>
            <li> I like the ease of using it without trying to not drop a wet block of crystal.</li>
            <li> I imagine that this product is identical to the one in the pink container.</li>
            <li> However, I did have someone ask me why I had a pink deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much of a well kept secret.  </li>
            <li> so I can put it under and make it wet</li>
            <li> this is a rock must be wet to apply.</li>
            <li> Lasted a lot longer than I had ever expected, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People&#x27;s chemistries differ, so your mileage may vary</li>
            <li> I wanted and expected this to be my go-to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same stick everyday since January 2014</li>
            <li> I still go back to my Speed stik when I know I will be around people while perspiring heavily.</li>
            <li> I like to wear cologne and as such I try to avoid heavily scented products that could clash.</li>
            <li> have really wet armpits.</li>
            <li> tends to break in the center.</li>
            <li> Also, its a bit of a drag to have to wet the end with each application.</li>
            <li> In addition, Your underarm must be partially wet in order for the stick to slide.</li>
            <li> It basically feels like rubbing a wet plastic ball on your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I still have a long ways to go before it&#x27;s down to nothing.</li>
            <li> When my brother told me that regular commercial brand deodorants contained aluminum in it and it could have serious side effects.</li>
            <li> Instead run the water into your other hand and dip the crystal into the hand to get it wet.</li>
            <li> When you wet the stone it starts to erode and causes sharp edges like glass on your tender pits.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this one &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; is less costly than the pink container containing the same product &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34;, but that is my sole complaint about this product.  </li>
            <li> I started using them instead of the regular chemical powdery sticks because the white mess left behind from them.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of deodorant for at least 23 years, this specific brand as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I sweat constantly, when i am hot, when i am cold and when i am just sitting doing nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Personally I much prefer Herban Cowboy, but because I hate to just toss things out, I use the crystal first and then apply Herban Cowboy over it.</li>
            <li> Personally I much prefer Herban Cowboy, but because I hate to just toss things out, I use the crystal first and then apply Herban Cowboy over it.</li>
            <li> The product seemed to make some cleverly disguised false claims.   </li>
            <li> I think the only drawback to this stuff is that after some use, the solid piece of crystal shrinks enough to make it difficult to stay in the twist-up container, so it&#x27;s prone to slipping out of the holder and smashing on the sink/floor/counter/etc.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, this does very little, if anything.</li>
            <li> And other deodorants just mask the smell, rather than prevent it.</li>
            <li> You can also put the stick for no more than a second under the running water, then apply it to your underarms.   </li>
            <li> cause then its sharp</li>
            <li> On the plus side, no more itchy red arm pits, and no more yellow arm pit shirts.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I found that running water on the Crystal could cause fissures (think dissolved caves) that could get sharp edges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No powder or other types of stains    </li>
            <li> You can even use it on other body parts like your feet.      </li>
            <li> And other than the packaging, I don&#x27;t think this \\&quot;Men&#x27;s\\</li>
            <li> It works on your other parts too.</li>
            <li> He was using Degree, or some other mainstreamer, before Crystal.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it would work if someone regularly smelled.</li>
            <li> Even if I had to replace the crystal every other month, I would come out ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think this is due to water eroding the connection between the stick and the plastic.  </li>
            <li> No more under arm stains on white shirts.  </li>
            <li> You can even use it on other body parts like your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other is Dove Men +Care    </li>
            <li> Has helped provide a solution to my allergies with other deodorants and anti-perspirants.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, and at the end of the day, I am a bit gamey smelling.  </li>
            <li> So if you sweat a lot, this isn&#x27;t going to help you with anything other than killing the bacteria in your pits to reduce stink.</li>
            <li> if you try to use it the sharp edges do pose a problem.  </li>
            <li> no more white skin when I go swimming</li>
            <li> no more yellowing armpits of my white tee shirts!</li>
            <li> I guess it was due to the sweat?</li>
            <li> What I ended up doing was applying other stuff, in addition, for some scent.</li>
            <li> I trashed all other brands.</li>
            <li> It can help when used along with other things to help minimize odor.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical, but followed what others said.</li>
            <li> In other words, it&#x27;s still aluminum.</li>
            <li> He started using this because was getting rashes from other deodorants.  </li>
            <li> just the other day it was 91 degrees with humidity making it feel like 103 degrees</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be switching back to the usual deodorants EVER.</li>
            <li> If you happen to dry your armpit when you get out of the shower, just put a little water in your hand and rub it into your armpit and then apply the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Be very careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s an active guy - coaches basketball, plays basketball, works out... knows how to work up a sweat.</li>
            <li> how active you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for going to work, I use a conventional deodorant/anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> I also tend to sweat a bit less after applying the product, though that could just be due to a placebo effect, having the peace of mind that I do not smell.</li>
            <li> 3 is the average.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li> Despite that, this product only works for about 3-4 hours, then promptly loses its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh, and it had a 4.5+ star average.  </li>
            <li> It does work, if you use it religiously and rub it across your skin for at least 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> but it will stop it from getting worse and over time I&#x27;ve found the scent lightens and eventually goes away entirely (over a few to several hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This one is my third one, and each of the previous two lasted at least three years.</li>
            <li> and I must say it has not let me down yet..</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even look like it&#x27;s gone down at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember to store it upside down to not let the moisture drip to the bottom and dissinigrate the stone at the bottom.</li>
            <li> has not let me down</li>
            <li> So after 22 months I am down grading this product from a 5 to a 4.  </li>
            <li> Tips for making it lasts the longest 2+ years is to remove any moisture from the stone when done and turn the product upside down for storage.</li>
            <li> some have suggested wetting it so the water does not run down the sides of the mineral stick.</li>
            <li> I store mine upside down to prevent water dripping down into the container and molding.  </li>
            <li> I broke it down for him</li>
            <li> Giving yourself a quick \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; like you do with chemical deodorants under your shirt is impossible with this type of product.  </li>
            <li> I even feel like I sweat less.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a year and a half and no matter what, I do not stink.</li>
            <li> of baking soda or less, plus 1 tsp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for half a year and can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s been used at all.  </li>
            <li> The previous stick I had (Thai Crystal brand) lasted for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> This was slightly less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for half a year and can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s been used at all.</li>
            <li> Looking for a less chemical deodorant and found this.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my work shirts started to have a slight order.</li>
            <li> is wet the crystal and rub it wherever you sweat the worse (especially the armpit).</li>
            <li> It is NOT an antiperspirant, but will not irritate your pits like some of the typical sticks or roll-ons used today.</li>
            <li> Plus it is slightly cheaper.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work like a typical deodorant in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched to this deodorant because the one I was using previously was aluminum based, and it was ruining my shirts.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wary of how long it&#x27;ll last due to being a spray version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very active and play tennis, cardio which results in sweating like a fiend.  </li>
            <li> You have to \\&quot;wet\\&quot; the stick before application, but the problem is, when you wet it and apply it, water drips out of the bottom of the applicator and usually goes all over you, so don&#x27;t try to apply it while you&#x27;re wearing clothes.  </li>
            <li> It has absolutely no odor, so if any of you ladies are worried about smelling like a dude, then worry no more.</li>
            <li> but once you get past the feeling of wet pits, you realize that the sweat doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically buy spray-on deodorants, so I&#x27;m a little unsure.</li>
            <li> The one drawback I&#x27;ve noticed is, sometimes if I&#x27;m wearing a tight undershirt and have a sweaty day, my shirt will start to pick up an odor even though my pits themselves won&#x27;t stink at all.     </li>
            <li> The one drawback I&#x27;ve noticed is, sometimes if I&#x27;m wearing a tight undershirt and have a sweaty day, my shirt will start to pick up an odor even though my pits themselves won&#x27;t stink at all.</li>
            <li> It lasts two people over a year and half before replacement, and has made regular deodorants just feel weird and dry.</li>
            <li> Works better then all the others that don&#x27;t have all the nasty chemicals, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that for any other deodorant I&#x27;ve used in the past.     </li>
            <li> , just put a little water in your hand and rub it into your armpit and then apply the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> little inconvient that I always have to water it before applying.</li>
            <li> Then smearing it all around the arm pit area, not just in one little spot.</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Little to no odor at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You cannot use this on skin that doesn&#x27;t have a little water on</li>
            <li> After 2 months it shows little to no use.</li>
            <li> i would sit there and smell a little stinch coming from my under arms,</li>
            <li> Stink is not desirable, so this stuff works by making your sweaty areas uninhabitable to the little bacterium that like to feast upon your glands&#x27; biproducts.</li>
            <li> No more irritation/itching from other brands.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a little funk that rears</li>
            <li> Putting it on in the morning, I start to have a little BO by the evening.</li>
            <li> Just apply a little water, and apply.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but it works.</li>
            <li> what a little salt can</li>
            <li> The stick arrived from AmericaRx bouncing around in a too-large box with a tiny bit of padding; of course the crystal stick was broken in half.</li>
            <li> if I smell bad, I feel like I am going to have to revert back to my old deodorant.</li>
            <li> In the winter time, I tend to have to wear multiple layers, because it&#x27;s cold outside, but the subway is heated.</li>
            <li> It worked well for a few hours and then faded in ability to keep the odor at bay.  </li>
            <li> Have always had trouble with mass market products.  </li>
            <li> The product lasts longer than you can imagine and I am a heavy user, 1-3 times a day depending on my schedule.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I&#x27;ve never been all that \\&quot;stinky,\\</li>
            <li> Aside from that, the stick is somewhat \\&quot;loose\\&quot; inside the applicator and has trouble maintaining its position, and does wobble a bit.  </li>
            <li> Waste of $7.</li>
            <li> So, today, I was careless and didn&#x27;t watch how far I was tilting my hand while using it and</li>
            <li> My wife already broke her salt cylinder a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, I could smell my manly stink without a doubt.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I kept checking my pits the 1st few days</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I sweat heavy</li>
            <li> I read some reviews how people said how messy it was to use and how water drips everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> That did take me a few days to get useto</li>
            <li> I workout approximately three hours daily and the majority of my workout is cardio.</li>
            <li> That is, after any few hours I&#x27;ll stink.  </li>
            <li> It needs watter to work, too heavy to carry around.</li>
            <li> few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I destroy one by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it has a few quirks that you should know about.    </li>
            <li> I used this for a few months and still got a rash under one arm, so I suppose that&#x27;s some progress, but still not achieving the goal.  </li>
            <li> time it may or may not develop semi-sharp cracks after approximately 3-4 years of daily usage (I use mine 1-2 times a day).</li>
            <li> Sometimes if you run it under water it leaves your pits sopping wet and that sucks.</li>
            <li> i have used it everyday</li>
            <li> and it might not stop heavy odor.</li>
            <li> I did find that I have to rub it quite a few times, but after about a week of use</li>
            <li> Hey, it does not work for heavy perspiration.  </li>
            <li> and I work outdoors in the FL Everglades year round.</li>
            <li> No more deodorant marks on black shirts.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this now for a year and haven&#x27;t worn it down hardly at all.</li>
            <li> Or at a minimum, after wiping down your armpits at least (sponge bath).  </li>
            <li> A bit odd to say the least.</li>
            <li> But a little hard to use on hair pits.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t really smell bad</li>
            <li> problem number two shocked me when the lid of the product was not responsive to closing very well</li>
            <li> I like that this item will last me for 2+ years, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that it will randomly quit out on me.</li>
            <li> Ill try and see what happens on my next jog</li>
            <li> After using this deodorant, I have no more BO; also, it has reduced my arm pits&#x27; sweating to almost none.</li>
            <li> They just wrote back, again, defending their failed system.  </li>
            <li> but when you read the small print it says it contains Ammonium Alum.  </li>
            <li> No, it is not healthy.  </li>
            <li> If it last a month than it has already paid for itself and there is nothing for me to be angry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> Since using the deodorant stick I will usually apply 7 am or so, and I begin to smell by about 11 am.</li>
            <li> I try to take the chemical out, without going overboard.</li>
            <li> not sure why it&#x27;s marketed to men.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is that after extended use, some air bubbles in the mineral salt surfaced and got scratchy, making it uncomfortable to apply to my skin.</li>
            <li> No more burning, irritated pits.</li>
            <li> Hooray ... no more itchy armpits ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a small block of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My rating is 4-stars — 5-starts for the products itself, but minus a star for the rather poorly designed stone retaining mechanism of the plastic container</li>
            <li> If I find this stuff to not work well in a few weeks I will update my review!</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure why it&#x27;s just advertised as being for me, both genders use it.  </li>
            <li> No more rash</li>
            <li> /&gt;update: after some usage wetting it repeatedly, it falls out of the case and usually cracks on the sink or floor.</li>
            <li> I use the women&#x27;s version (by the way, they&#x27;re the same) and bought this for my boyfriend who was SO skeptical...</li>
            <li> and I can smell a small amount of body odor coming from them</li>
            <li> and I hardly notice it after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not had any negative reaction to the product.&lt;br /&gt;Under sweaty conditions</li>
            <li> This means I generally Stink like crazy, from the mouth, the pits, everywhere.</li>
            <li> IT DOES completely prevent unpleasant body odor.  </li>
            <li> The applicator sadly has not lasted nearly as long as the stick at the 16 month mark.</li>
            <li> Also the stick itself lasts a long time so it might seem expensive</li>
            <li> I also get annoyed of having water from the moistening of the crystal drip down my side all the time, even if I shake it out.</li>
            <li> It was hard to tell if anything was even going on.  </li>
            <li> and I have a really hard time buying that it does.</li>
            <li> A friend told me that he had to use hard pressure and cover the area 5-6 times to make it work for him&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crystal breaks or cracks when it hits hard surfaces and</li>
            <li> Hard to believe it works so well.</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to use.....</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It was making the underarm area of my shirts all hard like cement.  </li>
            <li> I wanted it to work so bad, however I&#x27;m still looking for a product that is natural and works.</li>
            <li> Have some common sense in how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have some common sense in how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;The container</li>
            <li> My mother has already commented on my lack of smell, since I usually smell unpleasant, to say the least, when I come back from the gym.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I like my deodorant to match or at least compliment the cologne</li>
            <li> Was getting really crazy with aluminum chlorohydrate in regular deodorants and did a ton of research and found this product.  </li>
            <li> I say at least because I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> At least with this, I&#x27;m not offensive with my body order.  </li>
            <li> Other deodorant brands are doing it WRONG.</li>
            <li> I was using an expensive brand name for extreme B O.</li>
            <li> That is probably why some of the guys (not many) are getting poor results.</li>
            <li> its a serious matter because there are still no studies to prove that</li>
            <li> Seriously, it should be on Discovery channel or something.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because when I use secret or dove it makes my odor worst like its masking the smell, plus it usually doesn&#x27;t last all day long.</li>
            <li> I was told to give this product a try and was a little skeptical because it does nothing for perspiration control.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at 1st but after using it for about 2months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m was a little skeptical since this contains an alum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a bad rash if I didn&#x27;t rotate to different brands often.  </li>
            <li> So, I thought this stuff was no good.  </li>
            <li> Prior to finding this I was always frustrated with deodorants or anti-perspirants in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> and I believe that stopping your body from sweating is not a good answer.</li>
            <li> Neither of us use an antiperspirant as it is not good for the body.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this product however, I was using 5-day deodorant pads EVERYDAY to control perspiration odor.</li>
            <li> But, also note that body order is not because you naturally stink, it&#x27;s because of crap you put into your body.  </li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot before going back to store bought and was highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this word in an Amazon review before, but this product SUCKS!</li>
            <li> So this has been a disappointing waste of money.</li>
            <li> I never used it, just annoyed by how it worked.</li>
            <li> When I read that Antiperspirants are cancer causing and deodorants use unhealthy ingredients I started doing research.</li>
            <li> If the bacteria have time to grow and they leave a scent behind, Crystal will not make it go away immediately</li>
            <li> It arrived with the plastic case broken, so I&#x27;m deducting a star for that.</li>
            <li> Please note though that if this doesn&#x27;t work for you, a poor diet and toxins in the body might be the cause.</li>
            <li> You can even use it on your feet, although that&#x27;s fairly unnecessary for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> What was frustrating, in my experience, is that while my pits did not smell at all, my shirt pit sometimes did.</li>
            <li> and I think using this is worse for you than using a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for months now and it has hardly decreased in size.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th one in a year already because they have broken, fallen out of the case, etc.  </li>
            <li> The additives in your tap water is worse for you.</li>
            <li> There was no smell at all, well maybe a slight smell of table salt, but very faint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years after hearing bad stuff about conventional deodorants.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After receiving a bad burn from a conventional aluminum based deodorant product, I did the research on this product and was amazed.</li>
            <li> Those little bacterium make your stinky areas smell bad as a result of their metabolizing the stuff you secret, so if you make yourself inhospitable to them, then they can&#x27;t do that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can get through an 8 - 10 hour day of hard exterior work without stinking too bad, but I am not a rose when I get home.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ugly little head.</li>
            <li> It frustrated me because if you see that your actual armpits do not smell badly, then you would hope/think that your shirt pits didn&#x27;t smell, but that wasn&#x27;t always the case for me.</li>
            <li> Deodorant is hard to find in Korea and very expensive.  </li>
            <li> this product is very weak and unprotective.</li>
            <li> When I twisted the lever, the deodorant slumped over.</li>
            <li> Well, I was a bit skeptical about this stuff, but on the advice of some friends, bought a stick to try out.      </li>
            <li> You may be skeptical just like I was</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t they listen to their valued customers and fix this repeated problem that happens 100% of the time making their product useless ????  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this deodorant after all</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to find just deodorants without antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> know it sounds weird</li>
            <li> i guess some men are uncomfortable using unisex products.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of how well this would work.  </li>
            <li> So needless to say he did not continue using</li>
            <li> Alright, I was skeptical about rubbing a moist rock under my arm for deodorant.</li>
            <li> Even if you are skeptical take a chance with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> No need to comment that I&#x27;m wrong.  </li>
            <li> Since he has a stoma and it is a very difficult procedure for him to take a regular shower, now he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about body odor OR the knots, which were very painful.</li>
            <li> The elements used in name brand products are clinically linked to cancers and other horrible diseases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it does for some reason that would be rather disappointing</li>
            <li> That way I do not get my crystal stone dirty by using it on an unclean armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That way I do not get my crystal stone dirty by using it on an unclean armpit.  </li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t apply it to a dirty armpit because the odor will transfer to the deodorant stick and it will take some time for it to go away.</li>
            <li> and he smelled terrible a few hours post shower.  </li>
            <li> antiperspirant/deodorant is very expensive in Singapore, and I haven&#x27;t seen any fragrance-free options here.  </li>
            <li> For those that have commented to me saying it&#x27;s impossible for this product to have a scent - In my opinion it does</li>
            <li> Maybe I happen to get a bad one, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I literally lack any bad odor period.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, and this rock had block the bad odor and also the quantity of sweat.</li>
            <li> Aluminium is bad.</li>
            <li> And whatever odor-absorbing, excretion-preventing, long-lasting tonics they put into the mainstream pit cream - those are bad too.  </li>
            <li> I will say this however, if you have really bad BO, you may want to use additional help as this may not cut it.</li>
            <li> bad?&lt;br /&gt;Probably not as bad as what you eat.</li>
            <li> My burns were bad from the chemical / metal based product.  </li>
            <li> Plus there is a question about how things containing aluminum would be bad for you.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see the ingredients as ammonium alum while the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;natural body deo are potassium alum.</li>
            <li> Sprays worked, but I hate them.</li>
            <li> One of my sticks broke at the base</li>
            <li> While this is annoying, the crystal is basically a rock, so I don&#x27;t mind if I have to touch it with my hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot base the way this product works on myself as I can go days not using a deodorant without any issues.  </li>
            <li> Blech.</li>
            <li> It is embarrassing and annoying too.</li>
            <li> were not working for him because he has really, really bad BO!</li>
            <li> it works!\\&quot; I always hated antiperspirants because, well, we sweat for a reason,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I could fully recommend it for anyone who sweats profusely or with very bad body odor since it doesn&#x27;t stop sweat</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This one lets me sweat all I want without developing the nasty tang from having a bacteria colony under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I figure at worst</li>
            <li> I deducted one start for the terrible applicator, and another star for just the nature of its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> and I have the ability to have a real bad stench in hours if I do not use deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have the ability to have a real bad stench in hours if I do not use deodorant.  </li>
            <li> it even get&#x27;s boring), I will try it again in another format.    </li>
            <li> This product has got to be the worst \\&quot;wanna be\\&quot; deodorant i have ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband has used this for years and works great for him. Paid a very reasonable price for this product and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to give it a try as the Kiss My Face Natural Deodorant I was trying wasn&#x27;t doing anything.  I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed with this either.  I bought the men&#x27;s version as it was the exact same as the women&#x27;s except the label is black instead of pink and it was several dollars cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easy enough but you have to wonder if you are using too much water to wet the end or not enough.  How much/long do you rub it under you arm?  It worked well for a few hours and then faded in ability to keep the odor at bay.  For a couple dollars it was worth a try, especially if it had worked and lasted a year.  I used it for a couple months and now it sits under my sink as I try another brand.</li>
            <li> No stinky da male &amp; no killa de Hubby. Wifey like!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical; now all I can really say is \\&quot;wow, it works!\\&quot; I always hated antiperspirants because, well, we sweat for a reason, right? And other deodorants just mask the smell, rather than prevent it. This one lets me sweat all I want without developing the nasty tang from having a bacteria colony under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you apply it correctly - it&#x27;s basically a rock, just get it wet and rub liberally on your pits. I have heard that some people have more alum-resistant body flora, but for me, this is a clear winner.</li>
            <li> I noticed this deodorant works well. I have to use it as much as my older stick yet this one is safer and I guess that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Have always had trouble with mass market products.  I&#x27;d get a bad rash if I didn&#x27;t rotate to different brands often.  I first bought the Body Spray, but the spray/pump was too positionally sensitive &amp; must be held perfectly upright - not the best design, but I&#x27;d the product &amp; it worked so well I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Takes getting use to since it has to be &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; to put it on, but it drys quickly &amp; works great just like the Crystal Rock Body Spray - - no odor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the performance of the deodorant I&#x27;ve ordered several other Crystal Rock products in other configurations.  The container makes it easier to hold than the &amp;#34;rock&amp;#34; version/configuration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s biology is different, so that maybe why some reviews indicate it didn&#x27;t work for everyone.  In my case, this is a great alternative to the chemicals in the more common mass market products.  If you need an alternative give this a try it maybe the answer.</li>
            <li> Works well, but must be reapplied much more often than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; deodorant/antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I received the product fast. The turning mechanism didn&#x27;t work properly. When I twisted the lever, the deodorant slumped over. Maybe I happen to get a bad one, I don&#x27;t know. It seems this twisting case is a cheaper quality compared to another brand I used. I was so irritated by this malfunction, I set this product under my sink as back up plan if I run low the other brand of crystal deodorant.</li>
            <li> Well, I was a bit skeptical about this stuff, but on the advice of some friends, bought a stick to try out.      I work in a factory as a technician.  I work 12 hour shifts repairing 450 degree ovens.  I sweat a LOT.  Other deodorants I&#x27;ve used (right guard, Brute, Speed Stick) would leave me with some B.O at the end of the day.  This stuff has no scent at all, so I didn&#x27;t think it would work.  But, at the end of a day where I can ring my shirt out, my pits don&#x27;t smell at all, so it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.      After about 2 months of use, I can&#x27;t actually tell that I&#x27;ve used any of it either.  It looks just like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent deodorant protection. Works best if applied right after showering to wet armpits, or wet the crystal, and give it a good 10-12 up and down strokes, then dry completely with a hair dryer (or by flapping your arms, which takes forever)!  Odorless, non-sticky and no residue, however sometimes I follow with regular antiperspirant/deodorant just for smell.</li>
            <li> I like that this item will last me for 2+ years, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that it will randomly quit out on me. Maybe it&#x27;s do to the changes of my work, but I can not find a way to keep this working more consistently for me throughout the day.</li>
            <li> You may be skeptical just like I was but this product works.  Please keep in mind, this is not an antiperspirant, this is a deodorant.  I have not had the chance to test it during the dog days of summer yet but I figure at worst, I may have to apply it again during the day.  I will find out in the coming weeks.  The bottom line is that even if it takes a second application on the hottest days it will be better than the chemical deodorants.</li>
            <li> I am a breast cancer survivor.  I tell everyone - please do not use any deodorants containing aluminium.  This natural stick is what everyone should use.</li>
            <li> This is very possibly the best deodorant I have ever used.  So, why is everyone using the chemical stuff?  I simply apply right out of the shower with wet underarms and it is simple and effective to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use chemical anymore, try this fine product!</li>
            <li> Kind of wierd to use, takes time to get use to it but it does work!</li>
            <li> I stopped using deodorant after I got an infection in my armpit because normal deodorant seemed to irritate it and after reading up on normal deodorants I found many articles about the potentially harmful chemicals found in them. So I looked for an alternative and found Crystal Body Deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or so now and I like it. It takes care of the stank and truely fights bacteria without any harmful chemicals.    The cheap plastic container the salt rock is in was cracked when I got it, but it still works fine.    The price is fine and it looks like it will last for a long time so the price is actually great.    I don&#x27;t like having to wet the rock before applying...if the plastic container was designed better than it wouldn&#x27;t be such a problem.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me (smelled by the end of the day) but it has been working for my wife.  We put it on after our showers but don&#x27;t dry your pits.  You need the water on your skin for the rock to get wet.  It was hard to tell if anything was even going on.  I kept moving it around and around and around to be SURE it was going on.  Still didn&#x27;t work though.  I would give it 1 start, my wife would give it 5 stars...3 is the average.</li>
            <li> First time user and I must say Im pleased, had it for 2 days now but have yet to use it under more harsh circunstances since its quit cold and havent sweat that much so Ill try and see what happens on my next jog but so far its done what It promised leaves no white residue oderles havent had to put more during the day really relieved with the idea of no harsh chemicals on my armpits anymore so Ill put it to the test and leave more feedback.</li>
            <li> Two pictures clearly showed that the only ingredient is Potassium Alum (an actual natural ingredient), however that is not the case. Upon closer inspection when I received this thing, it states &amp;#34;(Ammonium Alum)&amp;#34; which is not a natural ingredient despite advertisement. I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you, but I&#x27;d rather not use something that tries to pull a fast one on me with something else. So this has been a disappointing waste of money. I bought this hoping it could take care tiny nicks on my face after the occasional poor shave (as potassium alum is a natural astringent), however this thing is just unnatural trash.</li>
            <li> It kept falling apart. I never used it, just annoyed by how it worked.</li>
            <li> This really works and has no odor at all. Also, does not irritate my underarms as many did. Caution: don&#x27;t run water directly on it or it will eventually create sharp points. Instead run the water into your other hand and dip the crystal into the hand to get it wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably saved $1000&#x27;s by now as I&#x27;ve used the crystal or liquid crystal for almost 11 years now. The product lasts longer than you can imagine and I am a heavy user, 1-3 times a day depending on my schedule.</li>
            <li> This is a decent item, with drawbacks.  I was originally introduced to alum when I started wet shaving the with a DE razor about 5 years ago.  It works well for razor burn, and then I discovered it can also be used for a natural deodorant.  This intrigued me, because I have sensitive skin and found that anti-perspirants caused irritation.  I was usually able to find just a plain deodorant without anti-perspirant, but over the past few years they are becoming more scarce.  So, I used an old shaving alum block for a while, until it started to break apart, then began the search for a specific alum deodorant and was recommended this.    First, let me say, it does not work as well as chemical deodorants.  If you have a lot of body odor, you&#x27;ll find yourself applying this several times a day.  Fortunately, I&#x27;ve never been all that \\&quot;stinky,\\&quot; so I can get away with twice a day, whereas a chemical deodorant I would generally only have to apply once after a shower in the morning.  I find having to apply the Crystal after morning AND evening shower, otherwise it will not last.  So, be forewarned, if you&#x27;re expecting it to perform exactly like your chemical deodorant that you are giving up, it won&#x27;t.    Next, although not necessarily the fault of the product, the application of it is cumbersome.  You have to \\&quot;wet\\&quot; the stick before application, but the problem is, when you wet it and apply it, water drips out of the bottom of the applicator and usually goes all over you, so don&#x27;t try to apply it while you&#x27;re wearing clothes.  Giving yourself a quick \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; like you do with chemical deodorants under your shirt is impossible with this type of product.  Aside from that, the stick is somewhat \\&quot;loose\\&quot; inside the applicator and has trouble maintaining its position, and does wobble a bit.  Not a deal breaker, but be aware.    All in all, though, I&#x27;m a big fan of natural and holistic remedies.  It&#x27;s worth the negatives, for me, not just for that, but for the fact that I no longer suffer from any irritation or \\&quot;itching\\&quot; under the arms from chemical anti-perspirants.  I deducted one start for the terrible applicator, and another star for just the nature of its effectiveness.  There is a reason chemical deodorants were developed, and they DO work better than this, so if you have no problems with your gel stick, or whatever, this is definitely NOT better.  I promise if the deodorants on the market didn&#x27;t irritate me like they do, I&#x27;d still be using them.    EDIT:  If you read the comment by Arthur (below), he speaks some good sense.  I recently took a trip to the local drug store chain (that starts with a \\&quot;C\\&quot;) and found this deodorant on the shelf, for slightly more money, but it was the Potassium Alum version.  If you order it from here, chances are you&#x27;ll get the Ammonium Alum version.  Now, using the Potassium Alum version, I&#x27;m getting much better results in the form of longer-lasting odor protection (though still NOT as long-lasting as a chemical deodorant).  So, my advice to you is to find this stuff at a local pharmacy, and make sure it&#x27;s the Potassium Alum version.  Learn from my mistake.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this working when I bought it, but so far, I&#x27;ve been highly impressed. Even after 24 hours with me packing to move in between it kept all odor at bay. I admit that even after using it a couple weeks it still feels \\&quot;weird\\&quot; compared to traditional deodorant since it simply feels like you forgot to put any on at all. In the long run I think that would be a plus though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As has been said it&#x27;s NOT an antiperspirant, so if you sweat a lot and are looking for something to help stop/impair that, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it works... and it works really great!!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works and last for over a year.  I started with a small stick to test it and have been ordering the large size sense.  I could still use the old one but it cracked on a trip and has rough edges.</li>
            <li> I read a couple reviews before buying this and I decided to give it a shot. I have been using this deodorant for just three days now and all I can say is that no deodorant/antiperspirant on earth can be compared to it.. I went for 3 stars because I need to experience its performance overtime. So I will update this review in three months from now, or if I notice it stops working..   If it takes a whole year to actually finish the stick/rock as others have said, then I can qualify this purchase as the best money I have spent..   So far, I can say that it is clean, fragance-free and lasts all day long.. I live in the caribbean and we have just two seasons here: summer and hell. After using this deodorant, I have no more BO; also, it has reduced my arm pits&#x27; sweating to almost none. I would totally recommend this.   Just follow the instructions.   1. Never apply it without first taking a shower. Ensure your underarms are clean.   2. Apply it while your underarms are still wet. Otherwise it will hurt a lot and probably will not work. You can also put the stick for no more than a second under the running water, then apply it to your underarms.   3. Be generous and be sure to cover the whole area. Remember, the rock will probably last the whole year.   I&#x27;ll keep you informed!  -------------------------  Hi there! It&#x27;s been almost three months since I have been using the deodorant and I must say it has not let me down yet.. Go ahead and buy it.. It works very well! :)</li>
            <li> Does not work. Waste of $7.</li>
            <li> In effort to rid my world of some chemicals and toxic metals I found this product.  I have used anti-perspirant deodorant for all of my adult life.  I am very happy to say that I am now free of plugging my pores and spreading Aluminum and other toxic chemicals in them. This product works well and seems like it will last a very long time.  Just wipe it on after you shower while still damp and you are good to go.  I haven&#x27;t seen how this will perform during the summer but so far it works great and keeps odor away for the entire day for me with one application.</li>
            <li> I have emailed the manufacturer about once a year for five years, pleading with them to secure the crystal to the bottom inside of the container with better adhesive.  They just wrote back, again, defending their failed system.  They boast that it lasts &amp;#34;one year&amp;#34;, yet in only a few months, when more than half of the product is left, the adhesive comes loose, the crystal falls out, and shatters all over the floor like glass.  Why don&#x27;t they listen to their valued customers and fix this repeated problem that happens 100% of the time making their product useless ????  THE CHAIN IS A STRONG AS THE WEAKEST LINK  When will they EVER learn ???</li>
            <li> Update (01/28/2013) Months of use and I have no additional yellowing in white t-shirts, at all.  This is definitely a complete fix for me.&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and take minimal showers, every 2-3 days/ only after the gym and such i recommend having this and another gentle normal deoderant for inbetween days or when not wearing white t-shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item not for smell but because other deodorants cause severe yellowing in white shirts for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I marked all of my yellowed shirts I owned prior to using this deodorant with a black dot on the tag and bought a new set of white shirts. I&#x27;m going to wear them for a while and I expect that yellowing in the armpits will no longer occur.  If it does for some reason that would be rather disappointing but I will contact the manufacturer and update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As smell goes.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it completely eliminates it! It&#x27;s truly awesome.  Other deodorant brands are doing it WRONG. I even feel like I sweat less. Although this is NOT an antiperspirant I think that the other chemical filled deodorants actually cause excessive sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just take a shower, leave your armpits wet and apply it thoroughly.  Do not expect it to work on unclean skin.  So if you aren&#x27;t going to take a shower before wearing you still need to wipe your armpits with a wet cloth, or a cleaning wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.  Smell like your natural clean self, maybe a little bit of cologne.  Way better than reeking of BO or reeking of strongly scented deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants in the past. It wasn&#x27;t until I was in a college science class when I learned the harmful ingredient, known as aluminum, in most deodorants can possibly cause cancer with long term use. That&#x27;s when I decided to do my research and find a product without aluminum. I came upon two products without aluminum, which were Crystal and Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorants. I judged between the reviews and realized most people like the crystal deodorant more, so I gave it a shot and I am quite happy.     I&#x27;ve been using Crystal deodorant for about a year now. The deodorant stick itself lasts a very long time, even when you use it every day. Trust me, even with every day use of this product you won&#x27;t have to worry about purchasing a second one anytime too soon. You&#x27;ll be good for OVER a year because I got mine about a year ago and I still have a long ways to go before it&#x27;s down to nothing. I can&#x27;t say that for any other deodorant I&#x27;ve used in the past.     While it&#x27;s intention is to be a deodorant, not an antiperspirant to reduce sweat, it greatly helps to eliminate odor by using all natural ingredients. I&#x27;ll check myself after a few hours from time to time to ensure it is still working and am always surprised to discover there is no odor at all. True, there might be a little bit of sweat, but at least it does not smell! While you do have to wet the stick prior to applying it to your underarms, this doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit. I normally apply it right after I get out of the shower in the morning, so it&#x27;s perfectly fine with me. Others may not like the fact that you have to wet it for it to work, but in my book it&#x27;s far better than using an aluminum deodorant that may give me cancer. I&#x27;ll take wetting my deodorant over cancer any day.     I love it so much that I purchased one for my boyfriend. He recently became allergic to aluminum found in his deodorant, causing it to sting whenever he uses it, so I&#x27;m doing him a favor by getting him this one instead.     Overall, I love it and would highly recommend it.    UPDATE (July 29th 2011): I would just like to add that my boyfriend loves this deodorant as well. He can now apply deodorant to his underarms without it stinging like his old ones used to. So this is excellent for those who are allergic to aluminum!</li>
            <li> just perfect, healthy deodorant with out any danger chemicals, it works great, no perfumes, no aluminium and is great to know what You putting on Your skin [[ASIN:B000L978FU Crystal - Crystal Stick Body Deodorant, 4.25 oz sticks]]</li>
            <li> I have a hyperactive sweating problem (hands, feets, armpits, ect.).  It&#x27;s super awesome...but I have found that I sweat less with this product and the smell of my perspiration has been greatly reduced as well.  I have nothing but good things to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most deodorants and so I can&#x27;t use them, they just don&#x27;t work on me and cause a rash. A friend recommended this product to me and it&#x27;s been a life saver! I don&#x27;t get a rash and it works great! A dongle stone says about a year with daily use. I apply after I shower in th morning, one tip is you have to apply liberally when wet, I do pretty much my entire side and up my arm, if not you may notice its not working too well.</li>
            <li> My routine: Shower in the morning, including washing my armpit with shower foam. After showering, I will dry myself except for my armpit. The reason is that moisture is needed for an effective application. Then I will rub the crystal on my armpit about 12 to 15 times. Put on my clothes and I am done! It last throughout the day even after heavy gym sessions, until I take a shower at night. As all our lifestyles are all different, it is up to you to find the most effective way or day of the time to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crystal stick will last for a long time. And most importantly, Amazon&#x27;s price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> I have used natural deodorant for the past ten years and I have had pretty good results. I originally switched to natural deodorant to avoid all the harsh, unnecessary chemicals. My natural deodorant of choice worked moderately well, but I decided to search for something better and I&#x27;d heard great things about mineral deodorants. I decided to try this and WOW! There is NO odor at all. Of course, I still sweat, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about the smell involved. Like others have said, I can tell this deodorant will last a long time. I very highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The deodorant worked well for me. Getting it wet beforehand is a slight nuisance, but not a big deal.   The problem is that the cylinder of salt is not attached at all to the plastic housing. It just pops right out if you tilt it too far. So, today, I was careless and didn&#x27;t watch how far I was tilting my hand while using it and the whole cylinder of salt fell out and shattered on the floor. My wife already broke her salt cylinder a few weeks ago. I&#x27;m going to try the other brand next time, to see if they attach the salt cylinder to the plastic housing in some way.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product at first until my wife got some for my teenage son. That boy&#x27;s pits could muster up a stank that could choke out a full grown moose without deodorant. So I was quite amazed when he started using this only and did not smell at all. I got this for myself and it works great.</li>
            <li> This works Perfectly fine!! You wet it and rub it on. The problem for me is that I had to rub it on numerous times for it to work so Id sit their and rub for a couple minutes each morning (thats the reason for 4stars) Do not drop or break it either cause then its sharp and it hurts to put on. Besides that the product worked and was great!!</li>
            <li> Great solid form of the spray. Remember to store it upside down, or in a couple months you won&#x27;t be able to screw the stick up for application, as the crystals lodge between the plastic cover and stick. Most deodorants you have to apply daily, this one seems to be good for two days every with tub or shower daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty suspicious guy but I was tired of using the white flaky deodorant and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try, thinking \\&quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure this won&#x27;t work but for less than 7 dollars it won&#x27;t kill me if it doesn&#x27;t and at least it&#x27;s not toxic\\&quot;     Lo and behold it does actually work. I don&#x27;t spend a ton of time outside but I do live in Florida where it&#x27;s been 95 degrees or more for the past 3 months with humidity near 1,000,000% I can put it on in the morning and not go to bed stinky.     I&#x27;ve read that you build up a tolerance to this stuff over time. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks.     I&#x27;ve read there is still aluminum in this. Do your own research before buying.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference started using maxim and I don&#x27;t sweat anymore</li>
            <li> Summer is perhaps not the best time to test this. It is ok.  Remember that it does contain aluminum.  I guess the advantage is that it provides more applications than regular stick deoderant.  It is not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, I put it on right after a shower and then went golfing in the high heat (95F).  After a few hours, I could smell my manly stink without a doubt.  So, I thought this stuff was no good.  But, I tried it again the next day, this time without much activity, and I intentionally smelled my pits throughout the day.  There was no smell at all, well maybe a slight smell of table salt, but very faint.  So it worked great in those conditions.    So, I conclude that this is great for a normal, non sweaty day, but I wouldnt trust it during a workout.    On the plus side, no more itchy red arm pits, and no more yellow arm pit shirts.  So I will stick with it.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> Very misleading.  Thought this was all natural but when you read the small print it says it contains Ammonium Alum.  I wanted all natural vegan. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It will not keep you from sweating, but you will not stink. I have been using for a year and a half and no matter what, I do not stink. Working out, yard work, long day at work. I am always odorless. I don&#x27;t dry my pits after the shower and just apply it dry to my wet skin liberally. Works like a charm. And I&#x27;m not putting all those deodorant toxins on my skin. I am usually very skeptical about organic and new age, really to the point where I steer well clear of anything remotely hippy-ish. This really works though, and as one sweaty man to another I&#x27;ll tell you, its still masculine. The science is basic. The salt stays on your skin all day killing the bacteria that cause the stink. That&#x27;s all it is. The applicator sadly has not lasted nearly as long as the stick at the 16 month mark. But that is another selling point as I have not bought or used deodorant in 16 months. Family, friends, and coworkers swear they can&#x27;t smell me. I will purchase again here in a year or two when it finally runs out.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I am on a Ketogenic Diet. This means I generally Stink like crazy, from the mouth, the pits, everywhere. Byproducts of Fat metabolism (Ketones and Acetone) are exuding from every pore. When I take 2 pills of Chlorofresh every night, Not only is the additional odor that I am producing due to diet completely eradicated but also the noxious odor I would generally produce from frustrating or stressful days combined with especially long and strenous workouts. I literally lack any bad odor period. I do combine this product with the Thai Rock salt deoderant on my private areas which now also lack any odor whatsoever. These 2 products are fantastic and I am going to be a customer for life. I never realized these very powerful natural odor neutralizers existed. The Thai Rock salt has no Aluminum also so it is much healthier than the chemical laden deoderants most people use. Also this Deodorant seems to last forever, So not only is it more effective, and healthier, but also more cost effective!</li>
            <li> This deodorant has worked very well for me for years now. This one is my third one, and each of the previous two lasted at least three years. I use it in my gym bag. Prior to finding this I was always frustrated with deodorants or anti-perspirants in my gym bag. My bag is often thrown in the trunk of my car, where it gets hot. The solid products would all melt and get all over my bag. The roll-ons would leak out, I think because of thermal expansion. Sprays worked, but I hate them. Then I found Crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come up with my own way of using it that is a bit different than the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;- I wet my underarm at the sink instead of wetting the Crystal under running water. I found it applies smoother. Plus, I found that running water on the Crystal could cause fissures (think dissolved caves) that could get sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;- I swipe the Crystal up and down my underarm 20 to 30 times quickly. Normal deodorant I just use 2 or 3 swipes. I think the reviewers that complain about it not working don&#x27;t apply enough. Don&#x27;t worry, it will still last years.&lt;br /&gt;- Be very careful not to drop it. The plastic packaging is fragile and if it chips it can get sharp and cause irritation in the armpit. I do wish the packaging were more durable for such a long lasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this way it works very well for me. If I ever forget it, I can tell later in the day, but when I use it there is never any underarm odor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with deodorants for many years because of sensitivity to the ingredients which leads to swelling and itching of the armpits. I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine in addition to many other types without success.     I&#x27;ve been using Crystal Body Deodorant now for 2 weeks and must say I am very happy with the results.     1) No irritation   2) Good long lasting odor control   3) No powder or other types of stains    It&#x27;s amazing to me that a product like this, which seems to be the most natural and hence least harmful of any of them, works so well. My thanks to the manufacturer for bringing this to market.</li>
            <li> As someone who has a family history of smelly sweat, but got the short end of the stick with antiperspirant allergies, I stumbled across this product. It is super easy to apply, is perfect for people with sensitive skin, and does not leave any residue/stickiness. Right after applying, you can notice a decrease in BO. It&#x27;s very surprising that a rock can do so. I also tend to sweat a bit less after applying the product, though that could just be due to a placebo effect, having the peace of mind that I do not smell. The one downside - the effects will not last a full 24 hours. It lasts about 12 hours, maximum, so you may need to reapply during the day. This could also be an side-effect of being an athletic 22-year-old, but nonetheless, it is a downside (which is why it only receives 4 stars). I originally paired this with Sweat Block, which I applied once every week (with a couple of Benadryl...). Recently I&#x27;ve cut out the antiperspirant regime and rely solely on this and the Thompson Tee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: This product works, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a natural, safe alternative to conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li> Works like it was meant to.</li>
            <li> This product might have a high rating, but you have to consider the kind of people who go for this product - this is more a selective group and not really a representation of the public at large, despite being on Amazon. By and large, you&#x27;re going to get a mix of hippies, open minded people and new agers - not those who have been using axe, old spice or other mainstream stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a shot for about a couple of months, as I like to try new things every now and then, especially if they have a fair amount of positive feedback, and I like products that are on the more natural side. If you&#x27;re one of those people who have switched from the standard mainstream stuff, going to more natural based products tend to have a bit of an adjustment curve. What I mean is that your body takes some adjustment until it \\&quot;gets into the swing of things\\&quot; with a new product. I took this into consideration going into this product, as it&#x27;s only a salt stick, and even for natural things this is far different from the others out there. I&#x27;m now about 3 months into using it and I have a hard time buying that it does more than not using deodorant at all, except for maybe it initially helps neutralizes odors. Unfortunately that feeling doesn&#x27;t seem to last long (couple hours at best). I also get annoyed of having water from the moistening of the crystal drip down my side all the time, even if I shake it out. You have to be patient and really shake it out to prevent this, but if your like me there are other things you would rather be doing than getting ready in the morning, so I try to get ready relatively quick. It might sound silly, but slowing down 3-5 times more to apply deodorant without getting wet gets on your nerves just a bit, especially if it doesn&#x27;t provide results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t think this does nothing or that it&#x27;s complete crap, but it really just doesn&#x27;t do much and I have a really hard time buying that it does. I even went scientific on this and applied it to only one arm for an extended amount of time and didn&#x27;t really see any difference. I&#x27;m not even really that much of a sweater, but I smelled worse than ever using this deodorant. Personally I much prefer Herban Cowboy, but because I hate to just toss things out, I use the crystal first and then apply Herban Cowboy over it. This has been working for me pretty well, but I definitely will never be using crystal by itself again. If you use crystal in any way, I would say it should be like this. If you&#x27;re going to do something strenuous, I might recommend using a touch of \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Deodorant For Men\\&quot; with Herbal Cowboy or something else over it, as Burt&#x27;s Bees is sticky on it&#x27;s own and can be hard to get out of clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth of the matter is people want to believe this works much better than it does. After talking to several friends and roommate who have used it at some point in their life, they all agree with me.pplied it to only one arm for an extended amount of time and didn&#x27;t really see any difference. I&#x27;m not even really that much of a sweater, but I smelled worse than ever using this deodorant. Personally I much prefer Herban Cowboy, but because I hate to just toss things out, I use the crystal first and then apply Herban Cowboy over it. This has been working for me pretty well, but I definitely will never be using crystal by itself again. If you use crystal in any way, I would say it should be like this. If you&#x27;re going to do something strenuous, I might recommend using a touch of \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Deodorant For Men\\&quot; with Herbal Cowboy or something else over it, as Burt&#x27;s Bees is sticky on it&#x27;s own and can be hard to get out of clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth of the matter is people want to believe this works much better than it does. After talking to several friends and roommate who have used it at some point in their life, they all agree with me.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he LOVES it. Same as the pink version (which appears to be marketed towards women). It burns my armpits but for his furry versions, it works really well. We both have a lot of allergies and this hits the spot for him. No stink!</li>
            <li> I buy these in quantity. My husband and I both use it. My brother had horrid knots under his arms from regular deoderant because of the aluminum content - he was extremely pleased with it. Since he has a stoma and it is a very difficult procedure for him to take a regular shower, now he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about body odor OR the knots, which were very painful.</li>
            <li> Yes, Crystal Body Deodorant Stick for Men does do what it is advertised to do.  No, it is not healthy.  I have cancer and since looking up information on the alum this product contains, I had to throw this in the garbage.  I now mix up 1/4 tsp. of baking soda or less, plus 1 tsp. of water or more.  I splash it under my arms and let it dry.  It works well and I don&#x27;t worry about chemicals linked with cancer.</li>
            <li> This product is a very effective deodorant even in the heat and humidity of the Dominican Republic where I live.  When you first start using this. it takes a few days to get full effectiveness but from then on you are well protected without the use of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no residue and no staining of the clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best time to apply it is when you are right out of the shower and your body is still damp.  Moisten the stick and rub it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t how this works for others because it sure doesn&#x27;t for me. I wet it and apply it and 2-3 hours later I stink which is just like I&#x27;m not using any deodorant. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s all natural and a cool shaped rock but it doesn&#x27;t work so I&#x27;d stay away from it.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me or my husband. My daughter dropped it and the container cracked the first day too.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised, and seems like it will last a lifetime, practically. I run it under the tap and apply it. Then, I shake off the excess water and reapply the cap. Keeps me dry without all the chemicals and staining. Couldn&#x27;t live without it, now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this deodorant after all it&#x27;s just a crystal rock!!!, but antiperspirants give me a rash and it&#x27;s difficult to find just deodorants without antiperspirants. I tried this and from day one it worked great, it&#x27;s amazing just apply it after your shower and it works all day no small at all!!! I kept checking my pits the 1st few days but nothing,  you still sweat but it&#x27;s a deodorant. At this price give it a try.</li>
            <li> This really works.  It seems contradictory, but remember to wet it before using, and use it every day.  I am a convert!</li>
            <li> Gave up stick deodorant over a year ago. Use this after your showers and you are good for 24hr min. Stick deodorants have PCBs that are linked to breast cancer and this is totally natural, can&#x27;t beat it. Do be aware though that this is a deodorant not and anti-perspirant. You will still sweat, it just won&#x27;t smell. I have found that if I am going to work outside all day and want to keep from soaking my shirt, I do need to use an anti-perspirant. That being said, this is what I use 95% of the time and it works great, lasts forever and wont give me cancer.</li>
            <li> When I read that Antiperspirants are cancer causing and deodorants use unhealthy ingredients I started doing research. This one kept coming up as the #1 of all deodorants. It doesn&#x27;t resist the sweat to escape rather it absorbs the toxic particles of your sweat to make a better aroma. I gave it a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t last all day but all you have to do is reapply.</li>
            <li> Ever since Gillette stopped making its deodorant gel, I&#x27;ve been looking for something to replace it.  (Yes, they still have anti-perspirant gels, but they used to have a straight deodorant gel too.)  This Crystal Body Deodorant really does the trick.  I&#x27;m a stinky guy and I need deodorant.  Not that other deodorants don&#x27;t work, but of the half dozen or so I&#x27;ve tried the past few years, I like this one the best.  It is as good as or better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, plus it&#x27;s natural and a lot milder than anything else.    I don&#x27;t like anti-perspirants because they don&#x27;t work for me, I still sweat.  So whether the chemicals in anti-perspirants are harmless or cancer causing is a moot point, they just don&#x27;t work so why take the chance.  Plus, I feel a stickiness when I do end up sweating.    This deodorant is just a block of some sort of mineral salt.  You have to wet it to apply, or just don&#x27;t dry your pits after you shower and it is moist enough to apply.  Very mild, I haven&#x27;t had any sort of reaction to it.  You can even use it on other body parts like your feet.      This thing lasts forever.  I&#x27;ve had mine for half a year and can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s been used at all.  I even feel like I put it on \\&quot;thick\\&quot;.  I rub it around my pit a lot more than the one or two swipes I would with a regular deodorant.    Remember, this is not an anti-perspirant.  You will still sweat.  The one drawback I&#x27;ve noticed is, sometimes if I&#x27;m wearing a tight undershirt and have a sweaty day, my shirt will start to pick up an odor even though my pits themselves won&#x27;t stink at all.     The spray version works as well, it just doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.  [[ASIN:B001ET765S Crystal Body 30093 Crystal Spray Body Deodorant, 4-Ounce Spray Bottles in 3-Count Packages (Pack of 2)]]  And other than the packaging, I don&#x27;t think this \\&quot;Men&#x27;s\\&quot; version is any different than the regular stick, they are both fragrance-free.  [[ASIN:B001ET764E Crystal Body Stick Deodorant, 4.25-Ounce Stick (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> Followed directions and applied liberally and does not work at all.  I don&#x27;t really sweat much either.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This particular deodorant was so dry, I have to wet it before I could apply it to my armpits.</li>
            <li> I love the fact i wont apply any chemical product on my body. I sweat a lot, and this rock had block the bad odor and also the quantity of sweat. Owever it lSt only half day, i have to apply twice a day.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to some ingredient in most deodorants and antiperspirants several years ago. My wife suggested Crystal and it works great, lasts for 24 hours. It does not prevent sweat but that is probably a good thing. It works on your other parts too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a solid &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; of deodorant so wasn&#x27;t sure how to actually use this.  I just started wetting the tip with water and putting it on and it works well.  No smell during the day, or even at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that you can just put it right on out of the shower because you have a bit of moisture still on you, so no need to wet it then.  This looks like it will last forever.  I&#x27;ve had it about 3 weeks and it doesn&#x27;t even look like it&#x27;s gone down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  non-poisonous, long lasting, and keeps the stink away.</li>
            <li> This works great and lasts a very long time. I was using an expensive brand name for extreme B O. This works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I sweat heavy and I&#x27;m constantly looking for a way to eliminate body odor. I was told to give this product a try and was a little skeptical because it does nothing for perspiration control. However, I understand BO is a direct result of the bacteria that feeds on elements in our sweat, and this product eliminates the growth of said bacteria in the area it&#x27;s applied. I can honestly say it works well. I still sweat just as much as before but there is no odor. I&#x27;m also pleased that I don&#x27;t have to expose myself to the harmful elements found in common antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on giving this review one start if the crystal does manage to fall out after some time. If it last a month than it has already paid for itself and there is nothing for me to be angry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It looks like I have to cycle off of this product for a month or so. It&#x27;s effectiveness has worn off after a while. I&#x27;ll use conventional deodorant for a month and move back to this.</li>
            <li> After using regular deoderants my whole life, going over to this from Crystal is simply amazing. Even though I sweat a tiny bit more, the sweat has absolutely no smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as a replacement for deodorant. No aluminum or any of that crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it LASTS! The previous stick I had (Thai Crystal brand) lasted for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> I use this deodorant because I&#x27;m allergic to metal.  It also happens to be the most practical deodorant you can buy considering a stick will easily last you a year (I&#x27;d say 2 and a half is about average).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to Korea soon for a 1 year teaching gig and buying one of these for the trip is a no brainer.  Deodorant is hard to find in Korea and very expensive.  A friend of mine doing the same program spent 25 dollars on 6 sticks of regular higher end deodorant assuming each stick would last&#x27;em 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the crystal deodorant works very well.  The key is to realize that the salt rock will Not mask odor, just prevent it.  So after taking a good shower you apply it (wetting the rock a little and liberally spreading it across your under arms) and that&#x27;s it.  The disadvantage is you have to clean up well before using it, unlike your common deodorants that you can literally keep in your car and just apply whenever you feel a little stinky.  But if you shower every day anyway, or you&#x27;re planning on leaving the country for an extended period of time, really consider this product.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were looking for natural alternatives as far as deodorant. He tried this for several days and it diid not help so he switched back to his regular  one. If you are not doing any yard work,working out and just lazing around at home, this product will work.</li>
            <li> very good product is recommended</li>
            <li> Great product I have been using this for about a month now and have very little bad things to say about it. It works as it should maybe not as strong as those deodorants with all the chemicals, but good enough.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three months now and I am extremely pleased with it.  This product might work for you if:&lt;br /&gt;1. You are a clean person that showers daily and uses soap to clean your body/armpits.&lt;br /&gt;2. You like using items that are scent free.&lt;br /&gt;3. You do not want an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;4. You are ok with using Potassium Alum.&lt;br /&gt;5. Have some common sense in how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention those five things because after reading a lot of reviews I was amazed at why people did not like using this product. If you are OK with the five things above I think you will like the product.  I will explain each one and why I listed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You are a clean person that showers daily and uses soap to clean your body/armpits.&lt;br /&gt;I am a male who has body odor. If I do not use deodorant, I will have a noticeable stench in about three hours, even during the winter snowing months. To combat that, I shower regularly, once or twice a day, using soap.  I only apply this deodorant immediately after a shower. For example, if you shower at night and do not apply this deodorant until the morning after you wake up, you defeat the purpose.  During the time you slept bacteria could be building in your arm pit.  Once you apply the product in the morning the smell is already there and this deodorant won’t do anything to fix it. If you have stinky pits and want a deodorant to put on it to stop the stench I recommend an alcohol based product that can kill the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You like using items that are scent free.&lt;br /&gt;I do not want a product that smells.  I don’t like them.  If I want to smell “fancy” I will apply a cologne of my choice.  I do not plan of using my deodorant as cologne and I do not want my deodorant to smell different than my cologne if I choose to wear cologne, which I very rarely choose to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You do not want an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I personally chose not to wear antiperspirant.  I am OK with my armpits sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. You are ok with using Potassium Alum.&lt;br /&gt;Also know as potassium aluminum sulfate. You can find articles out there on why you should not use Potassium Alum.  That you can get Alzheimer’s and cancer if you use it.  The will claim there really is no difference between using Potassium Alum and potassium aluminum chlorate (which is found in antiperspirants).  What they won’t mention is why Potassium Alum does not stop you from sweating but potassium aluminum chlorate does.  They will also not tell you that the study that once said Alzheimer’s can be linked to potassium aluminum sulfate has not been clinically proven or the cancer society recommends Potassium Alum as a deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;It is up to you what you want to believe and I understand being cautious. I choose to use it because I rather use one ingredient than many and I believe that stopping your body from sweating is not a good answer. There are no studies on what lemongrass oild might do to your body after years of using it either.  Just because something is “natural” does not mean you should put it on or in your body.  I found it easier to study one ingredient, Potassium Alum, and feel safe using it.  I continue to monitor studies though on all the products I consume regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Have some common sense in how to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;The container says not to store on marble or granite.  That is because marble and granite are porous and you do not want this product to absorb into the stone.  Same goes for a lot of other things when dealing with marble and granite.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to tell you how I use the product; maybe it will work for you maybe it won’t. I read some reviews how people said how messy it was to use and how water drips everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said earlier, I use it right after I get out of the shower. I get out and towel dry my body, BUT, I do not dry my armpits.  That did take me a few days to get useto but now it is automatic.  Once my body is dry, I apply the product to my armpits.  The water that is still in my armpit from the shower is enough to allow the product to be applied.  I never have had to add additional water.  When I apply I do more than three swipes.  I do about 12 to 15 full up and full down swipes per armpit. You have to remember the crystal is dissolving into the water and spreading on your armit.  I personnaly believe you need to do a lot of swipes if you have a problem with odor and you want the product to work.  It feels no difference if you do 15 swipes or three, but you will smell the difference at the end of the day.  I have tested it to see what works best for me and 12 to 15 swipes works best.  Be sure to get all around your armpit.&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to dry your armpit when you get out of the shower, just put a little water in your hand and rub it into your armpit and then apply the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Once I am done I put the top on and put it on my shelf.  It has never dripped on the shelf or anything like that because I do not put it under running water when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that is a lot to write on such a simple product but it works for me as advertised and I have the ability to have a real bad stench in hours if I do not use deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use Crystal Rock spray deodorant or Welda’s Spray deodorant if I can’t shower that day, like when camping or when I choose to work out in the morning before I shower.  That way I do not get my crystal stone dirty by using it on an unclean armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps.from the shower is enough to allow the product to be applied.

            <li> I broke out from it...  I have never broke using normal deodorant so not sure why I did with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the  best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I never knew I could sweat so much while simultaneously smelling like nothing. My mother has already commented on my lack of smell, since I usually smell unpleasant, to say the least, when I come back from the gym. It feels very natural, and I no longer have any feeling of dryness, or irritation in and around my armpits.</li>
            <li> AWESOMELY AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this very hesitantly but was happy to find it actually works. My armpits have never been more odorless. It works better than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; deodorant. Plus you don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals seeping into your body. Simply amazing. I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> actually was quite impressed with this product.  will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have been using regular deodorants all my life. Have recently been having problems with my regular deodorant so tried the crystal and am never going back to regular deodorants again.  Keep in mind this is not a scented product so you&#x27;re not going to have the usual cologne mixed with your own aroma coming from your armpits but rather a neutral body scent mixed with whatever soap you use.  Great product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Leaves a coating on your skin that sticks to your hair. decent for hairless people, but you have to rub the dead skin off, as this thing makes a layer of skin stick together instead of falling off microscopically.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the aluminum compounds in antiperspirants, the phthalates in the fragrance of deodorants, and the persistent residue always left by the products I found most effective.  I saw Crystal Body Deodorant here on Amazon and decided it would be worth the price to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is scentless, leaves no noticeable residue, no trace on clothes.  I have found if I moisten the crystal before I use it that it glides on and the moisture dries quickly.  I&#x27;m still experimenting with how much coverage is necessary and I might be erring on more coverage than I need but IT WORKS.  It does not mask my natural scent at all.  It does not keep me from sweating at all.  IT DOES completely prevent unpleasant body odor.  For me, it also keeps me from sweating as much.  Other products residues would prevent my skin from breathing properly and would result in MORE sweat when I wasn&#x27;t working out or our in the heat and that doesn&#x27;t happen with Crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds weird but I keep smelling myself day after day and I&#x27;m always surprised.  No deodorant scent.  No BO.  Basically no scent at all.  I think using Crystal requires a good routine because I can never tell if I&#x27;m covered (no scent to clue you in) but as long as I apply it once a day it seems to work.  I would suggest applying it as soon as you get out of the shower every day.  If the bacteria have time to grow and they leave a scent behind, Crystal will not make it go away immediately but it will stop it from getting worse and over time I&#x27;ve found the scent lightens and eventually goes away entirely (over a few to several hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how long this deodorant will last but I haven&#x27;t seen any reason to disbelieve what others have said about it lasting more than a year.</li>
            <li> Regular deodorants cause me major rash problems. This one doesn&#x27;t and it seems to work for a couple of days without wearing off. Also the stick itself lasts a long time so it might seem expensive but it is really inexpensive. From time to time I try to switch back to newer deodorants that are supposed to be for sensitive skin but they too have bothered me. I do put it on right after showering while my underarms are still wet. This product does work for me. Hopefully it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I work. It works. What more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;Go to the beach. Go to the office. It&#x27;s no longer the pits!</li>
            <li> not bad, last long...</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this product works surprisingly well, however it is a bit misleading.  It states \\&quot;100% Natural Mineral Salts\\&quot; and \\&quot;No Aluminum Chlorohydrate\\&quot; but upon closer inspection of the ingredient list on the back, it lists \\&quot;Natural Mineral Salts, Ammonium Alum\\&quot;. Ammonium Alum is NOT a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product, and contains aluminum. According to ammoniumalum.com, \\&quot;A mineral salt, also known as aluminum ammonium sulfate, is a white crystalline double sulfate of aluminium that is chemically synthesized and manufactured to be used in  industrial application and everyday consumer products.\\&quot;  There is debate over the safety of the product, so whether or not it&#x27;s harmful is up to the opinion of the consumer, but I just wanted to point that out to those looking to purchase this item. The product seemed to make some cleverly disguised false claims.   I gave it 2 stars simply because it DOES work, and it&#x27;s certainly not as bad as other deodorants on the market.  Do a quick Google search for ammonium alum, along with a search for the ingredient list in this deodorant, and make your own judgment.</li>
            <li> What more do I have to say?  This product works great.  I use it; I don&#x27;t smell; it lasts a loooooong time; it&#x27;s inexpensive.  Should you buy it?  Yes.  Will you smell &amp;#34;like a man&amp;#34;?  You&#x27;ll probably smell like a person who doesn&#x27;t sweat, which is the reason I buy deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works better than nothing, which is what I wanted since my armpits seem allergic to everything. I have used the crystal deodorant for more than 2 years with no problems. I got the stick because the cube form always ends up getting dropped and shattering. The stick came out of the holder though so I am weary that it will meet the same fate. Does not work as well as antiperspirants at preventing unwanted smell but works much better than not using it. I would recommend this to anyone with similar armpit problems as I have.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; version is identical to the female version, with different packaging.  This was slightly less.  Don&#x27;t pay more for pink packaging, this is the same thing.</li>
            <li> Yes I tossed both of them in the trash. Even though it says that there is no Aluminum in this product there absolutely is. They call it Alum, but it is aluminum. I also read an article about it that warned me about this product. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I originally got this stick because I hate the way deodorant can cause pit stains on nice shirts, so I figured this would not do that. However, my job isn&#x27;t very physically demanding although I do have to move around a fair amount during the day. Since using the deodorant stick I will usually apply 7 am or so, and I begin to smell by about 11 am. I want to like this stick so much, but after two weeks of feeling like I constantly need to check myself to see if I smell bad, I feel like I am going to have to revert back to my old deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Apply it after stepping out of the shower. You need to apply it to wet skin or hold the tip under the faucet to wet the stick and then apply it. Like that it lasts a long time.  No complaints from family, friends or coworkers regarding the efficacy of the product, and they would not hesitate to tell someone to clean up their act when necessary.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I don&#x27;t know the chemistry or any of that, but it does what it says it will and apparently will last forever. It is reassuring that I don&#x27;t have to use perfumes and man-made chemicals and can still get deodorant protection. My son turned me on to it and he swore by it. I do too now. Doesn&#x27;t make you smell good, just STOPS you from smelling bad. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. I think he could care less about using a natural product. So i sent this to him and he tried it and actually loves it. He&#x27;s an active guy - coaches basketball, plays basketball, works out... knows how to work up a sweat. He&#x27;s been using this stuff and just told me he feels &amp;#34;fresh as a daisy&amp;#34;.  He was using Degree, or some other mainstreamer, before Crystal. He&#x27;s a believer. I bought him this one because of the manly packaging.. figured it would ease the transition. But now that i know he feels fresh a daisy I think the original packaging would be just fine.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was like, &amp;#34;Yeah sure... really no smelly body odor anymore after my workout? I don&#x27;t think so.&amp;#34; But really... think so. This product really really REALLY works!!! I workout approximately three hours daily and the majority of my workout is cardio. I take a shower before my workout, then apply this product. When I&#x27;m finished with my workout, I&#x27;m drenched but I don&#x27;t smell. I can literally let my workout shirt dry and I could use it again the following day if I wanted to. This product has a long life too... like a year or so. I think it is worth every penny. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see the ingredients as ammonium alum while the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;natural body deo are potassium alum. I dont know why they are making fool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but its a serious matter because there are still no studies to prove that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this synthesized salt is safe to use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, and will certainly last year or longer. It is a pleasant experience in this day and age to buy something that has lasting value and does not have to be thrown away after a short period of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  the Greatest safe Deodorant Stick</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have been using it for 4 months. I am a plant-based eater so I do not have much body odor in the first place but this stuff is cool. I wear it daily and from time to time I will have a very minor odor but that is just life. Most of the time no odor. I am not sure how well it would work if someone regularly smelled. I could go without deodorant about 90% of the time.</li>
            <li> Very prompt service.  Love the product.  Have used it for more than 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;Will. Not only buy the products  but also will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a healthy alternative to deodorant.  I&#x27;d consider myself normal - no body odor problems, typically smelly if I don&#x27;t shower up on a regular basis.  Normally, take a shower in the morning, put on deodorant, office all day, workout in the evening after which I&#x27;ll stink and take another shower in the evening.  If I use Crystal, I&#x27;d need a shower halfway through the work day, another shower before the workout, and yet another shower at night.  That is, after any few hours I&#x27;ll stink.  I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s because Crystal only slightly works, or that&#x27;s just naturally when I will start to stink and Crystal doesn&#x27;t work at all... Either way, this doesn&#x27;t make the cut for deodorant substitute.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. This is the second one I bought. The stick lasts for years. A year or two my wife started using the same item and she thinks it&#x27;s great too. No scent, no odors. Just be sure to wet it before use.</li>
            <li> Trew it to trash this morning. It needs watter to work, too heavy to carry around. I basically needed something to cary in my gym bag but this is not the product that woud work for this purpose.</li>
            <li> It actually holds up pretty well. Not 24 hours, but if you groom your armpit, this little boy will last pretty much the whole working day.&lt;br /&gt;This literally is a stick of salt crystal, so no parabens and unknowns chemical.</li>
            <li> Not that great, the stick broke after 2 or 3 weeks use, and it does not last all day long.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years; i think it is the best product available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 61 year \\&quot;old guy\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve spent my adult life trying not to stink in public. I&#x27;ve used just about every brand of deodorant stick out there!&lt;br /&gt;Some work better than others on me, but I&#x27;ve never been overly impressed, even if initial application goes on well and smells nice. There have been some sticks that caused a mild to severe reaction, but not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a number occasions when my deodorant has let me done; apparently it&#x27;s a fact of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this summer I decided to try something not usually found in a supermarket or convenience store and looked to Amazon reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crystal Body Deodorant Stick for Men Unscented works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it immediately after a shower and I hardly notice it after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not had any negative reaction to the product.&lt;br /&gt;Under sweaty conditions I still feel the perspiration but there has not any offensive odor.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any scent so I can use all the gifted colognes I&#x27;ve received in the last couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To you guys that see \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; and think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;new age\\&quot; hippy dippy product, just give it a try.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I like my deodorant to match or at least compliment the cologne I&#x27;m wearing.  Sometimes that can be a struggle.  With this crystal, it&#x27;s not an issue.  As as you age, you start to be a little more aware of using natural like products as opposed to chemical laden ones.  This makes for a better deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  You have to wet it to be able to use it.  Makes sense but if you are in a rush, you may end of getting water on you.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Doesn&#x27;t really create a smooth &amp;#34;after feel&amp;#34;.  I guess it&#x27;ll take some getting used to - most of my other deodorants (not the chalky stuff mind you) gave your underarm a little more motion.  This is like really wearing nothing at all.  A bit odd to say the least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the &amp;#34;mens&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;womens&amp;#34; version of this product, and they both work exactly the same.  My first crystal, I used off and on over the course of a year.  I&#x27;ve finally made the switch to the crystal full time.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for the last several months.  My family and I recently relocated to Singapore from Houston, and the weather here is hot and humid year around.  I use the crystal daily and it works to keep me odor free.  antiperspirant/deodorant is very expensive in Singapore, and I haven&#x27;t seen any fragrance-free options here.  Prior to trying the crystal, I would go through a stick of regular brand deodorant in 2-3 weeks.  Even if I had to replace the crystal every other month, I would come out ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Your underarms need to be very clean, and they need to not smell when you apply this stick.  Scrub your pits with soap while you shower.  After you dry off, immediately apply the crystal (after wetting it).&lt;br /&gt;2)  If you shower at night and want to reapply in the morning, use some wet wipes or a clean, damp wash cloth to clean your arm pits again before you reapply.&lt;br /&gt;3) This will not stop you from sweating, but you shouldn&#x27;t smell when you sweat.&lt;br /&gt;4) I now leave the top off of this stick so it can dry between uses.  One of my sticks broke at the base (same problem as other users report), and I think this is due to water eroding the connection between the stick and the plastic.  While this is annoying, the crystal is basically a rock, so I don&#x27;t mind if I have to touch it with my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I don&#x27;t know the difference between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s kind? Either way, works just as well as any other deodorant without the strong fragrantly smell! It for sure works. On some days where I&#x27;m out in the heat or sweating extra, I&#x27;ve noticed by the end of the day a slight smell of BO.. But honestly it would have been the same with other regular deodorant... Remember to store it upside down to not let the moisture drip to the bottom and dissinigrate the stone at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Still using it a year later, definitely recommend for those who aren&#x27;t heavy sweaters (may be good for them too, cannot personally attest to that).</li>
            <li> I would never have believed it but it really works to cancel odors.</li>
            <li> little inconvient that I always have to water it before applying. Its functionality is as promised.</li>
            <li> UPDATED: After using this a whole year I had to come back and downgrade my review. It worked partially for the first few months but I had to reapply several times a day.  Then as time went buy I started noticing my body odor and could smell body odor on my shirts when I took them off.  I put up with this for a year because I just didn&#x27;t want to go back to aluminum based deodorant.  Now I&#x27;m using Nasanta Magnesium Deodorant and it works great, lasts all day (and more), is unscented, and doesn&#x27;t leave me paranoid about body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------&lt;br /&gt;This product works but I have to apply more often than regular deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* No scent&lt;br /&gt;* One stick lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t leave stains on your clothes!&lt;br /&gt;* Stops odor without toxic chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Need to reapply more often (lasts 9-5 but need to apply again in the evening for me)</li>
            <li> Works very well. Long lasting and no chemicals. More then likely I will only use this deodorant for the rest of my life</li>
            <li> A healthy alternative.  It works perfectly there is no odor whatsoever. It seems like this will last a very long time too.  I&#x27;ve had this now for a year and haven&#x27;t worn it down hardly at all.</li>
            <li> It works and better yet it does not have any overwhelming perfume, doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts, and makes breakfast in the morning for me. Okay maybe I exaggerated with that last revelation but it works really well one has lasted me over a year and counting.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant that hasn&#x27;t irritated my husband- he is constantly raving about this and I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Great product. I sweat like a pig and this holds back odors without the stain of Mitchum.  Lasts forever.  Buy now!</li>
            <li> From time to time, I run across a product that seems to do the same thing as a product I currently use, but without the chemicals. I know this is a generalization but I think there&#x27;s to much chemicals in our daily lives. I try to take the chemical out, without going overboard. I don&#x27;t believe in spending $10 for a bar of shower soap, but this little gem seems to last forever. I think I save money from what I spent on traditional deodorant.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I have been looking for all-natural deodorant that actually works the way I wish it. I have tried several products (arm and hammer, nature&#x27;s bounty) but I had to be extra careful to keep feeling confident. But not with this salt crystal deodorant; I can be as active and confident in my activities as when wearing non-natural deodorant. The only small problem with this salt crystal is that it takes some extra more time applying than with regular deodorant. But I am willing to trade in extra two minutes for better health</li>
            <li> If you want to avoid chemicals and perfumes this is the product for you. I have been using a mineral salt &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; for years and it always works great. The mineral salt kills bacteria that cause odor and has no smell. It is all natural. The shape of this Crystal stick makes it easy to apply -and feels like a typical roll-on.</li>
            <li> This product works for me exactly as it says, even on a hot, humid southern day no smell at days end. Also eliminates wet underarm stains during the day.</li>
            <li> It supposed to block smell of sweat but it didn&#x27;t, There are better products in the market.</li>
            <li> Easy to drop - if it falls, the salt crystal shatters.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this one &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; is less costly than the pink container containing the same product &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34;, but that is my sole complaint about this product.  I have used Crystal deodorant for about 7 years now and have always loved it.  I put it on immediately after showering and rarely have a problem.  If highly active or on super hot days, this product may not be 100% effective at keeping body odor stink at bay, but on 95% of the days, I have had absolutely no problem.  I recommend it to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unscented.  not sure why it&#x27;s marketed to men.  i guess some men are uncomfortable using unisex products.  you will still sweat, but HELLO, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s supposed to happen.  and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes!  yeah.  here&#x27;s a tip if you are a guy....trim your pit hair.  it keeps the odor causing bacteria to a minimum.  unless you like that sorta thing :)</li>
            <li> Got this as an &amp;#34;alum&amp;#34; block for shaving with, and it works well for that. I&#x27;ve used it as deodorant as well, and it works for that too. The block started smelling a bit after using it for deodorant, but it wasn&#x27;t anything major.</li>
            <li> This product works fine. It arrived with the plastic case broken, so I&#x27;m deducting a star for that. It works, not worth the hassle to return, but could have been packaged better. I left separate packaging feedback.</li>
            <li> Works well if you wash or shower each day or more often.  Wet the top of the stick and re-wet it to apply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not anti-perspirant, you will sweat, but no harsh chemicals either.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised- there isn&#x27;t anything glamorous about it. You don&#x27;t smell for a while if you use this right when you get out of the shower. Sometimes I need to reapply, but not often. This can also be used to seal nicks from shaving.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well. I use it when at home or when I&#x27;m going out around my neighborhood. But for going to work, I use a conventional deodorant/anti-perspirant. I commute into Manhattan, and the commute can get you very hot and sweaty (some of the subway platforms are 100+ degrees in the summer with almost no circulating air), so I feel fresher using my Mitchum. But short of a using this on a commute from hell, this works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped yet.  After many years of regular antiperspirants became quite allergic to them.  Hoped these would be a suitable replacement -- not so far.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great.  No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> super product. has not let me down</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing stuff I have ever come across. I am a slender girl but sweat like a big fat guy. I have never been able to find a deodorant that will work all day so I used to end up smelling no matter how much I put on.&lt;br /&gt;With this, I put it directly on clean, wet skin (right out of the shower before toweling off) and it works wonders! The salt kills all the bacteria, so I never stink! I rarely even sweat, but if I do, it never smells.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my husband is allergic to aluminum in regular deodorant so this is great for him too. I don&#x27;t even know how much it costs now, but it&#x27;s completely worth it. If you don&#x27;t drop it on the ground and shatter it like I did, it will last well over a year.</li>
            <li> Aluminium is bad. We all know that. And whatever odor-absorbing, excretion-preventing, long-lasting tonics they put into the mainstream pit cream - those are bad too.  This, however, is not. And not only is it not bad for you, it actually works. Granted, it&#x27;s a stone, so it&#x27;s not going to preform as do things like Sport, Power, &amp; Total Sweat Defense, but it&#x27;s not supposed to.  It&#x27;s supposed to diminish the odor created by normal daily perspiration. Don&#x27;t play football with this and not shower. And by all means wet it, under hot water, before applying it. Your pits will thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mineral salts rock before but I&#x27;m definitely hooked on it now. Just make sure you wet the crystal before you apply it. Either that or put it on immediately after showering but before you dry off. It&#x27;s a great natural and safe alternative!</li>
            <li> I tried this after making my own for about a year. I started developing a rash from the baking soda in my recipe and after trying multiple new recipes nothing compared to the power of baking soda/coconut oil. I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot before going back to store bought and was highly disappointed. Not only is it a pain in the ass to put on without getting drips, it&#x27;s also not safe for granite counter tops and to top it off doesn&#x27;t work for a damn either. I&#x27;m not sure what type of person this works for, but isn&#x27;t me that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> If you have hair under your arms, you probably will better off with the gel version of this product because the stone isn&#x27;t rubbing directly against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure you are completely clean before applying.</li>
            <li> Works ok on days without strenuous exercise.  Fragile and tends to easily slip out of plastic holder after a month or so.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it.  My hubby even chose to switch over from conventional deodorant and it works better than ANYTHING else he&#x27;d ever tried (and he&#x27;s tried &#x27;em all!)</li>
            <li> Love this product.   No more deodorant marks on black shirts.   Traveled 4 days on long haul flights.  Stuck in hot humid airports.  No odor at the end of 4 days when I finally got to a shower.   No more under arm stains on white shirts.  T-shirts I wear daily after 3 months no stains.  Previous deodorants with in 3 weeks would start to show yellow stains.   No clumpy deodorant in your arm pits when laying out for some sun.   It&#x27;s like nothing is there at all.  It just works perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re allergic to normal deodorants or just wanna use a safe and all natural deodorant order this! I&#x27;ve used urban cowboy and toms of Maine and this is way better. Unlike those, you put this on and a couple hours later (even over night) the b. o. is non existent! Please note though that if this doesn&#x27;t work for you, a poor diet and toxins in the body might be the cause. Hope this helps!!!</li>
            <li> Ever since Gillette stopped making its deodorant gel, I&#x27;ve been looking for something to replace it. (Yes, they still have anti-perspirant gels, but they used to have a straight deodorant gel too.) This Crystal Body Deodorant really does the trick. I&#x27;m a stinky guy and I need deodorant. Not that other deodorants don&#x27;t work, but of the half dozen or so I&#x27;ve tried the past few years, I like this one the best. It is as good as or better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, plus it&#x27;s natural and a lot milder than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like anti-perspirants because they don&#x27;t work for me, I still sweat. So whether the chemicals in anti-perspirants are harmless or cancer causing is a moot point, they just don&#x27;t work so why take the chance. Plus, I feel a stickiness when I do end up sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is just a block of some sort of mineral salt. You have to wet it to apply, or just don&#x27;t dry your pits after you shower and it is moist enough to apply. Very mild, I haven&#x27;t had any sort of reaction to it. You can even use it on other body parts like your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing lasts forever. I&#x27;ve had mine for half a year and can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s been used at all. I even feel like I put it on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;. I rub it around my pit a lot more than the one or two swipes I would with a regular deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this is not an anti-perspirant. You will still sweat. The one drawback I&#x27;ve noticed is, sometimes if I&#x27;m wearing a tight undershirt and have a sweaty day, my shirt will start to pick up an odor even though my pits themselves won&#x27;t stink at all.</li>
            <li> Looking for a less chemical deodorant and found this.  It is perfect.  No sticky residue.  No harsh chemicals and does not leave armpit stains on my shirts.</li>
            <li> Works better then all the others that don&#x27;t have all the nasty chemicals, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, this does very little, if anything. I initially thought that this was great, but then I discovered that I don&#x27;t generally *need that much anti-perspirant / deodorizer in the first place, and so whether I used this or not, the result was more or less the same. In the end I went back to anti-perspirant because of the hot summer days.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s one of the few products where their advertisement is actually an understatement. It lasts two people over a year and half before replacement, and has made regular deodorants just feel weird and dry. You will have no smell at all when you use this, even if you have a grueling physical labor job.</li>
            <li> My skin is on the more sensitive side and I have always had irritation with most deodorants/anti-perspirants. I have tried other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products and they left me stinking after a short time. I decided to give this a try and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, you need to either have damp armpits from the shower or wet the stone. Otherwise, it seems to do nothing. I can get through an 8 - 10 hour day of hard exterior work without stinking too bad, but I am not a rose when I get home. It definitely does not have an odor and does not give me any underarm irritation. The stone seems to last forever too. I am approaching 6 months of daily use and I haven&#x27;t even turned the dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a miracle 48 hour odor free product, but it won&#x27;t fill your underarms with chemicals. Worth a try in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------- Update 11/17/14 ------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months after posting this review I began getting an itchy irritation in my pits. I thought nothing of it until it wasn&#x27;t going away. Apparently, it was a fungal thing similar to athletes foot. I can&#x27;t say it was because of this deodorant, but I can&#x27;t imagine having the same deodorant stick for a year is a good thing. I threw this stuff away and switched to a different product. I have not had an issue since.</li>
            <li> Like most people who have found this product, I have tended to have sensitive skin.  By that I mean that the most popular deodorants (Old Spice, even Dove) will make me break out in a red, smelly rash for days, sometimes weeks, no matter how much I try to bathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally figured out that underarm bacteria is the primary cause of body odor, and for some reason, daily showers just weren&#x27;t enough to fight the bacteria.  Once I figured this out, then I figured I would need to try something that is meant to kill bacteria, not just cover odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I used was hand sanitizer, and sure enough, I finally found the relief I was looking for.  It worked like magic -- I could consistently put it on every day and neither I nor my fiancée noticed any rancid stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I was ecstatic, but I knew that hand sanitizer probably wouldn&#x27;t be sustainable for the rest of my life, so I continued my search for something gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this stuff came to occur in nature, but boy is it a miracle.  Seriously, it should be on Discovery channel or something.  It works like a charm.  Perfect for every day use.  You can even use it on your feet, although that&#x27;s fairly unnecessary for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent and truly amazing product, would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Was getting really crazy with aluminum chlorohydrate in regular deodorants and did a ton of research and found this product.  Is not irritating, is a great deodorant but be aware - it is not an antiperspirant.  I do not think that anything that goops and gobs  to absorb sweat or stops you from perspiring is healthy for your body.  This is all natural salts and extremely effective.  Mind you, I am in the shower every AM and pretty nutty about personal hygiene.  If I can use this, most people will be thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it for several years now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I now buy it online sine most stores o not carry it. Turns out it last so long they don&#x27;t get money from selling you them. So they removed them. They have no sticky residue and last forever. No smell so you don&#x27;t smell like anything unless you prefer perfume or cologne. I gave one of these to a coworker and he was very impressed. His wife was equally amazed at this simple item that just worked.</li>
            <li> My son was getting armpit rashes from using regular off the shelf deodorants and antiperspirants so we gave this a try.  Within three days his rash was gone and he&#x27;s not had one problem with this product.  I also use it myself and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this does nothing. You should save your money and grab a rock from your back yard instead.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it works great for me!</li>
            <li> everything went well, complete and fully functional thank you very much ..... was a pleasure doing business with you .....&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the confidence to negotiate with Colombian and look forward to negotiating with you ..&lt;br /&gt;always meeting and hoping that I meet 100%</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at 1st but after using it for about 2months now and I like this stuff. It works and does what its suppose to do</li>
            <li> i do like it but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t completely help</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever! Natural, odorant free, safe and long lasting!</li>
            <li> I have used this type of deodorant for at least 23 years, this specific brand as long as I can remember. I have always purchased it from local retailers and could only find the pink colored container. It has always worked perfectly and I cannot remember the last time I smelled bad from sweat. I used chemical spray deodorant with anti-perspirant before this and frequently developed itchy sore rashes on my armpits. Over the years I have recommended this product to many of my friends who had similar issues. Most of them adopted this product and one or two told me that it didn&#x27;t work well for them. I love the fact that this product lasts for more than a year. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind based on my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Use immediately after a shower and allow armpits to air dry. Armpits must be wet to apply.&lt;br /&gt;- Do not share this product with ANYONE! I let someone use mine once to test it and it stopped working for me until I rinsed the &amp;#34;stone&amp;#34; thoroughly, which probably washed a month of product away. It did not work for my friend either. It would probably be ok to share an almost empty one but rinse it well before you do.&lt;br /&gt;- Store at room temp. I keep an almost empty container in my vehicle and it tends to dry out and crack after being in the heat for too long. Using it in this state is torture as it will tear your armpits up.&lt;br /&gt;- Do not drop the container. The plastic tends to crack easily but more importantly the salt will break into sharp shards that are useless. I always have two containers available in case I destroy one by accident.&lt;br /&gt;- Experiment to figure out how much pressure is needed and how long to apply for. I found that for me it works best if I coat the body side of my armpit only and go over about 3-4 times with mild pressure. A friend told me that he had to use hard pressure and cover the area 5-6 times to make it work for him&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find the &amp;#34;Mens&amp;#34; version of this on Amazon at the best price I have seen in many years. I will continue to use this forever unless something better arrives.</li>
            <li> Works great for me. My only issue is that after extended use, some air bubbles in the mineral salt surfaced and got scratchy, making it uncomfortable to apply to my skin. However, that was after more than a year of daily use, and I&#x27;m promptly replacing it with a new one, so I&#x27;m still giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It will last you long but it does not do what it is suppose to do! I can smell my sweat and now I had to buy another product.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  I&#x27;ll never go back to conventional.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet, as most others have done. I have tried all the natural, no scent, easy on the skin products, and this was one of the only ones I found that worked. The other is Dove Men +Care    However, it has a few quirks that you should know about.    1. Label states that it should only be used on clean skin. If you are the type of person that thinks deodorant is a shower in a can, then this is not for you. It must be put on immediately after a shower or bath to keep any odor from forming. I did try it one day before my shower, to see what would happen, and it actually made the smell worse instead of better.    2. If you drop it, the crystal will shatter. The crystal is not held in the case with a lot of force, so as you shake the water off, you might shake the crystal out of the tube, and when it hits the ground it will most likely shatter. This happened to me with my first stick, and I had to order another one.    Overall, it works for me, but I am not a super stinky guy in general.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the claim that it is hypo-allergenic.  I have tried many different roll-on and spray products and always got a rash on my armpits.  I used this for a few months and still got a rash under one arm, so I suppose that&#x27;s some progress, but still not achieving the goal.  It didn&#x27;t seem to have any scent to it (as advertised), so I&#x27;m not sure that it really was of any use as a deodorant.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This type of mineral deodorant does a great job at battling the various odors that can develop during the day. However, I&#x27;ve found that as soon as I begin to perspire, the minerals seem to leave with the perspiration, and odor can soon begin to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you use this mineral stick for a day in the office, and you are not a chronic sweater, then the product should work well. But I&#x27;ve definitely found that exercising while wearing this product, or sitting in the sun and perspiring, is the quickest way for this product to lose its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product because my skin breaks out with other deodorants, even the sensitive skin varieties.  When this occurs, I can count on using the Crystal mineral stick instead, which allows the rash to heal up a lot faster.</li>
            <li> Has helped provide a solution to my allergies with other deodorants and anti-perspirants.  I have struggled with both allergies and occasional cysts caused by regular products - three outpatient surgeries over the last 15 years.  I apply this product right after the shower (so I leave the pits wet and then apply this immediately).  It really does prevent any odor.  I believe that the 1 year estimate is accurate, based on how much I have left and how long I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Works really well and has no scent!</li>
            <li> Excellent deodorant due to its totally natural content. Not only that but it lasts a long time--usually a year or so.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!!! No smelly pits, and no nasty chemicals. I&#x27;ve used my salt stick for over 8 months now and love it. It hasn&#x27;t deteriorated much at all. So far so good. For best performance, I suggest running a little water over the end of the stick while tilting the stick downward as to not wash away the rest of the stick. Then smearing it all around the arm pit area, not just in one little spot. Maybe go over it four to six times. Then, bam, no smell all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years after hearing bad stuff about conventional deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fine, and lasts a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great alternative produce that&#x27;s also a great value.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is the third time I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and made sure to put it on right after taking a shower. The first two times it worked good. The third time unfortunately, I did shower, and had to go to clinical skills, so I made sure to wet the top of the rock with water and spread it on me. Guess what? During clinicals I started getting stinky. I would not recommend wearing this during the summer or during activity when you will be around people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when should you wear it? I honestly don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> After using this, and asking my girlfriend, &amp;#34;What do you think of my new deodorant?&amp;#34; she replied &amp;#34;What deodorant?&amp;#34;.  Nuff said.</li>
            <li> One stick lasts more that a year.  Best for the purpose, and great for the environment. Great price. Does the job well.</li>
            <li> Started using salt crystal for deodorant and bought this for both of my teenage boys... Works like a charm for all of us... No stink... One of my sons even attended a concert and came home very impressed with being stink free... Awesome, natural alternative. Love it!</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine as a deodorant but has irritated my skin after two uses.  Really itchy armpits.  I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few days now, honestly this is the best working deodorant I&#x27;ve come across, this is how any deodorant should be hence the word De-Odorizer. It was hard to believe at first and I sweat pretty easily especially in this summer heat, but even after mowing the lawn, no smell! My wife couldn&#x27;t figure it out either lol. Ingredients are natural mineral salts...that&#x27;s it, if you want scent to it you can find some that have it, I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect from order to delivery and packaging. I like the way it goes.on and it is not sticky or wet.  There is no smell whatsoever and so far works great. I plan to reorder although I will have to wait for a year as it lasts that long. My dermatologist is the one who suggested it and she uses the.product as well and also gets it from amazon.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands &amp; types of deodorants to find one that does not irritate my arm pits. I&#x27;ve been using Crystal for the last month now and I am completely satisfied with this product. No more burning, irritated pits. As far as reducing body odor, when my wife got home from work this evening, she asked me if I had already mode the lawn. She was surprised that I had, and made a comment on the fact that I was not stinky. This stuff really works great.</li>
            <li> have been using this brand for years, won&#x27;t use anything else at the moment</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for odor.  Within a couple hours of showering and using this product my husband smelled like BO.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Excellent service! I ordered this for my son because he is in the military and wanted a deodorant only product. He loves it! The fact that it is unscented is excellent for use by those who have allergy or skin problems. Thanks to the seller. I would recommend this seller and this product highly!!!</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried I would spent my bucks on this product at the beginning, specially because it is more expensive to bring this to Panama by a special mail service.    But his works!  Like other reviewers here I can testify it is a natural deodorant that works fine.  Still, this rock/crystal version might not be useful for heavy perspiration, but I haven´t tried other formats.    As I am an office desk worker most of the time, it works very well for me.    The only think is that you have to be careful not to let it fall, it will break easily.  The nice thing is that you may still use the pieces!  So when I finish this product (this lasts forever it even get&#x27;s boring), I will try it again in another format.    Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t really care about the different chemicals that are in most deodorant sticks. My biggest judging criteria is whether or not something works well. That being said...this is a great product that works fantastically for me. You will still sweat which happens to the best of us, but you don&#x27;t get the stench that men tend to get. My wife said that she can notice a huge difference and has actually thought about switching herself. It does take a little getting used to. It was quite strange taking a chunk of minerals getting them wet and applying to your armpit. I doesn&#x27;t bother me any more however. I am excited by the fact that it lasts a long time and I don&#x27;t have to pay 8 bucks for a stick that lasts a month. At the price it is an awesome value. I was glad that I tried it out. The real test will be when it comes to summer as that is the height of BO season. I for one think it will work well!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried all the other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, and at the end of the day, I am a bit gamey smelling.  Not the case with this Crystal rock deodorant.  It does take a bit longer to apply since it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue to know if you&#x27;re covered or not, so I just rub each pit about 30 seconds or so.  Little to no odor at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant.  So if you sweat a lot, this isn&#x27;t going to help you with anything other than killing the bacteria in your pits to reduce stink.</li>
            <li> I cannot base the way this product works on myself as I can go days not using a deodorant without any issues.  However not so much for my wife or my 29 year old son.  I suggested my wife try mine as she has used everything know to man and women without much success. This product has worked perfectly for her never having an issue, and that my friends is a modern miracle. Same holds true for my son. Both say it works fantastic. As deodorants go this one has not smell which is fine and it lasts forever,  Just one warning though..... don&#x27;t drop it. Crystal breaks or cracks when it hits hard surfaces and if you try to use it the sharp edges do pose a problem.  I highly recommend this for everyone to at least try. It is natural, does not cost that much, what do you have to lose.</li>
            <li> I heard some good things about this stuff, and like that it doesn&#x27;t have any Aluminum Chlorohydrate, so I gave it a try. It just doesn&#x27;t work at all at stopping odor. I have average body odor, applied as directed to my underarms, daily, and used it for several weeks. By just after mid-day, I could tell it wasn&#x27;t preventing odor. I was as smelly as if I hadn&#x27;t put on any deodorant. Good idea behind it, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. I&#x27;m just going to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Hooray ... no more itchy armpits ... no more white skin when I go swimming ... no more yellowing armpits of my white tee shirts!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried one of these crystals before, you really should consider it. First off it is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. I don&#x27;t notice any less sweating, but there is no odor, no staining of your clothes, and no messy residue. Hard to believe it works so well. Just wet it and apply under arms. It just feels like a smooth stone that leaves no visible film behind, but miss a day and you&#x27;ll realize how well it works. I like the dispenser. When I used to use the stones, they would occasionally slip out of my hand while wet and shatter into a thousand pieces on the floor! If you can hold on to them, the stone of the dispenser both last over a year.</li>
            <li> 4 stars; awesome product with a not so awesome delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now on my second order of this deodorant, as the first one had the crystal sent into the sink and shattered into a number of pieces due to the plastic body giving out during use. The second one lasted 2 uses before the outer body separated from the bottom/crystal. The tabs that slide the crystal up and down became worn too much to slide into the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works as advertised through 90% of days. If you are in a sweat-inducing environment, I would not count on this deodorant to get you through without leaving some odors. I use this after my morning shower, and I&#x27;ll go with no odor the whole day. When I work out, I augment this deodorant with some Herban Cowboy (http://www.amazon.com/Herban-Cowboy-Deodorant-Maximum-Protection/dp/B004153MG4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418209560&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;herban+cowboy+deodorant) and it works great until I shower again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great purchase and I would absolutely recommend it. Just be gentle with it when applying, and hopefully you can avoid the housing issues I experienced.</li>
            <li> been using these rocks for decadeds,  turned plenty of people on to them.  lasts forever and a day. use after shower or pit cleaning, and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or ruin your shirts</li>
            <li> This deodorant is nice because it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, and is good on sensitive or irritated skin, but it just doesn&#x27;t keep my dry, even in cooler weather. I only use it when I want to be sure I won&#x27;t stain my shirt.</li>
            <li> For Me it worked. Did not smell Like anything. This Will be my deodorant for when I do not need to smell special like sports etc. Also because of the application process it will last a while and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. So nice not to be using chemicals, one less thing to worry about exposing your body to. Works great, I have noticed that I have practically no B.O.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as described..</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  It does a solid job preventing odor and goes on clean.  No chance of staining.  If you have severe BO, this might not work for you, but I&#x27;m very satisfied.  I&#x27;ve had mine for 9 months and I&#x27;ve only used about 1/3 of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip on applying it..  your armpit needs to be wet so, after my morning shower, I don&#x27;t dry my underarms and immediately put the deodorant on.  Works very well.  Also, don&#x27;t apply it to a dirty armpit because the odor will transfer to the deodorant stick and it will take some time for it to go away.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything except absorb the smell of your pits so that it reapplies your own BO over and over.</li>
            <li> I used to be brand loyal to Old Spice antiperspirants.  My father and wife swayed me to move away from antiperspirant with aluminum in them.  I decided to try this product after I saw the spray version in a spa in Napa, CA.  Once you wet the stick, the product goes on easily.  I feel dry for about 10-12 hours.  I use this before my workouts, and in 3 months, the stick does not look like I have used it at all.  I really believe this will last for the entire year if not longer.  Even though it says for Men, there is no reason I see that it could not be used for a women.  My wife uses the spray version of the product.  **UPDATE** So after 22 months I am down grading this product from a 5 to a 4.  I am on the original stick still.  The issues I have found is that after time, the twist up feature no longer works.  Also, if I am sweating for more than an hour, my body odor starts to come back.  I had to stick to an antiperspirant when I went on a beach vacation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start by saying that there is an identical product from the same company, that is cheaper: [[ASIN:B000L978FU Crystal - Crystal Stick Body Deodorant, 4.25 oz sticks]]&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the difference? This is one has a masculine clear bottle while the cheaper one is a pink purple bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Good]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really great for getting rid of body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No chemicals and all natural. It&#x27;s just a small block of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of price, it beats out regular deodorants. From personal experience, just one of these things will last for at least 5 years. I say at least because I&#x27;m still using it. I found that if one end gets cracked, or has ridges, just use it lightly; and over time it will get smooth again. (You&#x27;re supposed to use this after you take a shower so that skin is still semi-wet.) If you were to really max one of these out, I&#x27;m guessing that it will last for a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Bad]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this works for odor, I don&#x27;t think it does anything about preventing sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time it may or may not develop semi-sharp cracks after approximately 3-4 years of daily usage (I use mine 1-2 times a day). To get rid of these cracks, you just have to keep using it, and it will slow smooth out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The places you rub this deodorant on should be semi-wet. You cannot use this on skin that doesn&#x27;t have a little water on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container isn&#x27;t good. It&#x27;s too easy to break it when you drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve already mentioned, this is identical to the purple bottle, [[ASIN:B000L978FU Crystal - Crystal Stick Body Deodorant, 4.25 oz sticks]] but for some strange reason it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because when I use secret or dove it makes my odor worst like its masking the smell, plus it usually doesn&#x27;t last all day long. My mom is thai and she always had this crystal rock in her bathroom and she uses it religiously but I never thought to purchase it until now. I have bought this and the spray and both work great! I think the stick works better though. After a shower I apply it liberally after wetting the tip, after it dries I spray my armpits a couple of times for extra protection. Loving it and no smell whatsoever, its great. I should have thought of it sooner</li>
            <li> Being a physically active and athletic older adult male (running, weightlifting, tai-chi, etc) I really wondered if this product was even worth trying since it contains virtually none of the typical deodorant antiperspirant chemicals of most currently marketed US products (compounds of the ?propylene glycol and aluminum/zirconium ?chlorohydrex gly types). But to me this “lack” can also be viewed as a plus since subjecting my body to the potential contamination of absorbing these complex non-metabolizable chemicals never seemed very smart, especially as I got older (and maybe a little wiser, who knows?). So the question for me clearly was, “Does the product work dependably as claimed as an underarm deodorant under long-term reasonable conditions?”  After over several months that reached well into the Rocky Mountain summer of using only it once a day immediately after an early morning shower, the answer to that for me was a surprising “Yes it certainly does, quite effectively, when properly used.” For me the secrets to successful use were: apply immediately after a shower (as soon as I was dried-off); moisten the stone sufficiently so that it really glides on your full under-arm areas; and then of course wear clean fresh clothing afterward. For me several unexpected benefits were that it is total fragrance-free itself — if you use a preferred scented bath soap that’s how you’ll smell, it is completely stain-free to clothing, and the manufacturers aren’t exaggerating when they imply one stick will last a year — possibly longer. My rating is 4-stars — 5-starts for the products itself, but minus a star for the rather poorly designed stone retaining mechanism of the plastic container [if you’re not careful the stone can dislodge from the container and could very well shatter if it hits the sink, tub, or floor]. Hint: if the stone comes loose a small piece of friction tape around the perimeter of the very bottom of the stone will lock it into the container fairly securely. Too bad to have to kluge-up a good product like this...container fairly securely. Too bad to have to kluge-up a good product like this...</li>
            <li> Fantastic Stick deodorant. Very convenient to use compared to the crystal I have used before that was not in a package like this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff .. no other smells to compete with my cologne. Put it on right after toweling off after shower and you have just enough dampness for the crystal to glide on.</li>
            <li> Works, just give it some time and wet it before applying.</li>
            <li> I only left 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days. This stuff has been great though. I sweat, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a have sweater, so if you are it might not work and it might work. I think this stuff is going to kind of vary case to case. But in the first two days I noticed the redness under my arms is completely gone away. Nothing left. I previously used Tom&#x27;s aluminum free deodorant. There&#x27;s absolutely no scent to this stuff which is pretty cool. You do have to wet it first. If you apply immediately after a shower I would just lightly dry your pits before applying this. I tried running it under water then applying and I&#x27;ve also used a spray must bottle under my arms then rubbing it on. I like that way better. Sometimes if you run it under water it leaves your pits sopping wet and that sucks. Other than that, this stuff seems to work wonders (so far)! If I find this stuff to not work well in a few weeks I will update my review!</li>
            <li> This really works -- hard to believe.  The reason for only 3 stars is that it breaks off and you have to hold it in with you fingers as you apply it.</li>
            <li> I really wonted to like the Crystal Body Deodorant Stick to work. I used it every day for 2 months. I noticed that my work shirts started to have a slight order. I tried to apply more because I thought maybe I just wasn&#x27;t using enough. I knew that there was no way after that I wasn&#x27;t using enough. I honest to goodness shaved my pits as a final ditch effort and it really made no difference. It is amazing how long they would have lasted if they worked for me. After 2 months it shows little to no use. I did put it on right after a shower each morning and I would just run water over them first so it wasn&#x27;t that. I am a male and in general I don&#x27;t really smell a lot. I started using them instead of the regular chemical powdery sticks because the white mess left behind from them. Fact is they just didn&#x27;t work for me. .</li>
            <li> Once I did not wet it enough before putting it on so it did not really go on.  After walking in the hot sun I noticed I smelled less than pleasant.  I then thought this would be a good test, so I wet it, put it on, and waited.  Within a few minutes the smell was gone completely, and I stayed fresh the rest of the day and night.  The next day my skin was fine, no redness or itching like some of the other deodorants I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I know this stuff works.  Just make sure to wet it enough before applying so it goes on your skin.  I like that it does not smell like soap or anything else too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a trial-as I wasn&#x27;t sure it would really work.  But it does!  Honestly, I am very happy with it and have not had any issues with body odor.  I apply it after showering or in the morning if I don&#x27;t shower and have not had any problems.  I am very happy with it knowing it is natural and doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> It can be hard to believe that something like this is very effective until you try it. Too different from conventional deodorants. You may have to moisten the tip a bit before applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It really works.&lt;br /&gt;- Natural. Made from a certain type of mineral salts&lt;br /&gt;- One stick will last for years&lt;br /&gt;- Absolutely no scent&lt;br /&gt;- Non-staining &amp; invisible&lt;br /&gt;- Not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Remember, this is a deodorant not an anti-perspirant</li>
            <li> This Crystal Body Deodorant Stick is exactly the same stuff that&#x27;s sold in the purple plastic case; it&#x27;s only labeled differently to appeal to men (or people who don&#x27;t want a purple container). Personally, I don&#x27;t really care what color the package is. This stuff works great for me, has no perfume or scent, doesn&#x27;t leave any stains or marks like &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; deodorants and antiperspirants do, and lasts a really long time. I think the only drawback to this stuff is that after some use, the solid piece of crystal shrinks enough to make it difficult to stay in the twist-up container, so it&#x27;s prone to slipping out of the holder and smashing on the sink/floor/counter/etc. Even if the thing shatters, you can still usually salvage enough large pieces to use while you&#x27;re waiting for your new stick to arrive.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would work for my son but he said he still needs a true deodorant.</li>
            <li> Package was just a folded piece of cardboard. Product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> hubby hates it, didn&#x27;t work for his smell, and when he would go to roll it on his skin it would pinch him</li>
            <li> The first deodorant that I have used that didn&#x27;t make me break out. A great deodorant!</li>
            <li> Not exactly sure why it&#x27;s just advertised as being for me, both genders use it.  Excellent product, I have used Crystal Body Deodorant stick for many years &amp; they last a really long time!  It works for me even in hot, humid weather.  I&#x27;m allergic to antiperspirants, many deodorants &amp; soaps, but I don&#x27;t react to this product at all.</li>
            <li> This product has got to be the worst \\&quot;wanna be\\&quot; deodorant i have ever used. I have armpits that require alot of protection, this sounded good. i paid for it and recieved it in the mail \\&quot;late\\&quot;, that was problem number one. problem number two shocked me when the lid of the product was not responsive to closing very well and that was agitating, now for problem number three. i used this product the first day i got it, BIG MISTAKE! i slowly but surely started noticing after using the product that it would fade so easily that it would literally last for up to maybe 20 minutes, and even before 20 minutes i would sit there and smell a little stinch coming from my under arms, like i said i require alot of underarm protection. this product is very weak and unprotective. i wouldent pay a dime for this stuff and refuse to let anyone i know either. DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS WORTHLESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;by the way, as im writing this i can smell my armpits...THANKS CRYSTAL BRAND! YOU GUYS TAKE THE DANG CAKE!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I started getting a rash with the popular deodorants and finally tried this.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now.  No more rash and I find it as effective or even more effective than the popular deodorants.  Based on how little has been used, this one purchase will likely last years, I don&#x27;t know how the company will make any money on this.</li>
            <li> My biggest fear was amount of sweat with not using anti-perspirant.  Personally I can use this during the summer just fine.  I don&#x27;t sweat a lot anyway, unless I am working out or very hot.  I wore this for several days when the temp was over 95 degrees and humid and it worked well to control smell.  I can get 1.5 days out of each application, so no need to worry if you can&#x27;t get home that night to reapply in the morning.  I also enjoy smelling like myself, not what the manufactures choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After over a year of use I still have the original stick and have only had to increase the height by 1 click.  I&#x27;ve used maybe 1/2 an inch, and at this rate will work a couple years.  I apply liberally, but it seems to last.  An interesting point- I wear my shirts at the gym multiple times and they start to smell faster, I used to get about 3 wearing out of them easy with anti-perspirant, now 3 is pushing it.  I smell fine, but they shirts don&#x27;t have the salt on them(of course) and seem to grow bacteria fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The stick arrived from AmericaRx bouncing around in a too-large box with a tiny bit of padding; of course the crystal stick was broken in half. Makes it hard to use..... has anyone found a way to glue the stick back together? Leave me a comment if you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works fine; no stinging or rash so far (1 week). Odor controlled without a perfume smell - nice. We&#x27;ll see if it prevents yellow pit stains on white shirts.</li>
            <li> I love crystal deodarants and have used them for probably 15 or more years. I have always used individual blocks, though. They work fine, but I drop them and then lose valuable deodorant to the bathroom tile as corners of the blocks would chip off and disintegrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this time I bought a stick! Much better. I like the ease of using it without trying to not drop a wet block of crystal. A little bit of water on the surface, and it glides right on and works perfectly all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why others who reviewed this product had such terrible times with it - it&#x27;s worked perfectly for me from the first day I used it. Both the plastic housing it is in has worked, and the deodorant itself has worked perfectly and done its job.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. It&#x27;s better than any other deodorant that I&#x27;ve used. I only need it once per day unless I shower more thanonce that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I formerly used the cyrstal deodorant that comes in the pink container. I imagine that this product is identical to the one in the pink container. However, I did have someone ask me why I had a pink deodorant. Thus, I highly recommend using the clear &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; version of the container.</li>
            <li> This works ok and I would prefer to use something natural, but not when I am worried that a coworker will smell me. I wear this when I am at home for the day!</li>
            <li> Really works. You still sweat, but there is no odor...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of how well this would work.  After using it for about a month, I&#x27;m in shock on how amazing it is that I don&#x27;t smell BO from the underarms!  I&#x27;m very active and play tennis, cardio which results in sweating like a fiend.  I can say that from the armpits, there was no smell.  When I roll it on, I feel like nothing is coming onto the armpits.  I&#x27;ve tried many other fancy deodorants but all had failed the ultimate test of tough conditions such as sweating from workouts etc.  I bought my wife the girly version of this and she loves it too.  It&#x27;s too much of a well kept secret.  Considering it lasts for a year, that is a tremendous value.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in excellent condition. I have seen broken cases before but this one was perfect. I have used the deodorant crystal for 15+ years and still use it. Tips for making it lasts the longest 2+ years is to remove any moisture from the stone when done and turn the product upside down for storage.</li>
            <li> Love the natural aspect of this deodorant. It certainly does keep any foul odors away for nearly all of the day. By late evening, I notice that I may sometimes begin to develop a slight odor, but it does an excellent job of protection all day. What was frustrating, in my experience, is that while my pits did not smell at all, my shirt pit sometimes did. I guess it was due to the sweat? It frustrated me because if you see that your actual armpits do not smell badly, then you would hope/think that your shirt pits didn&#x27;t smell, but that wasn&#x27;t always the case for me. What I ended up doing was applying other stuff, in addition, for some scent. Using powder seems to help somewhat. I kind of wish this deodorant had some kind of scent to it, for maybe it would help my particular case, but I don&#x27;t know. As of now, the product is pretty good for what it does. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months, but many say it can last well over a year, which is a great value. It certainly stops odor and is natural, so there&#x27;s not a ton to dislike. I&#x27;ll definitely continue using it, but I&#x27;m not against trying other products for the aforementioned reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a scented spray version of this product, but it&#x27;ll run you a little more and I&#x27;m wary of how long it&#x27;ll last due to being a spray version. I don&#x27;t typically buy spray-on deodorants, so I&#x27;m a little unsure.</li>
            <li> This works better than my typical deodorant in regards of order protection. It’s not an antiperspirant so I sweat like a you know what on nickel night! I wish there was a natural product that prevented sweating under pits, but 5 stars for order protection!</li>
            <li> Works well, no smell, no horrible additives. But a little hard to use on hair pits. Need to apply for a while to get adequate protection. Also flakes out the bottom of the container. Still the best choice I have made in deodorant.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of a natural salt deodorant, but my husband very reluctantly used it.  He&#x27;s used to the types that are scented and &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; more substantial.  To him it didn&#x27;t seem like a salt rock was doing much.  For a month or so he obliged, putting it on after his morning shower, as is recommended.  But...he dropped it twice. At the first drop, the lid and turning dial broke. The second drop went into the toilet. So needless to say he did not continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We won&#x27;t be ordering it again, because although it seemed to work decently for that month, I don&#x27;t think he liked the way it was designed (too easy to break, could be slippery when grabbing after a shower). We have, however, been trying the salt spray on deodorant by Naturally Fresh. He likes that format much better.</li>
            <li> it runs out too quick, yeah its natural, but i would wear this to sleep rather then go out in a night of clubbing.</li>
            <li> I use to use regular stick deodorant. It would stain my undershirts to the point where I had to replace them a lot sooner that they wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;Also I read about the chemicals (aluminum?) that go into the regular deodorant. It turns out that is a sensitive part of the skin, that is why some medications are delivered via underarm applicator!&lt;br /&gt;My concern was of course, would it hold to the end of the day? yes it does. You have to learn ho to use it. I open the faucet so I can put it under and make it wet and then I apply it all around under the arms and make maybe twenty movements (with the regular paste or dry deodorant it was just one pass) cover all the area under the arms.&lt;br /&gt;No stains. My undershirts now stay white.&lt;br /&gt;Also it has to be a lot cheaper than regular sticks because I bought another one and it must be more than eight months!</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything. Doesn&#x27;t cover up odor and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me and yes, I applied it correctly.  I&#x27;m was a little skeptical since this contains an alum. I wanted it to work so bad, however I&#x27;m still looking for a product that is natural and works.</li>
            <li> Seems like it works. I like that its natural and not chemical based.</li>
            <li> After using this kind of deodorant, I will not go back to the regular kind. Definitely works better than my old one. Btw, I&#x27;m a woman and it works perfect for me :)</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. No perfume, it works for me. One does need to wash well to start. Male,70 yr old, 70in tall. I work full time in sales and do a lot of DIY.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect deodorant. It works. It is hypoallergenic. It doesn&#x27;t smell or stain. It is very economical: one stick lasts a year or two.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Supposed to eliminate odor, but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> this $H!T is the bomb. i have used it everyday and im still on my first one since jan 2014.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t this these work that great. I was smelling soon after using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the wintertime &amp; thought it was an answer to prayer.  I thought I had finally found THE product without the chemicals, aluminum, etc.  For winter, this product was fine.  As soon as it started heating up outside &amp; we started working outside &amp; sweating, this product was not helpful.  It did not repel the &#x27;stink&#x27; of body odor AT ALL.  I will probably still use this item in the wintertime but will have to find another product for summer time.</li>
            <li> Works, not as well as traditional deodorants, but decently all the same.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective deodorant that does not have any fragrance.  I&#x27;ve used these before and they seem to last forever.</li>
            <li> I can no longer use regular deodorant because I get rashes. This works pretty well to fight odor but not wetness. It said &amp;#34;men&amp;#34; but it works for women too. Just do not shave before using, (think salt on a wound, ouch). Very economical !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these crystals now for two years (each crystal lasts just over one year!) and I love them.  No more burning underarms from regular deodorants like Old Spice.  And no body odor no matter how hot the summer day is, or how hard you exercise.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of comments that this antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t work for some. Well, the fist day it arrived I thought I&#x27;m going to be one of those as well. But the second day I was happy. It might not work for everyone, but it does for me. Perfectly. I use it immediately after shower, I don&#x27;t even wipe my underarm with a towel to keep the moist there and apply Crystal. Works great for the whole day. I trashed all other brands.</li>
            <li> For me this stuff is a life savor. So much cheaper and better for you than all that other smelly stuff. I will say this however, if you have really bad BO, you may want to use additional help as this may not cut it. It can help when used along with other things to help minimize odor. I recommend this to everyone who asks me what I use.</li>
            <li> I love using rock/crystal deodorant. Your body is supposed to sweat, so this allows it to do so freely. Stink is not desirable, so this stuff works by making your sweaty areas uninhabitable to the little bacterium that like to feast upon your glands&#x27; biproducts. Those little bacterium make your stinky areas smell bad as a result of their metabolizing the stuff you secret, so if you make yourself inhospitable to them, then they can&#x27;t do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is wet the crystal and rub it wherever you sweat the worse (especially the armpit). Use this fresh out of the shower and you won&#x27;t stink for at least 24 hours after application. You can also use it on your feet. It dries clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the label says &amp;#34;For Men&amp;#34; and has some shirtless muscular dude flexing on the label to convince you how manly it is or something, but let&#x27;s be real...it works just as well for men as women. It has absolutely no odor, so if any of you ladies are worried about smelling like a dude, then worry no more. I am a woman and I use it all the time. I don&#x27;t stink, and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> I never have any underarm odor with these crystal deodorant sticks.  The first week until the regular deodorant was completely scrubbed off my underarms, yes, after that, never!</li>
            <li> Alright, I was skeptical about rubbing a moist rock under my arm for deodorant. I must say that it works! AND it seems to be a better anti-perspirant than right guard spray that I have been using for 30 years. It has been in the 90&#x27;s here lately, and I do not stink at the end of the day and my underarms are relatively dry in comparison to Right Guard. It has no scent. The fact that it has no aluminum in it is a plus. This thing works! Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This works great for normal use.  It does not last all day for me.  I freshen up in the afternoon, usually with Brut deodorant stick, on most days.  On days where I just go with the Brut, I have to freshen up several times during the day too.  That&#x27;s just how my body chemistry works. When this is working I can&#x27;t smell ANYTHING under my arm.  It is the strangest sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I work out with the Crystal on, or do anything that causes me to sweat, then I have to reapply or I start to get odor.  I change shirts and freshen up.  I don&#x27;t trust products that can survive a good workout anyway!  I like that this simply sweats or washes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that the container is not pink (I believe that is the only difference between the original and this men&#x27;s version).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does last forever.  In fact, it starts falling apart inside (as water dissolves the salt) and makes the stick come out of the plastic.  I could just nurse it along, but it is just a dang salt stick and not expensive, so at that point I toss it and order a new one.  Mine is used daily and goes six-months before that happens.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and lasts far longer than one year, if you don&#x27;t drop it.  Have been using natural mineral salt for deodorant for years and this one is the easiest to use.  Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for mineral salt deodorant.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the branded deodorant about a month ago.  This stuff is great because my shirts aren&#x27;t getting stained at the armpits anymore.  I do notice that I have to slather it on or else I will start to stink midday but it is still better than the clothes staining.  Even if you are skeptical take a chance with this stuff.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I have two of these things on standby just because.  Maybe even for friends.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff really does work.  It reduces sweating and I don&#x27;t smell.  I even got my husband his own and it is working for him.  Will defnately be buying again when we run out - this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product works well for me personally. No it does not stop me from sweating but it will keep me from stinking. I don&#x27;t know if I could fully recommend it for anyone who sweats profusely or with very bad body odor since it doesn&#x27;t stop sweat and it might not stop heavy odor. However, if you&#x27;re a like me and only sweat moderately with normal body odor, this product should work great.&lt;br /&gt;I find that it works best when applied right after a shower. Fully wet the crystal with clean water and apply it liberally to your underarms, I re-wet it between arms. I find it best to not wipe under my arms after applying and let the water absorb/evaporate naturally so that the salt crystals aren&#x27;t wiped away.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts about a day or so for me. If I haven&#x27;t worked out or sweated much you might go two days, but I tend to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;The crystal doesn&#x27;t really work to kill existing odor. If your armpits smell then you need to wash them before applying the crystal.</li>
            <li> I found this product only marginally effective with not much to like about the packaging. The stick is a heavy block contained within a fragile clear plastic case. After one week of normal use, I&#x27;ve cracked the top and base of the packaging and I thought that I smelled better than when I use nothing but not as good as a standard deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works great. No more irritation/itching from other brands. Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> This works really well. When I got pregnant, my homemade deodorant, which had been working great, stopped working, the body odor was bad all the time and even my husband&#x27;s regular deodorant couldn&#x27;t help. A friend told me about this and said her and her husband both use it (and he&#x27;s super into Cross Fit). I wanted a natural deodorant and it was so cheap I figured I had nothing to lose. I did find that I have to rub it quite a few times, but after about a week of use I was smell free and have been for the past several months now! Yay! I&#x27;ve even noticed that if l forget it, I&#x27;m still safe. On days I don&#x27;t shower I just get it wet under the faucet, it works just as good. And it will obviously last a looong time, which my thrifty self loves! I&#x27;ll be getting my husband one of these when his normal stuff is gone!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.  Net-Net this is a rock must be wet to apply. To apply you must be totally naked or the water will get on your clothes. First stick it under the water in the sink.  Then rub under the arm pits till it dries up, then repeat the water process again.  For something that should take ten seconds, this takes way too long. It hurts when it runs out of moisture. And after all that effort, it really doesn&#x27;t work; not even close.  My wife used the female version of this and she stopped using this way before I did.  I&#x27;ve never used this word in an Amazon review before, but this product SUCKS!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical, but followed what others said. Put it on when clean, wet it, give it a few days to get acclimated.&lt;br /&gt;Well, in a period of the last month I&#x27;ve:&lt;br /&gt;went to Six Flags amusement park on a humid day in August. Sweated, and was pretty much the only one in my party that didn&#x27;t smell at the end of the day (this sealed the deal for me btw)&lt;br /&gt;Got married and ran around NYC (another humid day) in a tux sweating like mad. Worked 100%&lt;br /&gt;Went to the Mediterranean and sometimes went 1.5 days without reapplication. held up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on when right after my shower in the morning before drying off. Also put it on my feet too and my socks/sneakers no longer smell. a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see it lasting a full year. perhaps I&#x27;m applying more liberally than most? It&#x27;ll still last a long time and no&lt;br /&gt;more white stains on my shirts.I&#x27;ll certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Used this once then did some research and realized that this is not just a salt. This is alum salt. In other words, it&#x27;s still aluminum. So I think the advertising is deceptive and I think using this is worse for you than using a deodorant.</li>
            <li> used this product for years... love it.. and no bad chemicals</li>
            <li> I know it says it&#x27;s for men, but it should say &amp;#34;For REAL men.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t think of a manlier thing that rubbing a rock on your armpits and calling it deodorizing. Sure, I don&#x27;t smell, and that&#x27;s cool, but I get to smugly smirk at those rubbing weird white gunk on their pits, or spraying some spray that smells like horny 14 year olds. Blech. This stuff rules. It&#x27;s cheap, it works, and it gives you bragging rights.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet but is the same thing as another product I have used and it works very well and is all natural. Lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the generally positive feedback of this deodorant. It simply doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To contextualize that statement, I&#x27;m neither a particularly sweaty or odoriferous guy. I have a white-collar job. I am fortunate enough to live a particularly stress-free life. Despite that, this product only works for about 3-4 hours, then promptly loses its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, for example, the high was 48 degrees. I spent the day sitting comfortably in a climate controlled office, didn&#x27;t exert myself or sweat whatsoever, and drank 6-7 glasses of ice water throughout the day. An uneventful office day in the middle of winter should be about the easiest test of a deodorant of all time, but shortly after lunch the product stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the fourth time I&#x27;ve used the product, and the results are essentially the same--it simply doesn&#x27;t work after a few hours in a comfortable environment. If I was a construction worked in Texas pouring concrete in the middle of August, I&#x27;d be more understanding, but I suggest you try the alternatives out there if you do anything other than spend your time in a coma.</li>
            <li> No &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; me with this product.......and, safe to use.  A great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for everyone in the family and it work for the first month.  After that it stopped working for us, it started burning the under arm to much.  We went back to regular deodorant stick, I really wanted to stick with the rock.  But, I guess not for now still looking for something natural.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have tried this stuff years ago. My shirts were destroyed and my underarms were like a pale olive drab yellow relative to the rest of my skin. I decided to switch to Deodorant only and ditch Antiperspirant, but I was still slathering myself in Propylene Glycol, dyes and fragrances for no apparent reason other than my consumer brainwashing dictating that was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a grown man who has no time to smell like a junior high runt, I am very pleased with this product. I have even discovered that since I no longer am concerned with rashes or goofy smells, I can apply it to help combat odors elsewhere on my body such as my crotch and soles of my feet to great effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also fits in the traditional spot on my Ogio locker bag pouch, which was another pleasant surprise as I do not need a second travel size version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that this is applied over areas which are shaved, so there is no body hair to interfere with the performance of the product. You sweat out of the pores of your skin, if the product is not on your skin it is not going to work. End of story.</li>
            <li> After many years of using the typical \\&quot;speed stick\\&quot; deodorant, I would get a mild rash or burning in my armpit area. This solid stick has worked extremely well to keep me from becoming offensive, at least from a scent standpoint. Some reviewers have said it&#x27;s not that great, but to make this product effective, you MUST apply it to wet skin and not just where the hair in the armpit is. Wipe it around the whole area. I have used this stick for over a year and it is still effective for even a couple of sweaty days at work. Really, this is a great product, and if you don&#x27;t mind that you will sweat but not stink, this is for you. It is NOT an antiperspirant, but will not irritate your pits like some of the typical sticks or roll-ons used today.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is safe, and does the job.  You willl find that the crystal lasts for ever.  I had my last deodorant (I am a woman and this is unisex, believe me) stick for years,  Hard to find, glad it was here on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third one in about 5-6 years! These last a long time. They do a decent job of inhibiting odor-causing bacteria while still allowing you to sweat naturally.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still do sweat (because this is not an anti-perspirant) but I do not smell foul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most popular and most selling deos are also anti-perspirants.&lt;br /&gt;Their modus operandi is to stop you from perspiring so you wont smell bad but would smell like the deo.&lt;br /&gt;Perspiration is a natural human body function and you do not need to meddle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deo does not allow any bacteria to grow and lets you perspire.&lt;br /&gt;I do not think I will ever go back to the most popular deo again that makes me smell like a flower and their ad campaigns promise to make you smell like alpha-males. :)</li>
            <li> Works great no stains Need to use it as directed doesn&#x27;t work like an ordinary deorodant. Need to wash vigorously in order for best results, lasts all day even through sweating a lot.</li>
            <li> Does not protect against odor as well as the liquid version of this product. For best results, put on the product and dry with a hair dryer right after to seal in the salts. Lasts all day that way.</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff last a long time, it does eliminate underarm odor. I have used Mennen for more years than I can remember, but I more frequently have been getting bad rashes from using it. I started using this intermittently, but am using it all the time now. It will last all day if you are not active. It&#x27;s power is relative to the amount you sweat, so this could only last a few hours, depending on how active you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem is that the more you sweat the more your pores are open to absorbing whatever chemicals you use. My wife used to use antiperspirant,  but there is a correlation between aluminum and dementia/Alzheimer&#x27;s. She uses Tom&#x27;s of Main as she has to have a deodorant, but I keep it simple. This does have alum in it, so if you do want aluminum free, you should look for an organic stick. You will pay a lot more and a little of this does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, and I was very sceptical, but it works pretty good. I require a stronger deodorant and this holds up. Doesn&#x27;t make it through a full day if I&#x27;m golfing (in the desert) or hit the gym hard but a normal day, no problem</li>
            <li> My son LOVES this deodorant...and it really works...even in sweaty sports situations.  He started using this because was getting rashes from other deodorants.  The rashes have cleared up and we are both amazed at how well this works.</li>
            <li> As long as it is applied properly, works great. Eliminated armpit stains and odor. It does not stop sweat but once you get past the feeling of wet pits, you realize that the sweat doesn&#x27;t stink. My skin is also a lot healthier now.</li>
            <li> so far, great product (after 2 weeks use - we&#x27;ll see if it really lasts a year ;) )</li>
            <li> Reduced one star for the mechanics of the container.  Wish they just made a solid stick connected to a handle like the travel size...only bigger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crystal Body Deodorant for years and saw the \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; version, which is the same as the pink packaging.  The price is terrific and I purchased one for myself and one for my husband who I finally convinced to try the Crystal.  It has worked on him.  Neither of us use an antiperspirant as it is not good for the body.  We were made to sweat, we just don&#x27;t need to smell when we do and the Crystal allows you to sweat without the odor.</li>
            <li> It looks like hippie stuff, but I can&#x27;t argue with results. In the winter time, I tend to have to wear multiple layers, because it&#x27;s cold outside, but the subway is heated. It&#x27;s freezing on the walk from the subway to work, but the office is heated. During that transition time between walking in and taking off my layers, I sweat buckets, and it&#x27;s kind of gross to see my shirts. This actually keeps me dry all day long.</li>
            <li> the only thing that works for me! it is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as he has very sensitive skin and tends to break out in a rash several months after using deodorant.  We&#x27;re constantly switching brands to find one he can tolerate.  I read such positive reviews so this sounded amazing.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work at all and he smelled terrible a few hours post shower.  I think the deodorant itself just smells gross.  We gave it a good try for a week and finally had to toss.  It just didn&#x27;t work at all.    **For those that have commented to me saying it&#x27;s impossible for this product to have a scent - In my opinion it does and it&#x27;s not a scent I enjoy.  No need to comment that I&#x27;m wrong.  In my personal opinion on this product, in my own review, I believe it doesn&#x27;t work and it smells.  Write your own review if you believe otherwise.</li>
            <li> love it. works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: after some usage wetting it repeatedly, it falls out of the case and usually cracks on the sink or floor. i&#x27;d prefer a way to use it without the &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34; plastic case. some have suggested wetting it so the water does not run down the sides of the mineral stick.</li>
            <li> If I sound surprised in the headline, I actually am - will purchase it again. Don&#x27;t expect it to last a long workout session, but for normal daily use/activity, a great product that doesn&#x27;t have chemicals or ingredients you can&#x27;t pronounce and that actually works.</li>
            <li> Sure, a crystal? My first thought was &#x27;These guys haven&#x27;t smelled ME!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago a friend of mine owned a health food store and recommended an early version of this product. It basically was, well, a smooth &#x27;rock&#x27; vs. a nice twisty applicator. Stubbornly, I refused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be overly personal, but as I was dieting I noticed my stink factor was rising. In fact - and I can&#x27;t verify this - it seemed the more fragrance-y coverup products I used, the stronger my &#x27;stank&#x27; got. THIS is not an attractive trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First day with Crystal Body Deodorant and my foulness had met its match. Half a star off for a little to much &#x27;play&#x27; in the applicator. I made a little cardboard shim to settle it down and it worked great. Lasted a lot longer than I had ever expected, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People&#x27;s chemistries differ, so your mileage may vary but I&#x27;m happily on my second stick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ready to call this the best value in my medicine cabinet. I just purchased my third since my initial review and I shower twice a day and use this product each time. When I think about how much money I used to spend on some pricey P&amp;G product often, I cringe. This continues to work like a charm as I&#x27;m out hustling in my job during the summer heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, which is great.  I ordered it in search of the perfect unscented deodorant not to mention it looked like a unique and inexpensive product. Oh, and it had a 4.5+ star average.  I wanted and expected this to be my go-to deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work.  But after using it for a month I found it doesn&#x27;t consistently last longer than 3 hours.  And, for that reason, I&#x27;ve relegated it to the medicine cabinet where it will serve me well for the occasions I run out of real, unnatural, dependable deodorant.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice and easy to use.  When I first received my crystal deodorant I applied it as directed and went to the gym.  Hey, it does not work for heavy perspiration.  So I try it every now and then in the mornings when I am not exercising.  I still can&#x27;t decide if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this product however, I was using 5-day deodorant pads EVERYDAY to control perspiration odor. I was concerned about the amount of Aluminum Chlorohydrate (25%) in that product. Until now, I thought the 5-day deodorant pads worked better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. Crystal Body Deodorant Stick WORKS EVEN BETTER to control odor. It&#x27;s very inexpensive too. I&#x27;ve been using the same stick everyday since January 2014 and it looks like it has many more months of use!</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of the mineral salts. Much better than deodorant if you have the right body chemistry for it. This one in particular is nice because I have broken more blocks than I have finished and I believe with the housing on this one I may see it to the end. If you have never tried one, try it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product lasts forever and is all natural. It works enough to the point where you won&#x27;t stink but by the end of the day there&#x27;s a little funk that rears it&#x27;s ugly little head. I guess that comes along with the territory of using any all natural deoderant that doesn&#x27;t conatin aluminum.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product that has become my everyday, go-to deodorant. I like that it&#x27;s simply salt and nothing more. Although I don&#x27;t live an &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; lifestyle by any means, I did develop concern about my periodic underarm rashes and the chemical buildup that occurs when using typical deodorants daily on those sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to this product, I have had zero breakouts under my arms and seldom even have itchy underarms at all. Further, it actually feels more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; under my arms without any residue there - and there is no material left on my clothes either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is not heavy duty stuff. Putting it on in the morning, I start to have a little BO by the evening. That&#x27;s just to me though, I&#x27;ve never had anyone mention it. If I go to the gym, it&#x27;s gonna be smelly. I still go back to my Speed stik when I know I will be around people while perspiring heavily. Still, I use this stuff 90% of the time.</li>
            <li> I dont use it. Only If i was a tree hugging hippe. It would be for you but not for a gym goer. Like me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stain clothes or have any scent.&lt;br /&gt;It works well.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is best when put on right out of the shower and applied before you are completely dry&lt;br /&gt;Also - it last over 2 years with daily use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often but I felt the need to write one here! Regular deodorants started to irritate my skin and would constantly stain and ruin my shirts. I switched over to powdered deodorant which no longer stained my shirts or irritated my armpits but none of the ones I tried did much to mask my odor either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is AMAZING. First off, I barley feel like it is even there. No irritation, no streak marks, no nothing. Wasn&#x27;t even sure if it got applied the first time to be honest. Next, I am sitting here right now, two days without a shower or reapplying my deodorant with armpits that smell of absolutely NOTHING. No other deodorant has even come close and I can not say enough good things about this product! Buy and you will not regret.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It works if you follow the directions and apply right after you shower and wet the stone first.  Apply thoroughly, up/down, back/forth and around.  It last all day and beyond.  I work outdoors in the heat and this has not let me down in many years.  Also the stick I had before was smaller and lasted me a solid year plus.  I expect this larger size will last me almost two years.&lt;br /&gt;SOME NOTES:  I store mine upside down to prevent water dripping down into the container and molding.  At the end of my last unit (different brand but similar) the last bit of product fell out.  It was the size of a ping pong ball.  I keep that &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; in a plastic bag and take it with me on vacation; my own travel size deodorant. Finally if this is not working for you you may need to wash you pits more thoroughly when you shower and or trim back some of the hair.</li>
            <li> The deodorant works as advertised. Just apply a little water, and apply. I do not know if the chemicals I&#x27;m regular deodorant are harmful long term or not. It certainly could not hurt to avoid them. The label says it lasts a year. If it lasts half that long it will be worth it in savings alone.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get any of it out. I tried wetting it, shaking it, whatever. Gave up on it and got the Gilette clear gel that works wonders and is dispensed very easily.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a deodorant that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals. I also have a bit of a sensitivity to many deodorants. (I get itchy arm pits) I ordered this and I was skepticle. I didn&#x27;t think that a hard rock was going to combat my B.O. :-) Surprisingly, this works amazing. It lasts all day long and works better than the many deodorants that I have used over the years. I&#x27;ve had it for months now and it has hardly decreased in size. I&#x27;m actually saving money since I&#x27;m not buying deodorant every other week now. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well, but after a while the bottom of the stick starts dissolving, and since the stick is held in by threads formed in the bottom of the crystal, the crystal tends to fall out.</li>
            <li> Nice change from traditional deodorant. Only gripe is that I smell like BO later in the day while working in an office. It won&#x27;t really smell bad (I don’t have a strong body odor), but it&#x27;s a noticeable smell which regular deodorant usually covers up.</li>
            <li> It does work, if you use it religiously and rub it across your skin for at least 30 seconds.  I have found that if you rub it for any less time or forget to use it, it actually takes a couple of days to work again.  It does not work the same day.  It takes some time for the body odor to disappear but when it finally does, yes, it works.  The cons to this product are that it easily comes out of it&#x27;s container.  You cannot ever drop it, or you&#x27;ll be buying a new one because it shatters.  Also, mine came in contact with a sink full of water with other soaking times and it literally vanished.  Disintegrated in the water.  This is my 4th one in a year already because they have broken, fallen out of the case, etc.  If you don&#x27;t have slippery hands and can hang onto it without ever dropping it, great.  If not, be prepared to buy several.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to subject my 10 year old son to all the chemicals in an antiperspirant and the natural deodorants were not working for him because he has really, really bad BO! So after reading some of these reviews I decided to try the Crystal deodorant AND IT WORKS! He goes to a Parkour class after school and his whole body is completely drenched in sweat afterwards BUT HE DOESN&#x27;T SMELL AT ALL. What a relief to find this product!</li>
            <li> I use the women&#x27;s version (by the way, they&#x27;re the same) and bought this for my boyfriend who was SO skeptical... Well, it&#x27;s been months now and guess who loves it?! P.S. he&#x27;s a big guy and it keeps him from smelling all day at work. I was impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 years and I work outdoors in the FL Everglades year round. There was a period of adjustment, you may want to begin use on a weekend. Success depends on your personal biology, I&#x27;m sure some people have resistant strains of bacteria and this just won&#x27;t work for some.</li>
            <li> I like to wear cologne and as such I try to avoid heavily scented products that could clash. This stuff has no scent and keeps me minty fresh all day. I&#x27;ve gone camping and used this stuff on the first day and not stunk until the 3rd or 4th day. It is very easy to use, lasts a really long time (I think I&#x27;m at almost a year on my first stick) and most importantly, it WORKS.</li>
            <li> Get the THAI stone of $1 more, i thought this should work the same but it&#x27;s totally a knockoff product.  Get the Thai stone, NOT THIS.</li>
            <li> Amazing. It really works. First deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever been able to effectively use. I am allergic to the rest or the substitutes don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> it works well. my only issue is... it should have a textured dispenser, cause it works best when you apply it to a wet armpit, but it easily slips out of your hands. I shattered 2 so far when they hit the floor. think the next one will get a sanding to ruff it up.</li>
            <li> Still using this, probably a year later.  I told my daughter about it, she&#x27;s a major Zumba person going sometimes twice a day.  She started using Crystal for Men and says it works for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Salt Rocks for years now and I love them.  But, just to be clear for most of you.  This not an antiperspirant, it&#x27;s a deodorant.  In fact, for me, I don&#x27;t mind sweating.  I got used to it, when I was kid, playing outside.  So, I&#x27;m not concerned about wether I sweat or not.  At least with this, I&#x27;m not offensive with my body order.  But, also note that body order is not because you naturally stink, it&#x27;s because of crap you put into your body.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Just sayin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> You may be thinking:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Does this actually work?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does. However, you have to either A. saturate the crystal with water or B. have really wet armpits. If water is not involved, it won&#x27;t go on your body. Also, you must LIBERALLY apply it. I make 40-60 quick strokes over each underarm. I also make sure to press down hard on 5 or 10 of those strokes. Maybe this isn&#x27;t necessary, but I tend to smell easily and I just want it to work. You also might have to apply it about 2-3 times a day, but this is depending on many factors such as diet, activity, general body chemistry, etc., etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way this is not antiperspirant. This is a natural product and truly natural products do not keep your body from doing what it is supposed to do. Your body is supposed to sweat. Deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Is this good for me?&lt;br /&gt;Yes. There are no synthetics or chemicals in this. It&#x27;s just a crystal. The additives in your tap water is worse for you. Which means that unless you&#x27;re using distilled or RO water, the water you put on the crystal will hurt you more than the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Are there ANY OTHER natural deodorants?&lt;br /&gt;Yes! This same brand has other good deodorants that are easier to apply, including wipes and roll-ons. Also, Young Living sells good natural deodorant as well, but you need a referral to buy from them and they are more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Is chemical deodorant REALLY that bad?&lt;br /&gt;Probably not as bad as what you eat. But look it up. You might be surprised.</li>
            <li> makes my husband smell-free and it is not sticky and natural. what is not to love!</li>
            <li> I am not a man, but bought this anyway and it is good....I have no idea why this is gender specific....is it perhaps stronger as men smell stronger?  Oh well, enough said.</li>
            <li> Still getting irritation under arms</li>
            <li> This was a great value, works well, was what I was looking for and I&#x27;m glad I bought this .</li>
            <li> Not for me! Has no smell and feels strange when putting it on.. it&#x27;s definitely different that&#x27;s all I can say...</li>
            <li> I have been using crystal for years, as my MD said I should never use antiperspirant.  I had a medical issue because I did.</li>
            <li> Did NOT work for me, at all, whatsoever!!</li>
            <li> I prefer unscented things so this is for anyone man or woman with the same preference. Plus it is slightly cheaper. So avoid the &amp;#34;pink tax&amp;#34; ladies and go for this one.</li>
            <li> tends to break in the center.</li>
            <li> works only under minimal activity. Anything strenuous whatsoever and you&#x27;ll smell quickly enough. Also, its a bit of a drag to have to wet the end with each application.</li>
            <li> The full chemical name of potassium alum is potassium aluminum sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that most people try to avoid aluminum in deodorant is because of its possible link to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. There is some strong evidence of a link -- for instance, in 1988, a truck driver accidentally dumped 20 tons of aluminum sulfate in to a town&#x27;s drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, over 20 years later, they are finding a higher incidence of Alzheimer’s in the people of this town.</li>
            <li> The first seller backed out because it suddenly did not have the item in stock.&lt;br /&gt;The second seller sent Men&#x27;s deodorant when my order was for Women&#x27;s deodorant.  The Men&#x27;s works just as well as the Women&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27; . . .&lt;br /&gt;The product is excellent and works beautifully to prevent odor no matter how intense the workout or the emotional experience.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for everyone, even teenagers.</li>
            <li> When this product was working it worked great. For the first few days everything worked as promised, there was no smell. However, after about a week of using this product, I started to develop an itchy rash under the arms. At that point I stopped using it and the rash went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure for some people this is ideal, for me, I am left looking for another natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I am a big guy and sweet all the time. This eliminates the smell. There is no smell at all after all day use. This is all i will ever use. Plus it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I love it. It goes on easy. And doesn&#x27;t dry out if I leave the cap off. It really works in these hot and humid summer days.</li>
            <li> I think I have what&#x27;s called hyperhidrosis. I sweat constantly, when i am hot, when i am cold and when i am just sitting doing nothing at all. It is embarrassing and annoying too. I had to change my shirt a couple times a day. I tried all the clinically proven antiperspirants with 22% aluminum what evers in them. Mitchum, Certain Dry and others that worked for a short time but usually left me itching and irritated, and sweating after a few weeks. So I tried this Crystal stick. Wow! I stayed mostly dry all day, not irritated and not embarrassed. I do suggest this for sweat problems even though is states its a deodorant and not an antiperspirant. Apply to wet skin right out of the shower and don&#x27;t wet the stone. When you wet the stone it starts to erode and causes sharp edges like glass on your tender pits. I hope this helps anyone suffering from constant sweating.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to but it works. I live in Miami and I work outside as a lineman just the other day it was 91 degrees with humidity making it feel like 103 degrees I was drenched in manly sweat and no smell under my pits . It&#x27;s pretty much a solid form of a mineral rock it&#x27;s really dry and in order to apply it you need to put some cream or water so it could slide when you apply it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my. Doctor since I was getting a rash from every other kind of deodorant. I&#x27;ve been impressed with the effectiveness of it. It&#x27;s nice to just not have any odor to deal with.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ... apply carefully, as it did sting the arm a little outside the prescribed area. Does a better job of stopping wetness than those without aluminum.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. It works perfectly, better than Mitchum. He&#x27;s happy with it and I&#x27;m happy knowing that he is not putting chemicals in his body.  Thank you, Crystal!</li>
            <li> After receiving a bad burn from a conventional aluminum based deodorant product, I did the research on this product and was amazed. I actually used it for the first time, went to the driving range and was totally surprised at the result. Since my wife uses Downey fabric softener when she washes, my t-shirts have a nice fragrance to them.  After I went to the driving range, I took my t-shirt off, folded it and took it to my son (He&#x27;s my Litmus Tester!) he smelled it and I asked him what he smelled and he said; \\&quot;It was just washed and i smell the Downy, dad.\\&quot;  I broke it down for him and he could not believe it.  He smelled the entire t-shirt and was still in disbelief.  I stink when I sweak! Not after this.  No kidding the freaking t-shirt smelled like it was just washed!&lt;br /&gt;Here is why it worked really well for me.  My burns were bad from the chemical / metal based product.  I had to shave the hair under my arms to reduce the irritation from the burns.  Since the Crystals block the bateria that develops from the mosture that interfaces with the hair under the armpits, when you cut the hair back, it makes the salts more effective.  When you have a forest under your arms, the Crystals have to work their way into the follicals. That is probably why some of the guys (not many) are getting poor results. I make is a point to keep my under arm hair short rather than maintaining a manly bush that doesn&#x27;t impress my wife and trust me, your wife and or girlfriend did not fall in love with you because of the amount of hair you have under your arms! Think about it.  It is super effective if you maitain a reduced level of hair under your arm. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product!</li>
            <li> A brand of deodorant I had used for years was discontinued, so since I was trying a new brand anyway, I thought I&#x27;d try something a little healthier/more natural.  I have been very impressed with how well this works.  I work an outdoor job in the heat, and even at that it provided pretty good odour protection.  As far as protection for just going out etc, it works fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have said though, I have found the key to getting it to work the best is to apply it immediately after a shower.  Or at a minimum, after wiping down your armpits at least (sponge bath).  It definitely wasn&#x27;t as effective when I was just applying it at random times, EG while already sweaty/smelly.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work like a typical deodorant in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick I bought 2 months ago has hardly even worn down at all, so on top of working well for me, it seems very cost effective.</li>
            <li> First deodorant my husband has found that works to control odor and does NOT irraratate his arm pits.  VERY happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s not disappearing quickly and I&#x27;ve used it for a year. My wife says I don&#x27;t have significant BO. It doesn&#x27;t cause irritation which is great!</li>
            <li> Moisten the crystal, swab it generously on your &#x27;pits, exercise and sweat all day.  You won&#x27;t stink at all because bacteria simply can&#x27;t grow in the salty environment you created.  Such a simple solution, but by far the most effective.  One ingredient (potassium alum) I know won&#x27;t irritate my skin. Works on the bottom of my feet, too.  Looks like a stick will last months if not a year, for the price of a commercial gel anti-perspirant that lasts a few weeks.  You should try this.</li>
            <li> Works great, feels great and doesnt leave white on my clothing</li>
            <li> This crystal stick can be used for men or women. The women&#x27;s stick is the same thing just in a different package. I am allergic to every deodorant I have tried, even all the natural ones like Tom&#x27;s. This stuff does the trick and I do not break out with a rash. A couple of key things to remember with this product: You must put it on after a shower or after you have cleaned. In addition, Your underarm must be partially wet in order for the stick to slide. Apply generously and overlap the under arm. I play in a soccer league and I&#x27;m still amazed after using this product for several years that I have no odor. I do reapply the stick before any major physical activity. If you are prone to sweating, you may sweat the product off and should probably reapply mid day at some point. It does not work as an antiperspirant. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> After making significant changes in the way I eat (eating more natural) I felt it was time to make a similar change when it comes to the use of products I apply to my skin and body.  I purchased this product with a natural shampoo and toothpaste as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I will say is after a couple decades of using a &amp;#34;sport gel&amp;#34; deodorant, this one took some getting used to.  It is unlike any store brand deodorant in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Application - You literally cannot feel it go on and subsequently cannot even tell if it is on after you apply it.  With store bought deodorants you can always tell it is there.  Even the &amp;#34;clear sticks&amp;#34; leave you with a &amp;#34;filmish&amp;#34; feeling under your arm after it is applied.  This one... nothing.  I probably apply a little too much when I use it, but I want to ensure I&#x27;m getting it on since I can&#x27;t feel that it is there.  It basically feels like rubbing a wet plastic ball on your skin.  To apply this you have to run it under water for a couple seconds to moisten it prior to application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Smell - Zero smell... so again you can&#x27;t tell if it is on... at all.  This takes some getting used to because if you have a bit of a BO smell it does not immediately go away after you apply it.  With store bought brands, they are so full of scents that any underarm smell you have goes away immediately after application.  You have to give this one some time to work as there is no scent to cover up body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Lasting Time - I sweat quite a bit less than the average male and also have very minimal body odor so for me, one morning application lasts the whole day just fine.  My underarms stay dry and odor free all day.  On days where I use the gym, my underarms do sweat and I can smell a small amount of body odor coming from them so I do have to apply a second time on those days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Amount for the price - For the price this deodorant is a great value.  It costs similar to the store brands but lasts a lot longer.  The packaging says it will last up to a year... I&#x27;m not sure about that yet, but I can certainly tell that it is going to last considerably longer than the store brands.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and it basically looks like the same amount it was when I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Overall - Overall I would recommend this product.  Once you get used to items 1 and 2 above it is just like any other normal deodorant in the fact that is deodorizes and keeps you from sweating.  I feel good that it does not have any of the harmful chemicals that store brands have.  That fact alone makes it 100% worth it to me.tore brands but lasts a lot longer.

            <li> When my brother told me that regular commercial brand deodorants contained aluminum in it and it could have serious side effects. I decided to throw my Old Spice Pure Sport away. I had been wearing that stuff for years as a teenager until recently. So my brother bought me a stick of this crystal deodorant and I have to say it works quite well. It won&#x27;t last all day if your exercising or doing some other strenuous activity that gets you sweating but then again you can reapply it. I was getting armpit stains from wearing the Old Spice and wanted something more natural and I don&#x27;t mind that its fragrance free. I apply this every morning before work and it seems to last all day and it doesn&#x27;t block your armpits from sweating. Sweating is natural and should not be blocked like most deodorants say they do.</li>
            <li> I switched to this deodorant because the one I was using previously was aluminum based, and it was ruining my shirts.  It was making the underarm area of my shirts all hard like cement.  Plus there is a question about how things containing aluminum would be bad for you.  After doing some research online, I came to the conclusion that Crystal would not ruin my shirts, and it is more of a natural product because it is basically just a composition of minerals.  So far I love it.  It has no scent though, if you are the type who likes a scent on your deodorant, use this product and then spray some Axe or something like that on top of it.  One thing to note, when you use this product, you have to apply it when you are right out of the shower (still wet), and you have to wet this deodorant in the sink also before applying it, or else it won&#x27;t work.  You can&#x27;t just apply it to dry skin as if it were a gel, because it is not a gel. Also note it is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant.  As far as I know, your body needs to perspire anyway, of course you don&#x27;t need to stink while doing it, so it is best to stick to deodorant anyway.  Update (several months later):  Twice, the deodorant mineral stick fell out of the cheaply designed plastic dispenser, both times it hit the sink and shattered.  After that, you basically can&#x27;t use it anymore because it will have jagged edges.  Because of this, I knocked off several of stars from the rating, and I am not going to buy this product a third time.  I just switched to old spice where this is not a problem, and old spice doesn&#x27;t ruin my shirts either.</li>
            <li> I like the none screw up version much better because the screw up crank will break and become brittle.</li>
            <li> I tried this and really, really wanted it to be a replacement for my Anti-Persperant Deoderant stick.  It just simply wasn&#x27;t, it would last a whole day if I wasn&#x27;t doing any physical activity, but if I went for a walk, or worked outside in the yard, things got stinky fairly quickly.  Oh well...</li>
            <li> The plastic holder is flimsy and comes off or rattles/breaks..</li>
            <li> Thought it was a bit odd and would never work, but works great.  Won&#x27;t be switching back to the usual deodorants EVER.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, apply it right after a shower.  It really does last a year or more.</li>
            <li> Good stuff at a good price.  Lasts a long time.  I have not minded the original &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; package but this one is better priced for the same contents.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! It&#x27;s a little strange adjusting to using it instead of more traditional antiperspirants or deodorants that just rub on with a single swipe. I found that I had to re-wet the tip a couple times to get complete coverage of my armpits. But applied liberally, it will last days. There was no scent at all from it. I have very sensitive skin and a bunch of allergies, and this stuff didn&#x27;t bother me at all. Add on to it that this &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; should last a year, and you&#x27;ve got a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 33 year old active male.  I live in South Florida (a true testing ground for any deoderant) and this stuff holds up all day.  The value combined with the nautrsl goodness of this product make it a no-brainier.  Stop thinking about it and just buy it.  I bought mine with full intentions of sending back to Amazon.  Didn&#x27;t believe it could do what it promised.  Well, it does and I&#x27;m more than happy.  It&#x27;s amazing what a little salt can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s horrendous what toxic chemicals can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After working for years at a major consumer packaged good company with a famous and market leading deoderant/antiperspirant brand that can be found on every drugstore/supermarket store, I became aware firsthand of the chemicals used in those products their toxicity to the body.  Let me tell you one thing, slathering on any store bought brand of antiperspirant/deodorant is playing Russian roulette with your health.  The elements used in name brand products are clinically linked to cancers and other horrible diseases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brands get away with it because there in minimal regulation on ingredients used in their products and the chemicals they use are super cheap for them to buy.  Their goal is quarterly profit; not your lifetime health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a deodorant.  It won&#x27;t make you stop sweating.  Our body is supposed to sweat.  Advertising has told us it&#x27;s not supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase it. Try it.  Return it if you aren&#x27;t happy.&lt;br /&gt;I can guarantee that won&#x27;t be the case.</li>
            <li> Going on my second year with my first one.  Works very well and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great! I started using it 15 years ago in an effort to avoid aluminum and found it works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not antiperspirant, just eliminates odors. It would probably work on foot odor. Packs well, does not need to be placed in 1 quart bag for TSA since it&#x27;s a rock.</li>
