            <li>Fragrance is light and good for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rinses clean and leaves your skin feeling good.</li>
            <li>Gets me clean, has a pleasant scent - not too strong.</li>
            <li>Bads outweigh the good, best used for harsh cleaning conditions like mechanicss.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but If I can help someone by providing more information about this product, I thought I should.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>and it really does a great job on those.  </li>
            <li>its ok but too perfumed.  </li>
            <li>Its overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>What more could you want.</li>
            <li>Great soap for guys who like to smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>smell is pretty good though</li>
            <li>Very good for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Cleans skins well and leaves a pleasant natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li>A good natural soap.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean, and I felt clean after I used it.</li>
            <li>The old soap had a good leather/wood smell, it also took grease right off.  </li>
            <li>The great rough and manly smelling bar of soap most of us have grown to love has taken a 180 degree turn and become a soft citrus scented soap.  </li>
            <li>I boutght it for my husband, who is hard to buy for, and he LOVED IT!!</li>
            <li>This scent smell like nothing doesn&#x27;t even larger good smells like rot when it lays on the shower .</li>
            <li>I love the oats that really roughen up the dirt and help cleanse the skin.  </li>
            <li>Probably good for hand soap to get stubborn tattoos off or something, but daily bathing with it is out for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dissapointed with how quickly you go through a bar.</li>
            <li>some bars were pretty good overall</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably good if you are a mechanic or other profession (soldier?)</li>
            <li>Well, they were exactly right.</li>
            <li>Thanks Maple Hill Naturals, you lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>Returning it today...Says its natural but has a strong synthetic cologne smell...</li>
            <li>Someone else who gave a review said they thought bathing should be a penitent process, and I thought this was funny until I received this soap.</li>
            <li>Best advice I can give is to keep the bar dry between showers, because it gets a little soggy.</li>
            <li>The shampoo bar is not only great for your hair, but I have dry skin on my legs and arms</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal to get a large pack like this so they will last a long time</li>
            <li>br /&gt;Is used up pretty fast (might get a week of use out of a bar)</li>
            <li>Maple Hills Naturals please make this a new bar and give us our old Honest for Men soap back!  </li>
            <li>The scent I don&#x27;t mind so much</li>
            <li>A bar lasts a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>If gently means a surface akin to a pumice stone dipped in diamond dust then I guess so.</li>
            <li>(I know, too much info)</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any real scent to speak of.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I go through it a bit too quickly, but that&#x27;s what you get with a good natural soap.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t like strong smelling soap), but this smells clean and subtle.</li>
            <li>ordered these, the ingredients are all natural, the price was reasonable and he likes the smell and the lathering quality.</li>
            <li>He disliked most brands I bought as they were too girly smelling or the bars used up way too fast.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, however, it does not last very long and uses up very quickly.</li>
            <li>The new soap smells like rotten tropical fruit and hippy stank.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for my face and gritty / strong enough to cut through engine grease.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer the old scent.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;great seller, completely satisfied&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>; The new bar has no oats for deep scrubbing and has a completely new scent.</li>
            <li>After trying to switch all of our health products, cleaning products and toiletries to a chemical free house I had a hard time finding a bar soap for my husband as he prefers bars to shower with.  </li>
            <li>Order my 5 bar value pack expecting the same great bar of soap only to be confused and let down.  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing in the description that lists this as an extreme exfoliant bar, but instead says &amp;#34;gently exfoliates&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is a bit rough, but I suppose that is part of what makes it manly soap :)</li>
            <li>I know that other people complained about this Men&#x27;s Soap being a bit too rough for their skin, but that is kind of the point.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This scent smell like nothing doesn&#x27;t even larger good smells like rot when it lays on the shower .</li>
            <li> All products are great!</li>
            <li> very gritty texture, not what i prefer. smell is pretty good though</li>
            <li> Great soap -- smells great (I don&#x27;t like strong smelling soap), but this smells clean and subtle.</li>
            <li> Cleans skins well and leaves a pleasant natural fragrance.  I love the oats that really roughen up the dirt and help cleanse the skin.  EDIT: Had to change my review as Maple Hill Naturals has changed their product.  Order my 5 bar value pack expecting the same great bar of soap only to be confused and let down.  The great rough and manly smelling bar of soap most of us have grown to love has taken a 180 degree turn and become a soft citrus scented soap.  The scent I don&#x27;t mind so much but I prefer the old scent.  Maple Hills Naturals please make this a new bar and give us our old Honest for Men soap back!  TLDR; The new bar has no oats for deep scrubbing and has a completely new scent.</li>
            <li> I got this because I read the reviews, and this is the first negative I have ever given a product. I got the soap and the only thing the scent reminds me of is dog food. The feel of the soap is great. It rinses clean, and I felt clean after I used it. I just couldn&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant.  A bar lasts a reasonable amount of time.  The exfoliant is way too rough.  It is like rubbing 60 grit sandpaper on your skin.</li>
            <li> I weent to Amazon at Christmas,requesting &amp;#34;really good soap for men&amp;#34; and this was shown. I boutght it for my husband, who is hard to buy for, and he LOVED IT!! Bought it again for Valentines&#x27;s day..will be buying it again!!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light Smell&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliates like non other&lt;br /&gt;Does&#x27;t dry out skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Light smell (I like to know I smell good and I cannot smell it, it&#x27;s so light)&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; are basically left over shrapnel, could potentially make you bleed&lt;br /&gt;Is used up pretty fast (might get a week of use out of a bar)</li>
            <li> After trying to switch all of our health products, cleaning products and toiletries to a chemical free house I had a hard time finding a bar soap for my husband as he prefers bars to shower with.  He disliked most brands I bought as they were too girly smelling or the bars used up way too fast.&lt;br /&gt;Then some bars were pretty good overall but they cost $8 per bar. Yikes!!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these, the ingredients are all natural, the price was reasonable and he likes the smell and the lathering quality. It&#x27;s a great deal to get a large pack like this so they will last a long time and they are just what he wanted.</li>
            <li> Bads outweigh the good, best used for harsh cleaning conditions like mechanicss.&lt;br /&gt;The Good:  Its a nice size bar, smell is neutral, lathers ok....&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  The embedded &#x27;pumice&#x27; is really too big sized particles, and is very harsh, and it dries out your skin worse than other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably good if you are a mechanic or other profession (soldier?) that needs a harsh cleaning and no scent, especially in a moist environment where you don&#x27;t mind a very dry soap.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but If I can help someone by providing more information about this product, I thought I should. Someone else wrote in a review that this feels like 60grit sandpaper, and I didn&#x27;t believe them. Well, they were exactly right. Someone else who gave a review said they thought bathing should be a penitent process, and I thought this was funny until I received this soap. There is absolutely nothing in the description that lists this as an extreme exfoliant bar, but instead says &amp;#34;gently exfoliates&amp;#34;. If gently means a surface akin to a pumice stone dipped in diamond dust then I guess so. This soap is ROUGH. Hope that helps some people. Probably good for hand soap to get stubborn tattoos off or something, but daily bathing with it is out for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that I use.  I use this soap for everything.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for my face and gritty / strong enough to cut through engine grease.  The smell is nice and fairly neutral, my wife loves it.  My only complaint is that I go through it a bit too quickly, but that&#x27;s what you get with a good natural soap.  ***Update 10/12/15*** Welp, looks like they changed the recipe.  I know that other people complained about this Men&#x27;s Soap being a bit too rough for their skin, but that is kind of the point.  The old soap had a good leather/wood smell, it also took grease right off.  The new soap smells like rotten tropical fruit and hippy stank.  Good to know that I bought the value pack so that I can throw five bars away at once. Thanks Maple Hill Naturals, you lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Great soap for guys who like to smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t leave a disgusting film in your shower.</li>
            <li> Way to rough and does not smell well either nothing like soap I have ever used before</li>
            <li> Good lather, nice fragrance.  My only complaint is that it is a bit rough, but I suppose that is part of what makes it manly soap :)</li>
            <li> Great product backed by great sellers.  I had a concern about a product that I bought and the owners not only rectified it, they added in the men&#x27;s shampoo bar as a sample.  The shampoo bar is not only great for your hair, but I have dry skin on my legs and arms (I know, too much info) and it really does a great job on those.  Can&#x27;t say enough about the integrity of this company.  I will definitely buy from them again.  &amp;#34;Honest&amp;#34; is a very appropriate name!!</li>
            <li> A good natural soap. I&#x27;m dissapointed with how quickly you go through a bar. The grit in the soap can leave the shower messy also.</li>
            <li> its ok but too perfumed.  I wanted something with less. .</li>
            <li> Very good for my dry skin.  It cleans very well, however, it does not last very long and uses up very quickly.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;great seller, completely satisfied&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is good. I think bathing should be a penitent process, and you will lose a few layers of skin each time you shower with this. Best advice I can give is to keep the bar dry between showers, because it gets a little soggy. Fragrance is light and good for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is great for what you get.</li>
            <li> Returning it today...Says its natural but has a strong synthetic cologne smell...Its overwhelming. To bad cause the soap it self feels nice...but it has that drug store cologne scent.</li>
            <li> It smells like pine tar soap from SASQUACH CO. Very pleasant smell. The name however. WTF.</li>
            <li> Very gritty soap, not disposed for comfort in the shower.</li>
            <li> Gets me clean, has a pleasant scent - not too strong. Doesnt dry out my skin, which is a problem I have sometimes with soap.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works for me. Definite improvement in my skin condition. I like the product.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Haven&#x27;t noticed any real scent to speak of. Shouldn&#x27;t offend anyone&#x27;s senses. Have used it as a body wash and as a shampoo. Rinses clean and leaves your skin feeling good. What more could you want.</li>
