            <li>I decided to give the Apricot Whip moisturizer a try after really loving the Eminence Sweet Red Rose moisturizer, but not wanting to pay the extra $20 for it.</li>

            <li> In the winter it eliminates that dry, tight feeling and in our hot humid summers, it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy and feels as if it&#x27;s helping in retaining moisture and not in a greasy way.</li>

            <li> Packaging was a mess.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier</li>
            <li> I use it day &amp; night, along with a few serums.  </li>
            <li> I received a small sample of hydrating gel with the product.</li>
            <li> If it seems to thick for you, they even suggest adding a bit of water, and provide a small tool to mix.</li>
            <li> It is thick (which I like)</li>
            <li> Not too ridiculously pricey</li>

            <li> Fabulous stuff. Like a dream. It&#x27;s 2 oz and you don&#x27;t need a lot because it spreads easily. You determine how much moisture you need. You can add water to make it lighter. It is great under makeup. Acts somewhat like a primer. Very moisturizing but not greasy. Great for morning and night. It&#x27;s also organic! Yay!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It is thick (which I like) but you can emulsify it with water if you like your moisturizer a little more light weight. I have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts! It is all organic and and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I decided to give the Apricot Whip moisturizer a try after really loving the Eminence Sweet Red Rose moisturizer, but not wanting to pay the extra $20 for it. I have dry and sensitive skin and this cream works really great.  There&#x27;s no irritation, and it smells delicious!  I ordered my cream on a wednesday, and got it by the friday, so it came much sooner than I expected.  I received a small sample of hydrating gel with the product. Recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> The case was not sealed and the content smelled funny.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Light on my skin!</li>
            <li> Perfect condition very happy</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, it only takes a small amount, it smells great and feels good, non-greasy and it&#x27;s all organic.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. It has a nice smell without being overpowering and hydrates my dry skin very well. I usually switch back and forth between this one and Eminence&#x27;s Coconut moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works great! A little thicker than my last cream, so I suspect to go through it a little quicker, but less than half the price as my last cream, so it&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> I love the Eminence products!  So nice not to have all those questionable ingredients in their products!  This moisturizer feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I try different moisturizers and keep coming back to this. Nothing compares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft skin, mild fragrance (all natural).</li>
            <li> Another one of eminences great products.</li>
            <li> Pretty thick for eminence. It was okay but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Packaging was a mess.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and texture.  My skin needs a bit more moisture than it provides but it would be great for younger skin.  I&#x27;ll stick to the sour cherry cream in the future.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for more than 2 years after she discovered it at the Ritz Carlton spa and she loved it! It is good for both summer and winter. The spa no longer carried it so she was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer smells so good.  It&#x27;s a little heavier so I would recommend using as a night cream.  It softens skin and gives skin a great appearance.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but every time I buy it from Amazon, the seal is loose. Not sure why as it seems to be fine when I purchase locally.</li>
            <li> I started getting facials and an aesthetician used Eminence products on my face. I fell in love. It&#x27;s pricey, but so worth it. You only get one face and skin, right? Treat it :) This moisturizer has a very light pleasant smell, is not heavy, and a little bit goes a long way. My last order was in October of 2011, so it has lasted me 9 months, plus I still have a little left. If it seems to thick for you, they even suggest adding a bit of water, and provide a small tool to mix. I&#x27;m really funny when it comes to products on my face -- I don&#x27;t like feeling like something is caked on, or really even feeling it, and this moisturizer has been perfect. It keeps my face moisturized through all seasons. In the winter it eliminates that dry, tight feeling and in our hot humid summers, it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy and feels as if it&#x27;s helping in retaining moisture and not in a greasy way. I have combination skin and I definitely recommend Eminence.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has used Eminence products for years and raves about them. I was looking for a good, &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; (no chemicals) moisturizer and she suggested I try one of the Eminence products. I found the apricot whip on Amazon and because of the ingredients listed and the impressive website of Eminence itself, I ordered this. It arrived in the original packaging but with no seal. I removed the lid and one smell told me it had  imitation apricot chemical perfume in it. My friend who uses these products had described their scent as natural, smelling like the flowers and herbs they are made from, a subtle fragrance. This did not match up with my experience at all. Then she mentioned that she had heard that imitation Eminence products were being sold on Amazon, that someone was using the containers and packaging of Eminence and filling them with their own inferior product and selling them at a slight discount. That is the only explanation I have heard that makes sense to me.</li>
            <li> Eminence products are excellent.  Not too ridiculously pricey and they do what they promise.  This is a lovely light moisturizer.  I use it day &amp; night, along with a few serums.  I look great!  (considering that I am older then old)</li>
            <li> I started with a small sample size and really enjoyed the texture and scent - not overwhelming. I also read in reviews from others that the moisturizer can be mixed with a little bit of water and that has made a huge difference. I will get more uses out of each jar and the product is lighter on my skin. I just love natural products :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keen on organic products so always interested in trialling new products.  This product feels fresh on your skin, not greasy or oily and smells like tangy fruit.  Very refreshing and tends to soak in and lay under the top layer of your skin so you feel fresh and moist but not wet to touch.  Would definitely recommend a try.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free, moisturizing, can be diluted with water in your palm, or by using wet fingertips to apply, or use more for a heavier cream.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer shows its effects immediately. Long lasting, a little goes a long way. I live at 7500 ft in the Rockies and it is a great fit for my skin, which doesn&#x27;t have other skin trouble besides dryness.</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night as well as Eminence Coconut Milk Cleanser.  This stuff makes my skin feel amazing.  It is pricey but is well worth the money that you pay.  It is a thick moisturizer as well so a little goes a long way and the 2oz. size will last a very long time.</li>
