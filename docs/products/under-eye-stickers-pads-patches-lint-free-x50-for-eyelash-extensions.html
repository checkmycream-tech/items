            <li>These are nice to use while doing eyelash extensions they work good</li>
            <li>My clients love these!</li>
            <li>These work well and are a good size for most of my clients&#x27; eyes.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>It is better to get the patches that contains anti-wrinkle collagen too.</li>
            <li>My clients love them.</li>
            <li>Better than the tape though.</li>
            <li>but anyway using it :)</li>
            <li>this is one of those products that i believe i will find more uses for as time goes by.</li>
            <li>they did fit the purpose of protecting bottom lashes from top lashes.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, and much better than the collagen pads.</li>
            <li>These work great for clients that sensitive to tape or patches.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to have found pads that were cheap, etc.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>They fit well and are easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>These pads stay in place,don&#x27;t move and are comfortable.</li>
            <li>I also use them over collegen eye pads if they arent lint free.</li>
            <li>so it is softer and more gentle as you remove and without pulling out lashes!</li>
            <li>Only one of my lash artist is okay with using this.</li>
            <li>they are way too sticky, more so than paper medical tape.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>This was great at first because it stayed put and was thin and smaller then most undereye gel pads.  </li>
            <li>I really like reasonable price and the way this product works.</li>
            <li>They are also very shiny so have a reflective glare when looking at it</li>
            <li>With these under eye stickers that feeling is not there so much anymore although these to not &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The foils are very sticky.</li>
            <li>I have reveived it on time and it has a nice quality when using but a little different than I thought it would be</li>
            <li>They have some serious stick to them though, so I have to to kind of &amp;#34;destickify&amp;#34; them before I put them on a client or they will pull quite a bit coming off.</li>
            <li>Especially for people that have strong and long bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>These worked very well, not too sticky but sticky enough and they are soft so they conform to your face well.</li>
            <li>These patches cover the lashes but damage the sensitive skin under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I was more than disappointed with how sticky and cheaply made they are!</li>

            <li> These serve their purpose but they are a little smaller than the avg eye size</li>
            <li> so it makes it hard to see the natural eyelash.</li>
            <li> I usually take some of the stickiness away by applying it to the back of my alcohol wiped hand.</li>
            <li> they do the trick to keep mascara off of my cheeks when i am putting it on and they are just the sort of product that will find other uses in time.</li>
            <li> so we have to use 2 for each eye flipped upside down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my lash technician because she was using a form of tape to hold down the lower lashes when applying the extensions.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s way too sticky, if they can make these that have less adhesive</li>
            <li> I would just recommend to use a little cream under eye before applying it because it contains a lot of adhesive</li>
            <li> Use these everyday.</li>
            <li> Bought for lash extensions way too harsh, they hurt the client when taking off, I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> are very very sticky and very hard to remove as well as uncomfortable on my clients&#x27; skin.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> A little hard fabric, no irrational under eyes...</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that when you go to remove them after your done lashing, it is very uncomfortable for the client as it hurts them and pulls out quit a few lashes.</li>
            <li> They lift off the skin and are not good to use on your clientele.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these gel pads did not work out for my clients.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Then glue from these stuck do bad to the bottom eyes lashes.  </li>
            <li> They are the worst things ever.</li>

            <li> Use these everyday. They are great.</li>
            <li> I really like reasonable price and the way this product works. I do eyelash extensions a lot and this pads cover the lower lashes well. I would just recommend to use a little cream under eye before applying it because it contains a lot of adhesive and you can accidentally pull on lower lashes while removing it.</li>
            <li> Great for applying lash extentions. Especially for people that have strong and long bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I love these. I use daily for eyelash extension clients!</li>
            <li> These are nice to use while doing eyelash extensions they work good and they don&#x27;t hurt my clients when pulling them off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and they work well for bottom lashes. I am still in practice mode and they will work for that.</li>
            <li> A little hard fabric, no irrational under eyes... Stays in place!</li>
            <li> These patches cover the lashes but damage the sensitive skin under the eyes. It is better to get the patches that contains anti-wrinkle collagen too.</li>

            <li> These are PERFECT for eyelash extensions!  My clients love them. They are comfortable, and much better than the collagen pads. The collagen pads slide and change position while doing lashes. These pads stay in place,don&#x27;t move and are comfortable. My clients love these!</li>
            <li> These work great for clients that sensitive to tape or patches.</li>

            <li> they are way too sticky, more so than paper medical tape. i would never use these on my clients eyes for eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> They are the worst things ever. Then glue from these stuck do bad to the bottom eyes lashes.  It&#x27;s was a nightmare</li>
            <li> These work well and are a good size for most of my clients&#x27; eyes. They have some serious stick to them though, so I have to to kind of &amp;#34;destickify&amp;#34; them before I put them on a client or they will pull quite a bit coming off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my lash technician because she was using a form of tape to hold down the lower lashes when applying the extensions.  When the tape was removed I thought my skin was coming off with it.  With these under eye stickers that feeling is not there so much anymore although these to not &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; great when they are removed either.  Better than the tape though.</li>
            <li> Thank u I have reveived it on time and it has a nice quality when using but a little different than I thought it would be but anyway using it :)</li>
            <li> The foils are very sticky. I usually take some of the stickiness away by applying it to the back of my alcohol wiped hand. They fit well and are easy to adjust. I also use them over collegen eye pads if they arent lint free. Its easier than paper tape.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER THESES PADS. I was very excited to have found pads that were cheap, etc. I was more than disappointed with how sticky and cheaply made they are! They lift off the skin and are not good to use on your clientele. I will be returning these!</li>
            <li> I gave it this rating because I like the way outfits under the eye and how it is not irritable</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality!</li>
            <li> this is one of those products that i believe i will find more uses for as time goes by. they do the trick to keep mascara off of my cheeks when i am putting it on and they are just the sort of product that will find other uses in time. thanks!</li>
