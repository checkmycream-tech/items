            <li>I ordered the metallic hair chalk for my daughter and received the bright colors in the metallic packaging.</li>
            <li>However it worked great on my own hair.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loved this product.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work good on darker hair</li>
            <li>I also loved the fact that it didn&#x27;t get on my clothes are anything I sat on.</li>
            <li>Awesome product adds a fun flair to hair.  </li>

            <li>The end result looked ok</li>
            <li>think these pens would work better if you were not going to style your hair but either braid it or put in in a bun.</li>
            <li>My daughter decided to add metallic streaks to her hair after dressing up for a dance and was pleased that she didn&#x27;t wind up with any chalk dust on her hands or formal dress.</li>
            <li>Was ok flaked onto skin</li>
            <li>I was this is the real deal!!!!</li>

            <li>Easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best temporary hair coloring I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a think clay-like feel, but feels light in my hair.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun!</li>
            <li>Pretty cool- for temporary fun.</li>
            <li>we had so much fun.</li>
            <li>The colors are easy to apply and they last, yet wash out easily.</li>
            <li>Superior to all the other hair chalk etc.</li>
            <li>We have used the bright colors and not all of them work well on dark hair.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old loves it, and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Its a good product however it rubs off of everything and makes a mess</li>
            <li>very high quality!</li>
            <li>My daughter has golden brown hair and they just blend in without much color at all.</li>
            <li>The purple went on nicely and showed up pretty well but faded quickly and was hard to see after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well on synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the colors don&#x27;t show up very well at all.</li>
            <li>However, I found the dye made my hair very sticky and clump together.</li>
            <li>color doesn&#x27;t show up well unless I virtually use the whole chalk...</li>
            <li>Blending colors helped to create more vibrant colors for my dark locks</li>
            <li>The green looks more dark turquoise but went on the hair quite smoothly.</li>
            <li>using the flat on it wasn&#x27;t useful at all</li>
            <li>messy on hands, but does wash easily.</li>
            <li>The hair pens look like and have the consistency of a large cream eyeshadow stick that you twist up as the product gets low.</li>
            <li>I purchased these originally to highlight a black wig with the silver and purple colors.</li>
            <li>The red showed up a bit better, but came out with little chunks of the chalk in the hair.</li>
            <li>i buy it for my 5 years old dougter for your B&#x27;day, her hair is broun and these metallic glitter</li>
            <li>I decided to try these pens cause they seemed super easy and way less messy.</li>
            <li>the company was great but the product was bad.</li>
            <li>It did not dry.</li>

            <li> Hands down the best temporary hair coloring I&#x27;ve ever tried. I just got it today and tried it out on both blonde and dark hair in my family. It went on great on both and washed out easily in both. It&#x27;s got a think clay-like feel, but feels light in my hair. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Great colors. Easy to wash out. I purchased these originally to highlight a black wig with the silver and purple colors. It didn&#x27;t work very well on synthetic hair. However it worked great on my own hair. So easy to use. Just hold the hair and swipe the crayons down the strands. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Maybe okay with lighter hair, but darker hair? Just doesn&#x27;t seem to stick.</li>
            <li> so much better then the dry chalk. The dry chalk kept  getting into my eyes as it would come of I had to spray it to keep it from doing it. I like this so much better and it last until you wash it out.</li>
            <li> Awesome product adds a fun flair to hair.  Goes on easy for a nice pop of color</li>
            <li> Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product &amp; seller.  Five Stars!!!!! A+++++!</li>
            <li> Pretty cool- for temporary fun. messy on hands, but does wash easily.</li>
            <li> the colour is very nice but my hair was very dry and i couldn&#x27;t even move my hands through it. using the flat on it wasn&#x27;t useful at all and it looked very bad after. the colour came out at the pillow when i slept and all over my clothes. i was wearing white ones and i had the blue colour on my hair and the shirt turned blue and when ever i touch my hair my hands turn blue as well.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved this product. we had so much fun. even the kids used them with thier halloween costumes. Awesome product would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Superior to all the other hair chalk etc. products that you can purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised by all the great reviews. I have to say that the colors don&#x27;t show up very well at all. My daughter has golden brown hair and they just blend in without much color at all. Not even that metallic looking.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible product. It did not dry. It got all over my hands when I touched my hair after 2 hours. Also After One Shampoo It Was gone. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Its a good product however it rubs off of everything and makes a mess</li>
            <li> disappointing.  save your money</li>
            <li> I usually dye my hair using hair chalk. I wet my hair to get a more intense color but find the process a bit messy and tedious. I decided to try these pens cause they seemed super easy and way less messy. The hair pens look like and have the consistency of a large cream eyeshadow stick that you twist up as the product gets low. I used the pink and purple pens to create an ombre effect on my blonde hair. I applied the color to dry hair. The colors were very bright and the pens made the application very easy. However, I found the dye made my hair very sticky and clump together. My hair was very hard to brush or style. I tried using a curling iron to see if setting the dye with a little heat would help, but the hair remained sticky. The end result looked ok but I could not brush or run my fingers through my hair at all. I usually use temporary dye when I wear my hair down and considering how sticky my hair felt I would not use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these pens would work better if you were not going to style your hair but either braid it or put in in a bun.</li>
            <li> Good product but did not show up in my daughters dark hair.</li>
            <li> I have blue black hair...color doesn&#x27;t show up well unless I virtually use the whole chalk...it&#x27;s the shimmer from the metallic that comes through slightly.  Blending colors helped to create more vibrant colors for my dark locks</li>
            <li> I bought this hair chalk for my teenager and was surprised at how well it shows up, even in dark hair. The colors are easy to apply and they last, yet wash out easily. My daughter decided to add metallic streaks to her hair after dressing up for a dance and was pleased that she didn&#x27;t wind up with any chalk dust on her hands or formal dress.</li>
            <li> Loved the product great packaging worked perfectly tried em all this one is hands down the best one out don&#x27;t be scared by other companies false claims like I was this is the real deal!!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastica product.  Works exactly as advertised!!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t show up in your hair. the company was great but the product was bad.</li>
            <li> It seems hard to apply on my hair.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work good on darker hair</li>
            <li> Was ok flaked onto skin</li>
            <li> Got it for daughter. She has dirty-blonde hair and she has to put a lot in to see the colors.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this stuff!!!!! It went on the hair extremely well and washed out with one wash!!! I also loved the fact that it didn&#x27;t get on my clothes are anything I sat on. LOVE THIS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am torn on what review to leave here. I ordered the metallic hair chalk for my daughter and received the bright colors in the metallic packaging. Amazon refunded my money and told us to keep the product we received. We have used the bright colors and not all of them work well on dark hair. The green looks more dark turquoise but went on the hair quite smoothly. The red showed up a bit better, but came out with little chunks of the chalk in the hair. The purple went on nicely and showed up pretty well but faded quickly and was hard to see after an hour or so. They wash out and off the skin very easily (that is a plus to me, though I can see that being a negative to some).</li>
            <li> Not too messy. Easy to use. Shows up well. Lots of fun!</li>
            <li> very high quality! i buy it for my 5 years old dougter for your B&#x27;day, her hair is broun and these metallic glitter are very cool &#x3D;) love it!!!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old loves it, and it washes out easily. Perfect.</li>
            <li> not easy to apply, does not show much on dark hair.  leaves hair messy, sticky and stiff.</li>
