            <li> This is an adorable head cap. I have mid length hair and petitie head and this covers well but not any excess room and it is not lined. Perhaps my error in reading desription. For anyone not needing lining this is great. For super long hair or larger heads I would keep looking. It is super cute. It&#x27;s great as a cap for my to use at night or to use when washing face, facial and so on…….</li>

My ignorance!!</li>

            <li> Cute.  Works for what it was designed for.  Little small for larger amounts of hair.</li>
