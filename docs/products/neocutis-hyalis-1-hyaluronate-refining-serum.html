            <li>I am quite pleased with this product.  </li>

            <li>love this brand.....expensive but, worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I also had their peel done in medical spa, which I loved.  </li>
            <li>Was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I have some other products with hyaluronate content, but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as you would expect going on but after a few days use I notice a great difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>This soaks right in within a minute of applying.  </li>
            <li>It really adds moisture to the skin!  </li>
            <li>Hyalis was suggested to me by my aesthetician; I love the entire Neocutis line, but you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price compared to the doctors&#x27; office price.</li>
            <li>Instead of fixing the problem and sending me the item I wanted in the first place, they gave me a refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried Neocutis product line for the first time a year ago.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found this product on Amazon, because it cannot be found in the retail stores and medical spas almost never have it on sale.  </li>
            <li>I sincerely hope this gets back to the manufacturer .  </li>
            <li>I realize the bottles get lighter as you use but visual is always better.</li>
            <li>You have no idea when you need to reorder as you can&#x27;t see how much you have used.  </li>
            <li>The new packaging for the Hyalis, Biocream and Journee is very ineffecient.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I did run out for awhile and tried another product but went right back to this.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t counteract any of the other facial products I&#x27;m using, so I feel confident in using it so often.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen such a difference in my skin since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot live without it!!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and supple since I&#x27;ve started to use this product.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates my skin and makes it feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>Unable to get product pumped out of bottle in upright position.&lt;br /&gt;Unable to tell if product is good or not</li>
            <li>I apply it gently without rubbing, pushing, pulling or tugging but gently spreading it on each side of my face, chin and forehead as well as a little on my neckline.</li>
            <li>The price was also very reasonable compared to the other vendors.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with some of their other products</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I use this product day and night.  A tiny droplet will spread over my entire face and neck.  It doesn&#x27;t counteract any of the other facial products I&#x27;m using, so I feel confident in using it so often.  Since I started using it 3 weeks ago my face is noticeably softer and moister.  I have some other products with hyaluronate content, but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen such a difference in my skin since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot live without it!!</li>
            <li> I love this Neocutis product. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with some of their other products but this one is good. It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as you would expect going on but after a few days use I notice a great difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and supple since I&#x27;ve started to use this product.  The price was also very reasonable compared to the other vendors.</li>
            <li> I had severely dehydrated skin and this was recommended by an Esthetician. Started to use it and could feel/see a difference in a few days. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist is the best,and he recommended this to me.  It really adds moisture to the skin!  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for light moisturizing and plumping. Hyalis was suggested to me by my aesthetician; I love the entire Neocutis line, but you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price compared to the doctors&#x27; office price.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use face serum that hydrates skin without feeling greasy. Use twice daily and can be used alone or under your sunscreen. I am 64 with almost no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love the neocutis products!  My face feels nice and smooth after using this product.  Only things is a hate the new packaging and have called the company and complained.  Every morning I am chasing my cap on the floor bouncing around.  I also feel the new packaging is a waste of plastic in the environment.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is addictive.  It is light and hydrating without being oily or greasy.  I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> i think i love this product so far..it seems to be doing all that is promised...ordered one more so I can give it the five stars.</li>
            <li> I placed 3 orders for this product because each time Amazon sent me an item it was the wrong product.  They kept sending me Neocutis Eye Balm instead of the Refining Serum.  The third time I returned the product I told them their inventory label and packaging did not match.  Instead of fixing the problem and sending me the item I wanted in the first place, they gave me a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neocutis Refining Serum is outstanding.  I highly recommend it. I did not mark down this review because my frustration is with Amazon, not the product.  I just hope Amazon fixes the problem soon, so I can order more of the product I need.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  It hydrates my skin and makes it feel so soft.  I did run out for awhile and tried another product but went right back to this.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this product.  My skin feels replenished and deeply moisturized after each application, morn and night.  I apply it gently without rubbing, pushing, pulling or tugging but gently spreading it on each side of my face, chin and forehead as well as a little on my neckline.</li>
            <li> Great rich moisturizer. Goes on light, under makeup and keeps my skin feeling great all day. A wonderful winter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Was delivered quickly. Definitely can see a change in my skin. Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have tried Neocutis product line for the first time a year ago.  I also had their peel done in medical spa, which I loved.  This product is very light and I like to use it for daytime skin care prior to applying daytime moisturizer and sun protection.  Only a small drop is needed to cover face and neck.  I am glad I found this product on Amazon, because it cannot be found in the retail stores and medical spas almost never have it on sale.  Product uses stem cells that help skin regeneration and collagen production.</li>
            <li> The inside bottle had leaked some, you can see liquid between the two liners.</li>
            <li> This product gives my skin a boost of moisture that lasts all day. It seems to make my skin look healthy and smooth. I use it twice a day - morning (under my makeup) and at night before I go to bed. I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> I use this on my neck only.  My neck is firmer and hydrated.  This soaks right in within a minute of applying.  Most serums don&#x27;t absorb well, but this one does.</li>
            <li> I cant recommend this product highly enough!! NEOCUTIS is the best beauty regime I have ever used!! Buy it and use it!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin all the time even in humid weather and this item truly helps to overcome that.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how it does in the winter season.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice.  I used it in addition to a daily and nightly moisturizer.  It costs more than I need and I can just use the OTC CereVe or Cetaphyl moisturizer.  But this is DEFINATELY a great line of products.  I&#x27;ve used this along with their product Journee (SPF moisturizer) and their eye cream.  I noticed changes with my skin - nice ones.  I was recommended them from my dermatologist otherwise I would never have purchased this.  This is not a wasteful purchase and it lasts quite some time - if you use it once a day it could last a couple months.</li>
            <li> this and the skin cleanser they make is effective.  that says a lot for an industry that puts out a lot of useless, but expensive, products</li>
            <li> This is a great product for roscea.</li>
            <li> The new packaging for the Hyalis, Biocream and Journee is very ineffecient.  I sincerely hope this gets back to the manufacturer .  You have no idea when you need to reorder as you can&#x27;t see how much you have used.  It is bigger bottles and not good for travel. Whoever came up with this idea should have checked with consumers.  I realize the bottles get lighter as you use but visual is always better.</li>
            <li> Unable to get product pumped out of bottle in upright position.&lt;br /&gt;Unable to tell if product is good or not</li>
            <li> love this brand.....expensive but, worth it.  great product.</li>
            <li> This serum smoothes the skin and gives it a nice texture.</li>
            <li> This product is the best for attracting &amp; retaining moisture.  I have very dry skin and it still feels moist hours later.  I use it morning and evening.</li>
