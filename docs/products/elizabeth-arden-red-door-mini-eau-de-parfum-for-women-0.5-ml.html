            <li>Delicious.  </li>
            <li>She was happy with the gift.</li>
            <li>Packaged GREAT, smells great.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling Parfum for women.</li>
            <li>Also great for travel and carrying in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Unforgettable.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this scent.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the packaging and love the fragrance!</li>
            <li>A bit stronger than what I like but nice for a change up.</li>
            <li>Love that it is perfume.</li>
            <li>This was my mom&#x27;s favorite scent, however the product is not as pictured as it does not have the &amp;#34;Red Door&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we were able to laugh it off.</li>
            <li>This little bottle is perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>There are a number of sets available out and about, but I don&#x27;t need this AND a huge bottle of spray cologne.  </li>
            <li>Because I prefer perfume to cologne, I was very pleased to find a seller on Amazon, and it was reasonably priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes, but the bottle was unbelievably tiny and the topper doesn&#x27;t screw on, it just pops in, so I can&#x27;t use in my purse which is what I wanted it for.  </li>
            <li>Hole in top with red plug in it.</li>
            <li>I always love this perfume,  could not afford the big bottle...</li>
            <li>Finally came and love it</li>
            <li>Love Red Door.  </li>
            <li>Better off buying larger size really.  </li>
            <li>I also have the large bottle.</li>
            <li>Looks like the real deal.</li>
            <li>But THIS does not, which leads me to believe that its not the real deal.</li>
            <li>Smells nothing like the real perfume.</li>
            <li>Absolutely  enticing.  </li>
            <li>This is the only perfume I wear because for the last 40 years I have received  compliments on how nice it smells.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this concentrated Red Door many times in the past because I love that it stays with you, for hours.</li>
            <li>Love the size of this little bottle of perfume.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite perfume for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>This is tiny, but just the right size for my luggage.</li>
            <li>Love it and the small size fits in my purse for on the go.</li>
            <li>It only usually comes as a gift or addition to buying larger bottles, so loved that I could buy it separately at Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>It arrived a day early.  </li>
            <li>Also love that I can put just a few drops on and don&#x27;t have to use a larger amount  of spray.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance though, but I am not sure it was worth  </li>
            <li>It is rich and robust - a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>However, the fragrance seems long lasting and I only use one dab to apply for the whole day.  </li>

            <li> After a long day if I smell the inside of my wrist there is still a subtle scent that is very pleasing when I rub my two wrists together.</li>
            <li> I know this isn&#x27;t expensive but don&#x27;t waste yours unless you want to be fragrance free an hour after putting this in.</li>
            <li> the price for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> But not exactly, and within an hour you can literally not even tell you ever had it on.</li>
            <li> but the seller wrote and said how she shipped it and that it is from the bigger collection broken down...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find this size sold individually.  </li>
            <li> I knew the bottle was small</li>
            <li> but I did not think it was that small.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely small.</li>
            <li> Well from the person I gave to as a gift didn&#x27;t seem to appreciate how small the perfume was</li>
            <li> I could not find a roll on type of travel size and have had to substitute this small size, instead.  </li>
            <li> I was so embarrassed when I was told how small it was ,I had, no ideal</li>
            <li> The paint was rubbed off the bottles and looked very bad to give as a present</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my wife&#x27;s birthday while I was out of town.  It arrived a day early.  She was happy with the gift.</li>
            <li> Love that it is perfume.</li>
            <li> I knew the bottle was small but I did not think it was that small.  I really like the fragrance though, but I am not sure it was worth  the price for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> Packaged GREAT, smells great.  This is a perfect size to sample.</li>
            <li> A bit stronger than what I like but nice for a change up.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes, but the bottle was unbelievably tiny and the topper doesn&#x27;t screw on, it just pops in, so I can&#x27;t use in my purse which is what I wanted it for.  Better off buying larger size really.  I get complements all the time when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Great smelling Parfum for women.</li>
            <li> It is extremely small.</li>
            <li> This was my mom&#x27;s favorite scent, however the product is not as pictured as it does not have the &amp;#34;Red Door&amp;#34; arch lid.</li>
            <li> Umm...No. Just no. Looks like the real deal. Smells similar to it too. But not exactly, and within an hour you can literally not even tell you ever had it on. I have bought this concentrated Red Door many times in the past because I love that it stays with you, for hours. But THIS does not, which leads me to believe that its not the real deal. The bottle is not what is pictured either, its actually a red glass door. I know this isn&#x27;t expensive but don&#x27;t waste yours unless you want to be fragrance free an hour after putting this in.</li>
            <li> Hole in top with red plug in it. Smells nothing like the real perfume. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well from the person I gave to as a gift didn&#x27;t seem to appreciate how small the perfume was I was so embarrassed when I was told how small it was ,I had, no ideal it was that the perfume was so so small.but I&#x27;m glad we were able to laugh it off.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume for a few years now.  It&#x27;s very hard to find this size sold individually.  (The Elizabeth Arden website doesn&#x27;t even sell it individually!)  There are a number of sets available out and about, but I don&#x27;t need this AND a huge bottle of spray cologne.  Because I prefer perfume to cologne, I was very pleased to find a seller on Amazon, and it was reasonably priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> it says parfum replica&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why ?</li>
            <li> Love the size of this little bottle of perfume.  It only usually comes as a gift or addition to buying larger bottles, so loved that I could buy it separately at Amazon.com.  Also great for travel and carrying in my purse.  Also love that I can put just a few drops on and don&#x27;t have to use a larger amount  of spray.</li>
            <li> I always love this perfume,  could not afford the big bottle...but the seller wrote and said how she shipped it and that it is from the bigger collection broken down...find with me, but i like what she wrote,  i will write a review on the seller when i get the actual package!</li>
            <li> Finally came and love it</li>
            <li> Mysterious and haunting.  Absolutely  enticing.  Delicious.  Unforgettable.</li>
            <li> The paint was rubbed off the bottles and looked very bad to give as a present</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent. It is rich and robust - a little goes a long ways. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the packaging and love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> this is my signature perfume.......Love it and the small size fits in my purse for on the go. I also have the large bottle.</li>
            <li> Love Red Door.  This is tiny, but just the right size for my luggage.</li>
            <li> lid would not stay on. lost all perfume</li>
            <li> This little bottle is perfect for travel.  I could not find a roll on type of travel size and have had to substitute this small size, instead.  However, the fragrance seems long lasting and I only use one dab to apply for the whole day.
