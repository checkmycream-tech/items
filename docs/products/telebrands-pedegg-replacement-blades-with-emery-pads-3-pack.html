            <li>This product is good.</li>
            <li>Ok... I am BLOWN AWAY at how good this works!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I did not try it with the ballon &#x3D;) , but it works great to remove calisus on your feet.</li>
            <li>I love this thing!  </li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING for my feet for YEARS, and the ped egg made my feet perfect within 10 minutes on the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This thing works great and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>Great for maintaining smooth feet between, or instead of, pedicures.</li>
            <li>I liked this product because I could file my feet while watching TV without leaving skin dust all over the living room carpet</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain because sometimes I need to hold it sideways.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product, it works great even though some shavings do escape it is easy to live with.</li>
            <li>This is totally worth the money!!!  </li>
            <li>Good product and an excellent deal with all the extra blades and the foot</li>
            <li>Honestly, my feet have not felt this smooth in years!</li>
            <li>I own the pedegg and I&#x27;m glad I found these replacements.</li>
            <li>I am so glad for this product, so I can feel confident doing my own pedicures without the hasse of scrubbing my feet.</li>
            <li>So I was pretty happy about that.</li>
            <li>The lotion included is ok but there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>Maybe the Ped Egg folks should supply more.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always one to get a good laugh at \\&quot;As</li>
            <li>Seen On TV\\&quot; products and think for the most part they are a scam.  </li>
            <li>My heels are looking so much better</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li>The foot repair cream was ok, but I like something that smells more minty or fruity.</li>
            <li>Better yet, I do not end up with sore feet from all the scrubbing.</li>
            <li>It leaves your feet feeling really nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>One more suggestion.</li>
            <li>And the foot cream is just heaven&#x27;s magic in a tube.</li>
            <li>I have another product that works much better.  </li>
            <li>all in all, i love it. :]</li>
            <li>Because you must hold the ped egg in the palm of your hand, you need to be able to maneuver your hand all around the soles of your feet, and this gets tricky depending on how you&#x27;re seated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I often got more than I wanted and got sore on my feet from it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is very useful!</li>
            <li>Use some lotion afterwards for a super nice feel.  </li>
            <li>Best result is to remove dry skin gradually with moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, and is perfect if you get rough heels.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like is how easy the product fits into the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  </li>
            <li>The order also arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>My feet were thoroughly callused but this has turned them very soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Well, I liked it so much that I kept it!</li>
            <li>I know I will enjoy my feet even more than what I do right now!</li>
            <li>the rasp is lightweight, easy to use, easy to clean and keeps my soles baby-soft.</li>
            <li>the razors wear out kind of quickly though, so its a good thing to buy the extra 3.</li>
            <li>I am warning you guys, do not buy this product if you have perfect little feet, and just tell yourself you have problematic feet, just to relate.</li>
            <li>it does leave your feet smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products to try to smooth the bottom of my feet, and I&#x27;m finding that nothing works as well for me as the OPI foot file that you see in salons.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t fit together well, seems like a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li>So now I can continue to enjoy my pedegg.</li>
            <li>I really dont remember buying this but for the most part I was glad I did</li>
            <li>I have used it very little, but I believe that it will have excellent results.</li>
            <li>I am SOOOOOO excited.</li>
            <li>This item is what I expected it works great.</li>
            <li>Mostly my fault because I don&#x27;t use lotion as much as I should.</li>
            <li>It works surprisingly well, and it collects all the tiny shaving - well, almost all.</li>
            <li>I threw away a grocery bag full of gadgets, files, stones, cremes, lotions.</li>
            <li>and we both laughed when we opened the box to find three Chinese replica Pedeggs.</li>
            <li>One use of the Pedegg and I once again have soft, smooth, adorable tootsies.  </li>
            <li>The blades and emery/file disk....dull quickly.</li>
            <li>Once I get good at doing my own pedicure; no more pedi visits to the asians for me!</li>
            <li>and it improved each foot like 60% on the first try!</li>
            <li>The shavings are like a powder so using a towel under your feet while you work is easy enough to keep anything that escapes the egg easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>This little gadget is great.  </li>
            <li>A few times I have over-done it and experienced a tender spot on my heel--hence the cautionary note in my title.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Revlon brand with amazing results and after several months and have not noticed any blade dulling.</li>
            <li>I have been making fun of this product for ages.  </li>
            <li>Very user friendly too...</li>
            <li>How many were surprised with all \\&quot;the powder\\&quot; in the egg after the first use?</li>
            <li>Works very well at quickly removing callouses from the bottom of your foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and gentle to use, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and you are ready for sandals!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I was blown away.</li>
            <li>I think once a month is more than enough but</li>
            <li>I only give this four stars because if you&#x27;re not holding the PedEgg so that the blade is perfectly on top, then some shavings will fall out.</li>
            <li>it seems as though the blades need changed pretty often though.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised and has really changed my life!</li>
            <li>but I still found it more productive to use after showering/bathing (and drying) while the skin is a little more soft.</li>
            <li>I really like it esp in the summer when feet have to look pretty.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to smooth my heels and this actually did the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>This little gizmo is amazing.</li>
            <li>The design is great but the grater that doesn&#x27;t pop a balloon also doesn&#x27;t break through truly tough</li>
            <li>I do really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This thing really works.</li>
            <li>This really didnt smell at all.</li>
            <li>My wife talked me into getting a pedicure with her on our honeymoon and they didn&#x27;t scuff off nearly as much as I can do myself with this thing.  </li>
            <li>real</li>
            <li>After using the product once I could really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Be gentle.</li>
            <li>use it too much too often&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I just really wanted the ped egg because it would catch the shavings</li>
            <li>this product works better than i expected it to, and i found it cheaper here than</li>
            <li>This item really works.</li>
            <li>It is gentle against the skin.</li>
            <li>I was really dissappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much when the result is achieved.</li>
            <li>As this leaves rough feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It worked better than any pumice stone or other foot shaver I have tried before.</li>
            <li>I laughed when I first heard about this product; it seemed like a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine how tough all the other reviewers&#x27; callouses really are compared with my own if they supposedly had such great results.</li>
            <li>You have to use it religiously, but not a bad deal for price and it does what it says.</li>
            <li>careful, you can overdo it, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out when you are going too far.  </li>
            <li>Go slow and do a little bit at a time and you will be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>and I have new feet!</li>
            <li>The emery stick on really helps to smooth out the rough edges after shaving.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because the wand style provides more leverage, which makes this chore less taxing on your hands and forearms.</li>
            <li>This is my reason for only 4 stars--the sandpaper strip wears out quickly.  </li>
            <li>The best most disgusting thing invented.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You do need to make sure you use it on absolutely dry skin, and use the emory paper they give you with the kit (that really gives the final finish).  </li>
            <li>We spent the summer by the pool, so feet have a tendency to get dry, in the evening after a shower, this little thing is perfect to smooth any rough edges.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how fast and how well this works.</li>
            <li>this thing really works as far as keeping my feet soft</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews here before going out and purchasing the Pedegg for my own crusty feet believing the previous reviewers were honest and really had great results on their tough feet, but this product disappointed me.</li>
            <li>get so carried away and excited while using the blades scratching filing and removing all dead skin all at once because it will leave your foot very tender and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First time users be careful not to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li>used Ped Egg few times and it seems fine</li>
            <li>However, this product does not leave your feet as smooth and seems to leave a little bit of an irritated feeling for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I find that it is easier to use an old towel underneath my feet when I am using the Ped Egg, so that the towel gets the shavings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been so happy to be so wrong about a product!  </li>
            <li>and I put a small towel under my feet and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to shave too much to where you get to the sensitive skin underneath.</li>
            <li>I bought this and now my feet stay soft and no dry skin flaking off and</li>
            <li>In addition, the blades that I received were not sharp.  </li>
            <li>I had previously been using a different kind of file that was akward to hold and messy.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s made them soft, much prettier, and I am looking forward to the first winter in a LONG LONG time where I don&#x27;t have dry, cracked, sore heels!!!</li>
            <li>I have NO rough skin on my heels now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, creams, all sorts of stuff, and nothing could make a real dent in the rough skin around the heel and on the side of the toe.  </li>
            <li>Pedicures get expensive when trying to maintain nice feet so after reading all the reviews and seeing all the commercials I figured I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>First, the Ped Egg that I received was Black and the extra blades were white.  </li>
            <li>This little Pedegg really works.</li>
            <li>The little sand paper strip is a must to smooth skin after the heavy duty removal work is over.  </li>
            <li>far as the smoothing part goes, the blades are sharp enough to remove the dry skin, and then you need to follow-up with the smoothing surface to give your feet a soft finish.</li>

            <li> This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  </li>
            <li> The order also arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> My feet were thoroughly callused but this has turned them very soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Well, I liked it so much that I kept it!</li>
            <li> I know I will enjoy my feet even more than what I do right now!</li>
            <li> the rasp is lightweight, easy to use, easy to clean and keeps my soles baby-soft.</li>
            <li> the razors wear out kind of quickly though, so its a good thing to buy the extra 3.</li>
            <li> I am warning you guys, do not buy this product if you have perfect little feet, and just tell yourself you have problematic feet, just to relate.</li>
            <li> it does leave your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products to try to smooth the bottom of my feet, and I&#x27;m finding that nothing works as well for me as the OPI foot file that you see in salons.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t fit together well, seems like a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li> So now I can continue to enjoy my pedegg.</li>
            <li> I really dont remember buying this but for the most part I was glad I did</li>
            <li> I have used it very little, but I believe that it will have excellent results.</li>
            <li> I am SOOOOOO excited.</li>
            <li> This item is what I expected it works great.</li>
            <li> Mostly my fault because I don&#x27;t use lotion as much as I should.</li>
            <li> It works surprisingly well, and it collects all the tiny shaving - well, almost all.</li>
            <li> I threw away a grocery bag full of gadgets, files, stones, cremes, lotions.</li>
            <li> and we both laughed when we opened the box to find three Chinese replica Pedeggs.</li>
            <li> One use of the Pedegg and I once again have soft, smooth, adorable tootsies.  </li>
            <li> The blades and emery/file disk....dull quickly.</li>
            <li> Once I get good at doing my own pedicure; no more pedi visits to the asians for me!</li>
            <li> and it improved each foot like 60% on the first try!</li>
            <li> The shavings are like a powder so using a towel under your feet while you work is easy enough to keep anything that escapes the egg easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is great.  </li>
            <li> A few times I have over-done it and experienced a tender spot on my heel--hence the cautionary note in my title.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Revlon brand with amazing results and after several months and have not noticed any blade dulling.</li>
            <li> I have been making fun of this product for ages.  </li>
            <li> Very user friendly too...</li>
            <li> How many were surprised with all \\&quot;the powder\\&quot; in the egg after the first use?</li>
            <li> Works very well at quickly removing callouses from the bottom of your foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and gentle to use, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and you are ready for sandals!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I was blown away.</li>
            <li> I think once a month is more than enough but</li>
            <li> I only give this four stars because if you&#x27;re not holding the PedEgg so that the blade is perfectly on top, then some shavings will fall out.</li>
            <li> it seems as though the blades need changed pretty often though.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised and has really changed my life!</li>
            <li> but I still found it more productive to use after showering/bathing (and drying) while the skin is a little more soft.</li>
            <li> I really like it esp in the summer when feet have to look pretty.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to smooth my heels and this actually did the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> This little gizmo is amazing.</li>
            <li> The design is great but the grater that doesn&#x27;t pop a balloon also doesn&#x27;t break through truly tough</li>
            <li> I do really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This thing really works.</li>
            <li> This really didnt smell at all.</li>
            <li> My wife talked me into getting a pedicure with her on our honeymoon and they didn&#x27;t scuff off nearly as much as I can do myself with this thing.  </li>
            <li> real</li>
            <li> After using the product once I could really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Be gentle.</li>
            <li> use it too much too often&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I just really wanted the ped egg because it would catch the shavings</li>
            <li> this product works better than i expected it to, and i found it cheaper here than</li>
            <li> This item really works.</li>
            <li> It is gentle against the skin.</li>
            <li> I was really dissappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much when the result is achieved.</li>
            <li> As this leaves rough feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It worked better than any pumice stone or other foot shaver I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I laughed when I first heard about this product; it seemed like a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine how tough all the other reviewers&#x27; callouses really are compared with my own if they supposedly had such great results.</li>
            <li> You have to use it religiously, but not a bad deal for price and it does what it says.</li>
            <li> careful, you can overdo it, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out when you are going too far.  </li>
            <li> Go slow and do a little bit at a time and you will be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> and I have new feet!</li>
            <li> The emery stick on really helps to smooth out the rough edges after shaving.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because the wand style provides more leverage, which makes this chore less taxing on your hands and forearms.</li>
            <li> This is my reason for only 4 stars--the sandpaper strip wears out quickly.  </li>
            <li> The best most disgusting thing invented.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You do need to make sure you use it on absolutely dry skin, and use the emory paper they give you with the kit (that really gives the final finish).  </li>
            <li> We spent the summer by the pool, so feet have a tendency to get dry, in the evening after a shower, this little thing is perfect to smooth any rough edges.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how fast and how well this works.</li>
            <li> this thing really works as far as keeping my feet soft</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here before going out and purchasing the Pedegg for my own crusty feet believing the previous reviewers were honest and really had great results on their tough feet, but this product disappointed me.</li>
            <li> get so carried away and excited while using the blades scratching filing and removing all dead skin all at once because it will leave your foot very tender and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First time users be careful not to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li> used Ped Egg few times and it seems fine</li>
            <li> However, this product does not leave your feet as smooth and seems to leave a little bit of an irritated feeling for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I find that it is easier to use an old towel underneath my feet when I am using the Ped Egg, so that the towel gets the shavings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been so happy to be so wrong about a product!  </li>
            <li> and I put a small towel under my feet and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to shave too much to where you get to the sensitive skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I bought this and now my feet stay soft and no dry skin flaking off and</li>
            <li> In addition, the blades that I received were not sharp.  </li>
            <li> I had previously been using a different kind of file that was akward to hold and messy.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s made them soft, much prettier, and I am looking forward to the first winter in a LONG LONG time where I don&#x27;t have dry, cracked, sore heels!!!</li>
            <li> I have NO rough skin on my heels now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, creams, all sorts of stuff, and nothing could make a real dent in the rough skin around the heel and on the side of the toe.  </li>
            <li> Pedicures get expensive when trying to maintain nice feet so after reading all the reviews and seeing all the commercials I figured I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> First, the Ped Egg that I received was Black and the extra blades were white.  </li>
            <li> This little Pedegg really works.</li>
            <li> The little sand paper strip is a must to smooth skin after the heavy duty removal work is over.  </li>
            <li> far as the smoothing part goes, the blades are sharp enough to remove the dry skin, and then you need to follow-up with the smoothing surface to give your feet a soft finish.</li>
            <li> or you can leave your feet a little tender if you get into live skin.</li>
            <li> You have to do this regularly though, or it just goes back to the rough skin again.</li>
            <li> The previous product I was using had the wholes to remove the dead skin but the surface of it was textured similar to a metal nail file and left a very smoth surface.</li>
            <li> The first time I got it, I used it for about 5 minutes, and I just couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dead skin the little egg captured.  </li>
            <li> and I found the shape made it easier to hold and to work with than my long foot file.</li>
            <li> I have been getting ready for Spring by purchasing some really cute open back shoes and while trying them on I realized my heels were looking HORRIBLE!!  </li>
            <li> The product works but as the title says I only gave 4of5 due to the delay in shipping.  </li>
            <li> The package says to use on dry feet</li>
            <li> It is intended for use on dry feet.  </li>
            <li> I was sceptical, but after using it on my dry, callused heels, I am a convert.</li>
            <li> i have really dry feet and had a lot of skin I had to peel off.</li>
            <li> no more sores from getting good skin with the bad.</li>
            <li> Even though the blades look sharp, they are sharp enough to do their work but not to nick and slice your feet.</li>
            <li> Unfortuantely, this causes my heels to get very dry, calused and crack.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry cracked heels</li>
            <li> I think it may be due the blade design which was rather flat and not protruded enough to collect the dead skin.</li>
            <li> so my feet would be so gross without this little thing.</li>
            <li> This really did get the tough layers off.  </li>
            <li> Yes its manual labor, but not much.</li>
            <li> I spent two hours trying to get the egg to even make a dent in my callouses</li>
            <li> Do not rub the Pedegg roughly on your feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands on pedicures.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get too agressive with it</li>
            <li> Not a real Ped Egg.  </li>
            <li> im currently in the military &amp; deployed in iraq where we get no days off &amp; wear boots to work everyday</li>
            <li> This is the first item i have every come across that has allowed me to easily and painlessly remove very thick and painful calluses from my feet.</li>
            <li> I have tried amny other products to help with my feet.</li>
            <li> Like I have said I have tried a lot of other products, foot files, or scrapers.</li>
            <li> These arrived as sharp as ever.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pedegg yesterday and was truly shocked at the amount of dry, dead skin it removed, easily and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed that a cheaper product that I had gotten did a better job than the pedegg.</li>
            <li> I recommend keeping extra blades on hand because they get dull.  </li>
            <li> The calluses were getting so thick on my heels that I was starting to lose sensitivity to touch.</li>
            <li> For years I would sand my feet down with an emery board.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product in an attempt to rid my feet of rough skin!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was really disgusted with the \\&quot;shavings\\&quot;, but they are contained well, easy to empty and the gross factor lasted about two seconds, got rid of them, cleaned out the container and went on my way.  </li>
            <li> I made quite a mess on the floor.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as it is faster and less messy.</li>
            <li> I noticed all the reviews here are a little dated</li>
            <li> Since you&#x27;re the one doing it you can take off as much or as little as you want.  </li>
            <li> They were tearing little holes in the bed sheets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suffering from serious dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Emptying is gross to see all the dean skin but my smooth feet like the nasty dryness gone.</li>
            <li> Yes some flecks of dead skin fell out but who the HECK cares?  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am over zealous, but I find I need to do it over a trash can as not all the filings get trapped in the egg.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5/5, but it can get messy with all the shavings that you end up with after you use the product on your heels.</li>
            <li> While it did remove callous and dead skin on my feet, the egg did not collect them in the storage compartment as advertised.</li>
            <li> I dont have a major dry foot problem but a few times a year they can get bad and this products works as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting tired of other products that didn&#x27;t work, or paying for a pedicure and still feeling rough heels.</li>
            <li> I also wear heels or flip flops mostly, so I am not easy on my tootsies.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does what it claims to do - and how!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if the product has changed some</li>
            <li> It is not sharp so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until my feet are restored to normal, and I can have confidence that my feet won&#x27;t look so bad at the pool or in sandals.</li>
            <li> You have to do a little bit of exercise with your arms if you have a very hard skin</li>
            <li> I had replacements from another vendor that I will not do business with anymore because their blades arrived dull and they would not replace them.  </li>
            <li> In all, it will do, at least to stretch time out between pedicures.</li>
            <li> you have serious calluses you will become bored with this product</li>
            <li> The worst I&#x27;ve had is that a small part of my foot was a little tender for a day or two.</li>
            <li> I find the emory strip to be rather useless.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical of this (or any) self use product.</li>
            <li> This product was specifically made for problem areas of the feet, and will disturbingly annoy the heck out of your feet if you don&#x27;t have any.</li>
            <li> These reviews have to be fake no way</li>
            <li> My heels have very tough skin (comes from almost never wearing shoes - inside and out.)  </li>
            <li> This makes those long nail file lookings smoothers look like CRAP!  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Fake!</li>
            <li> My feet were so bad</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of foot products on my heals which get so bad</li>
            <li> It wasnt bad though</li>
            <li> This softened my painful calluses on the balls of my feet.</li>
            <li> This winter has been brutal on my skin, from my hands to my feet</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m not ashamed to say it, but man was I wrong!!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. For years I would sand my feet down with an emery board. It never quite did it. This softened my painful calluses on the balls of my feet. Now it doesn&#x27;t hurt when I&#x27;m on my feet all day.</li>
            <li> This product is great for guys,  after 3 or 4 times of use my feet have been regenerated 15 years.  I haven&#x27;t had a need to use it again yet :D</li>
            <li> I am a soldier in the Army so my feet spend a lot of time in boots. Pedicures get expensive when trying to maintain nice feet so after reading all the reviews and seeing all the commercials I figured I would give this a try. I noticed all the reviews here are a little dated so I&#x27;m not sure if the product has changed some but I feel that the blades are not THAT great. It does take some time and work to see progress. The shavings are like a powder so using a towel under your feet while you work is easy enough to keep anything that escapes the egg easy to clean up. The package says to use on dry feet but I still found it more productive to use after showering/bathing (and drying) while the skin is a little more soft. The lotion included is ok but there are better products out there. I find the emory strip to be rather useless. In all, it will do, at least to stretch time out between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Ok... I am BLOWN AWAY at how good this works!  This makes those long nail file lookings smoothers look like CRAP!  My feet were so bad, I was thinking of actualy going to a foot doctor.  I heard good things about this (we sell them where I work and they were always out of stock) so I thought for $10 what the heck.  After using this one time, I saw I had SKIN on my feet!  I was beginning to think all I had was callouses!  It is truly amazing.  Yes some flecks of dead skin fell out but who the HECK cares?  If you are that grossed out about it - do it over a garbage can!!  All I can say is WOW WOW WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I do really like this product.  It is intended for use on dry feet.  I use it before getting in the shower.  Maybe I am over zealous, but I find I need to do it over a trash can as not all the filings get trapped in the egg.  A few times I have over-done it and experienced a tender spot on my heel--hence the cautionary note in my title.  The little sand paper strip is a must to smooth skin after the heavy duty removal work is over.  This is my reason for only 4 stars--the sandpaper strip wears out quickly.  Maybe the Ped Egg folks should supply more.  Not a reason to pass on this product.  Great for maintaining smooth feet between, or instead of, pedicures.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  I go barefoot the majority of the time.  Unfortuantely, this causes my heels to get very dry, calused and crack.  One use of the Pedegg and I once again have soft, smooth, adorable tootsies.  Very user friendly too...the Pedegg, not my tootsies.</li>
            <li> Actually works. Beats using sand paper...</li>
            <li> I have been making fun of this product for ages.  I&#x27;m always one to get a good laugh at \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; products and think for the most part they are a scam.  Well I&#x27;m not ashamed to say it, but man was I wrong!!!  This winter has been brutal on my skin, from my hands to my feet I&#x27;m suffering from serious dry skin.  I have been getting ready for Spring by purchasing some really cute open back shoes and while trying them on I realized my heels were looking HORRIBLE!!  While doing a search online for a remedy I kept coming across the Ped Egg and thought, alright, why not!  I&#x27;m so happy I bought it.  My heels are looking so much better and I&#x27;ve only used the Ped Egg twice!  I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was really disgusted with the \\&quot;shavings\\&quot;, but they are contained well, easy to empty and the gross factor lasted about two seconds, got rid of them, cleaned out the container and went on my way.  I have never been so happy to be so wrong about a product!  Really works!</li>
            <li> The best most disgusting thing invented. I love this thing!  Emptying is gross to see all the dean skin but my smooth feet like the nasty dryness gone. Afterward moisturize feet. Baby oil works well. The lotion that came with it is nothing to rave about. The ped egg rocks!</li>
            <li> Works very well at quickly removing callouses from the bottom of your foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does. I have tried everything to smooth my heels and this actually did the first time I used it.  I highly recommend it.  I bought mine for $9.99 at Target...Just FYI.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product, it works great even though some shavings do escape it is easy to live with. My feet were thoroughly callused but this has turned them very soft and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This item is what I expected it works great. However the foot repair lotion is only a trial size.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of foot products on my heals which get so bad sometimes that they crack and hurt.  I bought the Pedegg yesterday and was truly shocked at the amount of dry, dead skin it removed, easily and painlessly.  This is totally worth the money!!!  My feet look better than they have in years!!</li>
            <li> This product is very useful! I&#x27;d never had softer skin without spending a lot in podiatrist or pedicure. You have to do a little bit of exercise with your arms if you have a very hard skin but you&#x27;ll love the results. The final touch is given by the file included and your feet gonna thank you that.&lt;br /&gt;With this seller, 3 replacement blades and a Miracle foot repair are included, and that cream is perfect for ultra-smoothing feet after the treatment with the Ped Egg.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this seller and all these products!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and is perfect if you get rough heels. For me, it&#x27;s made them soft, much prettier, and I am looking forward to the first winter in a LONG LONG time where I don&#x27;t have dry, cracked, sore heels!!! I am SOOOOOO excited. I love this product!!!!! ;)</li>
            <li> Not met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Yes its manual labor, but not much. This thing really works. I have very dry cracked heels and I was skeptical of this (or any) self use product. I was surprised how fast and how well this works. If you tilt your foot or the PedEgg, of course some of the sandy shavings will fall to the floor. It wasnt bad though and I put a small towel under my feet and it worked fine. I recommend buffing afterwards, but put some foot cream on and you are ready for sandals! Really great inexpensive product. Go ahead and get the package with replacements because you will be hooked! The foot repair cream was ok, but I like something that smells more minty or fruity. This really didnt smell at all. Otherwise, great deal!</li>
            <li> The Ped Egg actually worked?  I was sceptical, but after using it on my dry, callused heels, I am a convert. I am even getting my family members as gifts. I would give it 5/5, but it can get messy with all the shavings that you end up with after you use the product on your heels. I find that it is easier to use an old towel underneath my feet when I am using the Ped Egg, so that the towel gets the shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting tired of other products that didn&#x27;t work, or paying for a pedicure and still feeling rough heels. With this product, I can do my heels while I watch TV and the job gets done. Better yet, I do not end up with sore feet from all the scrubbing. Even though the blades look sharp, they are sharp enough to do their work but not to nick and slice your feet. Another thing I like is how easy the product fits into the palm of my hand. It is a comfortablle hold and makes the job easier. I am so glad for this product, so I can feel confident doing my own pedicures without the hasse of scrubbing my feet.</li>
            <li> While it did remove callous and dead skin on my feet, the egg did not collect them in the storage compartment as advertised. I think it may be due the blade design which was rather flat and not protruded enough to collect the dead skin. I made quite a mess on the floor.</li>
            <li> This thing works great and is really easy to use.  My wife talked me into getting a pedicure with her on our honeymoon and they didn&#x27;t scuff off nearly as much as I can do myself with this thing.  Since you&#x27;re the one doing it you can take off as much or as little as you want.  It leaves your feet feeling really nice and smooth.  Use some lotion afterwards for a super nice feel.  Use it with the grate facing up to catch all the shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, you can overdo it, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out when you are going too far.  The worst I&#x27;ve had is that a small part of my foot was a little tender for a day or two.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because I could file my feet while watching TV without leaving skin dust all over the living room carpet and I found the shape made it easier to hold and to work with than my long foot file.</li>
            <li> This is a fantasic product. I have tried amny other products to help with my feet. This has been the only one to truly work. I did not try it with the ballon &#x3D;) , but it works great to remove calisus on your feet. One more suggestion. Like I have said I have tried a lot of other products, foot files, or scrapers. Go slow and do a little bit at a time and you will be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The blades and emery/file disk....dull quickly. While this is safer than the \\&quot;blade\\&quot; shaver callous removers...its still not effective.&lt;br /&gt;If you have serious calluses you will become bored with this product real soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion- A Rasp file (grater-style) callus remover along *WITH* a foam Miracle Stone (callus stone) work best.</li>
            <li> I have constants dry/cracked heels. Mostly my fault because I don&#x27;t use lotion as much as I should. I also wear heels or flip flops mostly, so I am not easy on my tootsies. After using the product once I could really tell the difference. It worked better than any pumice stone or other foot shaver I have tried before. The emery stick on really helps to smooth out the rough edges after shaving. You have to do this regularly though, or it just goes back to the rough skin again. I think incorporating this with a foot bath and good moisturizing routine would work miracles!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here before going out and purchasing the Pedegg for my own crusty feet believing the previous reviewers were honest and really had great results on their tough feet, but this product disappointed me. I spent two hours trying to get the egg to even make a dent in my callouses but it didn&#x27;t even scrape the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine how tough all the other reviewers&#x27; callouses really are compared with my own if they supposedly had such great results. The design is great but the grater that doesn&#x27;t pop a balloon also doesn&#x27;t break through truly tough skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a Diamoncel Callous Rasp #20 which did the trick-- the rasp is lightweight, easy to use, easy to clean and keeps my soles baby-soft.</li>
            <li> This product works so wonderfully! I only had one problem area, per foot, and this just took care of it! Once I get good at doing my own pedicure; no more pedi visits to the asians for me! I am warning you guys, do not buy this product if you have perfect little feet, and just tell yourself you have problematic feet, just to relate. This product was specifically made for problem areas of the feet, and will disturbingly annoy the heck out of your feet if you don&#x27;t have any. And the foot cream is just heaven&#x27;s magic in a tube. I can&#x27;t wait to try the emery pads. I know I will enjoy my feet even more than what I do right now! My only concern was the paper that guided me in putting it together. It requested that I remove plastic film from the blades, that weren&#x27;t present; which made me question the packaging. That is why I gave four stars, instead of five. But besides that, this baby is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> How many were surprised with all \\&quot;the powder\\&quot; in the egg after the first use? LOL This little gizmo is amazing. I have bought as gifts for friends.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product in an attempt to rid my feet of rough skin!! I saw an ad on TV for the Pedegg and decided to give it a try. The first time I used this product I was blown away. I have NO rough skin on my heels now. I add one word of caution- Do not rub the Pedegg roughly on your feet.Be gentle. Also do not rub for a prolonged period of time. Your feet will be sore if you do. Love, love, love this product!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is good. I had previously been using a different kind of file that was akward to hold and messy. However, this product does not leave your feet as smooth and seems to leave a little bit of an irritated feeling for a couple of days. The previous product I was using had the wholes to remove the dead skin but the surface of it was textured similar to a metal nail file and left a very smoth surface. I will continue to use this product as it is faster and less messy.</li>
            <li> Good product and an excellent deal with all the extra blades and the foot cream.&lt;br /&gt;I used Ped Egg few times and it seems fine but my advice is:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use it too much too often&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get so carried away and excited while using the blades scratching filing and removing all dead skin all at once because it will leave your foot very tender and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I also do not recommend to use it too regular .. I think once a month is more than enough but provided you apply foot cream daily.</li>
            <li> this thing really works as far as keeping my feet soft I really dont remember buying this but for the most part I was glad I did</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Ped Egg products.  I have a job where I&#x27;m walking around most of the day, and I tried all sorts of things to decrease the obvious wear on the feet without much success.  This product has worked really well with making feet look nice really easily and safely.  My only warning is that I would recommend to use it over a towel or tub because not 100% of the filings get caught by the case.</li>
            <li> It works but not as well as I hoped it would.  I have another product that works much better.  I just really wanted the ped egg because it would catch the shavings and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about cutting myself. It worked but I was a little disappointed that a cheaper product that I had gotten did a better job than the pedegg.</li>
            <li> My heels have very tough skin (comes from almost never wearing shoes - inside and out.)  This really did get the tough layers off.  Just be careful not to shave too much to where you get to the sensitive skin underneath.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does what it claims to do - and how!  My feet were in horrendous shape from wearing sandals all the time.  I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, creams, all sorts of stuff, and nothing could make a real dent in the rough skin around the heel and on the side of the toe.  The first time I got it, I used it for about 5 minutes, and I just couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dead skin the little egg captured.  You do need to make sure you use it on absolutely dry skin, and use the emory paper they give you with the kit (that really gives the final finish).  Use any good foot cream and you&#x27;re good to go!  Honestly, my feet have not felt this smooth in years!</li>
            <li> This little gadget is great.  Especially during the summer.  We spent the summer by the pool, so feet have a tendency to get dry, in the evening after a shower, this little thing is perfect to smooth any rough edges.  It is not sharp so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> You have to use it religiously, but not a bad deal for price and it does what it says.</li>
            <li> helpful helpful helpful. im currently in the military &amp; deployed in iraq where we get no days off &amp; wear boots to work everyday so my feet would be so gross without this little thing. the razors wear out kind of quickly though, so its a good thing to buy the extra 3. all in all, i love it. :]</li>
            <li> This little Pedegg really works. Best result is to remove dry skin gradually with moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> i like this product and i would recommend. it does leave your feet smooth. i still get my pedicures because it doesn&#x27;t paint my toes or massage my feet and legs, but it serves the purpose it was made for.</li>
            <li> I laughed when I first heard about this product; it seemed like a total waste of money. I went out and bought one for my mom, but thought I would give it a try before giving her one. Well, I liked it so much that I kept it! It works surprisingly well, and it collects all the tiny shaving - well, almost all. I only give this four stars because if you&#x27;re not holding the PedEgg so that the blade is perfectly on top, then some shavings will fall out. Kind of a pain because sometimes I need to hold it sideways. Still, it&#x27;s a really great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my feet were in horrendous condition. The calluses were getting so thick on my heels that I was starting to lose sensitivity to touch. So I ordered the ped egg from seller \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; and I received it in under 48 hrs even though I only got standard shipping. So I was pretty happy about that. I was also happy when I used the egg and it improved each foot like 60% on the first try! I can&#x27;t wait until my feet are restored to normal, and I can have confidence that my feet won&#x27;t look so bad at the pool or in sandals. I recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I used it once and couldn&#x27;t believe it! I threw away a grocery bag full of gadgets, files, stones, cremes, lotions. I&#x27;ve spent thousands on pedicures. My heels still looked like the back of a crocodile. They were tearing little holes in the bed sheets. Fifteen minutes with the Ped Egg and I have new feet! Yay! Sandals!</li>
            <li> I have used it very little, but I believe that it will have excellent results. Recommended 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tks &amp; Happy Holidays</li>
            <li> The product works but as the title says I only gave 4of5 due to the delay in shipping.  The product took 3 weeks longer to arrive than predicted.  Had the product been in stock and shipped on time--as indicated by Amazon--than I would have given them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> this product works better than i expected it to, and i found it cheaper here than the as seen on tv prices. it seems as though the blades need changed pretty often though.</li>
            <li> I bought a PedEgg and several boxes of replacement blades until I discovered Revlon made a version that didn&#x27;t require the constant purchase of replacement blades. After switching brands, I noticed the Revlon product yielded lasting results compared to those of the PedEgg. I have used the Revlon brand with amazing results and after several months and have not noticed any blade dulling. Skip the PedEgg and buy Revlon&#x27;s version if you want to see results and save money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products to try to smooth the bottom of my feet, and I&#x27;m finding that nothing works as well for me as the OPI foot file that you see in salons. I think it&#x27;s because the wand style provides more leverage, which makes this chore less taxing on your hands and forearms. Because you must hold the ped egg in the palm of your hand, you need to be able to maneuver your hand all around the soles of your feet, and this gets tricky depending on how you&#x27;re seated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smoothing part goes, the blades are sharp enough to remove the dry skin, and then you need to follow-up with the smoothing surface to give your feet a soft finish. It does what it says it does. I don&#x27;t regret trying it, but it&#x27;s not my go-to tool of choice for smoothing my feet.</li>
            <li> This is the first item i have every come across that has allowed me to easily and painlessly remove very thick and painful calluses from my feet. It works exactly as advertised and has really changed my life!</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING for my feet for YEARS, and the ped egg made my feet perfect within 10 minutes on the first time I used it. It&#x27;s easy and gentle to use, I highly recommend it. I can now wear flip flops shamelessly!!!</li>
            <li> I got this with a lot of doubt in my mind. i have really dry feet and had a lot of skin I had to peel off. I often got more than I wanted and got sore on my feet from it. I bought this and now my feet stay soft and no dry skin flaking off and no more sores from getting good skin with the bad. Just be careful not to get too agressive with it or you can leave your feet a little tender if you get into live skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this has been around for some time now I should of have one sooner&lt;br /&gt;it works great</li>
            <li> this was a total reject blades wont cut butter</li>
            <li> No brand name shown anywhere  on product or packaging and did not see same results as i did with brand name ped egg.</li>
            <li> This item really works. I really like it esp in the summer when feet have to look pretty. It is gentle against the skin. I have purchased it before, although not online.</li>
            <li> If this is what they advertise on TV, it doesn&#x27;t compare to the ped egg I bought before.  The &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t fit together well, seems like a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Father for Fathers day. I work on his feet and used this as soon as I got it. The results were great. I will never use anything else. As this leaves rough feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and worked well.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my wife&#x27;s feet she loves this product and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I dont have a major dry foot problem but a few times a year they can get bad and this products works as expected. I was happy that it did not tear my foot apart. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to manicure there feet.</li>
            <li> To give some context, I have never written a product review on Amazon.  I was really dissappointed with this purchase.  First, the Ped Egg that I received was Black and the extra blades were white.  This is not what is shown in the picture.  In addition, the blades that I received were not sharp.  I am going to throw it out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived before the invention of the Ped-Egg. It is like going to Paris and getting your personal foot peel, except you can do it at home on a regular basis without the cost of luxury.  I recommend keeping extra blades on hand because they get dull.  First time users be careful not to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does the job, making my feet softer than I have ever felt them. It does require some work (manual labor) but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much when the result is achieved. Great price, this order comes with three pedi eggs and some backup foot files. The order also arrived very quickly. I&#x27;m one happy customer.</li>
            <li> Fake! Not a real Ped Egg.  I bought this for my girlfriend and we both laughed when we opened the box to find three Chinese replica Pedeggs. You are not getting what is described in photo , we could not open and close the pieces because they were warped and the blades look so much bigger. These reviews have to be fake no way would anyone use these.</li>
            <li> I own the pedegg and I&#x27;m glad I found these replacements. I had replacements from another vendor that I will not do business with anymore because their blades arrived dull and they would not replace them.  These arrived as sharp as ever. So now I can continue to enjoy my pedegg.</li>
