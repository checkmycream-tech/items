            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is made with the best natural oils and herbs.</li>
            <li>Feels beautiful to apply and you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>And I swear my fine lines are disappearing!</li>
            <li>You could do better at WalMart or a drugstore.</li>
            <li>There were way too many unnatural chemicals in this product, my skin didn&#x27;t like it, and the sent was too &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfumy as well.</li>
            <li>Great for an intense moisture.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>AND LIKE-NOT SURE IT GIVES BETTER RESULTS</li>
            <li>I love this moisture night cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love this night</li>
            <li>I know while I sleep my skin is being nourished with a night cream adding more moisture which my skin soaks up.  </li>
            <li>I had first bought it at the mall and loved it, so when I found it online and for cheaper I jumped on the occasion.</li>
            <li>Very flattering to receive comments on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>good product, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and does not leave a greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>When I woke in the morning, my wrinkles were greatly pronounced and the tender skin around my eyes was extremely dry.</li>
            <li>I wish I had just stuck with Meaningful Beauty which has some special melon and is rich but not heavy like this one that takes a lot more to spread on your face</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It IS better than the day cream which does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly from seller.</li>
            <li>no awful fragrance and lasts for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>good for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;my girlfriend like it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not the same product I tried at the mall...</li>
            <li>It arrived before I expected, in perfect new condition with a far distant expiration date.</li>
            <li>Very nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much cheaper than this product</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy through amazon than in the shops.  </li>
            <li>my girlfriend like it very much&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;my girlfriend like it very much&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;my girlfriend like it very much&lt;</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Swimming in Dead Sea is great!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nice prices</li>
            <li>I tend to be allergic to lots of products, but not the first problem with these, I&#x27;ve used the cleanser, daily moisturizer and night cream!  </li>
            <li>For the money--Cliniques firming night cream is much better and about the same price or less</li>
            <li>Somethings always off- too greasy, not enought moisture, smell gets old, etc.</li>
            <li>When I wake in the morning my skin feels so soft</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My wife stopped using any other creams because of this featured natural product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way in making my skin feel soft  and supple.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really bought face cream twice from the same company.</li>
            <li> cream  Seems to do well with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I had already purchased the eye serum and creme which I&#x27;m not happy with either  as I&#x27;ve developed a couple of white heads under one eye</li>
            <li> I will try some of the other products by Seacret</li>
            <li> The night cream is slightly heavier than the day cream</li>
            <li> I believe that it may be a little too heavy to wear on the face.</li>
            <li> My hands dried out.</li>
            <li> Although this is a night cream, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> but when I use it by morning my skin is dry and tired looking</li>
            <li> When my face skin is dry it makes me feel dried out and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the miracle cream it claims to be but much less expensive than kiosks and home home sales party</li>

            <li> smells bad on my skin</li>

            <li> The best moisturizer ever! Worth the money. Once you use this product, you won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get this product everything we go to Israel every year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swimming in Dead Sea is great!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nice prices</li>
            <li> Israeli SEACRET eye cream.  I bought Seacret Regain age-defying eye cream. This cream is the worst I have ever  used. I put it around my eyes before I went to bed. When I woke in the morning, my wrinkles were greatly pronounced and the tender skin around my eyes was extremely dry. I tried this product  for about 4 days. It is horrible. When I tried it on my hands, I could not believe what happened. My hands dried out. Save your money. You could do better at WalMart or a drugstore.</li>
            <li> smells bad on my skin</li>
            <li> Also the night cream is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I had first bought it at the mall and loved it, so when I found it online and for cheaper I jumped on the occasion. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not the same product I tried at the mall... and it smells just like Nivea. Nothing against Nivea but it&#x27;s much cheaper than this product and I probably wouldn&#x27;t put it on my face.</li>
            <li> There were way too many unnatural chemicals in this product, my skin didn&#x27;t like it, and the sent was too &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfumy as well. I threw it out after trying it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the miracle cream it claims to be but much less expensive than kiosks and home home sales party</li>
            <li> Great for an intense moisture. I believe that it may be a little too heavy to wear on the face. Great shipping and price for product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve gotten this same product here in the states but it doesn&#x27;t have  the quality like the one I ordered from Israel.  I&#x27;m making my second order now.</li>
            <li> I love Seacret products!  And this is no exception.  A little goes a long way in making my skin feel soft  and supple.  Although this is a night cream, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  It absorbs well, leaving nothing to rinse off in the morning--no washing needed! It arrived before I expected, in perfect new condition with a far distant expiration date.</li>
            <li> IT WAS BOUGHT BY JUDY M. BOWERS-&#x3D;YES I BOUGHT IT AND LIKE-NOT SURE IT GIVES BETTER RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;AS LESS EXPENSIVE CREAMS-JB</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it! Helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles and keeps my skin moisturized. Arrived quickly from seller.</li>
            <li> I love this moisture night cream.  It goes on really smooth and does not leave a greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> My wife stopped using any other creams because of this featured natural product. She looks about 10 years younger after she started to use this cream. No hassle.</li>
            <li> I had already purchased the eye serum and creme which I&#x27;m not happy with either  as I&#x27;ve developed a couple of white heads under one eye but before this happened, I  decided to also get the night creme so I could see how they all work together.  I wish I had just stuck with Meaningful Beauty which has some special melon and is rich but not heavy like this one that takes a lot more to spread on your face and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is deeply moisturizing.  It seems like they just made a thicker version of their face creme.  Nothing special whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The night cream is slightly heavier than the day cream but when I use it by morning my skin is dry and tired looking so I don&#x27;t think it rates.  It IS better than the day cream which does absolutely nothing. For the money--Cliniques firming night cream is much better and about the same price or less</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cream that mosturizes.... minimizes wrinkles.... but isn&#x27;t greasy..... this is it!&lt;br /&gt;And... It is made with the best natural oils and herbs.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this line of products!  I tend to be allergic to lots of products, but not the first problem with these, I&#x27;ve used the cleanser, daily moisturizer and night cream!  Love them all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really bought face cream twice from the same company. Somethings always off- too greasy, not enought moisture, smell gets old, etc. I love this. And I swear my fine lines are disappearing!</li>
            <li> When this product is used with the Night Recover  It is amazing. The softness your face will have.  It gives it the moisture your face needs.</li>
            <li> I will put this cream on in the evening and leave it on all night while I sleep.  When I wake in the morning my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  Feels beautiful to apply and you don&#x27;t need much.  I&#x27;m on my second jar.  Much cheaper to buy through amazon than in the shops.  Very flattering to receive comments on how good my skin looks.  Sometimes use on my neck during the day.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend like it very much&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend like it very much&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend like it very much&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend like it very much.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this cream. She says it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever had and is already planning to buy more. Her mother is planning to have me order it for her as well</li>
            <li> I use this night cream in the morning as well.  I have normal to dry skin and it works wonderfully.  My skin feels so good afterward.</li>
            <li> good product, reasonably priced. good for normal to dry skin. no awful fragrance and lasts for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream  Seems to do well with dry skin.  I will try some of the other products by Seacret</li>
            <li> The night cream compliments the day cream.  I know while I sleep my skin is being nourished with a night cream adding more moisture which my skin soaks up.  When my face skin is dry it makes me feel dried out and uncomfortable.  So the night cream works just great on my face.</li>
