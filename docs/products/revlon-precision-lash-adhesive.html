            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to latex, so I&#x27;m happy to even find an adhesive I can use.</li>
            <li>(the rest of my makeup was smeared all over, lol)</li>
            <li>Great product as well.</li>
            <li>On - which worked out great.</li>

            <li>but I&#x27;m happy</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>works great</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The idea of the brush is very nice.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell, sticks very nicely.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this lash glue, works the best out of all that i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was great, on time, and a good experience.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li>Having good glue is the trick.</li>
            <li>and I have been using it for almost a year and its been really good to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really good with lashes, but this made even me struggle...</li>
            <li>and damn I look good.</li>
            <li>The Company delivered my item on time&lt;br /&gt;and loved it.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is good for people who have allergies.</li>
            <li>Good alternative to tube glue - a LOT easier to use.</li>
            <li>Best features of the glue is the brush-on applicator, glue stays all day, and application of my lashes takes seconds because the glue gets tacky quickly.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s not going to fall off of your eyes, and that&#x27;s absolutely great, but removal isn&#x27;t all about tearing out lashes and hurting yourself in the process.</li>
            <li>GOOD JOB, REALLY LIKED THIS Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive 0.17 fl oz  COMBO, ~ I NEEDED THE FULLNESS ~</li>

            <li>, I am going to buy like 5 more, just in case they discontinued it!</li>
            <li>I can BE CONFIDENT that they are not going to start peeling off on either side throughout the day!</li>

            <li>Very good product, just be sure to have a way to remove this adhesive after as it is quite strong.</li>
            <li>I do not have amazing eyelash application skillz.</li>
            <li>But gives amazing results.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes applying the perfect amount much easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the adhesive kind of a chicken,i&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li>Demi Lashes (Pack of 4)]], for instance) come with their own instructions on how to apply the lashes, some (Like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Well, Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive comes with its own instructions, and it matches any lashes you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li>so I cant say much but happy Wife happy life.</li>
            <li>Honestly I suck at applying lash adhesive glue to falsies but</li>
            <li>This can be rectified with warm water.</li>
            <li>Best adhessive ever super easy to use and hold lashes in place until you remove it</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to apply to the lashes.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Got here super quick and It works great!</li>
            <li>By far the best eye lash glue I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>By far the best eyelashe glue ever.</li>
            <li>This is the best eyelash glue out there by far.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>That worked great for one hour, when the lashes peeled right up.  </li>
            <li>it did not have a strong glue smell that makes my eyes water!</li>
            <li>This glue is very good for sensitive skin &amp; eyes!</li>
            <li>They come off easily if you just pull them off, but then you run the risk of accidentally tugging at your own lashes.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>Great adhesive, went on easy in just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this glue.</li>
            <li>Id buy this for sure again.  </li>
            <li>I actually slept in them &amp; woke up with them still perfectly glued in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different eyelash adhesives, and I love this one best.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t exist in most lash adhesive, and it&#x27;s a darn shame.</li>
            <li>Even though many eyelashes (Like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than Duo lash glue in terms of longevity.</li>
            <li>This is normally my favorite eyelash glue, the type i use all the time.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands, but always return to this one.</li>
            <li>Thank you. :)</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>The brush alows you more control when applying.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Well, I can not say enough about this adhesive, IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD!</li>
            <li>Well, love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li>This is just as flexible as traditional latex based adhesive, and has excellent hold</li>
            <li>Latex allergic lash weareres rejoice--there is this fantastic product around to solve your adhesive needs!</li>
            <li>I am trying to find one that is more sticky and a better adhesive</li>
            <li>Just be sure to let it get tacky for a couple seconds before applying to eyelids.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I have talked to the company and they worked with me to make sure I got the product.</li>
            <li>Glue also built up around the top and it just seemed like a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after the brush got worn out it just seemed like more of a hassle then help.  </li>
            <li>so CVS, Walgreens, or Walmart are much better options for purchase.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite,  </li>
            <li>But it is OKAY.</li>
            <li>I have used this  product  for 2 years now and it is in my opinion  much better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love love love this glue, it lasts more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li>She has tried almost every similar product on the market and for her this is the best she can find!</li>
            <li>It explains how to apply it in the best way possible, so your lashes would get that strong hold you wish</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t get over how great the glue application was while the brush was still new looking.  </li>
            <li>This one was easy to use and held the lashes on more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Love the easy application wand.</li>
            <li>Finally I saw a youtube video that alluded to latex free glue, so I found this one and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Amazing product absolutely great great clear adhesive for red cherry lashes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and see when it is ready and holds amazingly well.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this, this is the absolute best lash adhesive out there from what I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is the BRUSH.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t work any better than the glue that comes with cheap eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Completely disapointed!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this glue thinking that it would be great</li>
            <li>I see that&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is the best I have found for keeping lashes in place, which I wear every day.</li>
            <li>I use to struggle applying mine, but now I can easily just apply them.</li>
            <li>the skinny brush is easy to use and pliable.</li>
            <li>and it comes off fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>Revlon&#x27;s adhesive is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works easy and well.</li>
            <li>Cleanup is easy.</li>
            <li>Stays in place for days and attaches easily to eyelids</li>
            <li>Plus the brush applicator makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really easy to see.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t rip your eyelashes out and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have found this product to be really easy to use.</li>
            <li>The application brush is what makes it convenient and easy.  </li>
            <li>Removes easy with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li>Held up in the heat of summer easy to use</li>
            <li>the answer!&lt;br /&gt;-It has an easy application wand instead of a squeeze tube</li>
            <li>The glue is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>the less :D</li>
            <li>This Revlon brand is definitely my favorite to keep in my purse for when I need to quickly re-apply or when I travel.</li>
            <li>Great buy, easy to apply and will hold lashes until next day!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes, and this product is by far the BEST.</li>
            <li>Sticks the first time! :) A+++</li>
            <li>I will enjoy this adhesive</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the glue</li>
            <li>especially love the narrow brush applicator.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and stays on.</li>
            <li>but this glue was very helpful and amazing...</li>
            <li>Cheap glue</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great glue if you are just starting out with falsies, or even if you have been applying them for years.</li>
            <li>So this was a great idea but the execution wasn&#x27;t up to standard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy, has great hold and will last all day.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to order some lashes and lash glue just in time for the holidays.</li>
            <li>First and foremost I love this lash glue.</li>
            <li>You could also clean out the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great super long wear</li>
            <li>You will need special eye makeup remover pads to get this off, the type you use for waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t help with co-ordination and getting the things in the right place!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to gently clean the glue from your real lashes.</li>
            <li>The time frame for delivery was super quick and I recieved free shipping.</li>
            <li>The fine brush tip applies just the right amount of adhesive to the lash band.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to close it all the way when not in use, it starts drying out really fast.</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best, It makes it so easy to put the glue on your false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>That said, it peels off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It has a brush applicator, dries pretty quickly, AND is easy to wash off of pairs of eyelashes for re-use.</li>
            <li>I am super</li>
            <li>I said that, but it&#x27;s worthy to repeat that, ok?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a quick swipe.</li>
            <li>Also, quick swipe.</li>
            <li>It dries up quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied that my paranoia allowed me to discover this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried other lash adhesives and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>The brush makes it easy to apply and the glue really helps you have control.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and dries fast.</li>
            <li>and they are on the first time!</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun exploring lashes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I honestly think it last longer through out the day.</li>
            <li>It must be many years old for that to happen.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I wear the \\&quot;half\\&quot; lashes and I love how I can see it go onto the lash band, but it dries clear.</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite lash glue.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I got these for cosplaying only and to be honest</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly and most importantly - the adhesive doesn&#x27;t last through the day.</li>
            <li>its worth it</li>
            <li>The ease of application makes this product superior to other lash adhesives on the market.</li>
            <li>excellent-went underwater-lashes stayed on-far superior to ANY other lash adhesive-been wearing lashes for over 30 yrs</li>
            <li>(I just wash my face with my neutrogena cleanser that has makeup remover in it and they come right off without tugging).</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I use this it falls out right away.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m having issues finding the right adhesive too.</li>
            <li>My celebrity hair/make up girl swears by this one and she has free access to a lot of high end brands.</li>
            <li>Applying glue with the precision the fine brush gives allows you to reach a very natural look.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, takes longer to completely dry, easy to wash off you eyelids, not so easy to get of falselashes.</li>
            <li>Product as advertised, super fast delivery</li>
            <li>I currently use black, and although it works awesome, it&#x27;s a real pain in the rear to keep the stuff on the eyelashes and off of your eyelid, forehead, fingers, cheeks, nose...</li>
            <li>I work for a cosmetics company and am an avid falsies wearer, I started noticing that my eyes would get irritated with the lash glue I was using.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is after about a week or so of consistent every day use, the glue gets all over the top and comes out the side when you close it.</li>
            <li>thanks revlon!</li>
            <li>Like, really!</li>
            <li>I but this exact glue from this store in MArch of 2013 for around 5 dollars.</li>
            <li>I love this last glue.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s another problem entirely :)</li>
            <li>Okay so when you first put this on the lashes the color of the glue is a light blue color and as it dries it turns clear.</li>
            <li>unfortunately, only the dark color is available locally, so I was very happy to find it for him here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using lash glue for years and this is the first time it&#x27;s happened.</li>
            <li>I did not receive this exact version, which was what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I put the glue first along my lash line, then also along the eyelash - wait 20 or so seconds then apply.</li>
            <li>(.__-&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>it was first time</li>
            <li>I actually ordered two more tubes of this</li>
            <li>it was still on like when I put them on the first time</li>
            <li>wow! is super easy to use, because it comes with a brush, sticks very easily, not messy, and I tested it for 2 days</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to get a clear glue for my falsies.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this stuff and apprently so do many others as the few locations we can find nearby that sell it, sell out quickly!</li>
            <li>kind of looks like a greenish blue, but dries clear.</li>
            <li>With this product you put exactly how much glue you want exactly where you want.  </li>
            <li>It dries quick and clear and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect false eyelasses to be this easy, but with this glue and their lashes, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>The positive......</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is the thin brush, which makes precise application easy.</li>
            <li>I love it, lasts long and doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>My favorite lash glue, easy to apply and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li>I watched several youtube videos and the women on there recommend this, saying it was easy to use too.</li>
            <li>Comes with instructions which was great because this was my first time wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My eyes were watering all day and I had to keep checking a mirror to make sure my lashes had not come loose..</li>
            <li>The reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because I wish the glue was just a little bit stronger, but this is still a nice glue</li>
            <li>highly recommend it, just be sure to clean off the tube after each use, or it will gum up around the neck and make it hard to twist the top back on.</li>
            <li>Yes it is quite a bit more spendy than the little tubes, but you get what you pay for, and this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>This glue really sticks the lashes.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, packaged well.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li>I used this to glue jewels on my very oily skin and it stayed all night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute game-changer.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Lash off, and you&#x27;re ready for reuse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just have to wait and let the glue get really tacky before you put the lashes on, that should help them stay on all day.</li>
            <li>THANKS FROM TEXAS ~ BIANCA</li>
            <li>I tried it and it has real sticking power, all day.</li>
            <li>When you get ready to take your eyelashes off they come off with a gentle finger lifting.</li>
            <li>That was fast</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve fallen asleep in makeup and my lashes were still secure the next day even after sleeping in them) but is entirely latex free.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to find a glue that would hold throughout the day at work AND if ever wanted to go out, it would hold thicker lashes through dancing and drinks.</li>
            <li>Also, they both have an absolutely funky smell.</li>
            <li>But for whatever reason, may it be I was using cheap lashes, when I put the glue on them it turned blue.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>worked for the whole day.</li>
            <li>This gets very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lately it has not seemed to hold/stick quite as well as in the past, but it is still the best choice for quick touch ups or ease needed for travel.  </li>
            <li>That said, I was a little worried about peeling them off, but it was no problem at all--they came off super easy.</li>
            <li>Applies easily and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I used many other products and they all really were a joke to me.  </li>
            <li>This lash adhesive works better than any other product out there.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>I took the shower, on purpose I loffahed my face and eyes, with soap and water, finish the shower, went to dry my hair, and they are still there, strong.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and holds firmly.</li>
            <li>Best of all, I didn&#x27;t lose a single one of my own lashes, unlike when I tried Lashtite glue--lost a good half dozen lashes from trying to get the awful glue off my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Better than duo, keeps your edges down.</li>
            <li>It makes application so simple, so precise, so fast, no mess.</li>
            <li>I was in love with it when I bought it for awhile, but now I love Eylure&#x27;s eyelash adhesive in the small bottle!!!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend wears artificial lashes on stage frequently, and this is his preferred adhesive - it works best of any brand he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>It worked really well when I applied my lashes long lasting love it</li>
            <li>Glue was fine until it got to the stage where the glue was all around the outside of the bottle, where i could barely close it.</li>
            <li>To take them off, is so easy, is like the other adhesives.</li>
            <li>It stays beautifully, it&#x27;s not thick like the other glues, it&#x27;s transparent and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>The small brush makes application super easy and no mess.</li>
            <li>I was curious to wear some cheap falsies</li>
            <li>Fast drying and drys clear.</li>
            <li>Too much glue can leave a shiny finish even if it dries clear.</li>
            <li>And messy on the top of tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried putting it on lightly, medium and pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>The little brush works great avoiding a mess.</li>
            <li>but it clumps up easily and dried out kinda fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of experience with false eyelashes in general, but this adhesive went on easily, kept the lashes in place, then was easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>It was perfect for the first few uses but after about a week or two the brush got frayed up and it made it difficult to control where the glue was going.  </li>
            <li>New to lashes</li>
            <li>well if you are in a hurry and new at this, then this will get the job done.</li>
            <li>recommendation, though: if you are going to reuse your lashes (you probably should, for the sake of your bank account and all), since it&#x27;s a brush, you should probably clean the lash first, just so bacteria won&#x27;t transfer in the bottle and back to your eye every single time.</li>
            <li>So easy to use without making a mess because you are using the brush to control the amount you use.  </li>
            <li>It has a strange smell , but it&#x27;s normal for eyelash glue to smell kinda funky right?</li>
            <li>No more lashes falling off at the most inopportune moment, nor any itchy eyes either.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item expecting to get the same exact item as shown in the photo listed.</li>
            <li>It dry very quick and it last all day on your lashes.  </li>
            <li>Even better, because of the narrow application brush, its a snap to apply with no mess and no waste.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily,,, holds firmly.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in my life that false eyelashes have become hassle free!</li>
            <li>No mess!</li>
            <li>I have tried different lash adhesives and this one was much easier to use, it didn&#x27;t squeeze out all over the place and leave a huge mess around the eyes</li>
            <li>It is less gooey than duo and dries cleanly and clearly.</li>
            <li>Clearly the seller doesn&#x27;t watch expiration dates.  </li>
            <li>But it dries clear so that wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>My lashes stay in place and the product is clear on the eye.</li>
            <li>This definitely made things much MUCH easier.</li>
            <li>I know what it is supposed to be like, texture, thickness, and the one i got was old and nasty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they fixed it immediately with no hassle to me.</li>
            <li>I had always  a very sparce lashes, and now, at 56, they are almost invisible, then, I used sometimes the regular adhesives</li>
            <li>, it really helps everything to blend especially if you are using eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I tried putting it on while fresh and wet and putting it on after it became tacky.</li>
            <li>There was no control with where the glue went or how much was being applied, and it would never fail that an air bubble would pop up and get the glue dripping down the rest of the lash.  </li>
            <li>lasts all day, removes easily, dries totally clear, requires very little product to work.</li>
            <li>DUO would peel right off in the middle of my workouts, but this stays put and is actually water proof.</li>
            <li>I read the previous reviews about this product and it is pretty much all that I read upfront about this product.</li>
            <li>While the product arrived exactly when it was supposed to, this product was completely dry inside and out.</li>
            <li>First of all, the consistency is extremely thin (almost water-like) which makes it necessary to apply several coats to get any kind of hold on natural lashes.</li>
            <li>I used this in tandem with my Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 101 Demi Black for a cosplay and they stayed on ALL DAY without issue.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and easy to remove with no residue left over on my eye line afterwards.</li>
            <li>no mess, no waiting, no tube to squeeze.</li>
            <li>No fuss, no mess.</li>
            <li>would not mess with this one again.</li>
            <li>I was astonished also on the price as this same product was available at local CVS and TARGET or Walgreens for much much mcuh less</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands, this definitely being one of the bests in my opinion. :)</li>
            <li>quickly get gooped up with dried adhesive, even though I quickly close it tight after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I buy a new one every 5 months or so and use it daily.</li>
            <li>The price is about the same as we pay locally and it comes straight to the house</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t love are peeling corners globs of white stuff stuck to my eyes, my bottom lashes getting all stuck together and glue drying too slowly.</li>
            <li>it is pretty messy, the only thing that really cleans it off is a cotton ball soaked in eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Amazon has there act together like no other.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expenisve, but since it seems to be very limited availability that seems reasonable.</li>
            <li>This glue has a blue tint to it that drys clear.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-It comes out white but dries clear</li>
            <li>Blue so you can see it, but dries clear.</li>
            <li>It comes out blue but drys clear.</li>
            <li>I could barely remove the brush from the bottle.</li>
            <li>It took about 30 seconds for the glue to go tacky, and then I put it on my lashes with no slipping and sliding around.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but not great.</li>
            <li>false eyelashes many times</li>
            <li>It is much more easier to put on false lashes with this.</li>
            <li>I love wearing false lashes</li>
            <li>Let me just say I love the look of false lashes.</li>
            <li>I had previously used duo, and was happy with it, but was wary post eye freakout.</li>
            <li>The glue isn&#x27;t matte white, it&#x27;s more of a sheer luminescent white, but it dried completely clear and didn&#x27;t mess up my eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how this product could have gotten so many good reviews because it is the absolute worst eyelash glue I have ever used</li>
            <li>Additionally, there is virtually no staying-power, as I am able to effortlessly pull the false lashes off after only a couple hours of wear (without using any water or makeup remover), despite having applied several coats of this adhesive.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to the black one because I can see how much glue I&#x27;m applying</li>
            <li>Gives you enough time to place your falsies exactly where you want them without about having to worry that it&#x27;s going to dry too fast or too slowly.</li>
            <li>Within hours the edges of the lashes are popping up, no matter how little or how much adhesive I tried.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good stuff!</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>

            <li> works great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The idea of the brush is very nice.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell, sticks very nicely.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this lash glue, works the best out of all that i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was great, on time, and a good experience.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> Having good glue is the trick.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for almost a year and its been really good to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really good with lashes, but this made even me struggle...</li>
            <li> and damn I look good.</li>
            <li> The Company delivered my item on time&lt;br /&gt;and loved it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is good for people who have allergies.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to tube glue - a LOT easier to use.</li>
            <li> Best features of the glue is the brush-on applicator, glue stays all day, and application of my lashes takes seconds because the glue gets tacky quickly.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s not going to fall off of your eyes, and that&#x27;s absolutely great, but removal isn&#x27;t all about tearing out lashes and hurting yourself in the process.</li>

            <li> I can BE CONFIDENT that they are not going to start peeling off on either side throughout the day!</li>

            <li> But gives amazing results.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes applying the perfect amount much easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the adhesive kind of a chicken,i&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li> Demi Lashes (Pack of 4)]], for instance) come with their own instructions on how to apply the lashes, some (Like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Well, Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive comes with its own instructions, and it matches any lashes you&#x27;re using.</li>
            <li> so I cant say much but happy Wife happy life.</li>
            <li> Honestly I suck at applying lash adhesive glue to falsies but</li>
            <li> This can be rectified with warm water.</li>
            <li> Best adhessive ever super easy to use and hold lashes in place until you remove it</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to apply to the lashes.</li>

            <li> this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> That worked great for one hour, when the lashes peeled right up.  </li>
            <li> it did not have a strong glue smell that makes my eyes water!</li>
            <li> This glue is very good for sensitive skin &amp; eyes!</li>
            <li> They come off easily if you just pull them off, but then you run the risk of accidentally tugging at your own lashes.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Great adhesive, went on easy in just the right amount.  </li>

            <li> I actually slept in them &amp; woke up with them still perfectly glued in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different eyelash adhesives, and I love this one best.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t exist in most lash adhesive, and it&#x27;s a darn shame.</li>
            <li> Even though many eyelashes (Like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyelash glue.</li>

            <li> I have tried many brands, but always return to this one.</li>

            <li> Latex allergic lash weareres rejoice--there is this fantastic product around to solve your adhesive needs!</li>
            <li> I am trying to find one that is more sticky and a better adhesive</li>
            <li> Just be sure to let it get tacky for a couple seconds before applying to eyelids.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I have talked to the company and they worked with me to make sure I got the product.</li>
            <li> Glue also built up around the top and it just seemed like a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after the brush got worn out it just seemed like more of a hassle then help.  </li>
            <li> so CVS, Walgreens, or Walmart are much better options for purchase.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite,  </li>
            <li> But it is OKAY.</li>
            <li> I have used this  product  for 2 years now and it is in my opinion  much better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love love love this glue, it lasts more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and lasts and lasts!</li>
            <li> She has tried almost every similar product on the market and for her this is the best she can find!</li>
            <li> It explains how to apply it in the best way possible, so your lashes would get that strong hold you wish</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get over how great the glue application was while the brush was still new looking.  </li>
            <li> This one was easy to use and held the lashes on more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Love the easy application wand.</li>
            <li> Finally I saw a youtube video that alluded to latex free glue, so I found this one and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Amazing product absolutely great great clear adhesive for red cherry lashes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and see when it is ready and holds amazingly well.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this, this is the absolute best lash adhesive out there from what I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is the BRUSH.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work any better than the glue that comes with cheap eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Completely disapointed!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this glue thinking that it would be great</li>
            <li> I see that&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is the best I have found for keeping lashes in place, which I wear every day.</li>
            <li> I use to struggle applying mine, but now I can easily just apply them.</li>
            <li> the skinny brush is easy to use and pliable.</li>
            <li> and it comes off fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> Revlon&#x27;s adhesive is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works easy and well.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is easy.</li>
            <li> Stays in place for days and attaches easily to eyelids</li>
            <li> Plus the brush applicator makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really easy to see.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rip your eyelashes out and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be really easy to use.</li>
            <li> The application brush is what makes it convenient and easy.  </li>
            <li> Removes easy with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove at night.</li>
            <li> Held up in the heat of summer easy to use</li>
            <li> the answer!&lt;br /&gt;-It has an easy application wand instead of a squeeze tube</li>
            <li> The glue is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> the less :D</li>
            <li> This Revlon brand is definitely my favorite to keep in my purse for when I need to quickly re-apply or when I travel.</li>
            <li> Great buy, easy to apply and will hold lashes until next day!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes, and this product is by far the BEST.</li>
            <li> Sticks the first time! :) A+++</li>
            <li> I will enjoy this adhesive</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the glue</li>
            <li> especially love the narrow brush applicator.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and stays on.</li>
            <li> but this glue was very helpful and amazing...</li>
            <li> Cheap glue</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great glue if you are just starting out with falsies, or even if you have been applying them for years.</li>
            <li> So this was a great idea but the execution wasn&#x27;t up to standard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy, has great hold and will last all day.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to order some lashes and lash glue just in time for the holidays.</li>
            <li> First and foremost I love this lash glue.</li>
            <li> You could also clean out the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great super long wear</li>
            <li> You will need special eye makeup remover pads to get this off, the type you use for waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t help with co-ordination and getting the things in the right place!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to gently clean the glue from your real lashes.</li>
            <li> The time frame for delivery was super quick and I recieved free shipping.</li>
            <li> The fine brush tip applies just the right amount of adhesive to the lash band.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to close it all the way when not in use, it starts drying out really fast.</li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, It makes it so easy to put the glue on your false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> That said, it peels off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> It has a brush applicator, dries pretty quickly, AND is easy to wash off of pairs of eyelashes for re-use.</li>
            <li> I am super</li>
            <li> I said that, but it&#x27;s worthy to repeat that, ok?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a quick swipe.</li>
            <li> Also, quick swipe.</li>
            <li> It dries up quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied that my paranoia allowed me to discover this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lash adhesives and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> The brush makes it easy to apply and the glue really helps you have control.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and dries fast.</li>
            <li> and they are on the first time!</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun exploring lashes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I honestly think it last longer through out the day.</li>
            <li> It must be many years old for that to happen.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I wear the \\&quot;half\\&quot; lashes and I love how I can see it go onto the lash band, but it dries clear.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite lash glue.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I got these for cosplaying only and to be honest</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly and most importantly - the adhesive doesn&#x27;t last through the day.</li>
            <li> its worth it</li>
            <li> The ease of application makes this product superior to other lash adhesives on the market.</li>
            <li> excellent-went underwater-lashes stayed on-far superior to ANY other lash adhesive-been wearing lashes for over 30 yrs</li>
            <li> (I just wash my face with my neutrogena cleanser that has makeup remover in it and they come right off without tugging).</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I use this it falls out right away.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m having issues finding the right adhesive too.</li>
            <li> My celebrity hair/make up girl swears by this one and she has free access to a lot of high end brands.</li>
            <li> Applying glue with the precision the fine brush gives allows you to reach a very natural look.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, takes longer to completely dry, easy to wash off you eyelids, not so easy to get of falselashes.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I currently use black, and although it works awesome, it&#x27;s a real pain in the rear to keep the stuff on the eyelashes and off of your eyelid, forehead, fingers, cheeks, nose...</li>
            <li> I work for a cosmetics company and am an avid falsies wearer, I started noticing that my eyes would get irritated with the lash glue I was using.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is after about a week or so of consistent every day use, the glue gets all over the top and comes out the side when you close it.</li>
            <li> thanks revlon!</li>
            <li> Like, really!</li>
            <li> I but this exact glue from this store in MArch of 2013 for around 5 dollars.</li>
            <li> I love this last glue.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s another problem entirely :)</li>
            <li> Okay so when you first put this on the lashes the color of the glue is a light blue color and as it dries it turns clear.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, only the dark color is available locally, so I was very happy to find it for him here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using lash glue for years and this is the first time it&#x27;s happened.</li>
            <li> I did not receive this exact version, which was what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I put the glue first along my lash line, then also along the eyelash - wait 20 or so seconds then apply.</li>
            <li> (.__-&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> it was first time</li>
            <li> I actually ordered two more tubes of this</li>
            <li> it was still on like when I put them on the first time</li>
            <li> wow! is super easy to use, because it comes with a brush, sticks very easily, not messy, and I tested it for 2 days</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get a clear glue for my falsies.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff and apprently so do many others as the few locations we can find nearby that sell it, sell out quickly!</li>
            <li> kind of looks like a greenish blue, but dries clear.</li>
            <li> With this product you put exactly how much glue you want exactly where you want.  </li>
            <li> It dries quick and clear and shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect false eyelasses to be this easy, but with this glue and their lashes, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> The positive......</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is the thin brush, which makes precise application easy.</li>
            <li> I love it, lasts long and doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> My favorite lash glue, easy to apply and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li> I watched several youtube videos and the women on there recommend this, saying it was easy to use too.</li>
            <li> Comes with instructions which was great because this was my first time wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My eyes were watering all day and I had to keep checking a mirror to make sure my lashes had not come loose..</li>
            <li> The reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because I wish the glue was just a little bit stronger, but this is still a nice glue</li>
            <li> highly recommend it, just be sure to clean off the tube after each use, or it will gum up around the neck and make it hard to twist the top back on.</li>
            <li> Yes it is quite a bit more spendy than the little tubes, but you get what you pay for, and this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This glue really sticks the lashes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, packaged well.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> I used this to glue jewels on my very oily skin and it stayed all night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute game-changer.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Lash off, and you&#x27;re ready for reuse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just have to wait and let the glue get really tacky before you put the lashes on, that should help them stay on all day.</li>
            <li> THANKS FROM TEXAS ~ BIANCA</li>
            <li> I tried it and it has real sticking power, all day.</li>
            <li> When you get ready to take your eyelashes off they come off with a gentle finger lifting.</li>
            <li> That was fast</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve fallen asleep in makeup and my lashes were still secure the next day even after sleeping in them) but is entirely latex free.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to find a glue that would hold throughout the day at work AND if ever wanted to go out, it would hold thicker lashes through dancing and drinks.</li>
            <li> Also, they both have an absolutely funky smell.</li>
            <li> But for whatever reason, may it be I was using cheap lashes, when I put the glue on them it turned blue.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> worked for the whole day.</li>
            <li> This gets very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lately it has not seemed to hold/stick quite as well as in the past, but it is still the best choice for quick touch ups or ease needed for travel.  </li>
            <li> That said, I was a little worried about peeling them off, but it was no problem at all--they came off super easy.</li>
            <li> Applies easily and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I used many other products and they all really were a joke to me.  </li>
            <li> This lash adhesive works better than any other product out there.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I took the shower, on purpose I loffahed my face and eyes, with soap and water, finish the shower, went to dry my hair, and they are still there, strong.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and holds firmly.</li>
            <li> Best of all, I didn&#x27;t lose a single one of my own lashes, unlike when I tried Lashtite glue--lost a good half dozen lashes from trying to get the awful glue off my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Better than duo, keeps your edges down.</li>
            <li> It makes application so simple, so precise, so fast, no mess.</li>
            <li> I was in love with it when I bought it for awhile, but now I love Eylure&#x27;s eyelash adhesive in the small bottle!!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wears artificial lashes on stage frequently, and this is his preferred adhesive - it works best of any brand he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> It worked really well when I applied my lashes long lasting love it</li>
            <li> Glue was fine until it got to the stage where the glue was all around the outside of the bottle, where i could barely close it.</li>
            <li> To take them off, is so easy, is like the other adhesives.</li>
            <li> It stays beautifully, it&#x27;s not thick like the other glues, it&#x27;s transparent and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> The small brush makes application super easy and no mess.</li>
            <li> I was curious to wear some cheap falsies</li>
            <li> Fast drying and drys clear.</li>
            <li> Too much glue can leave a shiny finish even if it dries clear.</li>
            <li> And messy on the top of tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried putting it on lightly, medium and pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> The little brush works great avoiding a mess.</li>
            <li> but it clumps up easily and dried out kinda fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of experience with false eyelashes in general, but this adhesive went on easily, kept the lashes in place, then was easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> It was perfect for the first few uses but after about a week or two the brush got frayed up and it made it difficult to control where the glue was going.  </li>
            <li> New to lashes</li>
            <li> well if you are in a hurry and new at this, then this will get the job done.</li>
            <li> recommendation, though: if you are going to reuse your lashes (you probably should, for the sake of your bank account and all), since it&#x27;s a brush, you should probably clean the lash first, just so bacteria won&#x27;t transfer in the bottle and back to your eye every single time.</li>
            <li> So easy to use without making a mess because you are using the brush to control the amount you use.  </li>
            <li> It has a strange smell , but it&#x27;s normal for eyelash glue to smell kinda funky right?</li>
            <li> No more lashes falling off at the most inopportune moment, nor any itchy eyes either.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item expecting to get the same exact item as shown in the photo listed.</li>
            <li> It dry very quick and it last all day on your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Even better, because of the narrow application brush, its a snap to apply with no mess and no waste.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily,,, holds firmly.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life that false eyelashes have become hassle free!</li>
            <li> No mess!</li>
            <li> I have tried different lash adhesives and this one was much easier to use, it didn&#x27;t squeeze out all over the place and leave a huge mess around the eyes</li>
            <li> It is less gooey than duo and dries cleanly and clearly.</li>
            <li> Clearly the seller doesn&#x27;t watch expiration dates.  </li>
            <li> But it dries clear so that wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> My lashes stay in place and the product is clear on the eye.</li>
            <li> This definitely made things much MUCH easier.</li>
            <li> I know what it is supposed to be like, texture, thickness, and the one i got was old and nasty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they fixed it immediately with no hassle to me.</li>
            <li> I had always  a very sparce lashes, and now, at 56, they are almost invisible, then, I used sometimes the regular adhesives</li>
            <li> , it really helps everything to blend especially if you are using eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I tried putting it on while fresh and wet and putting it on after it became tacky.</li>
            <li> There was no control with where the glue went or how much was being applied, and it would never fail that an air bubble would pop up and get the glue dripping down the rest of the lash.  </li>
            <li> lasts all day, removes easily, dries totally clear, requires very little product to work.</li>
            <li> DUO would peel right off in the middle of my workouts, but this stays put and is actually water proof.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews about this product and it is pretty much all that I read upfront about this product.</li>
            <li> While the product arrived exactly when it was supposed to, this product was completely dry inside and out.</li>
            <li> First of all, the consistency is extremely thin (almost water-like) which makes it necessary to apply several coats to get any kind of hold on natural lashes.</li>
            <li> I used this in tandem with my Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 101 Demi Black for a cosplay and they stayed on ALL DAY without issue.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and easy to remove with no residue left over on my eye line afterwards.</li>
            <li> no mess, no waiting, no tube to squeeze.</li>
            <li> No fuss, no mess.</li>
            <li> would not mess with this one again.</li>
            <li> I was astonished also on the price as this same product was available at local CVS and TARGET or Walgreens for much much mcuh less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands, this definitely being one of the bests in my opinion. :)</li>
            <li> quickly get gooped up with dried adhesive, even though I quickly close it tight after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I buy a new one every 5 months or so and use it daily.</li>
            <li> The price is about the same as we pay locally and it comes straight to the house</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t love are peeling corners globs of white stuff stuck to my eyes, my bottom lashes getting all stuck together and glue drying too slowly.</li>
            <li> it is pretty messy, the only thing that really cleans it off is a cotton ball soaked in eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Amazon has there act together like no other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expenisve, but since it seems to be very limited availability that seems reasonable.</li>
            <li> This glue has a blue tint to it that drys clear.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-It comes out white but dries clear</li>
            <li> Blue so you can see it, but dries clear.</li>
            <li> It comes out blue but drys clear.</li>
            <li> I could barely remove the brush from the bottle.</li>
            <li> It took about 30 seconds for the glue to go tacky, and then I put it on my lashes with no slipping and sliding around.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but not great.</li>
            <li> false eyelashes many times</li>
            <li> It is much more easier to put on false lashes with this.</li>
            <li> I love wearing false lashes</li>
            <li> Let me just say I love the look of false lashes.</li>
            <li> I had previously used duo, and was happy with it, but was wary post eye freakout.</li>
            <li> The glue isn&#x27;t matte white, it&#x27;s more of a sheer luminescent white, but it dried completely clear and didn&#x27;t mess up my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product could have gotten so many good reviews because it is the absolute worst eyelash glue I have ever used</li>
            <li> Additionally, there is virtually no staying-power, as I am able to effortlessly pull the false lashes off after only a couple hours of wear (without using any water or makeup remover), despite having applied several coats of this adhesive.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the black one because I can see how much glue I&#x27;m applying</li>
            <li> Gives you enough time to place your falsies exactly where you want them without about having to worry that it&#x27;s going to dry too fast or too slowly.</li>
            <li> Within hours the edges of the lashes are popping up, no matter how little or how much adhesive I tried.</li>
            <li> At this point I have used a few lash glues, including the ever popular Duo and Ardell glues, so I do have at least some point of reference for comparing this to other glues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was determined to wear false eyelashes for my wedding, and i got the duo adhesive from sephora originally.  </li>
            <li> I had low expectations after the disappointment I had with Duo last week, but surprisingly the Revlon glue held the wispies tight against my lash line, and didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It stays on over night, I actually leave my lashes on all week and they only need minor touch ups on the corners.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t waste my time sending it back since I live overseas.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the white one to the black because it dries clear.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t take it off to go to sleep, next day, there they were, firm, completely attached.</li>
            <li> Simple concept, but it was much harder to actually find a product like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff,a little too expensive!</li>
            <li> and I also recommend it fit fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started wearing false eyelashes, and it&#x27;s been hit or miss  on the finding the right lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a very long time ago, almost a year ago.</li>
            <li> The packaging of the item wasnt sealed properly and when i opened the glue it was completely dry!!!</li>
            <li> This could be because I&#x27;m based in Arizona where it&#x27;s really dry though.</li>
            <li> everything inside is dry and doesnt stick..</li>
            <li> Found dry clumps growing in it after two weeks.</li>
            <li> Worse nicely with false lashes</li>
            <li> However, the price here is inflated by at least %100 over normal costs</li>
            <li> I had never worn false eyelashes so when I bought my first set</li>
            <li> I used with band lashes,  a little adhesive goes a long way and last all day, you could even leave on all night and just touch up the edges of the band in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the product dries up with half the tube left and becomes unusable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this product once, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the adhesion that my black glue does.</li>
            <li> The third time i tried to wear it (i needed lots of practice), i noticed my eyes were turning itchy and bloodshot and that everywhere the adhesive touched was a little swollen.  </li>
            <li> Also, with Duo and Ardell you have to squeeze the product out of the tube so you can&#x27;t always guarantee that you&#x27;ll only get a little out.</li>
            <li> When I went to open it it was hard to open.</li>
            <li> If you place the false lashes on immediately after applying glue, the false lashes will slide right off, but if you wait a few seconds more, the adhesive will have become too dry and will create clumps and flakes as you try to adjust the false lashes to your lash line.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this stuff especially for those times when she wants to wear fake eyelashes with no eyeliner on</li>
            <li> The drying time takes longer than expected.</li>
            <li> glue was all dried up and the lid with the brush looked like it may have been opened because it was internally broke.  </li>
            <li> also the package looked like it was taped closed after being opened once before.</li>
            <li> it stays wet forever</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one i received on this purchase was old though, It is goopy thick.</li>
            <li> One star off because it eventually gums up around the opening long before you run out of product, but not so soon that it&#x27;s irritating to buy a new tube.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;other&#x27; lash adhesives would make my eyes itch so bad, I couldn&#x27;t wear lashes more than a couple days per week.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t stick as well or as long as the black glue.</li>
            <li> The other thing is be careful when closing because the glue tends to ooze out.</li>
            <li> Half of the order was dry with nothing in it</li>
            <li> Decent but not great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and this was my first time wearing fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to use when the lashes are on if you notice you missed an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I chose this due to it being latex-free.</li>
            <li> Never buy this, i finally bought duo for mine and it worked perfectly as usual</li>
            <li> One other problem, it&#x27;s almost 6 dollars, plus another 3 something for shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other glue.</li>
            <li> Although the package seemed to be sealed, the wand was dry as a bone and the liquid inside was dried out</li>
            <li> The watery consistency presents further problems in that there is a very short timeframe (mere seconds) where the glue is the proper stickiness and dryness for application of the false lashes to the natural ones.</li>
            <li> It doesnt stick hard enough</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried the dark one sooner though</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m encouraged to try the dark precision version which I will do</li>
            <li> As a bellydancer I frequently wear false eyelashes and was saddened upon developing a latex allergy since almost all lash adhesives are latex based.</li>
            <li> I guess I just lost my money down the drain</li>
            <li> You can sleep overnight and this product holds tight.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with lots of hope that it would keep my lashes holding tight.  </li>
            <li> Sticks and lasts all day, sometimes a little too well</li>
            <li> No more sloppy wet white glue that is messy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it came to me dried out and completely unusable.  </li>
            <li> Duo glue was so messy for me to use and my lashes would come off at the edges.</li>
            <li> All the liquid was dried to a rock.</li>
            <li> , it got really messy and tacky.</li>
            <li> it seemed a bit dried out in the tube.</li>
            <li> It was dried out when I received it.</li>
            <li> Tube was dried up; unusable.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother because she had trouble finding this product in stores.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of piecing the package and receipt together.  </li>
            <li> I opened the package and the product was dried out.  </li>
            <li> You simply paint the edge of the lash strip with a thin line of adhesive, let it get tacky and apply.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I  wear lashes everyday</li>
            <li> It was almost caked up or dried up.</li>
            <li> The adhesive doesn&#x27;t brush on, it drags on from the brush, and not smoothly but in fits and starts and blobs.</li>
            <li> arrived dried up in one clump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months.</li>
            <li> (and I have been applying false lashes on a regular basis for years).</li>
            <li> Red Cherry #43 False Eyelashes (Pack of 6 Pairs)]], for example) don&#x27;t come with any instructions.</li>
            <li> I have a big problem with getting false lashes to stick to my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who wears a lot of false eyelashes, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> You just pull it slightly and there you go!</li>
            <li> No strong smell either.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the heat or if the product was any different from the one sold in stores, but she was not completely happy with the glue.</li>
            <li> (See the other reviewers picture and you&#x27;ll understand what I mean).</li>
            <li> other glues have dried hard on your skin which pulls at your delicate eyes, or have caused my eyes to burn when applying.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d just pull my fake lashes off, but this requires some extra makeup remover.</li>
            <li> and it was dried up!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that wet sloppy glue.</li>
            <li> This thing takes forever to get tacky enough to put on even though I use a very thin line of it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that fishy smell that Duo has, and it isn&#x27;t very messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing false lashes for quite some time now due to chemo.</li>
            <li> Later, I tried the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; and let me tell you, I always wash my face like crazy with a loofah, (people say is not fine, but  believe me, everybody complements my complexion, well, this adhesive stood the proff.</li>
            <li> I started wearing false lashes just to make me feel better about myself, but almost stopped because the glue in those little squirt tubes were awful!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the negative responses, but I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so hard to find in person, though.</li>
            <li> The negative....</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes everyday.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> There is the single lash adhesive, but it dries hard and sharp and is difficult and painful to remove.</li>
            <li> When I first attempted to wear eyelashes, I bought Duo glue in dark and failed miserably.</li>
            <li> A expensive waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always used DUO, I wanted to try out a wand to make it less messy and this one is bad.</li>
            <li> I received a  different Revlon lash adhesive. :(</li>
            <li> waste your time and money!!!</li>
            <li> I am not experienced at putting on lashes but when I tried it with this as opposed to another I was using, the lashes stuck and stayed on.</li>
            <li> adhesive itself is a thin consistency, so</li>
            <li> I had never worn false eyelashes before using this product.</li>
            <li> Saw a woman using it in a false eyelashes tutorial.</li>
            <li> i wore the false lashes and i was so worried about its glue</li>
            <li> These have a very thick, difficult lash band.</li>
            <li> My package arrived with the glue already dried, was a bad batch.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst lash adhesive I have ever used....</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed i wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, TERRIBLE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I received mine and its useless..</li>
            <li> I want an explanation for this absurd mark up.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, when I return home to L.A.,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it with Kiss Sultry fake lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice at using fake lashes too.</li>
            <li> (It is not a fresh glue) so needless to say I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a horrific reaction to permanent eyelashes, and was very careful afterwards on what chemicals I would allow towards my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give five stars because it is very difficult to take off</li>
            <li> Their is nothing bad i can say about this adhesive.</li>
            <li> I got the Revlon Precision Lash adhesive after reading how is it is latex-free, and while I don&#x27;t have a latex issue, I figure it can&#x27;t be a bad thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> but i was completely wrong!!</li>
            <li> You use a thin line and it stays all day!!!</li>
            <li> It was not probably packaged that make me unsure to use it or not that is why I hate it .</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> , well, I always had itch in my lids, and a very terrible time, then, I found this, and...</li>
            <li> this is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> this is the worst adhesive I ever bought.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brush makes it easy to apply and the glue really helps you have control. I use to struggle applying mine, but now I can easily just apply them. Having good glue is the trick. I see that&#x27;s true! This glue really sticks the lashes. Just be sure to gently clean the glue from your real lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and this was my first time wearing fake eyelashes and I&#x27;ve received several compliments. I seem a video on YouTube that recommended this and I also recommend it fit fake lashes. I will order again!</li>
            <li> Duo glue was so messy for me to use and my lashes would come off at the edges. I discovered this glue through amazon reviews and never looked back. Best features of the glue is the brush-on applicator, glue stays all day, and application of my lashes takes seconds because the glue gets tacky quickly. I LOVE IT! I am having so much fun exploring lashes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend just pulling them off your eye without some type of remover (I just wash my face with my neutrogena cleanser that has makeup remover in it and they come right off without tugging). They come off easily if you just pull them off, but then you run the risk of accidentally tugging at your own lashes.  So I like to wash them off.</li>
            <li> I do not have amazing eyelash application skillz. This definitely made things much MUCH easier. It makes applying the perfect amount much easier.</li>
            <li> When I first attempted to wear eyelashes, I bought Duo glue in dark and failed miserably. This is so much better! It has a brush applicator, dries pretty quickly, AND is easy to wash off of pairs of eyelashes for re-use. Love it!</li>
            <li> My lashes never fall off with this, and I wear them for pro-style wrestling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the product dries up with half the tube left and becomes unusable. This could be because I&#x27;m based in Arizona where it&#x27;s really dry though.</li>
            <li> I work for a cosmetics company and am an avid falsies wearer, I started noticing that my eyes would get irritated with the lash glue I was using. I realized I am allergic to latex. Thank god for the Revlon eyelash glue!!! It&#x27;s great super long wear and I honestly think it last longer through out the day. Must buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I used with band lashes,  a little adhesive goes a long way and last all day, you could even leave on all night and just touch up the edges of the band in the morning. kind of looks like a greenish blue, but dries clear. the skinny brush is easy to use and pliable.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order some lashes and lash glue just in time for the holidays. I used 2 days shipping. While the product arrived exactly when it was supposed to, this product was completely dry inside and out. It must be many years old for that to happen. I could barely remove the brush from the bottle. All the liquid was dried to a rock. I am super disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now I have a bunch of lashes ( 2 packs of 4) and no lash glue. There is not enough time to reorder/return and get some lash glue before the holidays now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummed is an understatement!</li>
            <li> Works just like its supposed to! Gives you enough time to place your falsies exactly where you want them without about having to worry that it&#x27;s going to dry too fast or too slowly. Would def recommend.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold fairly well!</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the black one because I can see how much glue I&#x27;m applying and it comes off fairly easily.  Shipping was fast, packaged well.  Just be sure to close it all the way when not in use, it starts drying out really fast. The other thing is be careful when closing because the glue tends to ooze out. I still prefer the white one to the black because it dries clear.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this glue. Every time I look around, I see Duo....Duo....Duo!! I don&#x27;t like that wet sloppy glue. Revlon&#x27;s adhesive is so easy to use. Just a flip of the wand and you&#x27;re ready to go. Best of all...they stay put all day. Their is nothing bad i can say about this adhesive. Its a must have for all \\&quot;falsie\\&quot; wearers.</li>
            <li> It doesnt stick hard enough</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Works easy and well. Does not always feel like my lashes are staying on, but only had an issue once. Almost time to reorder!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a very long time ago, almost a year ago. I was in love with it when I bought it for awhile, but now I love Eylure&#x27;s eyelash adhesive in the small bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Been trying for months to get these darn lashes on my eyes,STILL CAN&#x27;T...LOL. It&#x27;s not the adhesive kind of a chicken,i&#x27;ll get over it. it doesn&#x27;t irratate my eyes,or cause any discomfort watsoever! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product could have gotten so many good reviews because it is the absolute worst eyelash glue I have ever used (and I have been applying false lashes on a regular basis for years). First of all, the consistency is extremely thin (almost water-like) which makes it necessary to apply several coats to get any kind of hold on natural lashes. The watery consistency presents further problems in that there is a very short timeframe (mere seconds) where the glue is the proper stickiness and dryness for application of the false lashes to the natural ones. If you place the false lashes on immediately after applying glue, the false lashes will slide right off, but if you wait a few seconds more, the adhesive will have become too dry and will create clumps and flakes as you try to adjust the false lashes to your lash line. Additionally, there is virtually no staying-power, as I am able to effortlessly pull the false lashes off after only a couple hours of wear (without using any water or makeup remover), despite having applied several coats of this adhesive. The only good thing about this product is the thin brush, which makes precise application easy. Overall though, TERRIBLE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I will enjoy this adhesive</li>
            <li> Applies easily and lasts a long time.  Cleanup is easy. Stays in place for days and attaches easily to eyelids</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how awesome this glue is.  So easy to use without making a mess because you are using the brush to control the amount you use.  Not only that, it doesn&#x27;t smell like Duo glue.  It dry very quick and it last all day on your lashes.  Id buy this for sure again.  Im allergic to latex but this doesn&#x27;t have that chemical and I have been using it for almost a year and its been really good to me.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Overall i did like the glue, the problem was the adhesive around the container, it got really messy and tacky. Glue was fine until it got to the stage where the glue was all around the outside of the bottle, where i could barely close it.</li>
            <li> Love it! this product works Great!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;ve been wearing false lashes for quite some time now due to chemo. The &#x27;other&#x27; lash adhesives would make my eyes itch so bad, I couldn&#x27;t wear lashes more than a couple days per week. Now I wouldn&#x27;t dream of NOT wearing lashes, I even sleep in them with this adhesive. No more lashes falling off at the most inopportune moment, nor any itchy eyes either.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of experience with false eyelashes in general, but this adhesive went on easily, kept the lashes in place, then was easy to remove.  I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> My favorite lash glue, easy to apply and long lasting. One star off because it eventually gums up around the opening long before you run out of product, but not so soon that it&#x27;s irritating to buy a new tube.</li>
            <li> I love this lash glue, works the best out of all that i&#x27;ve used. Sticks and lasts all day, sometimes a little too well and I&#x27;ll see left over glue remnants on my eyelashes the next morning even after washing my face twice. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is after about a week or so of consistent every day use, the glue gets all over the top and comes out the side when you close it. It get&#x27;s everywhere and it is pretty messy, the only thing that really cleans it off is a cotton ball soaked in eye makeup remover. (See the other reviewers picture and you&#x27;ll understand what I mean). Other than that, it is the best I have found for keeping lashes in place, which I wear every day. Plus the brush applicator makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great buy, easy to apply and will hold lashes until next day!</li>
            <li> I received mine and its useless.. everything inside is dry and doesnt stick..</li>
            <li> Best eyelash glue out there! no mess, no waiting, no tube to squeeze. water proof too! lasts about 2 months, if strip lashes are worn every day! thanks revlon!</li>
            <li> It was not probably packaged that make me unsure to use it or not that is why I hate it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to latex, so I&#x27;m happy to even find an adhesive I can use. That said, it peels off pretty easily. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for extended wear, but for a dinner out it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Have tried Duo, etc.  This glue actually lasts for an entire evening. I use the brush to put glue both on lash-strip and on my eylashes for extra holding power.</li>
            <li> I tried all the adhesives I could get my mits on before choosing one to use when wearing falsies for my best friend&#x27;s wedding. This one was easy to use and held the lashes on more than 24 hours. I could not believe it. I actually slept in them &amp; woke up with them still perfectly glued in place. (the rest of my makeup was smeared all over, lol) That said, I was a little worried about peeling them off, but it was no problem at all--they came off super easy. Best of all, I didn&#x27;t lose a single one of my own lashes, unlike when I tried Lashtite glue--lost a good half dozen lashes from trying to get the awful glue off my eyelids. I highly, highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> it wears well and lasts all day and night. The drying time takes longer than expected. But gives amazing results. I used this to glue jewels on my very oily skin and it stayed all night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different eyelash adhesives, and I love this one best. I will repurchase this over and over again, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;* The most important thing is the BRUSH. That doesn&#x27;t exist in most lash adhesive, and it&#x27;s a darn shame. It makes application so simple, so precise, so fast, no mess. It&#x27;s an absolute game-changer.&lt;br /&gt;* It holds up! Like, really! Your lashes won&#x27;t just accidentally start falling or drooping in the middle of the day. No way. Not with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s so simple! Even though many eyelashes (Like [[ASIN:B003ZS4WJY Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 110 Demi Lashes (Pack of 4)]], for instance) come with their own instructions on how to apply the lashes, some (Like [[ASIN:B006LRRQK8 Red Cherry #43 False Eyelashes (Pack of 6 Pairs)]], for example) don&#x27;t come with any instructions. Well, Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive comes with its own instructions, and it matches any lashes you&#x27;re using. It explains how to apply it in the best way possible, so your lashes would get that strong hold you wish for.&lt;br /&gt;* Removal is a breeze! Sure, it&#x27;s not going to fall off of your eyes, and that&#x27;s absolutely great, but removal isn&#x27;t all about tearing out lashes and hurting yourself in the process. You just pull it slightly and there you go! Lash off, and you&#x27;re ready for reuse.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s not messy. I said that, but it&#x27;s worthy to repeat that, ok?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recommendation, though: if you are going to reuse your lashes (you probably should, for the sake of your bank account and all), since it&#x27;s a brush, you should probably clean the lash first, just so bacteria won&#x27;t transfer in the bottle and back to your eye every single time. Just a quick swipe. You could also clean out the brush. Also, quick swipe. Nothing crazy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, this is the absolute best lash adhesive out there from what I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyelash glue. It is very easy to apply and see when it is ready and holds amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Will forever love this product!</li>
            <li> This lash adhesive works better than any other product out there.  It is easy to use and lasts a long time. Amazing.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work any better than the glue that comes with cheap eyelashes. Not worth the price. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I but this exact glue from this store in MArch of 2013 for around 5 dollars. WHY is it now 15 dollars??? I want an explanation for this absurd mark up. I enjoy using the glue but I do not wish to be taken advantage of regarding it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The positive......it did not have a strong glue smell that makes my eyes water! The negative....it seemed a bit dried out in the tube.</li>
            <li> It was dried out when I received it. I didn&#x27;t waste my time sending it back since I live overseas. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This glue is the best ever. I wear the \\&quot;half\\&quot; lashes and I love how I can see it go onto the lash band, but it dries clear. It sort of looks blueish when you glide it on, so it&#x27;s really easy to see. Plus if you get some on the lash by mistake, you won&#x27;t notice once it dries because it is not too tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the narrow brush applicator. It&#x27;s small enough to use when the lashes are on if you notice you missed an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, just be sure to clean off the tube after each use, or it will gum up around the neck and make it hard to twist the top back on.</li>
            <li> Great! I love it, lasts long and doesn&#x27;t budge. I think it&#x27;s better than Duo lash glue in terms of longevity.</li>
            <li> Tube was dried up; unusable.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, takes longer to completely dry, easy to wash off you eyelids, not so easy to get of falselashes.</li>
            <li> Half of the order was dry with nothing in it</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash glue that I will ever put on my eyelids. I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The wife wanted this one so I cant say much but happy Wife happy life.</li>
            <li> I had never worn false eyelashes so when I bought my first set I attempted to use the adhesive that was included; it was a nightmare. Then I tried this and it was so much better! The small brush makes application super easy and no mess. I would advise giving 10 to 20 seconds for the glue to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; before applying the lash.</li>
            <li> I was determined to wear false eyelashes for my wedding, and i got the duo adhesive from sephora originally.  The third time i tried to wear it (i needed lots of practice), i noticed my eyes were turning itchy and bloodshot and that everywhere the adhesive touched was a little swollen.  Next i went out looking for this product in stores (walmart, walgreens, target, and i called a rite aid) and none of them had it.  I settled for Andrea striplash adhesive (which didn&#x27;t have latex or formaldehyde in it--i figured i was allergic to one of those two).  That worked great for one hour, when the lashes peeled right up.  So i ordered this from amazon (had to overnight it to get it in time for the wedding) and it was great--no allergic reaction, held all night.  I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so hard to find in person, though.</li>
            <li> This is normally my favorite eyelash glue, the type i use all the time. The one i received on this purchase was old though, It is goopy thick. (It is not a fresh glue) so needless to say I was very disappointed. Since i use this one all the time I know what it is supposed to be like, texture, thickness, and the one i got was old and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was great, on time, and a good experience.</li>
            <li> Great adhesive, went on easy in just the right amount.  Lashes stay in place after applying.</li>
            <li> My package arrived with the glue already dried, was a bad batch. I let the company know and they fixed it immediately with no hassle to me. Great product as well. Doesn&#x27;t rip your eyelashes out and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Worse nicely with false lashes</li>
            <li> My celebrity hair/make up girl swears by this one and she has free access to a lot of high end brands. I took her advice and ordered it and I agree with her. Goes on smoothly and stays on.</li>
            <li> I had never worn false eyelashes before using this product. I have found this product to be really easy to use. I watched several youtube videos and the women on there recommend this, saying it was easy to use too. I have worn&lt;br /&gt;my false eyelashes many times and they have been great! They have stayed on from morning&lt;br /&gt;to night and I have not had to reapply. This is easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> only lash glue i rely on. lasts all day, removes easily, dries totally clear, requires very little product to work. best ever.</li>
            <li> I love this last glue. It works excellent. I have tried many brands, but always return to this one. Thank you. :)</li>
            <li> I had no idea eyelash adhesive had latex in it, but always had problems with it as a severe irritant. Finally I saw a youtube video that alluded to latex free glue, so I found this one and it works perfectly. Of course it doesn&#x27;t help with co-ordination and getting the things in the right place! That&#x27;s another problem entirely :)</li>
            <li> Great product!  Will repurchase!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item expecting to get the same exact item as shown in the photo listed. I received a  different Revlon lash adhesive. :(</li>
            <li> Better than I expected! My lashes STAYED PUT all night...no sliding or lifting. No strong smell either. I will be stocking up on this gem!</li>
            <li> I had a horrific reaction to permanent eyelashes, and was very careful afterwards on what chemicals I would allow towards my eyes. I chose this due to it being latex-free. I had previously used duo, and was happy with it, but was wary post eye freakout. I actually prefer this to duo now! It is less gooey than duo and dries cleanly and clearly. It also stays on like superglue...with duo, I&#x27;d just pull my fake lashes off, but this requires some extra makeup remover. Overall, I am very satisfied that my paranoia allowed me to discover this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product absolutely great great clear adhesive for red cherry lashes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant wait to buy more!!!! awesomeee!!! love</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash glue I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes my eyelashes stay on all day and I never have to reapply it.</li>
            <li> Okay so when you first put this on the lashes the color of the glue is a light blue color and as it dries it turns clear. The reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because I wish the glue was just a little bit stronger, but this is still a nice glue and it is very easy to apply to the lashes. You just have to wait and let the glue get really tacky before you put the lashes on, that should help them stay on all day.</li>
            <li> GOOD JOB, REALLY LIKED THIS Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive 0.17 fl oz  COMBO, ~ I NEEDED THE FULLNESS ~ THANKS FROM TEXAS ~ BIANCA</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wears artificial lashes on stage frequently, and this is his preferred adhesive - it works best of any brand he&#x27;s tried. unfortunately, only the dark color is available locally, so I was very happy to find it for him here. It&#x27;s expenisve, but since it seems to be very limited availability that seems reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is much more easier to put on false lashes with this. And the best thing of all is that the lashes stay in place untill the moment you remove it. I don&#x27;t give five stars because it is very difficult to take off, I suggest to use a oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I seen this product on a Youtube channel. I tried it and it has real sticking power, all day. When you get ready to take your eyelashes off they come off with a gentle finger lifting. I have never had any problems with this glue.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother because she had trouble finding this product in stores. For some reason her eyelashes would start detaching during the middle of the day. Not sure if it was the heat or if the product was any different from the one sold in stores, but she was not completely happy with the glue.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. I have tried other lash adhesives and this one is by far the best.  The brush alows you more control when applying. In addition the adhesive keeps your lashes on until you want them off. The time frame for delivery was super quick and I recieved free shipping. Amazon has there act together like no other. Hope this helps. Peace, Tammila in Dallas</li>
            <li> I am not experienced at putting on lashes but when I tried it with this as opposed to another I was using, the lashes stuck and stayed on.</li>
            <li> Decent but not great I prefer the Asian brand I forgot the name. Sometimes when I use this it falls out right away. I&#x27;ve been using lash glue for years and this is the first time it&#x27;s happened.</li>
            <li> glue was all dried up and the lid with the brush looked like it may have been opened because it was internally broke.  also the package looked like it was taped closed after being opened once before. I was very disappointed.  There was no glue what so ever to be used in the container.  I would have sent it back but I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of piecing the package and receipt together.  should receive no stars.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite lash glue. I tried the brand DUO and I would not purchase that one again, I will be going back to Revlon.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and the product was dried out.  So I cannot rate the quality.  Needless to say, when I return home to L.A.,&lt;br /&gt;I will ask for a refund.  Thank goodness I ordered another brand - Ardell Brush On - which worked out great.</li>
            <li> Very good product, just be sure to have a way to remove this adhesive after as it is quite strong.</li>
            <li> That was fast it took three days I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Yes! I used this in tandem with my Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 101 Demi Black for a cosplay and they stayed on ALL DAY without issue.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and easy to remove with no residue left over on my eye line afterwards.</li>
            <li> A expensive waste of money.  This thing takes forever to get tacky enough to put on even though I use a very thin line of it.  Then it will not stay stuck on the ends.  I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> Precision Lash Adhesive is great.  I have a big problem with getting false lashes to stick to my eyelids.  I used many other products and they all really were a joke to me.  This product works great and I never have to worry about lifting or the goo glue look.</li>
            <li> Best adhessive ever super easy to use and hold lashes in place until you remove it</li>
            <li> Best lash glue. Better than duo, keeps your edges down.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes everyday.  So I have definitely tried a variety of adhesives. This Revlon brand is definitely my favorite to keep in my purse for when I need to quickly re-apply or when I travel. Lately it has not seemed to hold/stick quite as well as in the past, but it is still the best choice for quick touch ups or ease needed for travel.  The application brush is what makes it convenient and easy.  So I would recommend this brand and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I did not receive this exact version, which was what I was hoping for. The version I received doesn&#x27;t get tacky as the one pictured. No where in the description does it say that products may vary in different packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using falsies for years and I&#x27;ve always used DUO, I wanted to try out a wand to make it less messy and this one is bad. It won&#x27;t even stick my eyelashes to my eyes... I&#x27;ve never had that problem before. It&#x27;s similar to the elf lash glue.</li>
            <li> Well, I can not say enough about this adhesive, IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD! I had always  a very sparce lashes, and now, at 56, they are almost invisible, then, I used sometimes the regular adhesives and I am allergic to latex, well, I always had itch in my lids, and a very terrible time, then, I found this, and... wow! is super easy to use, because it comes with a brush, sticks very easily, not messy, and I tested it for 2 days, I didn&#x27;t take it off to go to sleep, next day, there they were, firm, completely attached. Later, I tried the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; and let me tell you, I always wash my face like crazy with a loofah, (people say is not fine, but  believe me, everybody complements my complexion, well, this adhesive stood the proff. I took the shower, on purpose I loffahed my face and eyes, with soap and water, finish the shower, went to dry my hair, and they are still there, strong. To take them off, is so easy, is like the other adhesives. Well, love it, love it, love it, I am going to buy like 5 more, just in case they discontinued it! I am a fan!!!</li>
            <li> As a bellydancer I frequently wear false eyelashes and was saddened upon developing a latex allergy since almost all lash adhesives are latex based. There is the single lash adhesive, but it dries hard and sharp and is difficult and painful to remove. When I stumbled upon this product, my problem was solved! This is just as flexible as traditional latex based adhesive, and has excellent hold (I&#x27;ve fallen asleep in makeup and my lashes were still secure the next day even after sleeping in them) but is entirely latex free. Even better, because of the narrow application brush, its a snap to apply with no mess and no waste. You simply paint the edge of the lash strip with a thin line of adhesive, let it get tacky and apply.  Latex allergic lash weareres rejoice--there is this fantastic product around to solve your adhesive needs!</li>
            <li> New to lashes but this glue was very helpful and amazing... The little brush works great avoiding a mess. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> You can sleep overnight and this product holds tight. The lashes may get bent but they will stay on. Removes with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I might as well relied on water for glue. Lashes was off before I could get in the car. Recommend Ardell Lash Glue.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Got here super quick and It works great! The brush is perfect</li>
            <li> Perfect! Comes with instructions which was great because this was my first time wearing false eyelashes. It dries quick and clear and shipped very fast. Definitely will buy this again and again and again.</li>
            <li> Best eyelash glue ever!</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst lash adhesive I have ever used.... I bought it, cause my store was out of my regular brand and never again.. I&#x27;m really good with lashes, but this made even me struggle... it stays wet forever and once it&#x27;s tacky it sticks to everything but your skin/ lashes. My eyes were watering all day and I had to keep checking a mirror to make sure my lashes had not come loose.. this is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> The ease of application makes this product superior to other lash adhesives on the market. The fine brush tip applies just the right amount of adhesive to the lash band.  No fuss, no mess.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  No more sloppy wet white glue that is messy.  This glue has a blue tint to it that drys clear. Mine also stayed on overnight.  Removes easy with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It dries up quickly. I am trying to find one that is more sticky and a better adhesive</li>
            <li> Eh.....just alright. If I want to wear my lashes for just one or two hours. I can&#x27;t get any of the non-latex adhesives to work for me. I&#x27;ve tried to duo and kiss versions also, and similar results. The idea of the brush is very nice. It just won&#x27;t hold for me.</li>
            <li> Good stuff,a little too expensive!</li>
            <li> Honestly I suck at applying lash adhesive glue to falsies but these...well if you are in a hurry and new at this, then this will get the job done. I was curious to wear some cheap falsies and damn I look good. This product held my falsies on all day until I want to take them off. I just tear it off my lids and it doesn&#x27;t even hurt! No harm no foul. This is one of the best product ever!</li>
            <li> Best adhesive I&#x27;ve found.  Easy to use and dries fast. Excellent holding power. Just be sure to let it get tacky for a couple seconds before applying to eyelids.  Only issue I have with it, is gets clumpy In tube after a couple weeks. And messy on the top of tube. Good product overall.</li>
            <li> excellent-went underwater-lashes stayed on-far superior to ANY other lash adhesive-been wearing lashes for over 30 yrs</li>
            <li> Completely disapointed!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this glue thinking that it would be great but i was completely wrong!! The packaging of the item wasnt sealed properly and when i opened the glue it was completely dry!!! Never buying it again!! I dont recomend it at all!! Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> By far the best eye lash glue I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> I used it with Kiss Sultry fake lashes. I&#x27;m a novice at using fake lashes too. With that said I feel that the glue didn&#x27;t hold the lashes in place for me. Remember I am a novice at this.</li>
            <li> The for itself works well but it clumps up easily and dried out kinda fast. Found dry clumps growing in it after two weeks. Stick with duo lash glue. This isn&#x27;t worth the buy. Cheap glue</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this stuff especially for those times when she wants to wear fake eyelashes with no eyeliner on</li>
            <li> I love wearing false lashes and I do so daily. This is the best adhesive on the market that I have tried. It is one application. Holds all day. Easy to remove at night. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I Really liked this revlon glue for eyelashes!! It worked really well when I applied my lashes long lasting love it</li>
            <li> By far the best eyelashe glue ever. I wear my lashes daily. Fast drying and drys clear. You use a thin line and it stays all day!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life that false eyelashes have become hassle free! I used to give myself about an extra 15 minutes to get around to fight them but now with this adhesive, it takes only one try and they are on the first time! I can BE CONFIDENT that they are not going to start peeling off on either side throughout the day! other glues have dried hard on your skin which pulls at your delicate eyes, or have caused my eyes to burn when applying. This glue is very good for sensitive skin &amp; eyes! I put the glue first along my lash line, then also along the eyelash - wait 20 or so seconds then apply. Sticks the first time! :) A+++</li>
            <li> BEST eyelash glue EVER! I have very sensitive eyes, and this product is by far the BEST. It doesn&#x27;t upset my eyes; no buring or tearing. And the adhesive actually sticks! And stays for 2 days (when applied correctly)</li>
            <li> Held up in the heat of summer easy to use</li>
            <li> I ordered this item, but instead of receiving the item I wanted I received some sort of foundation. I guess I just lost my money down the drain</li>
            <li> One of family members recommended this eyelash glue to me about a year ago so I decided to give it a try &amp; ever since then it has always been my favorite! The adhesive lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling on my lashes. It&#x27;s always my go-to and I always recommend this glue to my friends! If you&#x27;re someone who wears a lot of false eyelashes, I definitely recommend this product! You will love it!</li>
            <li> First and foremost I love this lash glue. At this point I have used a few lash glues, including the ever popular Duo and Ardell glues, so I do have at least some point of reference for comparing this to other glues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I finish giving my opinion, I guess it would help to specify what I wanted in a lash glue. I really wanted to find a glue that would hold throughout the day at work AND if ever wanted to go out, it would hold thicker lashes through dancing and drinks. Simple concept, but it was much harder to actually find a product like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with that being said, I bought two of the Revlon adhesives yesterday and tried it out on a pair of Ardell wispies. These have a very thick, difficult lash band. I had low expectations after the disappointment I had with Duo last week, but surprisingly the Revlon glue held the wispies tight against my lash line, and didn&#x27;t budge. The glue isn&#x27;t matte white, it&#x27;s more of a sheer luminescent white, but it dried completely clear and didn&#x27;t mess up my eyeliner. Also, with Duo and Ardell you have to squeeze the product out of the tube so you can&#x27;t always guarantee that you&#x27;ll only get a little out. At times the adhesive comes pouring out. Also, they both have an absolutely funky smell. I didn&#x27;t smell the Revlon glue, and with the brush applicator, applying what I needed to the lash band was a breeze. It took about 30 seconds for the glue to go tacky, and then I put it on my lashes with no slipping and sliding around. There was absolutely no mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great glue if you are just starting out with falsies, or even if you have been applying them for years. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands, this definitely being one of the bests in my opinion. :)</li>
            <li> Let me just say I love the look of false lashes. I have teeny tiny onces so on big events lashes are a must have. What I don&#x27;t love are peeling corners globs of white stuff stuck to my eyes, my bottom lashes getting all stuck together and glue drying too slowly. This was the answer!&lt;br /&gt;-It has an easy application wand instead of a squeeze tube&lt;br /&gt;-It comes out white but dries clear&lt;br /&gt;-Does not have a funky smell&lt;br /&gt;- Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this with lots of hope that it would keep my lashes holding tight.  Unfortunately, it came to me dried out and completely unusable.  I am so disappointed i wasted my money.  I threw it away the day i received it. Clearly the seller doesn&#x27;t watch expiration dates.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Go to Duo.</li>
            <li> I heard alot about revlon and decided to give this adhesive a try. Came on time. When I went to open it it was hard to open. Finally I managed to open it and it was dried up! I tried to contact the facility. They ignored me. So If I could give this review no stars..I would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have talked to the company and they worked with me to make sure I got the product. I am greatful for the communication and will be buying again from this company soon.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash glue out there by far. Goes on easily,,, holds firmly.</li>
            <li> You will need special eye makeup remover pads to get this off, the type you use for waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> The very BEST eyelash glue. Blue so you can see it, but dries clear. Very easy to apply and holds firmly.</li>
            <li> The Company delivered my item on time&lt;br /&gt;and loved it.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping &amp; perfect lashes glue</li>
            <li> So this was a great idea but the execution wasn&#x27;t up to standard.  It was perfect for the first few uses but after about a week or two the brush got frayed up and it made it difficult to control where the glue was going.  Glue also built up around the top and it just seemed like a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get over how great the glue application was while the brush was still new looking.  But after the brush got worn out it just seemed like more of a hassle then help.  Fix that and this product would be great!  I bought this twice but now I&#x27;m going back to the regular tube.</li>
            <li> Received Item with NO GLUE!!!</li>
            <li> I  wear lashes everyday and I have experimented with several  strip lash adhesives and this is by far the best. Applying glue with the precision the fine brush gives allows you to reach a very natural look. Too much glue can leave a shiny finish even if it dries clear. That doesnt happen with this brand. Lashes stay in place until you take them off. If you sleep in your lashes then the bond will last about 4 days.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Saw a woman using it in a false eyelashes tutorial. But for whatever reason, may it be I was using cheap lashes, when I put the glue on them it turned blue. But it dries clear so that wasn&#x27;t a problem. Doesn&#x27;t smell, sticks very nicely. Love the easy application wand. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The best lash glue I&#x27;ve ever tried! I wish I had tried the dark one sooner though, it really helps everything to blend especially if you are using eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I got these for cosplaying only and to be honest I thought the tube would be a bit bigger but I&#x27;m happy none the less :D It has a strange smell , but it&#x27;s normal for eyelash glue to smell kinda funky right? (.__-&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> When I opened the packaging and bottle the inside was not even usable. It was almost caked up or dried up. I tossed the bottle the day i opened it. I was astonished also on the price as this same product was available at local CVS and TARGET or Walgreens for much much mcuh less cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your time and money!!!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it works great. DUO would peel right off in the middle of my workouts, but this stays put and is actually water proof. I&#x27;m not sure about the negative responses, but I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of years and it&#x27;s great. However, the price here is inflated by at least %100 over normal costs so CVS, Walgreens, or Walmart are much better options for purchase. I would never pay what they&#x27;re asking here. It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I didn&#x27;t expect false eyelasses to be this easy, but with this glue and their lashes, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started wearing false eyelashes, and it&#x27;s been hit or miss  on the finding the right lashes. Now I&#x27;m having issues finding the right adhesive too. I got the Revlon Precision Lash adhesive after reading how is it is latex-free, and while I don&#x27;t have a latex issue, I figure it can&#x27;t be a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush applicator idea - however, the idea doesn&#x27;t work. The adhesive doesn&#x27;t brush on, it drags on from the brush, and not smoothly but in fits and starts and blobs. There&#x27;s no control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container and brush handle and brush itself quickly get gooped up with dried adhesive, even though I quickly close it tight after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive itself is a thin consistency, so I find it&#x27;s not enough to stick to your skin. I have to go over the lash again and again to add enough adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly and most importantly - the adhesive doesn&#x27;t last through the day. Within hours the edges of the lashes are popping up, no matter how little or how much adhesive I tried. It&#x27;s the adhesive itself. Not that sticky I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not mess with this one again. Maybe all adhesives are similarly problematic, I don&#x27;t know, but I will continue to review them as I try them.</li>
            <li> I have tried different lash adhesives and this one was much easier to use, it didn&#x27;t squeeze out all over the place and leave a huge mess around the eyes</li>
            <li> it was first time i wore the false lashes and i was so worried about its glue but it worked perfectly well.. worked for the whole day.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but not great. Product arrivedvl on time w/ no problems. Not my favorite,  but I&#x27;m encouraged to try the dark precision version which I will do</li>
            <li> arrived dried up in one clump. had to toss it</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!!! Amazing!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use at all!! this is the worst adhesive I ever bought. Its like theres no glue at all on the brush and inside. Never buy this, i finally bought duo for mine and it worked perfectly as usual</li>
            <li> Although the package seemed to be sealed, the wand was dry as a bone and the liquid inside was dried out</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews about this product and it is pretty much all that I read upfront about this product. But it is OKAY.</li>
            <li> The glue is easy to apply.  But after multiple use the glue start to built up in the opening making it more difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this  product  for 2 years now and it is in my opinion  much better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I am going through chemo so all my hair fell out again, including my eyelashes and eyebrows.  I started wearing false lashes just to make me feel better about myself, but almost stopped because the glue in those little squirt tubes were awful!  There was no control with where the glue went or how much was being applied, and it would never fail that an air bubble would pop up and get the glue dripping down the rest of the lash.  With this product you put exactly how much glue you want exactly where you want.  It&#x27;s quick, easy, has great hold and will last all day.  I haven&#x27;t slept in them so don&#x27;t know if it would stand up to that.  I actually ordered two more tubes of this so I have it on hand, just in case I can&#x27;t find it again.  Yes it is quite a bit more spendy than the little tubes, but you get what you pay for, and this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is good for people who have allergies. Also, I never have to reapply throughout the day. My lashes stay in place and the product is clear on the eye. It comes out blue but drys clear. The container can get messy and sticky at times if you have too much product coming out. This can be rectified with warm water. I will always use this product.</li>
            <li> This glue is so perfect. It doesn&#x27;t have that fishy smell that Duo has, and it isn&#x27;t very messy. The only problem I have is after a couple weeks of using it, every time you close it, the glue comes out of the bottle. This gets very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays on over night, I actually leave my lashes on all week and they only need minor touch ups on the corners. One other problem, it&#x27;s almost 6 dollars, plus another 3 something for shipping and handling. I would rather drive to cvs and buy it for 4.99 plus tax. [:</li>
            <li> Great product. It keeps lashes in place and adds a great look to makeup.</li>
            <li> Love love love this glue, it lasts more than 24 hours. It&#x27;s the BEST!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone, its easy to apply great for anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this daily for over a year. It stays beautifully, it&#x27;s not thick like the other glues, it&#x27;s transparent and comes off easily. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other glue. It&#x27;s fantastic and lasts and lasts! I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months. I buy a new one every 5 months or so and use it daily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, It makes it so easy to put the glue on your false eyelashes. I will never go back to the tube glue</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff and apprently so do many others as the few locations we can find nearby that sell it, sell out quickly! The price is about the same as we pay locally and it comes straight to the house no need to go searching! She has tried almost every similar product on the market and for her this is the best she can find!</li>
            <li> love this! this is the best i have tried! works great</li>
            <li> Great product. No mess!</li>
            <li> works well, holds well</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get a clear glue for my falsies. I currently use black, and although it works awesome, it&#x27;s a real pain in the rear to keep the stuff on the eyelashes and off of your eyelid, forehead, fingers, cheeks, nose... you get the picture. I&#x27;ve only tried this product once, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the adhesion that my black glue does. I&#x27;ve tried putting it on lightly, medium and pretty heavy. I tried putting it on while fresh and wet and putting it on after it became tacky. It just doesn&#x27;t stick as well or as long as the black glue.</li>
            <li> Good alternative to tube glue - a LOT easier to use.</li>
            <li> I personally noticed a difference between white eyelash glues and translucent eyelash glues with opal coloring to them. The consistency, hold, and drying times are different. I just prefer the translucent ones.</li>
            <li> Best glue I&#x27;ve used yet</li>
            <li> Love this best ever easy to use I had got this at alco for 4 dollars or 5 but its worth it i slept with it n it was still on like when I put them on the first time I would tell every one to get this will buy agin</li>
