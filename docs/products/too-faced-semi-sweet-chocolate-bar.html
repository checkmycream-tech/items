            <li>Awesome authentic product</li>
            <li>But this one is also perfect as an addition, more in the neutral-brown range (warm+cool) +</li>

            <li>This is an amazing pallet.</li>
            <li>a nice blue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well more like a hot cocoa chocolate but still delicious.</li>
            <li>Also it arrived a day early and the colors are BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Colors names are written on the palette and not on a separated sheet (more practical!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it and it smells delish</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s supposed to be a &#x27;top coat&#x27; for any color</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the versatility of this palette.</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>Some colors are more glittery and others.  </li>
            <li>I just love the colors, the scent and the packaging.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an irredescent top coat to colors of you</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted some more color choices so that&#x27;s why I ordered this.</li>
            <li>I really love my semi sweet chocolate bar palette!</li>
            <li>I am a huge makeup lover, and this is my most used makeup palette.</li>
            <li>This pallet is also very amazing for sensitive skin since it is made from cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the original Chocolate Bar was better than this one.</li>
            <li>But all the other colors are just perfect and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Colors are really easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who loves neutrals but also beautiful deep colors.</li>
            <li>I got the Semi Sweet and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really show up on my skin at all and felt kind of grainy.</li>
            <li>I like that there are two larger highlight shades, and one is a warm matte and one a warm shimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful smoky Grey color.</li>
            <li>When I swatched the color on my skin, they were all super beautiful except PinkSugar which is a really light sparkly pink color.</li>
            <li>I love nude palettes that have browns and more natural colors.</li>
            <li>Bon Bon is a beautiful rose gold shade, similar to the shades in the Naked 3 palette.</li>
            <li>pigments are very strong and colorful, they blend very smoothl</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this palette.</li>
            <li>However, besides that one color, all the rest of the colors are very creamy and blend able.</li>
            <li>personally use my original chocolate palette more because it permits more colors combinations.  </li>
            <li>You can take your look from cute, and sweet to dark and sexy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but in my opinion, worth it.</li>
            <li>I preferred the colors in this palette to the original&#x27;s, definitely a lot more warmer tones in this one.</li>
            <li>I stay an absolute fan of Too Faced palettes and have a lot, including the original chocolate bar palette.  </li>
            <li>But other then that I am very pleased with this palette and think it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I appreciated that this came super wrapped in bubble wrap</li>
            <li>I have the first Too Faced chocolate bar</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it when I saw it, but it&#x27;s very wearable and pretty.</li>
            <li>Would prefer it come with an applicator, but the slight chocolate smell is nice.</li>
            <li>all seem to have good color pay off when swatches except for the shade called pink sugar.. it barely shows up at all on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very versatile pallet and has colors for every skin color and skin type.</li>
            <li>The lasting power is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It think it smells like a mix of vanilla and chocolate, which I think is better than a dark chocolate scent.</li>
            <li>The palette does smell like chocolate which I thought was a little unusal but overall smells good.</li>
            <li>The darker colors are a little harder to blend out, but still very nice.</li>
            <li>This one is good, but not great.</li>
            <li>The smell alone makes you want to dive right in, until you remember that it&#x27;s not actual chocolate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend if you are looking for a new palette.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this pallet to anyone who has sensitive eyes or anyone who needs an eye shadow that&#x27;ll last all day.</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s barely any fall out when using even the darkest of shades in this palette.</li>
            <li>I love creating anything from simple to dramatic looks with this palette.</li>

            <li> ; the pink color is very disappointing, it doesn&#x27;t transfer on the eye even with a MAC Fix+.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this palette. The colors are beautiful and pigmented and look great on any skin tone. I would recommend this to anyone who loves neutrals but also beautiful deep colors. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the quality is amazing!</li>
            <li> Omg i love this palette! Every color is gorgeous and just for those who want to know yes it does smell like chocolate. Well more like a hot cocoa chocolate but still delicious. The colors are so beautifully pigmented and buttery  iv had no fallout from any of these shadows either. I will defi itly buy again</li>
            <li> Love this palette, it even smells like chocolate!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing pallet. I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon but I did from Sephora. When I swatched the color on my skin, they were all super beautiful except PinkSugar which is a really light sparkly pink color. It didn&#x27;t really show up on my skin at all and felt kind of grainy. However, besides that one color, all the rest of the colors are very creamy and blend able. The darker colors are a little harder to blend out, but still very nice. When used with a primer, these eye shadows will defiantly last all day long. This pallet is also very amazing for sensitive skin since it is made from cocoa powder. I didn&#x27;t experience ant burning or discomfort even when I fell asleep with it on. This is a very versatile pallet and has colors for every skin color and skin type. I highly reccomend this pallet to anyone who has sensitive eyes or anyone who needs an eye shadow that&#x27;ll last all day.</li>

            <li> Love it! My favorite! It smells so good!</li>
            <li> I love this palette. My boyfriend bought it for me as a gift. I love nude palettes that have browns and more natural colors. If you&#x27;re a fan of the naked palettes you will like this one. Colors are really easy to apply and lasts all day. Some colors are more glittery and others.  The palette does smell like chocolate which I thought was a little unusal but overall smells good. I would recommend if you are looking for a new palette.</li>
            <li> I just love the colors, the scent and the packaging.  It&#x27;s pricey but in my opinion, worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a must have palette! I have Urban Decay&#x27;s NAKED 1, 2, &amp; 3 and they don&#x27;t compare to the Chocolate Bar palettes. I got the Semi Sweet and am so glad I did. Photos don&#x27;t do any justice for how beautiful the shades are. It think it smells like a mix of vanilla and chocolate, which I think is better than a dark chocolate scent. Everyone complains about the shade Pink Sugar, saying it is not pigmented. It&#x27;s not supposed to be. It&#x27;s an irredescent top coat to colors of you want to jazz up the matte shades. I love it. Also, the shade Blueberry Swirl does not show up as blue on the skin. It&#x27;s a beautiful smoky Grey color. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it when I saw it, but it&#x27;s very wearable and pretty. So so happy!</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND IT 100% !!!! FELL IN LOVE WITH IT!!!</li>
            <li> The BEST eyeshadow palette I have ever owned or used. Also it arrived a day early and the colors are BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, all shadows in tacked, none are broken. all seem to have good color pay off when swatches except for the shade called pink sugar.. it barely shows up at all on my skin. But other then that I am very pleased with this palette and think it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wife is very happy with this.  It&#x27;s her second set and she likes them both.</li>
            <li> My eye shadow came earlier than expected! I have the first Too Faced chocolate bar and I love it. I wanted some more color choices so that&#x27;s why I ordered this. I appreciated that this came super wrapped in bubble wrap so it was not damaged!</li>
