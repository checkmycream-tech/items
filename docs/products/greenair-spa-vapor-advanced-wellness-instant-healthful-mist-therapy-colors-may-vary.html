            <li>Quality of this diffuser is very good.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and they were very good about saying they would send me another one.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very good about the return.</li>
            <li>and it does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>The product works as stated and provides surprisingly a very good amount of vapor.</li>
            <li>Great diffuser and great company!  </li>
            <li>I have an $80 diffuser from Amazon and it has worked beautifully for 6 months.</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, and it won&#x27;t run longer that 3 hours max, but it diffuses beautifully.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working perfectly!Very very pleased with product!</li>
            <li>Great for diffusing my DoTerra oils.</li>
            <li>and they all work great except I had to return one because&lt;br /&gt;it was defective and shorted out.</li>
            <li>It still works great.</li>
            <li>Great way to relax.</li>
            <li>This is a great diffuser for the price.</li>
            <li>It gets great reviews, but I don&#x27;t get the hype.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, I needed 2 and the price is great on this diffuser</li>
            <li>Works great, great price</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It worked great for one month, and conveniently quit working 4 days after the return window expired.  </li>
            <li>So if you just need a diffuser for one month, it&#x27;s great, but then quits working.</li>

            <li>This difusser worked great, while it worked.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s own, basically operates as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still looking for an effective long-lasting diffuser</li>
            <li>Also, the automatic shut off is a nice feature.  </li>

            <li>The colors are nice</li>
            <li>It travels nicely.</li>
            <li>You can use what ever kind of aromatherapy oil you want in the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked it while it worked</li>
            <li>and I can honestly see some change ..for one thing..</li>
            <li>Amazon has been so great to replace them immediately and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Awesome first ime diffuser love it.</li>
            <li>Using Plant Therapy EOS in it and enjoy that I can diffuse in the morning, leave the house for hours and come home to find it still smelling amazing!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does the job!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong!  </li>
            <li>love, love, love  diffusing my oils with this!</li>

            <li>First, it&#x27;s a great price, Second, it looks nice and the best thing about it is that it turns itself off when water/oil are gone.</li>
            <li>This is our first diffuser, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Seems very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and with a couple of drops of lavender oil, my house smells amazing.</li>
            <li>received our order quickly and everything arrived in good order</li>
            <li>The mist is nice and strong.</li>
            <li>It is very nice looking and pretty colors</li>
            <li>and you will get some amazing fine mist.  </li>
            <li>They are really nice and helpful and QUICK!</li>
            <li>This oil diffuser emits a fine mist (without the moisture) into the air, thereby producing a nice and passive therapeutic session each time you run it.</li>
            <li>I love it even more because it lasts about 4 hours and works great in a large room.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you read and follow the directions to a tee.</li>
            <li>I love the automatic  shut-off feature.</li>
            <li>a pan of water on the stove top would work better than these things.)</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t diffuse for as great any area as I hoped, but it was good for next to the bed.  </li>
            <li>I am into aromatherapy and  I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am able to put in any oil and the scent fills my bedroom.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for diffusing essential oils.  </li>
            <li>The one that DOES work seems to be okay.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I have the option to shut them off.</li>
            <li>Works well for healthy mist with doTerra oils.  </li>
            <li>This thing is okay.  </li>
            <li>I love that it uses tap water (don&#x27;t have to purchase distilled water).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to be able to run it for 6+ hours at a time.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I are both enjoying it.</li>
            <li>but he was able to fix them himself.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention how much we love these...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Perhaps I could use more.</li>
            <li>as what I would like - I have another brand that is much better</li>
            <li>I have replaced with a better diffuser that works.</li>
            <li>It works so good that it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a hole in the top rim, if you get water in it the unit burns out.</li>
            <li>pouring out any excess water, make sure that the hole is on the top, pour out and then use a q-tip to get any drops that remain in the top ridge so that any moisture does not run into the hole.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Love that you can turn lights off our on.  </li>
            <li>I thought there will be more mist coming out from this vapor,&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Has a cute interchanges light too!</li>
            <li>I love the product when it works, but they just quit working.</li>
            <li>put essential oil in it and it produces a wonderful amount of steam and</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This has become my most favorite thing in my home.  </li>
            <li>It has more than done everything I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I like the swivel nozzle at the top.</li>
            <li>It works wonderful for aromatherapy with essential oils added to the water.</li>

            <li>cheaply made!  </li>
            <li>I used it most all of the day.....</li>

            <li>Loved this when I first got it, but it stopped working after 10 uses.  </li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, but for the price I think it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I loved this for the first week.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product at first.</li>
            <li>Everybody wants their own!</li>
            <li>Worked good at first, but died after about 5 months.</li>
            <li>I loved mine for the 2 days that it worked, but after that not so much!</li>
            <li>Love the function of being able to turn off the light when I want to sleep with the mist still running.</li>
            <li>A very affordable option but still effectively diffuses Eos nicely.  </li>
            <li>I consider it to be such a great handy appliance..</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and to run.</li>
            <li>My kids love using this as a night light.</li>
            <li>so enjoy putting any amount of moisture in the air and scented is better.</li>
            <li>It is a great tool in an all natural (or trying to be) household.</li>
            <li>Just plugged in my diffuser and so far so great.</li>
            <li>Works great for near my workstation or on the nightstand.</li>
            <li>Love the light colors and the auto shutoff.</li>
            <li>I use it at night with lavender essential oil to help promote a good nights sleep!  </li>
            <li>did have problems with the first one we ordered, but customer service with Greenair was outstanding!  </li>
            <li>very good product with light or mist only option</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate &amp; maintain.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill, you can adjust where you want the mist to disburse.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to use, turns off when out of water.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and runs for hours.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with this product and would highly recommend for it&#x27;s price</li>
            <li>The replacement has been working fine.  </li>
            <li>the unit works fine</li>
            <li>cause it does not put out a fine mist not like a humidifyer which is what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Worked fine but eventually broke.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to transport from room to room.</li>
            <li>Worked just fine for about 3 weeks-</li>
            <li>I let mine air dry after use with the top off)... really easy to care for and a great investment if you take care of it.</li>
            <li>The lights work fine</li>
            <li>I recommend if you are searching for a good quality long lasting diffuser this one will be perfect.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but I like to sleep in the pitch black and the fact that I can turn the light off makes this perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and you don&#x27;t have to have the light on.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I got this item as i wanted an extra one for upstairs</li>
            <li>Then one day I plugged it in and the light flashed and smoke started to come out from underneath the diffuser.</li>
            <li>Cheap but works well.</li>
            <li>These work great for essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Set up was simple and it works great.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it.</li>
            <li>you can have the led light on that change colors</li>
            <li>Has an on/off button and a light changing button.</li>
            <li>Light can be turned off.</li>
            <li>The product itself is made of cheap materials.</li>
            <li>and I find the LED light relaxing.</li>
            <li>I like sound that it makes</li>
            <li>Also, the light feature is optional.  </li>
            <li>This is a great essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really simple to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>The changing light is so calming.</li>
            <li>The multicolor changing LED light is calming, but can be turned off when not needed/wanted.  </li>
            <li>It works great in diffusing the essential oils in the room.  </li>
            <li>Great way to diffuse my DoTerra essential oils.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, it is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>At just around $30 (and free shipping)</li>
            <li>this diffuser filled the need.  </li>
            <li>I filled it with water &amp; oil, to find out that it did not work at all.  </li>
            <li>Works great with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>You can see it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I work in the essential oil industry and have used many different diffusers from many companies and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the lights and the mist that this diffuser provides.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need the light changing colors</li>
            <li>The light will come on but the diffuser will not come on any longer.</li>
            <li>The unit is so fabulous that I&#x27;d still keep</li>
            <li>but still no mist, just the light is working thats all.  </li>
            <li>This is great for diffusing essential oils.</li>
            <li>It does its job and together with the use of essential oils its great..</li>
            <li>In terms of appearance..it has a bit of a cheap look but it works..</li>
            <li>it gives the room a nice feel..a real sense of relaxation</li>
            <li>If you want to diffuse essential oils in your home this diffuser is great.</li>
            <li>Set up is fast and simple, and the Spa Vapor is the perfect size for any surface.  </li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Our daughters were still in cribs, everything should have been fine, but it most certainly was not!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and the lights are fun!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a month now, daily, and love it!!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and as long as you use something else to pour the water into the diffuser instead of putting it under the faucet and keep it clean, this should work great for you.</li>
            <li>Luckily I saved my receipt and plan to return it, but I can&#x27;t believe a product could be sold like this that so easily breaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been an awesome little diffuser!  </li>
            <li>The kids enjoy being able to stop the light on a certain color for the night, and I like how I can run it until the water is done</li>
            <li>Have bought three of these (also as gifts) because I love them so much!</li>
            <li>the original goes.  </li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser and I love it.</li>
            <li>We like the light, cool mist</li>
            <li>received the product and was excited to use it.</li>
            <li>Below you will see my original review....</li>
            <li>The aroma is not overwhelming and also works excellent for therapeutic reasons</li>
            <li>I love the pretty colors (which you can turn off if you want to), and you can see it going into the air.</li>
            <li>This was not part of my original order, so maybe they realized that lack of cleaning was causing problems.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a small room or office.  </li>
            <li>it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I clean it often and take care of it.</li>
            <li>Quiet and nice stream of mist is aim- able</li>
            <li>It is a pain to have to clean it every two hours before I can run it again.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t clean out the diffuser every time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like having to clean it out after each use.</li>
            <li>I do clean it as suggested after each use</li>
            <li>It is powerful for it&#x27;s size, and so easy to care for.</li>
            <li>it can be tricky to clean around them between uses.  </li>
            <li>Who has time to suit and clean a diffuser every day.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the spa vaporizer in order to provide a clean background smell during our house showings.</li>
            <li>Just clean the bowl with vinigar after every use and it will work well for you.</li>
            <li>far though, I love it!</li>
            <li>I wish it could put more water vapor into the air, but I think it does a great job for a small device.</li>
            <li>This unit worked great the first several times, but about 10 minutes into the sixth time I used it, it quit working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found an inexpensive difuser that works like one twice as much.</li>
            <li>cool mist with the option to add oils to help or deliver heath benefits</li>
            <li>and it really helps me to breathe better at night.</li>
            <li>They love the changing colors for the night light, and I love the way they sleep with the essential oils diffusing.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good product that does the job.</li>
            <li>Thanks I am going to order more</li>
            <li>Initially, I loved this product and used it daily.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow the directions when it comes to the fill line, too much water, and it will not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love the very fine mist  </li>
            <li>Love the diffuser - easy to use and good for small space, like a bedroom.</li>
            <li>This diffuser really puts out the mist and I love the light changes but also love that I can turn off the lights completely for sleeping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I appreciate being able to keep the light off, since the other style I have keeps the whole room too bright.  </li>
            <li>After trials with a different &amp; quite costly essential oil diffuser, the Greenair Spa Vapor is a very welcome item in our household.  </li>
            <li>It is simple with no extra bells and whistles, but it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably spend 20$ more for a better quality one next.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who diffuses oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very important to clean it frequently to keep it from getting sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and has the power to give you a fantastic night of sleep if you use it with some essential oils.</li>
            <li>I had one of these previously and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I have searched and reviewed for the perfect long lasting ultra sonic diffuser.</li>
            <li>Even if it did, the price is so reasonable, it can easily be replaced.  </li>
            <li>Buyer be aware!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love to buy a few more to have it in each rooms !</li>
            <li>I probably need to buy a few more to cover more area!  </li>
            <li>received my replacement readily and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>BUT THE CHANGING LIGHTS ARE FANTASTIC AND PUT MY DOTERRA CERTIFIED PURE THERAPEUTIC GRADE OILS</li>
            <li>Great little item.  </li>
            <li>Great little diffuser.</li>
            <li>It might work great for a few uses, but then stops and either won&#x27;t produce mist or just won&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
            <li>It seems to spread the fragrance around so lightly that I can&#x27;t really smell the oil I have put in it.</li>
            <li>and well the light is working now, so really?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to loving my diffusers again and based on the soldering job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have an extra, since my daughter and I both like oils diffused in our rooms at night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and pumps out a nice steam so it moisturizes the air a bit.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as others but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The led lighting is a nice touch but not necessary for our intensions.</li>
            <li>worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>After reading more online reviews of this product we shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve spent many a day enjoying the peacefulness of this aromatherapy mist machine.</li>
            <li>From everything I&#x27;ve read the machine averages about 4 hours worth of dispensing time if you fill the water to the fill line, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s closer to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I only cleaned it once since I got this and used room temperature reverse osmosis water, not tap warm water like it said to do in the instructions.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser works great at first, but then it quit diffusing in less than 2 months...</li>
            <li>It worked great, made my apartment smell amazing, and although the color changing lights are a little cheesy, I liked them!</li>
            <li>As long as the machine does not crap out in the near future I will be a happy customer!!!</li>
            <li>They did make it right with me.</li>
            <li>Diffusing serenity right now and my dog</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t detect the smell unless you put your nose right up against the machine.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem like much vapor is coming out, but for the price its not bad.</li>
            <li>We had a problem with the first one we got, so I called the eight hundred number on the instructions and the sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>this is ok - doesn&#x27;t put off near as much vapor</li>
            <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t come straight out the top is an added bonus for me because i can point it directly at me if i prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It dispenses enough to fill the classroom, it runs for 4-5 hours and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>One thing I really like better compared to my old spa vapor</li>
            <li>The aroma was strong and  you can direct the mist.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and clean, and it performs quietly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I love this adorable little thing so much!</li>
            <li>It is a good little unit for aromatherapy therapy.  </li>
            <li>I loved this little diffuser at first</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good little diffuser for the money.</li>
            <li>This is an edit to my first review:After I posted the first review the company contacted me and sent out replacements of the diffusers I bought.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last more than a month</li>
            <li>The lights are still pretty, but no mist is coming out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>but am aware that it does it now so no longer a bother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the first one that I bought.  </li>
            <li>I yanked it off of the shelf and ran it outside where it remained until my husband tested it to make sure it was truly malfunctioning and proceeded to throw it away.</li>
            <li>Put in tap water (along with your favorite essential oil) and you&#x27;re all set.  </li>
            <li>Diffusing essential oils has never been easier and more affordable.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Can use lights and diffuser at the same time or use as just a night light!</li>
            <li>This is my first experience using a spa diffuser and truth be told, I have no idea if this is working or not.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering a couple more to give as presents later this year.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it never worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I used it for more than three hours total.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own when it&#x27;s empty too.</li>
            <li>There is no noise, just a lovely wafting fragrance of whatever essential oil I have opted to use.....</li>
            <li>I hope the second one works better.</li>
            <li>I like that this doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>My first greenair was a gift</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for several months and love it.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I said I was interested</li>
            <li>My kids love the way it lights up and all the different colors it makes.</li>
            <li>than that I love this vaporizer especially when used with lavender</li>
            <li>I only wish it held more water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be exactly what I wanted if it worked.</li>
            <li>I ordered the first one, it arrived and the first night I noticed the \\&quot;off\\&quot; button did not work.  </li>
            <li>The first night the mist would not even work.  </li>
            <li>It is small but people notice a good feeling right when they walk in.  </li>
            <li>There are special yet simple instructions on how to properly clean and care for this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Also be sure to keep it on a flat surface with no cloth placemat or anything underneath that could block the airflow of the fan and cause it to stop working.</li>
            <li>They work beautifully and great for going to sleep at night and for when cold season hits!!</li>
            <li>I own the Aroma Ace which is really expensive, works amazing but does not shoot out the mist.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I bought this second one in case</li>
            <li>I really did love it while it lasted using it with do terra essential oils.</li>
            <li>I will try to call the manufacturer and hope for positive results.</li>
            <li>I also saw the positive reviews though, and decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li>Great but a little hassle to clean every single use</li>
            <li>better than expected; seems to aid our sleep; sometimes the lights provide an entertaining backdrop; if the lights annoy, we simply flip a switch to turn them off.</li>
            <li>I really likes this diffuser when I first received it</li>
            <li>that was supposed to go in the top, so haven&#x27;t used it in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It works great, I can smell the essential oils, so far I&#x27;ve only used lavender, the unit operates for about four hours, turns off on</li>
            <li>It only takes one drop of essential oil and my whole room smells good .</li>
            <li>This unit is also small and lightweight, which is always a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to put 5 drops of my favorite essential oil in the water and it helps calm and focus my Autistic children with their school work.  </li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use and so silent.</li>
            <li>Turns off automatically when water level is low and color changing lights can easily be turned off.  </li>
            <li>I add essential oils to the water and it fills the room very quickly.</li>
            <li>6/13/13:  Very soon after posting this positive review, my unit stopped producing mist.  </li>
            <li>I saw other diffusers for much more money, but these have been doing exactly what</li>
            <li>Luckily I remembered the blog and went back and located the fix post and after following his instructions I was able to fix both of my diffusers in about 20 mins.  </li>
            <li>It gives off instant mist and fills a room quickly!  </li>
            <li>I ordered another one because I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t  clean the first one enough.  </li>
            <li>Not only because it has actually lasted but the amount of vapor it releases is amazing.</li>
            <li>My children actually ask to turn the light on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really finicky about how much water you put in.  </li>
            <li>If you put in too much water, it won&#x27;t diffuse at all.  </li>
            <li>but, the ac adapter that you plug into the wall makes a high pitched squealing noise witch defeats the purpose of using a diffuser for relaxation!</li>
            <li>Love the diffuser, shuts itself off when the water is empty which is a plus</li>
            <li>so much so that we bought 2.</li>
            <li>Works very well very sturdy</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vapor really shoots out</li>
            <li>let it run for 4 hours straight</li>
            <li>I really like Greenair Spa Vapor machine.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>I use this machine in my bedroom with lavender oil and it really helps me to fall asleep and stay sleeping.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold much water (about a cup), but it doesn&#x27;t take much space either.  </li>
            <li>I could not return it because I didn&#x27;t unbox it and use it until after I moved--- too much time had passed.</li>
            <li>I love how it automatically shuts off once the tank is empty.</li>
            <li>I really like the color changing and the auto-shut off.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>The changing light color was the only thing that seemed to work the way it was meant to.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say from a medical standpoint if it works, but it does soothe him and helps him feel secure when he goes to bed.  </li>
            <li>Works very well&#x27;</li>
            <li>I was really exited to get and use this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend the one from NOW, It is shaped like a cone, and it works very well each and every time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this about a month now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>It makes me very &amp;#34;Smiley&amp;#34;, hint hint.  </li>
            <li>Did not scent the room very well.</li>
            <li>I like that you can change the direction of the mist with out having to move the whole machine.</li>
            <li>It is very durable</li>
            <li>Did not seem to do much.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very portable, so I sometimes bring it from one room to another.</li>
            <li>This item only worked most of the time at the beginning and by a month in, it&#x27;s completely shot.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I am about to order my fourth, I have not had any issues with any that I have purchased thus far.  </li>
            <li>Writing the review to warn others … DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$!!!</li>
            <li>You do have to be sure to clean off the little ceramic disk at the inside bottom with a little brush in between uses with vinegar and water ( or the essential oils could build up and clog it) and make sure not to clean the sensor because that is what indicates the water level and auto</li>
            <li>I had an issue with my first spa vapor and they sent me a new one with no issues.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these very soon to have them in other rooms of the house.</li>
            <li>LIke many other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>We originally bought 2 of these, and one instantly began to gurgle and spit.  </li>
            <li>I bought other diffusers that work way better then this...</li>
            <li>Love this little machine, quiet, portable, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I do clean it between uses to ensure it continues to work properly.</li>
            <li>The key to this diffuser as with all the others keep it clean</li>
            <li>I clean it out daily</li>
            <li>The company, Green air, gave me awesome, unbelievable customer service and worked with me to get my Spa Vapor working.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is amazingly simple.</li>
            <li>It works really well and quickly fills the room with the smells of my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>It does make some sound, but is pretty quiet in general.</li>
            <li>I liked to diffuse lavender in the nursery each night when we put the girls to bed and turned it off before I went to bed ( usually 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they last the full 8 hours, but usually they go off in 4-6 on their own.</li>
            <li>The first one i bought was young living $100 and that one stopped working within 3 months.</li>
            <li>It fits in a small space and diffuses nicely.  </li>
            <li>I actually loved this little thing...while it worked, which was only about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Light is soft enough to use for bedtime.</li>
            <li>I returned and received back 3 more, all with the same defect, so will not be purchasing again.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a lot of fancy features, but an inexpensive diffuser with decent quality.  </li>
            <li>But this would be better if it were a larger tank and would last longer than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>The lights work on both of them, the mist starts quickly on one but doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent diffuser.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be a pain to have to clean it so often, but it&#x27;s really quite easy - just put in the water and white vinegar, let it sit for 15 or 20 minutes, then use the little brush.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this greenair spa diffuser.</li>
            <li>I wish it held a little more water, but even a cup lasts about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I should have just spent the extra money and bought the Young Living diffuser, which I now have and absolutely love it (the YL diffuser)!</li>
            <li>Love this little vaporizer.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have ask for any thing more of this little item.</li>
            <li>like that you have option off turning the lights off of the machine while it&#x27;s running, because I find them a little bit obnoxious (although my kids love them).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about buying another one to put up in my kids room as I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different oils that can help fight off germs and calm the child (I have a son with autism).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had read many of the reviews that said this diffuser didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>This is an economical way to diffuse essential oils.  </li>
            <li>so well at first I am very ashamed that I told several people to buy this product</li>
            <li>I hope it lasts more than a few months this time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I may have to order a few more.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for reasonably priced diffuser, just goes to prove that it doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive to be good!</li>
            <li>We called the company numerous times, they said they would make it right with me and never did.</li>
            <li>I keep it right next to my bed at night.</li>
            <li>Also, you had to sit right next to the diffuser to smell the oil fragrance</li>
            <li>We had it a little more than 7 months before it completely terrified us.</li>
            <li>I love the amount of cool quiet thick vapor that comes flowing out.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert</li>
            <li>and they said they would send a new one that day which never arrived....</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected especially for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>Love this little diffuser!  </li>
            <li>I bought one 4 months ago and it has been running very frequently with no problems.  </li>
            <li>(The following is the first review....</li>
            <li>My first one quit working is why I purchased a second one.</li>
            <li>I love the choices of oils to use and the small is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>While I love their oils and other products, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending the extra money on their brand of diffuser, so I bought this.</li>
            <li>but after following all instructions exactly unit would not power up.</li>
            <li>I first saw this diffuser at a local health and wellness shop.  </li>
            <li>You add tap water and essential oils and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I ordered three more and had to return two of the three within a few weeks!</li>
            <li>I bought a second one after my first one died but it died as well.</li>
            <li>My first was from a friend that had bought several for gifting...</li>
            <li>This vaporizer only worked correctly the first 2 times I used it.</li>
            <li>only problem is the &amp;#34;fill water line&amp;#34; marker is a sticker and it fell off after first use.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily for two weeks and the lights the change colors is not working as well as went first received.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I suggest is to use full strength White Vinegar during the cleaning process.</li>
            <li>I am almost positive they are the same company.</li>
            <li>All of the other colors are so cool and soothing.</li>
            <li>While I did order a clean air vaporizer it was supposed to come in the dark gray color shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Apparently some of the units that had a range of older production dates did have a flaw.</li>
            <li>I have since gotten a bigger one because I have a large room.</li>
            <li>They dont last very long but for the price, its okay ... i use for my young living essential oils.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first when I read other reviews, but it&#x27;s works great, and has improved my asthma.</li>
            <li>if you are not going to be using it everyday be sure to clean it out ( vinegar and water ) and dry it so it does not mold (be careful not to touch the sensor -</li>
            <li>The vapor really &#x27;pours&#x27; out, but I wish the smell would go further and linger longer.</li>
            <li>Very finicky and eventually struggles to vaporize even after following the cleaning regime.</li>
            <li>I used it frequently, probably once a day.  </li>
            <li>Just got it a day early in the mail.</li>
            <li>The lighting feature is an appreciated extra.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews but &#x27;gambled&#x27; and bought 2 of these, hoping at least one of them would be OK.  </li>
            <li>Overall I really like the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>and it really makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>I wanted a few more diffusers to have in different rooms in the house but at nearly $90 each I could not afford that.  </li>
            <li>I finally found an instrument that really helps my breathing.  </li>
            <li>My one year old nephew loves the color changing lights.</li>
            <li>Will definitely not waste my money anymore on this brand.</li>
            <li>I tried it again, with the same results,I was really looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li>No problems with this item thus far, &amp;</li>
            <li>It came, was obnoxiously loud with some &amp;#34;clicking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I would expect it to last much longer for that amount of use.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this diffuser mists the essential oils and water.  </li>
            <li>(my old one make a humming noise).</li>
            <li>Just fill with water to the clearly marked line and add a few drops of your favorite essential oils.  </li>
            <li>The colors are soft and pleasing.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t smell any of the essential oil I used, and I used a very premium grade oil.</li>
            <li>I was nervous after some of the negative reviews, but I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 2 months now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The replacement came with a small cleaning tool and instructions to clean with hot water and vinegar daily.  </li>
            <li>I like the wood looking one from Now Foods better, even if the water container is a little strange.</li>
            <li>Much too small a quantity to be useful.</li>
            <li>the room has a steady scent of the oils for several hours.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how much more I will be ordering from Amazon as the two products I ordered at the same time</li>
            <li>I will start by saying that this is the first diffuser that I have ever purchased, so I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference between this and a more expensive machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other reviews that talk about the mister not working is right on the money.</li>
            <li>I was very careful to follow the directions and clean it regularly.  </li>
            <li>major bummer!  </li>
            <li>The ultrasonic mist quickly delivers essential oils into the air just as expected.  </li>
            <li>I bought this diffuser and I have no regrets so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a week but have used it pretty much constantly since I purchased it (3 times a day for several hours each time).</li>
            <li>I unplug, clean out, refill and try again, usually it works...</li>
            <li>I bought them directly from the Greenair company in order to resale but an entire case of them didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Plus it barely pooped steam.</li>
            <li>You can barely smell it...</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t bigger to hold more water.</li>
            <li>but the vapour is barely there.</li>
            <li>I had this product for barely over a month and it will no longer work.</li>
            <li>Do not fill past water line and clean on regular basis for longer life</li>
            <li>Product is not as dark in color as depicted, which is a positive in my book.  </li>
            <li>to clean often with vinegar to remove hard water scale (it comes with instructions and a cleaning brush)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish there weren&#x27;t so many different items on Amazon that all seemed the same but had different prices and different pictures which makes it confusing.  </li>
            <li>The tank is not big enough to hold much water, so it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>The lights in a dark room are very relaxing and meditating.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the red light.  </li>
            <li>Apparently these units just aren&#x27;t meant to last.  </li>
            <li>I intended to return, signed on and discovered that it was no long eligible for a return.  </li>
            <li>after one use it barely produced any aroma and did not work at all the second time.</li>
            <li>Not really wanting to order a new one at the cost.</li>
            <li>Stopped working after just a few uses, exchanged for a new one and had the same problem with the new one.</li>
            <li>The first one stopped working within a week despite following the cleaning and trouble shooting guidelines.  </li>
            <li>I have found if i fill it a little UNDER the recommended amount that the vapor is much stronger.</li>
            <li>I should have listened to the bad reviews instead of the one good one at Learning About Essential Oils.  </li>

            <li> and it does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> The product works as stated and provides surprisingly a very good amount of vapor.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser and great company!  </li>
            <li> I have an $80 diffuser from Amazon and it has worked beautifully for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, and it won&#x27;t run longer that 3 hours max, but it diffuses beautifully.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working perfectly!Very very pleased with product!</li>
            <li> Great for diffusing my DoTerra oils.</li>
            <li> and they all work great except I had to return one because&lt;br /&gt;it was defective and shorted out.</li>
            <li> It still works great.</li>
            <li> Great way to relax.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser for the price.</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, I needed 2 and the price is great on this diffuser</li>
            <li> Works great, great price</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> It worked great for one month, and conveniently quit working 4 days after the return window expired.  </li>
            <li> So if you just need a diffuser for one month, it&#x27;s great, but then quits working.</li>

            <li> I liked it while it worked</li>
            <li> and I can honestly see some change ..for one thing..</li>
            <li> Amazon has been so great to replace them immediately and so far so good!</li>

            <li> First, it&#x27;s a great price, Second, it looks nice and the best thing about it is that it turns itself off when water/oil are gone.</li>
            <li> This is our first diffuser, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Seems very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and with a couple of drops of lavender oil, my house smells amazing.</li>
            <li> received our order quickly and everything arrived in good order</li>
            <li> The mist is nice and strong.</li>
            <li> It is very nice looking and pretty colors</li>
            <li> and you will get some amazing fine mist.  </li>
            <li> They are really nice and helpful and QUICK!</li>
            <li> This oil diffuser emits a fine mist (without the moisture) into the air, thereby producing a nice and passive therapeutic session each time you run it.</li>
            <li> I love it even more because it lasts about 4 hours and works great in a large room.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you read and follow the directions to a tee.</li>
            <li> I love the automatic  shut-off feature.</li>
            <li> a pan of water on the stove top would work better than these things.)</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t diffuse for as great any area as I hoped, but it was good for next to the bed.  </li>
            <li> I am into aromatherapy and  I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am able to put in any oil and the scent fills my bedroom.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for diffusing essential oils.  </li>
            <li> The one that DOES work seems to be okay.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I have the option to shut them off.</li>
            <li> Works well for healthy mist with doTerra oils.  </li>
            <li> This thing is okay.  </li>
            <li> I love that it uses tap water (don&#x27;t have to purchase distilled water).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to be able to run it for 6+ hours at a time.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I are both enjoying it.</li>
            <li> but he was able to fix them himself.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention how much we love these...</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Perhaps I could use more.</li>
            <li> as what I would like - I have another brand that is much better</li>
            <li> I have replaced with a better diffuser that works.</li>
            <li> It works so good that it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a hole in the top rim, if you get water in it the unit burns out.</li>
            <li> pouring out any excess water, make sure that the hole is on the top, pour out and then use a q-tip to get any drops that remain in the top ridge so that any moisture does not run into the hole.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Love that you can turn lights off our on.  </li>
            <li> I thought there will be more mist coming out from this vapor,&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Has a cute interchanges light too!</li>
            <li> I love the product when it works, but they just quit working.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This has become my most favorite thing in my home.  </li>
            <li> It has more than done everything I wanted.  </li>

            <li> I will be picking up more for my kids</li>
            <li> The best part about this diffuser is its noise level; it&#x27;s virtually silent.</li>
            <li> cheaply made!  </li>
            <li> I used it most all of the day.....</li>
            <li> I also love the nightlight feature if I want to put it in a childs room at night too.</li>
            <li> There is another brand that I also love (that one has a timer).  </li>
            <li> We LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>

            <li> Love the light colors and the auto shutoff.</li>
            <li> I use it at night with lavender essential oil to help promote a good nights sleep!  </li>

            <li> the unit works fine</li>
            <li> cause it does not put out a fine mist not like a humidifyer which is what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fine but eventually broke.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to transport from room to room.</li>
            <li> Worked just fine for about 3 weeks-</li>

            <li> Easy to set up and easy to clean.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and you don&#x27;t have to have the light on.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I got this item as i wanted an extra one for upstairs</li>
            <li> Then one day I plugged it in and the light flashed and smoke started to come out from underneath the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Cheap but works well.</li>
            <li> These work great for essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Set up was simple and it works great.</li>

            <li> Light can be turned off.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really simple to use and does a great job.</li>

            <li> It works great in diffusing the essential oils in the room.  </li>
            <li> Great way to diffuse my DoTerra essential oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, it is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> At just around $30 (and free shipping)</li>
            <li> this diffuser filled the need.  </li>
            <li> I filled it with water &amp; oil, to find out that it did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> Works great with my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> You can see it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I work in the essential oil industry and have used many different diffusers from many companies and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the lights and the mist that this diffuser provides.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need the light changing colors</li>
            <li> The light will come on but the diffuser will not come on any longer.</li>
            <li> The unit is so fabulous that I&#x27;d still keep</li>
            <li> but still no mist, just the light is working thats all.  </li>
            <li> This is great for diffusing essential oils.</li>
            <li> It does its job and together with the use of essential oils its great..</li>
            <li> In terms of appearance..it has a bit of a cheap look but it works..</li>
            <li> it gives the room a nice feel..a real sense of relaxation</li>
            <li> If you want to diffuse essential oils in your home this diffuser is great.</li>
            <li> Set up is fast and simple, and the Spa Vapor is the perfect size for any surface.  </li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Our daughters were still in cribs, everything should have been fine, but it most certainly was not!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and the lights are fun!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now, daily, and love it!!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and as long as you use something else to pour the water into the diffuser instead of putting it under the faucet and keep it clean, this should work great for you.</li>
            <li> Luckily I saved my receipt and plan to return it, but I can&#x27;t believe a product could be sold like this that so easily breaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been an awesome little diffuser!  </li>
            <li> The kids enjoy being able to stop the light on a certain color for the night, and I like how I can run it until the water is done</li>
            <li> Have bought three of these (also as gifts) because I love them so much!</li>
            <li> the original goes.  </li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and I love it.</li>
            <li> We like the light, cool mist</li>
            <li> received the product and was excited to use it.</li>
            <li> Below you will see my original review....</li>
            <li> The aroma is not overwhelming and also works excellent for therapeutic reasons</li>
            <li> I love the pretty colors (which you can turn off if you want to), and you can see it going into the air.</li>
            <li> This was not part of my original order, so maybe they realized that lack of cleaning was causing problems.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for a small room or office.  </li>
            <li> it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I clean it often and take care of it.</li>
            <li> Quiet and nice stream of mist is aim- able</li>
            <li> It is a pain to have to clean it every two hours before I can run it again.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t clean out the diffuser every time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to clean it out after each use.</li>
            <li> I do clean it as suggested after each use</li>
            <li> It is powerful for it&#x27;s size, and so easy to care for.</li>
            <li> it can be tricky to clean around them between uses.  </li>
            <li> Who has time to suit and clean a diffuser every day.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the spa vaporizer in order to provide a clean background smell during our house showings.</li>
            <li> Just clean the bowl with vinigar after every use and it will work well for you.</li>
            <li> far though, I love it!</li>
            <li> I wish it could put more water vapor into the air, but I think it does a great job for a small device.</li>
            <li> This unit worked great the first several times, but about 10 minutes into the sixth time I used it, it quit working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found an inexpensive difuser that works like one twice as much.</li>
            <li> cool mist with the option to add oils to help or deliver heath benefits</li>
            <li> and it really helps me to breathe better at night.</li>
            <li> They love the changing colors for the night light, and I love the way they sleep with the essential oils diffusing.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good product that does the job.</li>
            <li> Thanks I am going to order more</li>
            <li> Initially, I loved this product and used it daily.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow the directions when it comes to the fill line, too much water, and it will not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love the very fine mist  </li>
            <li> Love the diffuser - easy to use and good for small space, like a bedroom.</li>
            <li> This diffuser really puts out the mist and I love the light changes but also love that I can turn off the lights completely for sleeping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I appreciate being able to keep the light off, since the other style I have keeps the whole room too bright.  </li>
            <li> After trials with a different &amp; quite costly essential oil diffuser, the Greenair Spa Vapor is a very welcome item in our household.  </li>
            <li> It is simple with no extra bells and whistles, but it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably spend 20$ more for a better quality one next.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who diffuses oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very important to clean it frequently to keep it from getting sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and has the power to give you a fantastic night of sleep if you use it with some essential oils.</li>
            <li> I had one of these previously and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I have searched and reviewed for the perfect long lasting ultra sonic diffuser.</li>
            <li> Even if it did, the price is so reasonable, it can easily be replaced.  </li>
            <li> Buyer be aware!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d love to buy a few more to have it in each rooms !</li>
            <li> I probably need to buy a few more to cover more area!  </li>
            <li> received my replacement readily and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE CHANGING LIGHTS ARE FANTASTIC AND PUT MY DOTERRA CERTIFIED PURE THERAPEUTIC GRADE OILS</li>
            <li> Great little item.  </li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.</li>
            <li> It might work great for a few uses, but then stops and either won&#x27;t produce mist or just won&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
            <li> It seems to spread the fragrance around so lightly that I can&#x27;t really smell the oil I have put in it.</li>
            <li> and well the light is working now, so really?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to loving my diffusers again and based on the soldering job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have an extra, since my daughter and I both like oils diffused in our rooms at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and pumps out a nice steam so it moisturizes the air a bit.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as others but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The led lighting is a nice touch but not necessary for our intensions.</li>
            <li> worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> After reading more online reviews of this product we shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent many a day enjoying the peacefulness of this aromatherapy mist machine.</li>
            <li> From everything I&#x27;ve read the machine averages about 4 hours worth of dispensing time if you fill the water to the fill line, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s closer to 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I only cleaned it once since I got this and used room temperature reverse osmosis water, not tap warm water like it said to do in the instructions.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser works great at first, but then it quit diffusing in less than 2 months...</li>
            <li> It worked great, made my apartment smell amazing, and although the color changing lights are a little cheesy, I liked them!</li>
            <li> As long as the machine does not crap out in the near future I will be a happy customer!!!</li>
            <li> They did make it right with me.</li>
            <li> Diffusing serenity right now and my dog</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t detect the smell unless you put your nose right up against the machine.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem like much vapor is coming out, but for the price its not bad.</li>
            <li> We had a problem with the first one we got, so I called the eight hundred number on the instructions and the sent me a replacement right away.</li>
            <li> this is ok - doesn&#x27;t put off near as much vapor</li>
            <li> The fact that it doesn&#x27;t come straight out the top is an added bonus for me because i can point it directly at me if i prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It dispenses enough to fill the classroom, it runs for 4-5 hours and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> One thing I really like better compared to my old spa vapor</li>
            <li> The aroma was strong and  you can direct the mist.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and clean, and it performs quietly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I love this adorable little thing so much!</li>
            <li> It is a good little unit for aromatherapy therapy.  </li>
            <li> I loved this little diffuser at first</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little diffuser for the money.</li>
            <li> This is an edit to my first review:After I posted the first review the company contacted me and sent out replacements of the diffusers I bought.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last more than a month</li>
            <li> The lights are still pretty, but no mist is coming out.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> but am aware that it does it now so no longer a bother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the first one that I bought.  </li>
            <li> I yanked it off of the shelf and ran it outside where it remained until my husband tested it to make sure it was truly malfunctioning and proceeded to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Put in tap water (along with your favorite essential oil) and you&#x27;re all set.  </li>
            <li> Diffusing essential oils has never been easier and more affordable.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Can use lights and diffuser at the same time or use as just a night light!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using a spa diffuser and truth be told, I have no idea if this is working or not.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering a couple more to give as presents later this year.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it never worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I used it for more than three hours total.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own when it&#x27;s empty too.</li>
            <li> There is no noise, just a lovely wafting fragrance of whatever essential oil I have opted to use.....</li>
            <li> I hope the second one works better.</li>
            <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> My first greenair was a gift</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for several months and love it.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I said I was interested</li>
            <li> My kids love the way it lights up and all the different colors it makes.</li>
            <li> than that I love this vaporizer especially when used with lavender</li>
            <li> I only wish it held more water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would be exactly what I wanted if it worked.</li>
            <li> I ordered the first one, it arrived and the first night I noticed the \\&quot;off\\&quot; button did not work.  </li>
            <li> The first night the mist would not even work.  </li>
            <li> It is small but people notice a good feeling right when they walk in.  </li>
            <li> There are special yet simple instructions on how to properly clean and care for this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Also be sure to keep it on a flat surface with no cloth placemat or anything underneath that could block the airflow of the fan and cause it to stop working.</li>
            <li> They work beautifully and great for going to sleep at night and for when cold season hits!!</li>
            <li> I own the Aroma Ace which is really expensive, works amazing but does not shoot out the mist.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I bought this second one in case</li>
            <li> I really did love it while it lasted using it with do terra essential oils.</li>
            <li> I will try to call the manufacturer and hope for positive results.</li>
            <li> I also saw the positive reviews though, and decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li> Great but a little hassle to clean every single use</li>
            <li> better than expected; seems to aid our sleep; sometimes the lights provide an entertaining backdrop; if the lights annoy, we simply flip a switch to turn them off.</li>
            <li> I really likes this diffuser when I first received it</li>
            <li> that was supposed to go in the top, so haven&#x27;t used it in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It works great, I can smell the essential oils, so far I&#x27;ve only used lavender, the unit operates for about four hours, turns off on</li>
            <li> It only takes one drop of essential oil and my whole room smells good .</li>
            <li> This unit is also small and lightweight, which is always a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to put 5 drops of my favorite essential oil in the water and it helps calm and focus my Autistic children with their school work.  </li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use and so silent.</li>
            <li> Turns off automatically when water level is low and color changing lights can easily be turned off.  </li>
            <li> I add essential oils to the water and it fills the room very quickly.</li>
            <li> 6/13/13:  Very soon after posting this positive review, my unit stopped producing mist.  </li>
            <li> I saw other diffusers for much more money, but these have been doing exactly what</li>
            <li> Luckily I remembered the blog and went back and located the fix post and after following his instructions I was able to fix both of my diffusers in about 20 mins.  </li>
            <li> It gives off instant mist and fills a room quickly!  </li>
            <li> I ordered another one because I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t  clean the first one enough.  </li>
            <li> Not only because it has actually lasted but the amount of vapor it releases is amazing.</li>
            <li> My children actually ask to turn the light on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really finicky about how much water you put in.  </li>
            <li> If you put in too much water, it won&#x27;t diffuse at all.  </li>
            <li> but, the ac adapter that you plug into the wall makes a high pitched squealing noise witch defeats the purpose of using a diffuser for relaxation!</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser, shuts itself off when the water is empty which is a plus</li>
            <li> so much so that we bought 2.</li>
            <li> Works very well very sturdy</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vapor really shoots out</li>
            <li> let it run for 4 hours straight</li>
            <li> I really like Greenair Spa Vapor machine.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> I use this machine in my bedroom with lavender oil and it really helps me to fall asleep and stay sleeping.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold much water (about a cup), but it doesn&#x27;t take much space either.  </li>
            <li> I could not return it because I didn&#x27;t unbox it and use it until after I moved--- too much time had passed.</li>
            <li> I love how it automatically shuts off once the tank is empty.</li>
            <li> I really like the color changing and the auto-shut off.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> The changing light color was the only thing that seemed to work the way it was meant to.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say from a medical standpoint if it works, but it does soothe him and helps him feel secure when he goes to bed.  </li>
            <li> Works very well&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was really exited to get and use this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend the one from NOW, It is shaped like a cone, and it works very well each and every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> It makes me very &amp;#34;Smiley&amp;#34;, hint hint.  </li>
            <li> Did not scent the room very well.</li>
            <li> I like that you can change the direction of the mist with out having to move the whole machine.</li>
            <li> It is very durable</li>
            <li> Did not seem to do much.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very portable, so I sometimes bring it from one room to another.</li>
            <li> This item only worked most of the time at the beginning and by a month in, it&#x27;s completely shot.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I am about to order my fourth, I have not had any issues with any that I have purchased thus far.  </li>
            <li> Writing the review to warn others … DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$!!!</li>
            <li> You do have to be sure to clean off the little ceramic disk at the inside bottom with a little brush in between uses with vinegar and water ( or the essential oils could build up and clog it) and make sure not to clean the sensor because that is what indicates the water level and auto</li>
            <li> I had an issue with my first spa vapor and they sent me a new one with no issues.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these very soon to have them in other rooms of the house.</li>
            <li> LIke many other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> We originally bought 2 of these, and one instantly began to gurgle and spit.  </li>
            <li> I bought other diffusers that work way better then this...</li>
            <li> Love this little machine, quiet, portable, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I do clean it between uses to ensure it continues to work properly.</li>
            <li> The key to this diffuser as with all the others keep it clean</li>
            <li> I clean it out daily</li>
            <li> The company, Green air, gave me awesome, unbelievable customer service and worked with me to get my Spa Vapor working.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is amazingly simple.</li>
            <li> It works really well and quickly fills the room with the smells of my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> It does make some sound, but is pretty quiet in general.</li>
            <li> I liked to diffuse lavender in the nursery each night when we put the girls to bed and turned it off before I went to bed ( usually 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they last the full 8 hours, but usually they go off in 4-6 on their own.</li>
            <li> The first one i bought was young living $100 and that one stopped working within 3 months.</li>
            <li> It fits in a small space and diffuses nicely.  </li>
            <li> I actually loved this little thing...while it worked, which was only about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Light is soft enough to use for bedtime.</li>
            <li> I returned and received back 3 more, all with the same defect, so will not be purchasing again.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a lot of fancy features, but an inexpensive diffuser with decent quality.  </li>
            <li> But this would be better if it were a larger tank and would last longer than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> The lights work on both of them, the mist starts quickly on one but doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent diffuser.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a pain to have to clean it so often, but it&#x27;s really quite easy - just put in the water and white vinegar, let it sit for 15 or 20 minutes, then use the little brush.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this greenair spa diffuser.</li>
            <li> I wish it held a little more water, but even a cup lasts about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I should have just spent the extra money and bought the Young Living diffuser, which I now have and absolutely love it (the YL diffuser)!</li>
            <li> Love this little vaporizer.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have ask for any thing more of this little item.</li>
            <li> like that you have option off turning the lights off of the machine while it&#x27;s running, because I find them a little bit obnoxious (although my kids love them).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about buying another one to put up in my kids room as I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different oils that can help fight off germs and calm the child (I have a son with autism).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read many of the reviews that said this diffuser didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This is an economical way to diffuse essential oils.  </li>
            <li> so well at first I am very ashamed that I told several people to buy this product</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts more than a few months this time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I may have to order a few more.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for reasonably priced diffuser, just goes to prove that it doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive to be good!</li>
            <li> We called the company numerous times, they said they would make it right with me and never did.</li>
            <li> I keep it right next to my bed at night.</li>
            <li> Also, you had to sit right next to the diffuser to smell the oil fragrance</li>
            <li> We had it a little more than 7 months before it completely terrified us.</li>
            <li> I love the amount of cool quiet thick vapor that comes flowing out.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert</li>
            <li> and they said they would send a new one that day which never arrived....</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected especially for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> Love this little diffuser!  </li>
            <li> I bought one 4 months ago and it has been running very frequently with no problems.  </li>
            <li> (The following is the first review....</li>
            <li> My first one quit working is why I purchased a second one.</li>
            <li> I love the choices of oils to use and the small is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> While I love their oils and other products, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending the extra money on their brand of diffuser, so I bought this.</li>
            <li> but after following all instructions exactly unit would not power up.</li>
            <li> I first saw this diffuser at a local health and wellness shop.  </li>
            <li> You add tap water and essential oils and it does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I ordered three more and had to return two of the three within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I bought a second one after my first one died but it died as well.</li>
            <li> My first was from a friend that had bought several for gifting...</li>
            <li> This vaporizer only worked correctly the first 2 times I used it.</li>
            <li> only problem is the &amp;#34;fill water line&amp;#34; marker is a sticker and it fell off after first use.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for two weeks and the lights the change colors is not working as well as went first received.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I suggest is to use full strength White Vinegar during the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> I am almost positive they are the same company.</li>
            <li> All of the other colors are so cool and soothing.</li>
            <li> While I did order a clean air vaporizer it was supposed to come in the dark gray color shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Apparently some of the units that had a range of older production dates did have a flaw.</li>
            <li> I have since gotten a bigger one because I have a large room.</li>
            <li> They dont last very long but for the price, its okay ... i use for my young living essential oils.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first when I read other reviews, but it&#x27;s works great, and has improved my asthma.</li>
            <li> if you are not going to be using it everyday be sure to clean it out ( vinegar and water ) and dry it so it does not mold (be careful not to touch the sensor -</li>
            <li> The vapor really &#x27;pours&#x27; out, but I wish the smell would go further and linger longer.</li>
            <li> Very finicky and eventually struggles to vaporize even after following the cleaning regime.</li>
            <li> I used it frequently, probably once a day.  </li>
            <li> Just got it a day early in the mail.</li>
            <li> The lighting feature is an appreciated extra.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews but &#x27;gambled&#x27; and bought 2 of these, hoping at least one of them would be OK.  </li>
            <li> Overall I really like the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> and it really makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> I wanted a few more diffusers to have in different rooms in the house but at nearly $90 each I could not afford that.  </li>
            <li> I finally found an instrument that really helps my breathing.  </li>
            <li> My one year old nephew loves the color changing lights.</li>
            <li> Will definitely not waste my money anymore on this brand.</li>
            <li> I tried it again, with the same results,I was really looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li> No problems with this item thus far, &amp;</li>
            <li> It came, was obnoxiously loud with some &amp;#34;clicking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would expect it to last much longer for that amount of use.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this diffuser mists the essential oils and water.  </li>
            <li> (my old one make a humming noise).</li>
            <li> Just fill with water to the clearly marked line and add a few drops of your favorite essential oils.  </li>
            <li> The colors are soft and pleasing.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t smell any of the essential oil I used, and I used a very premium grade oil.</li>
            <li> I was nervous after some of the negative reviews, but I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 2 months now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The replacement came with a small cleaning tool and instructions to clean with hot water and vinegar daily.  </li>
            <li> I like the wood looking one from Now Foods better, even if the water container is a little strange.</li>
            <li> Much too small a quantity to be useful.</li>
            <li> the room has a steady scent of the oils for several hours.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much more I will be ordering from Amazon as the two products I ordered at the same time</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that this is the first diffuser that I have ever purchased, so I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference between this and a more expensive machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other reviews that talk about the mister not working is right on the money.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to follow the directions and clean it regularly.  </li>
            <li> major bummer!  </li>
            <li> The ultrasonic mist quickly delivers essential oils into the air just as expected.  </li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser and I have no regrets so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a week but have used it pretty much constantly since I purchased it (3 times a day for several hours each time).</li>
            <li> I unplug, clean out, refill and try again, usually it works...</li>
            <li> I bought them directly from the Greenair company in order to resale but an entire case of them didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Plus it barely pooped steam.</li>
            <li> You can barely smell it...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t bigger to hold more water.</li>
            <li> but the vapour is barely there.</li>
            <li> I had this product for barely over a month and it will no longer work.</li>
            <li> Do not fill past water line and clean on regular basis for longer life</li>
            <li> Product is not as dark in color as depicted, which is a positive in my book.  </li>
            <li> to clean often with vinegar to remove hard water scale (it comes with instructions and a cleaning brush)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish there weren&#x27;t so many different items on Amazon that all seemed the same but had different prices and different pictures which makes it confusing.  </li>
            <li> The tank is not big enough to hold much water, so it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> The lights in a dark room are very relaxing and meditating.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the red light.  </li>
            <li> Apparently these units just aren&#x27;t meant to last.  </li>
            <li> I intended to return, signed on and discovered that it was no long eligible for a return.  </li>
            <li> after one use it barely produced any aroma and did not work at all the second time.</li>
            <li> Not really wanting to order a new one at the cost.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after just a few uses, exchanged for a new one and had the same problem with the new one.</li>
            <li> The first one stopped working within a week despite following the cleaning and trouble shooting guidelines.  </li>
            <li> I have found if i fill it a little UNDER the recommended amount that the vapor is much stronger.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the bad reviews instead of the one good one at Learning About Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t choose what light is glowing, as they just slowly rotate from green, red, blue, etc., but you can turn them off completely and still diffuse.  </li>
            <li> I would not purchase this item ever again, but would consider something from the seller because they at least &amp;#34;tried&amp;#34; to make it right.</li>
            <li> I also bought 3 other off brands for over $50 each and returned them all (they stopped working completely).</li>
            <li> Tried to contact Green Air&#x27;s customer service department (left two messages - no call back) or their sales department but no one there to answer (during normal weekday business hours).</li>
            <li> Seriously, folks, this one simply isn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the spa vapor by green air.</li>
            <li> to not only add moisture to the dry air, but diffuse essential oils like doTerra&#x27;s OnGuard to prevent winter sniffles.</li>
            <li> Has to be cleaned with vinegar every single time you use it, and after using it about ten times, it only mists for about two hours.  </li>
            <li> only wish you could select a solid colored light rather than having it change in a random color pattern.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much sucks</li>
            <li> The second week the motor was loud upon starting, but then would settle in after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> We use the Spa Vapor with an essential oil blend for my son who has nighttime seizures.  </li>
            <li> but it does not seem to be a product that will last too long.</li>
            <li> Works just as nicely as the very expensive models.</li>
            <li> I think I have taken good care of it, so I was disappointed to have to replace it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this one will last a long time!</li>
            <li> i like it, but they don&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I use it every single night next to my bed with my oils and now i want another one for the living room!</li>
            <li> , i have it set directly on a hard surface (no cloth under it) and about every 3rd day i put a small amount of vinegar and water in it and clean out any oil residue.</li>
            <li> I expected it to last longer than that.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m looking forward to it performing well for a long time.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I use it all day long for three days a week</li>
            <li> It holds 1 1/2 cups water and it will vapor for a long time, I&#x27;m talking about 3-5 hours at time.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t use it at all, so we got 4 actual weeks of usage, and the return window closed on Feb 16</li>
            <li> so I figured I would go with one that looks just like it since it lasted so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products by their competitors and there is just no comparison.</li>
            <li> The other one, if it runs for enough hours, the mist will start, but not keep going.  </li>
            <li> When you refill it, the inner plastic cover drips due to condensation.  </li>
            <li> I tried the troubleshooting advice as explained in the packaging, but based on other reviews, it seems this product has a short lifespan.</li>
            <li> and we are using the product several times a day due to my daughter&#x27;s asthma.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run very long but works well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as much power of the Young Living diffuser-but it isn&#x27;t as expensive either.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with sinus problems or dry bedrooms</li>
            <li> but It only holds about a cup of water at a time so it only runs a few hours.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I used it every single day.  </li>
            <li> The mist is not wet or messy.</li>
            <li> and I start it up for the first time and its already broken.</li>
            <li> I did I doubt they will ever come loose again</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/5/13: after several calls and messages to their customer service department with no return call I have given up and considered this $32 down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It appears to be a design flaw and is pretty common with this model and all it takes to fix is a soldering iron and a bit of solder on one little spot.    </li>
            <li> One stopped working after I had only had it a week or less</li>
            <li> so I put it in a less obvious place.</li>
            <li> The only downside is I waited two and a half months to receive the product.</li>
            <li> Only cons are the writing on the inside (it shows the max fill water line), melts away from the essential oils, so it looks like a messy black writing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, in fact the other one I had (which I see Amazon no longer carries) didn&#x27;t run as long and got everything around it wet.  </li>
            <li> it takes awhile to heat up, and only a little mist comes out one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It will last a little over a couple of hours and shuts off when the water is gone.</li>
            <li> I received it quicker than I expected and it&#x27;s everything I wanted and needed</li>
            <li> The water was almost empty and it smelled as though something were burning.</li>
            <li> A few days after that started, the entire unit went dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of a essential oil in.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few hours at a time and maybe 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday for inhaling essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I have since read some of the reviews and found out that quite a few people have had the same problem as I have had.</li>
            <li> Helped with being closed up all winter .</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve ordered several of these and had issues with a few of them not working.</li>
            <li> It is not large and can be placed discreetly.</li>
            <li> Love this I work with children who are always sick</li>
            <li> Other than that they serve their purpose&lt;</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re struggling with asthma due to polluted air.</li>
            <li> Other units are louder.</li>
            <li> I was more than disappointed in this diffuser.</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;ll update this post and plan to purchase another unit for other rooms in my home.</li>
            <li> One thing, not sure if it will cause any problems later on, but if I plug in the outlet to the wall and THEN plug the end into the diffuser it has sparked at the point of the plug-to-diffuser.</li>
            <li> This only put out a small mist.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these spa vapor 6-7 years ago not sure if it was the same brand</li>
            <li> All three died within 48 hours of each other like a well executed plan.</li>
            <li> I have 2 other defusers, but this one is a dud.</li>
            <li> Not only am I getting the health benefits of the oils, but I am completely done with candles and fake scents in my home.</li>
            <li> A little weird when the lights go on and off by themselves right before it shuts itself off  -</li>
            <li> With a 4-hour (roughly) run-time, I can turn it on and go about my business of cleaning the house, cooking, or just spending time with my little boy while we reap the benefits of the oils in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> that is why my complaint fell through the cracks when I initially contacted them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it ran longer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money for this diffuser.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> contact (Thanks Carrie!) offered me a replacement base immediately and is sending it out directly.  </li>
            <li> well and are very economical except I think every so often they get a bad one&lt;br /&gt;because of how and where they are made.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wish to burn down my house cause of a faulty piece of junk.</li>
            <li> The size is a little awkward for me, maybe my hands are too small, with its smooth surface it can be slippery to hold</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviews where the people said it would work for a few times then quit.</li>
            <li> Set it up and had it running in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> There is a problem with the power hook up on the machine it sparks and is turning the part you plug in black</li>
            <li> I called the company and they mailed another one to me in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> Takes less than 5 minutes of my time.  </li>
            <li> Half way</li>
            <li> My Wyndmere nebulizer of 4 years was looking a little worse for the wear (constant use, very few cleanings) and starting to make noise, so I thought it was time to move on.  </li>
            <li> It usually took about 20 tries.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I live in Oregon and right now the fires are really horrible and my asthma has been a challenge due to the smoke.</li>
            <li> I figured i would purchase a less expensive one because i assumed these type of diffusers just don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has ever changing color of lights in the base.</li>
            <li> The auto-shut off stopped working, so we found that it would continue to run, despite little to no water in the basin, thus &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Spa Vapor for a little over a week in my office.</li>
            <li> lights and the little fan still work, but the ultrasonic part that creates the vapor is kaput.</li>
            <li> There are lots of little bumps on the inside bottom of the diffuser-</li>
            <li> It would run for about 20 minutes on the little bit of water that I used.</li>
            <li> and i wish it was a little thinner in width</li>
            <li> I came home to check out the Greenair diffuser on Amazon and saw that quite a few people had issues with it breaking after little use.  </li>
            <li> Seriously works well (as long as you follow the directions) and will be buying another soon!</li>
            <li> about 3hrs straight maybe, can&#x27;t be set for intervals of cutting on/off.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I put my oils and water in and run a cycle and then run a few cycles without&lt;br /&gt;adding additional oil.  </li>
            <li> Purchased in May....started having trouble with misting within 3 weeks...followed all instructions....</li>
            <li> Waste of $30, but</li>
            <li> I have used for over 3 weeks everyday and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Use it everyday in my home for my allergies.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> I had been using my Spa Vapor for a few months a few nights a week with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed for 30 some dollars, I guess I will spend more to get a quality item .</li>
            <li> It works well and uses very little water.  </li>
            <li> Have used one of them every night for the past 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I tried to see if I could get an exchange or a refund but as it turned out I am past the 30 days.</li>
            <li> Small diffuser but puts out a lot of vapor.  </li>
            <li> it is not working well and does not diffuse to cover the small room.</li>
            <li> This is a small unit and has a small water reservoir ...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m simply not sure</li>
            <li> After about 2 hours, I noticed that there was no more vapor and the LED lights were not on.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed a small puddle of water has leaked out the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Used on a regular basis without fail.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I was not able to turn off the lights, the button didn&#x27;t respond at all.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing to have thrown away money for something that only worked for a short time.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t be hard to use either.</li>
            <li> When I have allergies or a cold I like to breathe in the the essential oils &amp; mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will mention i use this item at least 3 times every day</li>
            <li> A waste of money!!</li>
            <li> The company contacted me after this review and sent me a new base at their cost.</li>
            <li> My new base has had no problems at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to replace 3 of these diffusers in less than 3 months time, so needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> But I think that is ridiculous to expect to have to be that time consuming to take care of this product.</li>
            <li> noise that was ridiculous..</li>
            <li> The lights are subtle and soothing.  </li>
            <li> We now have 3 of these bad boys in our home and use them all on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> This green air spa diffuser has proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this diffuser several times when someone in the family is sick.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my mother in law and definitely helped me when I was sick and couldn&#x27;t breath well during the night.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I lost something (some small part, maybe a sponge?)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read past the reviews and ordered this.</li>
            <li> The mist is so weak and unremarkable, it produced no scent in a closet, and not for lack of sufficient oil application.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these based on the review of a blogger, this was after he had posted that his had broken</li>
            <li> I thought it may take some time, but soon realized it is broken.</li>
            <li> I also have friends who have have purchased these and they have broken-</li>
            <li> The vapor covers approximately 250 square feet.</li>
            <li> Sorry to be negative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine nonstop for approximately two months</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a company that stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> i purchased the item in December and used it for about a month, approximately 4 times per week for about 2 hours at a time.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Its functional but not beautiful (its plastic)</li>
            <li> my 3yr just got sick and i needed one asap, so i ran up to vitaminworld or whatever its called, and bought one for $29, guess what DOESN&#x27;T WORK, not at all, its completely dead.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed, as hoped it would&#x27;ve lasted longer.</li>
            <li> So disappointed and they are not cheap</li>
            <li> The vapor was very weak.  </li>
            <li> Failed after 7 days.</li>
            <li> We were unable to get it to even turn on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, neither of them work.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I missed my window of oppty to return them, so I will just throw them away.  </li>
            <li> Well, I WAS WRONG-</li>
            <li> My son is sad and hoping I can fix it.</li>
            <li> but it is absolutely useless.  </li>
            <li> Sadly the unit I got was fritzy.  </li>
            <li> ur gonna put a plug with your product that is THE WRONG VOLTAGE?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NOT IMPRESSED!!</li>
            <li> does what it says just as well as my expensive diffuser</li>
            <li> Needless to say it was returned.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> So, very frustrating!</li>
            <li> Out of the seven sent to me, I had 5 go bad after 4-10 uses.</li>
            <li> I have not got sick this year</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy. :(</li>
            <li> What a surprise that I cannot contact the seller! :(</li>
            <li> bought one and it didn&#x27;t work, but i threw out the receipt and box :-(  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t settle for being disappointed and having a non-working unit.  </li>
            <li> was sadly disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> One thing though, there is a bit of a &#x27;spark&#x27; when i go to plug it in at the base.</li>
            <li> I use it without the lights which i believe would be annoying.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I cleaned between uses and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The company is terrible at customer service.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Make sure you read and follow the directions to a tee. If you do you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues. I absolutely love this thing! It is easy to use and as long as you use something else to pour the water into the diffuser instead of putting it under the faucet and keep it clean, this should work great for you. I am so glad I found an inexpensive difuser that works like one twice as much. It runs for about 4-5 hours and I use it in an open floor plan home so It has effectively scented almost 700 square feet of space. I love this difuser! I have had it for close to two months.</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for  my aromatherapy. I love the automatic  shut-off feature.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, and am very happy with the quality. She has been running it daily for 10+ months now and there hasn&#x27;t been any problems.</li>
            <li> My kids love using this as a night light. It does make some sound, but is pretty quiet in general. Works just as nicely as the very expensive models.</li>
            <li> Failed after 7 days. Very disappointed for 30 some dollars, I guess I will spend more to get a quality item .</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser - easy to use and good for small space, like a bedroom. The oils and roller balls were delightful as well.</li>
            <li> Loved this when I first got it, but it stopped working after 10 uses.  I wasn&#x27;t too diligent about cleaning. It worked when I was cleaning it, then stopped.</li>
            <li> Quality of this diffuser is very good. I like the fact it shuts off if the water gets too low. Only wish it was bigger so it didn&#x27;t need to be refilled as often. I live in the desert so enjoy putting any amount of moisture in the air and scented is better. Works well with essential oils.</li>
            <li> This is an edit to my first review:After I posted the first review the company contacted me and sent out replacements of the diffusers I bought. I guess they had some staffing issues and that is why my complaint fell through the cracks when I initially contacted them. They did make it right with me. They are nice diffusers when they work. (The following is the first review....These are junk! They don&#x27;t last more than a month and that is if you can get it to work when you take it out of the box. I bought them directly from the Greenair company in order to resale but an entire case of them didn&#x27;t work. We called the company numerous times, they said they would make it right with me and never did. So, very frustrating! I was out $180. I had to pay my customer&#x27;s back and now I am stuck with a case of (crap)non functioning Spa Vapors! Do yourselves a favor and spend your money on something else! Heck a pan of water on the stove top would work better than these things.)</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 of these units. The first one stopped working within a week despite following the cleaning and trouble shooting guidelines.  I gave two of them as gifts and they have both had some problems with them as well.</li>
            <li> The vapor really &#x27;pours&#x27; out, but I wish the smell would go further and linger longer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works, and sometimesit doesn&#x27;t.....recommended to a friend who purchased and his won&#x27;t work at all!  They need to improve their quality....</li>
            <li> Well, I would have given it a 4, it didn&#x27;t diffuse for as great any area as I hoped, but it was good for next to the bed.  I used it every single day.  I cleaned it as described.  I only used tepid water.  In short I followed all the directions, and guess what 10 days after the return date passed, it simply stopped working.  The fan is running.  The lights are still pretty, but no mist is coming out.  I&#x27;ve cleaned it again twice.  I&#x27;ve lowered the water level. I&#x27;ve pressed the on switch for 10-20 seconds as another customer recommended, but it&#x27;s a no go.  Apparently these units just aren&#x27;t meant to last.  I should have listened to the bad reviews instead of the one good one at Learning About Essential Oils.  Now to order a more expensive diffuser.  Seriously, folks, this one simply isn&#x27;t worth the money.  I figure it cost me about a dollar a use.</li>
            <li> Have bought three of these (also as gifts) because I love them so much! Great for diffusing my DoTerra oils. Have used one of them every night for the past 6 weeks and it&#x27;s still working perfectly!Very very pleased with product!</li>
            <li> I eally like that I can turn it on and off.  Hope it lasts longer than the last one I got, though.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son &amp; daughter in law for Christmas. Seems to work great! Thanks!</li>
            <li> LIke many other reviewers.  Mine stopped working after 3 months.  I was very careful to follow the directions and clean it regularly.  Boo.  I used it daily.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I got this item as i wanted an extra one for upstairs so I didnt need to move it back and forth. Well I had it for just over a month and it broke. The on off button didnt work from the third use so I always had to unplug it to turn it off. Then one day I plugged it in and the light flashed and smoke started to come out from underneath the diffuser. I tried to see if I could get an exchange or a refund but as it turned out I am past the 30 days. This is the second diffuse that broke on me. So disappointed and they are not cheap</li>
            <li> Love it service awesome!</li>
            <li> I am into aromatherapy and  I just love this product. Easy to set up and easy to clean. It has automatic shut off too. I use it everyday and  I have two at home and  had no problem with them. It only takes one drop of essential oil and my whole room smells good .</li>
            <li> Great! I&#x27;ve purchased 6 to share!!</li>
            <li> better than expected; seems to aid our sleep; sometimes the lights provide an entertaining backdrop; if the lights annoy, we simply flip a switch to turn them off.</li>
            <li> I used this product two times and it quit working. This one was my second one to purchase. I didn&#x27;t bother returning it, which is my fault. Not happy with the product. I have three different types of diffusers. So I know it isn&#x27;t user error.</li>
            <li> I purchased four of these and they all work great except I had to return one because&lt;br /&gt;it was defective and shorted out. The replacement has been working fine.  They work&lt;br /&gt;really well and are very economical except I think every so often they get a bad one&lt;br /&gt;because of how and where they are made.  Other than that they serve their purpose&lt;br /&gt;well.  I put my oils and water in and run a cycle and then run a few cycles without&lt;br /&gt;adding additional oil.  There is enough residue in the unit to still diffuse that oil.  I&lt;br /&gt;believe this helps to keep the unit from getting clogged up.</li>
            <li> I have used mine for about 6 months. It still works great. I clean it often and take care of it. I would totally recommend this. Cheap but works well.</li>
            <li> These work great for essential oils.  Some oils dissolve the &amp;#34;Max Fill&amp;#34; line.  I use between 1/2 and 2/3 cup of water.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, easy to use and keep clean. I often put this in my children&#x27;s room at night when they are not feeling well. Light is soft enough to use for bedtime.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, wish it had a timer for 30 min off and 30 on, and bigger capacity</li>
            <li> I love this and makes my bedroom smell so good. Seems to be helping with my headaches as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Set up was simple and it works great. I am able to put in any oil and the scent fills my bedroom. I keep it right next to my bed at night. I wish it could put more water vapor into the air, but I think it does a great job for a small device.</li>
            <li> I have one of these diffusers in my room and in my children&#x27;s rooms.  They diffuse the oil really nicely.  My children actually ask to turn the light on.  It is a great tool in an all natural (or trying to be) household.</li>
            <li> One of the best built units out there, LOVE IT!!!! We use it every day, this is our 3rd one. Have them in almost every room.</li>
            <li> Great mister and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for diffusing essential oils.  Very easy to clean and to run. It also shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to my expectations.  If I wanted to have a humidifier, I would have ordered one.No fragrance when I used the essential oil.</li>
            <li> I had one of these previously and it works great.  My first one quit working is why I purchased a second one.</li>
            <li> We originally bought 2 of these, and one instantly began to gurgle and spit.  I returned it and received another.  This one came without the water level sensor.  I returned and received back 3 more, all with the same defect, so will not be purchasing again.  The one that DOES work seems to be okay.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. Easy to use. Great way to relax. My wife uses it every day. Enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I like the changing colors and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use filtered water.  It doesn&#x27;t have as much power of the Young Living diffuser-but it isn&#x27;t as expensive either.</li>
            <li> cool mist with the option to add oils to help or deliver heath benefits&lt;br /&gt;plus you can have the led light on that change colors with i find calming</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser for the price. It has been knocked around by my boys twice and it is still ticking. The lights are nice but I am glad I have the option to shut them off. It diffuses nicely and it covers quite a bit of space! We love it!</li>
            <li> Works well for healthy mist with doTerra oils.  Like the fact that it shuts itself off.  A little weird when the lights go on and off by themselves right before it shuts itself off  - but am aware that it does it now so no longer a bother.</li>
            <li> This thing is okay.  It&#x27;s really finicky about how much water you put in.  If you put in too much water, it won&#x27;t diffuse at all.  It gets great reviews, but I don&#x27;t get the hype.  I like the wood looking one from Now Foods better, even if the water container is a little strange.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, easy to use and clean. As described.</li>
            <li> Great product. Small diffuser but puts out a lot of vapor.  I love that it uses tap water (don&#x27;t have to purchase distilled water).  Doesn&#x27;t have a lot of fancy features, but an inexpensive diffuser with decent quality.  Has an on/off button and a light changing button. Light can be turned off.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product multiple times only to have it break after a short period of use. I would not recommend</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! Easy to use and has ever changing color of lights in the base. Quiet and nice stream of mist is aim- able</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser, it stopped working after only two weeks. I cleaned it just as directed and used distilled water but it will not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to replace 3 of these diffusers in less than 3 months time, so needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying it again. It might work great for a few uses, but then stops and either won&#x27;t produce mist or just won&#x27;t turn on at all. The product itself is made of cheap materials. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the unit works fine but, the ac adapter that you plug into the wall makes a high pitched squealing noise witch defeats the purpose of using a diffuser for relaxation!</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser!! I use it several times a day to diffuse essential oils, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem. I do clean it between uses to ensure it continues to work properly. I definitely recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I live in Oregon and right now the fires are really horrible and my asthma has been a challenge due to the smoke. I was skeptical at first when I read other reviews, but it&#x27;s works great, and has improved my asthma. I like to sleep with it at night and I find the LED light relaxing. I like sound that it makes, I think it sounds like a bubbling creek. It shuts of when the water is out, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it running. I wish it held a little more water, but even a cup lasts about 2 hours. I also like how it has made my house smell with the essential oils that I use. I&#x27;m super happy with this product and would highly recommend for it&#x27;s price and if you&#x27;re struggling with asthma due to polluted air.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! My only complaint is that I wish it ran longer. It is a pain to have to clean it every two hours before I can run it again. I&#x27;d like to be able to run it for 6+ hours at a time.</li>
            <li> Very finicky and eventually struggles to vaporize even after following the cleaning regime. Very cheaply made. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Purchased in May....started having trouble with misting within 3 weeks...followed all instructions....now it no longer mists...UGH!</li>
            <li> Just received this and I love it. Very quiet which wa s a concern. Other units are louder. Good amount of vapor coming out of unit. Diffusing serenity right now and my dog and I are both enjoying it. I look forward to using this unit daily.</li>
            <li> This product stopped working six weeks after I received it, just after my 30-day window to return it to Amazon.  No option was given by Amazon to help with any manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these based on the review of a blogger, this was after he had posted that his had broken but he was able to fix them himself.  Let&#x27;s face it, I needed 2 and the price is great on this diffuser so I decided to take my chances.  Love the diffuser, shuts itself off when the water is empty which is a plus but after about 2 months of use both of mine also broke.  Luckily I remembered the blog and went back and located the fix post and after following his instructions I was able to fix both of my diffusers in about 20 mins.  It appears to be a design flaw and is pretty common with this model and all it takes to fix is a soldering iron and a bit of solder on one little spot.    I&#x27;m back to loving my diffusers again and based on the soldering job I did I doubt they will ever come loose again but if they do I know what to do.  Here is the link so you can fix your own: [...]</li>
            <li> Did I mention how much we love these...so much so that we bought 2. One stopped working after I had only had it a week or less and I was in the process of sending it back when I decided to plug it back in and give it another try...and it worked and has been working ever since...I love it cause it does not put out a fine mist not like a humidifyer which is what we were looking for.  We don&#x27;t need the extra water in the air...just the essential oils...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run very long but works well.</li>
            <li> I really likes this diffuser when I first received it but now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. There is no option to return this item and I won&#x27;t be buying from this maker again. Save your time and money and go with something else.</li>
            <li> I actually loved this little thing...while it worked, which was only about two weeks.  I used it frequently, probably once a day.  Then I noticed it started getting finicky when I would push the power button, only responding some of the time.  After about a week of fiddling with it that way, it just stopped working altogether.  Waste of $30, but I guess I got what I paid for. Bummer.</li>
            <li> The other reviews that talk about the mister not working is right on the money. I opened mine after the allowable Amazon return timing and ran it for 1 day. The fan and lights were working but no mist came out. I thought it may take some time, but soon realized it is broken. I will try to call the manufacturer and hope for positive results. Update will be posted. I have an $80 diffuser from Amazon and it has worked beautifully for 6 months. I guess you get what you pay for. DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS DIFFUSER.</li>
            <li> Works great, great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the first one that I bought.  I love it so much that I bought this second one in case the original goes.  I keep it on my nightstand and it really helps me to breathe better at night.</li>
            <li> It seems to spread the fragrance around so lightly that I can&#x27;t really smell the oil I have put in it. The instructions recommend 5 drops. Perhaps I could use more. It is absolutely silent and works well as a humidifier.</li>
            <li> I love it! I received it quicker than I expected and it&#x27;s everything I wanted and needed</li>
            <li> this is ok - doesn&#x27;t put off near as much vapor as what I would like - I have another brand that is much better</li>
            <li> This is the first diffuser I&#x27;ve purchased, I&#x27;m very happy with it. Easy to use for a beginner like me.</li>
            <li> I loved this little diffuser at first but it stopped working about six weeks after I received it. I tried rinsing it and doing a vinegar cleanse as instructed in the booklet but nothing helped. Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> Just plugged in my diffuser and so far so great. Extremely easy to use and so silent.</li>
            <li> Great product. Much too small a quantity to be useful. The lights are quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I bought this, used it for 2 months and then it quit working. I tried soaking and cleaning it. I tried all of the recommended tips but still wouldn&#x27;t work. I have replaced with a better diffuser that works.</li>
            <li> Works very well very sturdy</li>
            <li> Great little item.  I have used for over 3 weeks everyday and have had no problems.  I love the choices of oils to use and the small is not overpowering.  The lights in a dark room are very relaxing and meditating.  Will buy again from this dealer.</li>
            <li> ONLY WORKED FOR A WEEK</li>
            <li> It worked great for one month, and conveniently quit working 4 days after the return window expired.  So if you just need a diffuser for one month, it&#x27;s great, but then quits working.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the spa vapor by green air. I&#x27;ve tried other similar products by their competitors and there is just no comparison. Within minutes of plugging this thing in my office smelled wonderful. I would highly recommend this to anyone . Five star all the way.</li>
            <li> Showed up and must&#x27;ve been used it had mold growing in it.  Plus it barely pooped steam. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had one last for 6 months but then accidentally got some water in the motor. This is a great diffuser but it has to be babied. It works so good that it is worth it to me. I own the Aroma Ace which is really expensive, works amazing but does not shoot out the mist. When I have allergies or a cold I like to breathe in the the essential oils &amp; mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable nozzle&lt;br /&gt;Lasts about 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;The vapor really shoots out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Need to clean often with vinegar to remove hard water scale (it comes with instructions and a cleaning brush)&lt;br /&gt;There is a hole in the top rim, if you get water in it the unit burns out. Fill with a cup instead of the water tap to insure water does not get into the motor.&lt;br /&gt;Fill to just below the fill line or it will not work.&lt;br /&gt;When pouring out any excess water, make sure that the hole is on the top, pour out and then use a q-tip to get any drops that remain in the top ridge so that any moisture does not run into the hole.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month, daily - works quite well.</li>
            <li> Have followed all instructions and cleaned after each use. it is not working well and does not diffuse to cover the small room.</li>
            <li> The tank is not big enough to hold much water, so it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I loved it with aromatherapy oils.  Unfortunately, I lost something (some small part, maybe a sponge?) that was supposed to go in the top, so haven&#x27;t used it in a long time.  I&#x27;ll have to try to replace it.  But this would be better if it were a larger tank and would last longer than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This difusser worked great, while it worked. It died last week. I had it for 5 months...I expected it to last longer than that. I think I have taken good care of it, so I was disappointed to have to replace it.</li>
            <li> Love this little machine, quiet, portable, easy to use. works great! Love the function of being able to turn off the light when I want to sleep with the mist still running.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and has the power to give you a fantastic night of sleep if you use it with some essential oils.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an extra to be used in my daughter&#x27;s room. My sister had surgery recently &amp; I took it to her to use during her recovery. We were unable to get it to even turn on. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Vapor is very fine and scents besutifull huh.</li>
            <li> I had read many of the reviews that said this diffuser didn&#x27;t last long. I followed all the cleaning instructions, when we used it daily, and found that the motor would almost go on overdrive. The auto-shut off stopped working, so we found that it would continue to run, despite little to no water in the basin, thus &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; what precipitation was in there. It still works and diffuses, but you have to watch it as it gets close to using up the water in the basin and UNPLUG it manually, in order for the motor to stop working.  A little disappointed, as hoped it would&#x27;ve lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Just got it a day early in the mail. Set it up and had it running in less than 5 minutes. Love that you can turn lights off our on.  Would buy again as a gift for others.</li>
            <li> Gave this to a girlfriend to diffuse On Guard for her family as her son it currently going through chemo for bone cancer</li>
            <li> I thought there will be more mist coming out from this vapor,&lt;br /&gt;But it takes awhile to heat up, and only a little mist comes out one at a time.&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I could smell the essential oil after a while.&lt;br /&gt;It might be a good product to start with if you like your room to smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and I love it. It is very quiet and color changing is very nice !&lt;br /&gt;I let it run for 4 hours straight but water didn&#x27;t decrease at all ! I&#x27;m so happy with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to buy a few more to have it in each rooms !</li>
            <li> I was more than disappointed in this diffuser. We had it a little more than 7 months before it completely terrified us. I liked to diffuse lavender in the nursery each night when we put the girls to bed and turned it off before I went to bed ( usually 2 hours. One night I went in to turn it off and it was spewing water all over the shelf above their dresser and the colors were flashing like some  possessed disco ball. The water was all over the shelf, dresser and carpet. The water was almost empty and it smelled as though something were burning. I yanked it off of the shelf and ran it outside where it remained until my husband tested it to make sure it was truly malfunctioning and proceeded to throw it away. Our daughters were still in cribs, everything should have been fine, but it most certainly was not!</li>
            <li> This stopped working within 3 days.  I intended to return, signed on and discovered that it was no long eligible for a return.  Very disappointing to have thrown away money for something that only worked for a short time.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!  I appreciate being able to keep the light off, since the other style I have keeps the whole room too bright.  The kids enjoy being able to stop the light on a certain color for the night, and I like how I can run it until the water is done and it will auto turn off.</li>
            <li> I really like Greenair Spa Vapor machine.  I use it at night with lavender essential oil to help promote a good nights sleep!  I wold definetly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Nothing fancy, but for the price I think it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> There is a problem with the power hook up on the machine it sparks and is turning the part you plug in black</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great at first, but then it quit diffusing in less than 2 months... major bummer!  I should have just spent the extra money and bought the Young Living diffuser, which I now have and absolutely love it (the YL diffuser)!</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s easy to use and does the job! Has a cute interchanges light too!</li>
            <li> Only 2 out of the 3 I have bought works. I also have friends who have have purchased these and they have broken- all within 3-6 mos. I love the product when it works, but they just quit working. To be fair, I did use filtered water (why would I want to diffuse chlorinated tap H20) and I didn&#x27;t clean out the diffuser every time.  But I think that is ridiculous to expect to have to be that time consuming to take care of this product. I will look for another product.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a good, inexpensive, low-maintenance humidifier.  This is the one.  No need to use purified or distilled water.  Put in tap water (along with your favorite essential oil) and you&#x27;re all set.  Very relaxing.  Also, the light feature is optional.  Can turn the lights on or off, the humidifier still works.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a small unit and has a small water reservoir ... I use it on my office desk.&lt;br /&gt;I put essential oil in it and it produces a wonderful amount of steam and aroma.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it is supposed to do ... for about 2 hours. Then you need to refill or turn it off.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser and great company!  I had an issue with my first spa vapor and they sent me a new one with no issues. You don&#x27;t come across companies like that anymore!  Very happy and would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I used this product almost daily, and cleaned it after every use. It broke after two months. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> A diffuser that runs the night to relief allergy sufferers  throughout the night. use it for my doterra oils. Recommend this for people who suffer from allergies to have relief at night by using Breathe doterra oil in the diffuser. Wake up to clearer breathing. Also good for head colds.</li>
            <li> Love it. It has been almost a year and it still works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Spa Vapor for a little over a week in my office. It works great, I can smell the essential oils, so far I&#x27;ve only used lavender, the unit operates for about four hours, turns off on it&#x27;s own, basically operates as advertised. If it continues to operate well I&#x27;ll update this post and plan to purchase another unit for other rooms in my home.</li>
            <li> This has become my most favorite thing in my home.  Diffusing essential oils has never been easier and more affordable.</li>
            <li> I use this machine in my bedroom with lavender oil and it really helps me to fall asleep and stay sleeping.</li>
            <li> I use this product to add my Essential oils to our home.  It has more than done everything I wanted.  I would have given 5 Stars if it  would run longer but It only holds about a cup of water at a time so it only runs a few hours.</li>
            <li> Has to be cleaned with vinegar every single time you use it, and after using it about ten times, it only mists for about two hours.  I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worked fine but eventually broke.  Bought another on Amazon just like it from a different seller/manufacturer and it broke after about 5 months of use as well.</li>
            <li> This thing only worked for a couple months. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have two of these and about to order a third. This is a great essential oil diffuser. I have been using mine for about 6 months and have not had any problems. Sometimes they last the full 8 hours, but usually they go off in 4-6 on their own. Do a great job of diffusing the aromas.</li>
            <li> I like the swivel nozzle at the top. I don&#x27;t like having to clean it out after each use. That is the only reason I gave it a four star.</li>
            <li> This puts out a mist just as advised.  It works wonderful for aromatherapy with essential oils added to the water.</li>
            <li> received our order quickly and everything arrived in good order</li>
            <li> This is our first diffuser, and it works great.  The lighting feature is an appreciated extra.  Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> My mom gave me one last week and it refused to stay on.  After 2-3 hours, though it still had water, it would shut off.  I contacted Greenair by email the next day and was answered promptly.&lt;br /&gt;My contact (Thanks Carrie!) offered me a replacement base immediately and is sending it out directly.  She did not even require me to send back the defective piece!  All this took place over 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;So, to those who are having a similar problem, contact Greenair.  They are really nice and helpful and QUICK!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews but &#x27;gambled&#x27; and bought 2 of these, hoping at least one of them would be OK.  Unfortunately, neither of them work.  The lights work on both of them, the mist starts quickly on one but doesn&#x27;t last.  The other one, if it runs for enough hours, the mist will start, but not keep going.  VERY disappointed.  Have tried over and over again, following their directions to get them to work correctly, with no luck.  Unfortunately, I missed my window of oppty to return them, so I will just throw them away.  Writing the review to warn others … DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for are kids and is a good price. Would recommend this product to any parent who is having struggles putting there kid to sleep.</li>
            <li> very good product with light or mist only option</li>
            <li> My mom recommended this to me when it was time to replace my humidifier.  This one is amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t hold much water (about a cup), but it doesn&#x27;t take much space either.  It is easy to use, and with a couple of drops of lavender oil, my house smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a decent diffuser. It holds about 2/3 cup of water. It runs  about 3hrs straight maybe, can&#x27;t be set for intervals of cutting on/off. It cuts off when the water/oil runs out. It blows forcefully so the mist doesn&#x27;t just fall on the table/counter surface, but it gets into the air to circulate. One thing, not sure if it will cause any problems later on, but if I plug in the outlet to the wall and THEN plug the end into the diffuser it has sparked at the point of the plug-to-diffuser. The size is a little awkward for me, maybe my hands are too small, with its smooth surface it can be slippery to hold one-handed. I like that the air-vent can be rotated to blow in any direction without having to move the entire diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wellness advocate and IPC for doTERRA  Essential Oils. While I love their oils and other products, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending the extra money on their brand of diffuser, so I bought this. I use it almost every day, and it has yet to disappoint me. With a 4-hour (roughly) run-time, I can turn it on and go about my business of cleaning the house, cooking, or just spending time with my little boy while we reap the benefits of the oils in the diffuser. I loaned mine to my sister-in-law, and now she wants one!&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I use this in my son&#x27;s room when he&#x27;s not feeling well/sounding congested, or is having trouble sleeping. He likes the lights and I like that it won&#x27;t hurt him if he knocks it over.</li>
            <li> Awesome first ime diffuser love it. I have since gotten a bigger one because I have a large room. The key to this diffuser as with all the others keep it clean</li>
            <li> This item only worked most of the time at the beginning and by a month in, it&#x27;s completely shot. It didn&#x27;t stop from over-use. Save your $. Don&#x27;t buy. :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and it often runs several times a day. I love it! Easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to transport from room to room. I am probably going to buy another one soon!</li>
            <li> I loved this for the first week.  The second week the motor was loud upon starting, but then would settle in after a few minutes. A few days after that started, the entire unit went dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box it looked like a return, even had essential oil smell in the container.  I could not return it because I didn&#x27;t unbox it and use it until after I moved--- too much time had passed. But the unit was sold as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still looking for an effective long-lasting diffuser</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a year ago and it worked great until 2months ago and then it quit.  I ordered another one because I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t  clean the first one enough.  The second one lasted 3 uses and then it quit.  I contacted the company and they were very good about saying they would send me another one. That was 2 weeks ago and I haven&#x27;t seen it yet</li>
            <li> I love these diffusers.  Only issue I have is one of them sparks when I plug it in to either the diffuser or wall outlet.</li>
            <li> Love this. Use it daily!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I have already commended it to a friend. Very pleased with this purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Have had no issues with it after using several times.  I do clean it as suggested after each use so I&#x27;m looking forward to it performing well for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have an extra, since my daughter and I both like oils diffused in our rooms at night.</li>
            <li> I love this adorable little thing so much! It is powerful for it&#x27;s size, and so easy to care for.</li>
            <li> LOVE this diffuser!!! I have 4 of them in my home! Great price and does exactly what I need it to do! Can use lights and diffuser at the same time or use as just a night light! Great value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month, using it every day, and have had no problems. It&#x27;s really simple to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Cheapest diffuser I found. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem like much vapor is coming out, but for the price its not bad.</li>
            <li> Received unit but after following all instructions exactly unit would not power up. Tried to contact Green Air&#x27;s customer service department (left two messages - no call back) or their sales department but no one there to answer (during normal weekday business hours). Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Greenair Spa Vapor mist thingy.  It humidifies the air and disperses micro-sized particles of healthful essential oils in the air. Works great! One thing though, there is a bit of a &#x27;spark&#x27; when i go to plug it in at the base.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using a spa diffuser and truth be told, I have no idea if this is working or not. I&#x27;ve tried to diffuse citris and lemon essential oils in it using 3-5 drops of EO as instructed. I don&#x27;t smell a thing so I&#x27;m simply not sure is this is working or not.</li>
            <li> I had this vaporizer operating for about 2 hours.  The vapor was very weak.  After about 2 hours, I noticed that there was no more vapor and the LED lights were not on. Then I noticed a small puddle of water has leaked out the bottom.  At that point, not of the functions would work.  Amazon was very good about the return.</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser. For the price it is a good deal. The colors are great and very relaxing.  Jodi</li>
            <li> After trials with a different &amp; quite costly essential oil diffuser, the Greenair Spa Vapor is a very welcome item in our household.  Used on a regular basis without fail.  Easy to operate &amp; maintain.  Will be ordering a couple more to give as presents later this year.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. The changing light is so calming. I love how it automatically shuts off once the tank is empty.</li>
            <li> I read all the review and researched before ordering the Greenair Spa&lt;br /&gt;Vapor and decided on ordering it.  Unfortunately, it never worked for me.  The mist would never rise above the inside chamber and come out. I tried several suggestions on the reviews for getting it to work and it never did. I returned it.</li>
            <li> The Greenair Spa Vapor is an efficient product.  I cleaned and used it immediately after I opened the box.  Set up is fast and simple, and the Spa Vapor is the perfect size for any surface.  The ultrasonic mist quickly delivers essential oils into the air just as expected.  The multicolor changing LED light is calming, but can be turned off when not needed/wanted.  My children ask to use the Greenair Spa Vapor in their rooms at night.  There are special yet simple instructions on how to properly clean and care for this diffuser.  My husband and I plan to purchase another Spa Vapor soon.</li>
            <li> Operates great, highly recommended. I really like the color changing and the auto-shut off. I would buy this again. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This unit worked great the first several times, but about 10 minutes into the sixth time I used it, it quit working.&lt;br /&gt;The lights and the little fan still work, but the ultrasonic part that creates the vapor is kaput. I don&#x27;t think I used it for more than three hours total. I&#x27;m sure Amazon will replace it, but it&#x27;s still a hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this diffuser several times when someone in the family is sick.  It works great in diffusing the essential oils in the room.  I place 2-4 drops of oil in it and the room has a steady scent of the oils for several hours.  All the features work well, I&#x27;m very pleased.  Only cons are the writing on the inside (it shows the max fill water line), melts away from the essential oils, so it looks like a messy black writing.  There are lots of little bumps on the inside bottom of the diffuser- it can be tricky to clean around them between uses.  Overall I really like the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser now for 5 weeks and I like it.  It&#x27;s easy to fill, you can adjust where you want the mist to disburse.  Also, the automatic shut off is a nice feature.  I don&#x27;t use the changing color option, but I did try it and the colors are unobtrusive.  Two issues:  1. When you refill it, the inner plastic cover drips due to condensation.  2. It makes occasional bubbling noises.  In spite of these things I recommended it.  I use it every night to help with my sinuses and it really makes a big difference. I will update my review in 3 months.</li>
            <li> Product is not as dark in color as depicted, which is a positive in my book.  Great way to diffuse my DoTerra essential oils.  Lightweight, easy to use, turns off when out of water.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this! Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> It works well and uses very little water.  I hope it lasts a long time.  I probably need to buy a few more to cover more area!  It seemed to help our allergies when using lavender, lemon and peppermint essential oils.  I wish there weren&#x27;t so many different items on Amazon that all seemed the same but had different prices and different pictures which makes it confusing.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be cleaned after every 10 hours of use; that means after using it twice!  I go longer than that...</li>
            <li> Good price and easy to use. I use it a lot w/ my essential oils and it seems spread the smell around the room well. Love that it shuts off on it&#x27;s own when it&#x27;s empty too.</li>
            <li> I first saw this diffuser at a local health and wellness shop.  I liked the way that the vapor rose up into the air and how it looked.  My Wyndmere nebulizer of 4 years was looking a little worse for the wear (constant use, very few cleanings) and starting to make noise, so I thought it was time to move on.  I came home to check out the Greenair diffuser on Amazon and saw that quite a few people had issues with it breaking after little use.  I also saw the positive reviews though, and decided to go for it.  I felt like the product breaking was probably not the norm.  Well, I WAS WRONG- this product broke after ONLY TWO USES.  Luckily I saved my receipt and plan to return it, but I can&#x27;t believe a product could be sold like this that so easily breaks.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, it is cheaply made.  Shell out another 30 bucks and get a Wyndmere diffuser that will LAST.  That is what I am going to do once I return this POS</li>
            <li> Works for a month then stops working. Instructions say the device needs to be cleaned after each use.  Are they kidding?  Who has time to suit and clean a diffuser every day.  Not me.  WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well. Does not create a mist. Seems very cheaply made. Would not recommend this product. The changing light color was the only thing that seemed to work the way it was meant to.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just make sure to keep it clean!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is amazing!  It gives off instant mist and fills a room quickly!  It&#x27;s easy to clean and you don&#x27;t have to have the light on.</li>
            <li> i like it, but they don&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I am a user of doterra oils.  I have the 1 lotus diffuser they sell.  I wanted a few more diffusers to have in different rooms in the house but at nearly $90 each I could not afford that.  At just around $30 (and free shipping) this diffuser filled the need.  It is easy to use and runs for hours.</li>
            <li> I loved this product at first. It worked great, made my apartment smell amazing, and although the color changing lights are a little cheesy, I liked them! Unfortunetly, after about 4 weeks of almost daily use, and following the cleaning instructions religiously, it stopped diffusing. The lights still worked, as did the motor (or whatever it is that pushes the vapor upwards), but it wasn&#x27;t misting anymore. I tried the troubleshooting advice as explained in the packaging, but based on other reviews, it seems this product has a short lifespan. I am returning this to amazon and trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for the price. We had a problem with the first one we got, so I called the eight hundred number on the instructions and the sent me a replacement right away. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these.  The first one lasted 2 wonderful months.  I re-ordered a second one.  The day it arrived I filled it with water &amp; oil, to find out that it did not work at all.  Now in the process of sending it back.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have friends that seen mine and now have given me the money to get them one.  Works great with my essential oils.  will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> They dont last very long but for the price, its okay ... i use for my young living essential oils.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected especially for the price I paid.  Verry satisfied!!!!  I highly recommend this greenair spa diffuser.</li>
            <li> Worked great for almost 2 months. Def not buying another one. Lights still work but the water doesn&#x27;t pump anymore. My son is sad and hoping I can fix it. I clean it out daily so I do not know what the problem is. What a surprise that I cannot contact the seller! :(</li>
            <li> I finally found an instrument that really helps my breathing.  I would recommend this to anyone with sinus problems or dry bedrooms</li>
            <li> Love this little diffuser!  It works great, and is so portable I take it everywhere with me. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> You can barely smell it... I bought other diffusers that work way better then this... Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> We use the Spa Vapor with an essential oil blend for my son who has nighttime seizures.  I can&#x27;t say from a medical standpoint if it works, but it does soothe him and helps him feel secure when he goes to bed.  We like the light, cool mist and it diffuses the oil, well.&lt;br /&gt;We did have problems with the first one we ordered, but customer service with Greenair was outstanding!  I sent an email asking for help troubleshooting and I got a response from the President with suggestions; followed with a replacement unit, as well.  He made sure we were well taken care of!</li>
            <li> Love this!! Have bought several for gifts! Works very well&#x27;</li>
            <li> This lives up to my expectation. You add tap water and essential oils and it does exactly what it is supposed to do. My one year old nephew loves the color changing lights.</li>
            <li> I use this all of the time to diffuse my doTerra oils.  I ended up purchasing 2 more after this.  My only complaint is the red light.  All of the other colors are so cool and soothing.</li>
            <li> I use it every single night next to my bed with my oils and now i want another one for the living room!</li>
            <li> I am diligently cleaning this thing per the directions with vinegar following every use, so I hope it holds up. It is lovely. I use it without the lights which i believe would be annoying. There is no noise, just a lovely wafting fragrance of whatever essential oil I have opted to use.....As long as the machine does not crap out in the near future I will be a happy customer!!!</li>
            <li> I was really exited to get and use this product. Worked just fine for about 3 weeks- then stopped working. It recommends washing the unit out with vinegar and water after each use- which I did, but the unit still stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try a replacement product one more time- hopefully this was just a defective unit. I hope the second one works better.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my mother in law and definitely helped me when I was sick and couldn&#x27;t breath well during the night.</li>
            <li> It works really well and quickly fills the room with the smells of my essential oils.  I love the changing lights feature too.  I just ordered two more.</li>
            <li> Works ok. sometimes won&#x27;t turn on, I unplug, clean out, refill and try again, usually it works...</li>
            <li> Excellent buy for the money</li>
            <li> have to return it after 2 months, it wont turn on!</li>
            <li> Works great for near my workstation or on the nightstand.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for each of my children&#x27;s rooms.  They love the changing colors for the night light, and I love the way they sleep with the essential oils diffusing.  This has been an awesome little diffuser!  What a wonderful diffuser for a great price!  You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> received the product and was excited to use it. after one use it barely produced any aroma and did not work at all the second time. called the customer service number and they said they would send a new one that day which never arrived....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my acupuncture clinic to steam essential oils in the clinic.  I use it all day long for three days a week and it does a very good job.  It is small but people notice a good feeling right when they walk in.  Its functional but not beautiful (its plastic) so I put it in a less obvious place. It&#x27;s quiet and pumps out a nice steam so it moisturizes the air a bit. Definitely worth the price and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> This never worked properly, and somehow water ended up on the counter every time I used it.  I wasn&#x27;t please with the performance of this one, at all. I threw it away. I recommend the one from NOW, It is shaped like a cone, and it works very well each and every time.</li>
            <li> So far so good but it does not seem to be a product that will last too long. You can see it is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The product works as stated and provides surprisingly a very good amount of vapor. I will be picking up more for my kids rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also provide excellent and friendly customer support!</li>
            <li> This only put out a small mist. This my second one. Will definitely not waste my money anymore on this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought one 4 months ago and it has been running very frequently with no problems.  I just bought another one today for another room.  I work in the essential oil industry and have used many different diffusers from many companies and this is one of the best.  My only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t bigger to hold more water.</li>
            <li> This oil diffuser emits a fine mist (without the moisture) into the air, thereby producing a nice and passive therapeutic session each time you run it. It also displays 6 different colors that can be turned off if desired. The best part about this diffuser is its noise level; it&#x27;s virtually silent. One must remember not to use distilled water, as mineral content is needed to aid in the emission of vapor. The vapor covers approximately 250 square feet. This unit is also small and lightweight, which is always a good thing.  Overall, a good product that does the job.</li>
            <li> I have had this a while. And it has worked well. But it seems that one of the nodules is now showing through for the lights and all it does is keeps flashing. Not really wanting to order a new one at the cost.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve ordered 2 of these and we LOVE it!!!!! they work amazingly!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a Greenair Spa Vapor diffuser and it no longer worked after 7 weeks.  I called the company and they mailed another one to me in less than a week.  I enjoy the lights and the mist that this diffuser provides. Our family has found that it greatly reduces stress in our household.</li>
            <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t get hot. I can leave it on when I&#x27;m out and not worry about my dog getting it. I use it daily and love the very fine mist  it freshens my home with,  I put a few drops of a essential oil in. Don&#x27;t need the light changing colors but I don&#x27;t turn that part on. And in that price it was the best one out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month now and really like it.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with it, in fact the other one I had (which I see Amazon no longer carries) didn&#x27;t run as long and got everything around it wet.  I would have to put a towel under it whenever it was on.  Plus I love the color changing LED lights, creates a nice atmosphere.  I thought it might be a pain to have to clean it so often, but it&#x27;s really quite easy - just put in the water and white vinegar, let it sit for 15 or 20 minutes, then use the little brush.  Takes less than 5 minutes of my time.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for reasonably priced diffuser, just goes to prove that it doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive to be good!</li>
            <li> When I went to plug it in, there was sparks. I tried it again, with the same results,I was really looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li> Worked six tmes and then quit working...cheaply made!  Was cleaned and cared for per the Instructions but still won&#x27;t work....I would not purchase this unIt again!</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d my order on time!  This product does what it&#x27;s described to do.  No problems with this item thus far, &amp; I used it most all of the day.....I would recommend to others not wanting to start investing alot of $ for one!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this little vaporizer. I keep it on my nightstand, put my essential oils in it and it works wonderful. I also love the nightlight feature if I want to put it in a childs room at night too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read past the reviews and ordered this. It came, was obnoxiously loud with some &amp;#34;clicking&amp;#34; noise that was ridiculous..and there was, literally, NO vapor from the unit. I lowered the amount of water (which was ridiculously low) and it produced the vapor, but what&#x27;s the point? It would run for about 20 minutes on the little bit of water that I used. I was really disappointed because I wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> I have searched and reviewed for the perfect long lasting ultra sonic diffuser. This one is it!!!!! The first one i bought was young living $100 and that one stopped working within 3 months. I also bought 3 other off brands for over $50 each and returned them all (they stopped working completely). I figured i would purchase a less expensive one because i assumed these type of diffusers just don&#x27;t last long. This green air spa diffuser has proved me wrong. It is amazing. By far the best one i have bought. Not only because it has actually lasted but the amount of vapor it releases is amazing. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t come straight out the top is an added bonus for me because i can point it directly at me if i prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I will mention i use this item at least 3 times every day, i have it set directly on a hard surface (no cloth under it) and about every 3rd day i put a small amount of vinegar and water in it and clean out any oil residue. I have found if i fill it a little UNDER the recommended amount that the vapor is much stronger. Don&#x27;t over fill.&lt;br /&gt; I recommend if you are searching for a good quality long lasting diffuser this one will be perfect. It is simple with no extra bells and whistles, but it works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Great diffuser. Not as powerful as others but gets the job done. I like that it automatically turns off when water is too low. Easy to clean and the lights are fun!</li>
            <li> Sorry to be negative but it is absolutely useless.  A nice light at best but the vapour is barely there.</li>
            <li> I purchased the spa vaporizer in order to provide a clean background smell during our house showings. Cinnamon oil provided just the desired effect for us. The item has a self cutoff so leaving it running was not a concern. The item was the best combination of price and function for me when I was looking to purchase. The led lighting is a nice touch but not necessary for our intensions.</li>
            <li> Great but a little hassle to clean every single use and i wish it was a little thinner in width</li>
            <li> VERY happy with this diffuser.  It works perfectly, despite a TON of use, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  There is another brand that I also love (that one has a timer).  It makes me very &amp;#34;Smiley&amp;#34;, hint hint.  ;)  That one is a bit more expensive because of the timer, but I prefer than one in my toddler&#x27;s room.  I have 2 of both brands, actually.  Everybody wants their own!</li>
            <li> We LOVE LOVE LOVE this. We also have this paired with (). Seriously works well (as long as you follow the directions) and will be buying another soon!</li>
            <li> what a great value!&lt;br /&gt;I got this for under $30 and I ended up giving it my sons teacher for the class room.  It dispenses enough to fill the classroom, it runs for 4-5 hours and is easy to clean.  She has had no problems with it and has been using it for 4-5 months now.  Its a great unit.</li>
            <li> Never worked properly. The seller sent me a replacement and it also stopped working. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> DISLIKE the fact that 9 months into using this product, the mister stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Called customer service. They said it is non returnable, they WONT do anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;Warranty is only for 60 days from purchase date. Then, you&#x27;re outta luck and the money&lt;br /&gt;it cost to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;LOVED it while it worked.. added the perfect amount of moisture and oils to the air.&lt;br /&gt;WISH it would still work.</li>
            <li> I love mine!! I have had my 2 Spa Vapors for 8 months now and use them every day and have had no problems with them. You do have to be sure to clean off the little ceramic disk at the inside bottom with a little brush in between uses with vinegar and water ( or the essential oils could build up and clog it) and make sure not to clean the sensor because that is what indicates the water level and auto shut off...it is really simple to care for. Also be sure to keep it on a flat surface with no cloth placemat or anything underneath that could block the airflow of the fan and cause it to stop working. if you are not going to be using it everyday be sure to clean it out ( vinegar and water ) and dry it so it does not mold (be careful not to touch the sensor - I let mine air dry after use with the top off)... really easy to care for and a great investment if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> I am updating my review. Below you will see my original review....The company contacted me after this review and sent me a new base at their cost. Apparently some of the units that had a range of older production dates did have a flaw. The company has recognized this problem and has attended to it. My new base has had no problems at all and we are using the product several times a day due to my daughter&#x27;s asthma. I have changed my review from 1 star to 4 stars now that we don&#x27;t have any problems. I can aslo smell the oils much better with this diffuser.      I do not recommend this product. I had this product for barely over a month and it will no longer work. The light will come on but the diffuser will not come on any longer. It was not used on a daily basis and the water was never overfilled. Also, you had to sit right next to the diffuser to smell the oil fragrance no matter how many drops I added. Did not scent the room very well. It is not worth the money for this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser. I love the idea that it turns itself off when it runs out of water. My grandaughter likes the color changing of the product. The product arrived in a timely manner and was well packaged. Couldn&#x27;t have ask for any thing more of this little item.</li>
            <li> A very affordable option but still effectively diffuses Eos nicely.  The aroma is not overwhelming and also works excellent for therapeutic reasons</li>
            <li> Worked good at first, but died after about 5 months. I only used it a few hours at a time and maybe 2-3 times a week. I would expect it to last much longer for that amount of use.</li>
            <li> This is an economical way to diffuse essential oils.  I&#x27;ve been using mine nonstop for approximately two months and it&#x27;s still going strong!  You can&#x27;t choose what light is glowing, as they just slowly rotate from green, red, blue, etc., but you can turn them off completely and still diffuse.  The measurement line inside of the container did &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; away after a few weeks of constant use, but by that time you should know how much water to add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a necessity during the winter months to not only add moisture to the dry air, but diffuse essential oils like doTerra&#x27;s OnGuard to prevent winter sniffles.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a week of using it daily. I would run it once in the evening. The fan won&#x27;t turn on now.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is suspect. It broke on us within a week or two and when the seller sent a replacement it did not include another chord to plug it in! I would not purchase this item ever again, but would consider something from the seller because they at least &amp;#34;tried&amp;#34; to make it right.</li>
            <li> product is good.  i use it everyday for inhaling essential oils.  worth the cost.  it&#x27;s a more affordable model than others i&#x27;ve seen for more than $100.  works just as well.</li>
            <li> My first greenair was a gift and it broke After 3 weeks, thought it was a fluke. Purchased another one and its still working. I ordered three more and had to return two of the three within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Love this greenair diffuser. Price when ordering more  than 1 is great Use it everyday in my home for my allergies. Thanks I am going to order more</li>
            <li> Both my sister and sister-in-law love Greenair Spa Vapor.  I just had to get one too after I saw how great they work.  Sadly the unit I got was fritzy.  The company, Green air, gave me awesome, unbelievable customer service and worked with me to get my Spa Vapor working.  I love the amount of cool quiet thick vapor that comes flowing out.  There are great benefits to using this particular diffuser.  It holds 1 1/2 cups water and it will vapor for a long time, I&#x27;m talking about 3-5 hours at time. I&#x27;m able to put 5 drops of my favorite essential oil in the water and it helps calm and focus my Autistic children with their school work.  I want to use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish you could select a solid colored light rather than having it change in a random color pattern.  But you can run the unit without the lights.  The unit is so fabulous that I&#x27;d still keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a company that stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for several months and love it. The mist is not wet or messy. Clean up is amazingly simple. Works well for diffusing essential oils.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD THIS WELL OVER A MONTH AND IT WORKS GREAT  IT.  IT RUNS FOR ABOUT 5 HOURS ON ONE FILL.</li>
            <li> I use my therapeutic grade essential oils in this mister for different results. The mister has held up to ALL of them! I am very impressed. I am actually ordering another for my husband. The only thing I suggest is to use full strength White Vinegar during the cleaning process. When I diluted it, I wasn&#x27;t able to get the oil residue out of the chamber. Hasn&#x27;t harmed anything, and it is always cleaned after every use. Thank you for such a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> We were very happy with the way it functioned until it quit.  After reading more online reviews of this product we shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.  Most people got 2-6 weeks out of theirs.  My wife was gone for a week and I didn&#x27;t use it at all, so we got 4 actual weeks of usage, and the return window closed on Feb 16, it&#x27;s the 21st :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and hope you do more research on it than we did before we bought ours!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why on earth I bought a second one after my first one died but it died as well. It seemed to work so well at first I am very ashamed that I told several people to buy this product</li>
            <li> does what it says,  the buttons feel flimsy and you can&#x27;t quite tell if you have indeed turned it on.  I&#x27;ll probably spend 20$ more for a better quality one next.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time as the AquaMist.  I love it even more because it lasts about 4 hours and works great in a large room.  I have been using it&lt;br /&gt;daily for about 3 weeks &amp; have had no problems with it.  Has an automatic shutoff when the water runs out.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item.  My first was from a friend that had bought several for gifting...I said I was interested and she sold  me one.  I&#x27;ve been so happy I wanted to make sure I was never without one..this one is for my house in AZ.</li>
            <li> bought one and it didn&#x27;t work, but i threw out the receipt and box :-(  my 3yr just got sick and i needed one asap, so i ran up to vitaminworld or whatever its called, and bought one for $29, guess what DOESN&#x27;T WORK, not at all, its completely dead.  I am so beyond irritated with this product u have no idea.  Now i need one TONIGHT and have nothing.  I could scream.  My husband tried a different plug in it and well the light is working now, so really? ur gonna put a plug with your product that is THE WRONG VOLTAGE? wow awesome!!!!  but still no mist, just the light is working thats all.  Grrrrrrrr</li>
            <li> I love this! I love the pretty colors (which you can turn off if you want to), and you can see it going into the air. Very happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;Jenna</li>
            <li> I used this one time a day with reverse osmosis water and YL oils and it lasted about 3 weeks..I&#x27;M NOT IMPRESSED!!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this diffuser mists the essential oils and water.  I use it almost everyday.  After about 2 months it just stopped working.  No lights or mist.  The company replaced the unit even though the 30 day warranty had expired.  I appreciate that.  I&#x27;m hoping this one will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I had been using my Spa Vapor for a few months a few nights a week with no problem.  I followed directions for water level and temperature.&lt;br /&gt;It stopped providing a mist recently and I contacted the company via email.  They responded promptly and offered to send me a replacement unit at no cost.&lt;br /&gt;I received my replacement readily and it works fine.  The replacement came with a small cleaning tool and instructions to clean with hot water and vinegar daily.  This was not part of my original order, so maybe they realized that lack of cleaning was causing problems.  I hope it lasts more than a few months this time.&lt;br /&gt;I give their customer service 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now. It&#x27;s great! Love the light colors and the auto shutoff.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a friend of mine had one and said it worked well. I loved mine for the 2 days that it worked, but after that not so much! I returned it after only a week. I have since read some of the reviews and found out that quite a few people have had the same problem as I have had.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these spa vapor 6-7 years ago not sure if it was the same brand but it just quit working, so I figured I would go with one that looks just like it since it lasted so long. I am almost positive they are the same company. This diffuser works great. It is so quiet I forget it is on (my old one make a humming noise). The mist is nice and strong. I like that you can change the direction of the mist with out having to move the whole machine. The colors are nice but I like to sleep in the pitch black and the fact that I can turn the light off makes this perfect for me. One thing I really like better compared to my old spa vapor is that the power button is on the front not the bottom.</li>
            <li> This diffuser was recommended to me by a friend and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. We use it every day in our home and I also carry it along with me to births and appointments. It travels nicely. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Received my Spa Vapor yesterday.  It was packaged nicely, easy to put together and easy to use.  Love it already and I will purchase more for additional use in the house.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little diffuser for the money. Nothing fancy, and it won&#x27;t run longer that 3 hours max, but it diffuses beautifully.</li>
            <li> love, love, love  diffusing my oils with this! works great and shuts off automatically! going to have to get me another 1 for my house!</li>
            <li> I love this!  Helped with being closed up all winter . Colds and everything else. Use with my oils what a great find!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great.  Just don&#x27;t fill it to the Max Fill Line.  Half way and you will get some amazing fine mist.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  Perfect for a small room or office.  I&#x27;m buying my second one today for work. Might get a third for my daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> The on-off switch broke immediately. I like the way it diffuses but have to fiddle with it to get it to run.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great for diffusing the healing benefits of DoTERRA theraputic grade oils into the air.  Turns off automatically when water level is low and color changing lights can easily be turned off.  Try it!  Great diffuser at a great price.</li>
            <li> While I did order a clean air vaporizer it was supposed to come in the dark gray color shown in the picture.  It did not come that color, I got a silver one instead.  Not sure how much more I will be ordering from Amazon as the two products I ordered at the same time both came with problems.</li>
            <li> This vaporizer only worked correctly the first 2 times I used it. After that, I had to push the button multiple times. It usually took about 20 tries. The last times I tried it, I could never get it to work, so it ended up in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I am about to order my fourth, I have not had any issues with any that I have purchased thus far.  My suggestions to those that get a \\&quot;lemon\\&quot; return and get one that works.  Don&#x27;t settle for being disappointed and having a non-working unit.  I am now ordering one for work, I had given one to my daughter and I have two in the house.  Want to get one more for the house.  They work beautifully and great for going to sleep at night and for when cold season hits!! I use doTerra oils and they work beautifully in the diffuser!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my massage room. I use it all day 5 days a week. The changing colors and the cool mist have been great. Even my clients with allergies I can use my essential oils with no problem.</li>
            <li> When up plug cord into diffuser it creates a spark!!! My sisters cord burnt.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Extremely easy to use. Just fill with water to the clearly marked line and add a few drops of your favorite essential oils.  My kids love the way it lights up and all the different colors it makes. It is nice to use as a night light with calming oils at bedtime. The lights can also be turned off so that it isn&#x27;t using the lights during the day.  It is very durable - it has been knocked off the table a couple of times and didn&#x27;t break or crack. Even if it did, the price is so reasonable, it can easily be replaced.  I will be buying more of these very soon to have them in other rooms of the house. This was recommended to me by a friend and I will be recommending this to my friends and family as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is my 6 th . One. They are great gifts too.</li>
            <li> happy with it does what it says just as well as my expensive diffuser</li>
            <li> love it! I just wish it would last longer. it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> This is just the greatest aromatherapy mist machine.  It is not large and can be placed discreetly. It can also be placed out as a decoration because the body rotates interior colored lights.  The lights are subtle and soothing.  You can use what ever kind of aromatherapy oil you want in the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent many a day enjoying the peacefulness of this aromatherapy mist machine.</li>
            <li> only problem is the &amp;#34;fill water line&amp;#34; marker is a sticker and it fell off after first use.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I love this vaporizer especially when used with lavender</li>
            <li> I love this! I add essential oils to the water and it fills the room very quickly. I only wish it held more water. It will last a little over a couple of hours and shuts off when the water is gone. I want to get another one for my bedroom!</li>
            <li> This works great.  It shuts its self off when water is low.  The lights are relaxing.  Just clean the bowl with vinigar after every use and it will work well for you.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that this is the first diffuser that I have ever purchased, so I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference between this and a more expensive machine.&lt;br /&gt;So far though, I love it! I&#x27;ve only had it for a week but have used it pretty much constantly since I purchased it (3 times a day for several hours each time). I definitely notice the smell of the oil being dispersed throughout the room. From everything I&#x27;ve read the machine averages about 4 hours worth of dispensing time if you fill the water to the fill line, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s closer to 3 hours. Not a big deal though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that you have option off turning the lights off of the machine while it&#x27;s running, because I find them a little bit obnoxious (although my kids love them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;m thinking about buying another one to put up in my kids room as I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different oils that can help fight off germs and calm the child (I have a son with autism).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, i think this machine is pretty much perfect. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, isn&#x27;t hideous looking, is nice and quiet and dispenses the perfect amount of steam and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this diffuser for about 2 months now and still love it! I use it several times a day and it&#x27;s still running great. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one and will probably be making another purchase to put one in my kids bedroom soon.</li>
            <li> The changing colors are soothing. The steam function works great. It is easy to use. The only downside is I waited two and a half months to receive the product.</li>
            <li> I think it works great! I have bought more expensive ones that don&#x27;t preform as well as this one.</li>
            <li> Did not seem to do much.</li>
            <li> I use essential oils and this allows me to have the oils make my house smell wonderful and it helps my sinuses.</li>
            <li> Most of the diffusers that I have found - cost quite a bit more.  This is a real basic unit that works well for diffussing essential oils.  It does what it is intended to do without a lot of bells and whistles.  Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> I FRIEND HAD THIS ITEM. I HAD TO GET IT FOR MYSELF. I ORDERED THREE IN TOTAL (JUST IN CASE).</li>
            <li> Love it, would recommend it for anyone. Do not fill past water line and clean on regular basis for longer life</li>
            <li> Love this little diffuser.  It fits in a small space and diffuses nicely.  The colors are soft and pleasing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the price and good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I was sadly disappointed by this product. It is very nice looking and pretty colors however, mine will not blow out a mist. 😭&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried emptying it and refilling, repositioning the spout but nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Would be exactly what I wanted if it worked.</li>
            <li> Out of the seven sent to me, I had 5 go bad after 4-10 uses. The company is terrible at customer service. I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I buy something I like it to work. It shouldn&#x27;t be hard to use either. They told me I couldn&#x27;t pour water on the ceramic piece in the bottom, or that I couldn&#x27;t use filtered water (like it states you can on the packaging).I am scared that the one I do have that is working now will last untill I get a different brand. Pretty much sucks I have to resort to placing this information on here, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy another one, and would use one if it was given to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now, daily, and love it!!  Using Plant Therapy EOS in it and enjoy that I can diffuse in the morning, leave the house for hours and come home to find it still smelling amazing!  Not only am I getting the health benefits of the oils, but I am completely done with candles and fake scents in my home.</li>
            <li> It is a good little unit for aromatherapy therapy.  I would recommend using it with essential oils like purification in all rooms of the house, or in the bedroom with essential oil Peace and Calming in the bedroom at night.</li>
            <li> I bought three. All three died within 48 hours of each other like a well executed plan. Buy something nicer with better reviews. I used all three every night and rinsed them out and cleaned often.</li>
            <li> Initially, I loved this product and used it daily. The aroma was strong and  you can direct the mist. Worked well for only 2 months then quit working. I cleaned between uses and was very disappointed. I would not re-order this product. in reviewing, item there seems to be a trend. Buyer be aware!</li>
            <li> This has worked well for me. It is easy to use and clean, and it performs quietly and efficiently. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I only cleaned it once since I got this and used room temperature reverse osmosis water, not tap warm water like it said to do in the instructions.  I really did love it while it lasted using it with do terra essential oils.</li>
            <li> We now have 3 of these bad boys in our home and use them all on a daily basis.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The LED color changes are fun and non-intrusive, and they diffuse perfectly.  I saw other diffusers for much more money, but these have been doing exactly what we needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Stopped emitting vapor after a month!</li>
            <li> I liked it while it worked but it quit working about 6 months after I got it.  I would not buy again because I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Really love this diffuser for my doTERRA EO.  My only wish is that it would last longer ...</li>
            <li> i purchased the item in December and used it for about a month, approximately 4 times per week for about 2 hours at a time. It is now the end of February and the thing has not worked since the end of January. The lights go on and that&#x27;s about it. I would love to get a replacement, but can&#x27;t stand the hassle (and expense) of returns. I would be delighted if the seller got in touch with me for an explanation. In addition i purchased all these essential oils that i can&#x27;t use now. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday. I worked - sorta - once. I was not able to turn off the lights, the button didn&#x27;t respond at all. It did mist but I didn&#x27;t smell any of the essential oil I used, and I used a very premium grade oil. I tried it again today and it doesn&#x27;t mist AT ALL. And the lights still won&#x27;t turn off either. I cleaned it as stated in the product instructions (soaking it using a vinegar and water solution for 20 minutes and then cleaning with a brush) and that did nothing. I tried plugging it in to multiple outlets throughout the house. No change. I will be returning and purchasing a different brand.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this. Easy to clean and easy to use and the price was good. I use it with essential oils. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these diffusers - 1 for home, 1 for office and 1 as a gift. Two just stopped working! They were used according to directions and cleaned as recommended. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> This is great for diffusing essential oils. Puts out the perfect amount of mist. Light can be turned off if you want which is nice and the unit turns off automatically. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for two weeks and the lights the change colors is not working as well as went first received.  Tbe defuser works well.</li>
            <li> I was nervous after some of the negative reviews, but I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 2 months now, and I love it.  It makes my house smell great, and is very unobtrusive.  Just make sure to follow the directions when it comes to the fill line, too much water, and it will not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/13/13:  Very soon after posting this positive review, my unit stopped producing mist.  The fan still works, but no mist comes out.  I am waiting to hear from their customer service department...&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/5/13: after several calls and messages to their customer service department with no return call I have given up and considered this $32 down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> We love aromatherapy in our home and this difuser does the job for the price. We&#x27;ve ordered several of these and had issues with a few of them not working. Amazon has been so great to replace them immediately and so far so good!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these for use in my bedroom and living room. I use it for diffusing essential oils for smell, relaxation, and killing germs. I ended up giving one to my boyfriend as we found that diffusing lavender at night helped with his snoring!!!! I may have to order a few more.</li>
            <li> ITEM AS DESCRIBED, WE RUN THE CEILING FAN MOST OF THE TIME BUT THE CHANGING LIGHTS ARE FANTASTIC AND PUT MY DOTERRA CERTIFIED PURE THERAPEUTIC GRADE OILS IN  TO DIFFUSE. LOG ONTO doterra.com/hoodoomountainoils</li>
            <li> Great item for the price!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and was so embarrassed when it didn&#x27;t work the moment the recipient plugged it in. Needless to say it was returned.</li>
            <li> I used mine once and it stopped working...it shuts it&#x27;s  self off every 1to 2 seconds! A waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Silent air flow and beautifully back lit.  Woks as it said it would.</li>
            <li> Leaks and has buildup visible on outside. This is after about 10 days of not wiping outside with vinegar. It works for over 8 hours , if you can deal this amount of leaking.</li>
            <li> I ordered the first one, it arrived and the first night I noticed the \\&quot;off\\&quot; button did not work.  Had to unplug it to turn it off.  By the third night the mist just quit working.  So, I sent for a replacement.  The second one arrived.  The first night the mist would not even work.  They are both being sent back.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser and I have no regrets so far. It does its job and together with the use of essential oils its great..In terms of appearance..it has a bit of a cheap look but it works..I consider it to be such a great handy appliance..it gives the room a nice feel..a real sense of relaxation..love to use lavender..My daughter uses it in her room as a must to do her homework..and I can honestly see some change ..for one thing..the homework gets done and another she is relaxed and more focused..I would recommend this and I would buy another</li>
            <li> The mist is so weak and unremarkable, it produced no scent in a closet, and not for lack of sufficient oil application. Very disappointed. I have 2 other defusers, but this one is a dud. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> If you want to diffuse essential oils in your home this diffuser is great. First, it&#x27;s a great price, Second, it looks nice and the best thing about it is that it turns itself off when water/oil are gone. I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who diffuses oils. I have mine going every day. Easy to clean and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC PRICE! Love using my doTERRA oils in it! Works like a charm! My kids like how it has a night light option as well!</li>
            <li> Love this I work with children who are always sick I put peppermint in it and run it I have not got sick this year</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for the office and one for the living room. I use it with my doTERRA essential oils. It&#x27;s very portable, so I sometimes bring it from one room to another. Love it!</li>
            <li> Just got it and I start it up for the first time and its already broken. Fill it up to the line and drop in the oil and go to plug it In and as I plug it in to the unit it sparks....yeah. No thank you. I don&#x27;t wish to burn down my house cause of a faulty piece of junk. Returning. If I could give it zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after just a few uses, exchanged for a new one and had the same problem with the new one.</li>
            <li> I still have yet to get with the company to see if they will refund my $$. I should have listened to other reviews where the people said it would work for a few times then quit. I have cleaned it, then cleaned it again. Doing it the way they said with vinegar and water, etc.</li>
            <li> This diffuser really puts out the mist and I love the light changes but also love that I can turn off the lights completely for sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;It is very important to clean it frequently to keep it from getting sticky.</li>
            <li> I plugged this product in my bedroom. The lights work fine but you can&#x27;t detect the smell unless you put your nose right up against the machine. I added twice the recommended oil and a different oil brand and still nothing. Water leaked out of the bottom onto my antique furniture both times. This product is not worth the money.</li>
