            <li>not so much love for it.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to the fragrance many years ago by my sister-in-law.  </li>
            <li>GF&#x27;s favorite.  </li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume - one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It cost more at stores.  </li>
            <li>However, the cost was considerably more than I am used to paying for this product.</li>
            <li>I have worn this perfume for more than 30 years and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more selections in sizes of product, perhaps a travel size.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>When I found out I could still get it I was so excited!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a dear friend who mentioned to me that this perfume was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I was so fortunate to find it listed on AMAZON, and at the fairest price I ever bought it at.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>because I also got 2-day free shipping, it ,saved my butt on this Hallmark</li>
            <li>Will buy again if available</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!   </li>
            <li>Such a fresh and beautiful perfume.</li>
            <li>(Long time ago lol)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just always loved this perfume and it&#x27;s the only one my husband likes.  </li>
            <li>Also the amount you get for the price is a true bargain these days.</li>
            <li>It was purchased for my mother to replace an old bottle she enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>I could not believe how fast this item arrived!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon.com also!</li>
            <li>it works well for many women as it works with the body chemistry providing an individual scent.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me, either emotionally or physiologically, but I have come to love it as much as she did, and I have gotten several compliments from strangers in stores when wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON for making it available to me at the price you had it marked.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed this scent.</li>
            <li>I think this is my favorite perfume for a night out or a black tie affair...</li>
            <li>The main thing is that it has never changed in its fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy like some perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I think it was old.</li>
            <li>long lasting, sweet, feminine fragrance</li>
            <li>/&gt;the price is extremely high and my last order from you all looked like it had been chewed up by a dog.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was such a soft and alluring fragrance that I started using it.  </li>

            <li> This item arrived just as described in the review. It was purchased for my mother to replace an old bottle she enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I love Raffinee by Dana.  I have been wearing it for at least 30 years.  The problem is the price has gone up over the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the price is extremely high and my last order from you all looked like it had been chewed up by a dog.  I love this product.  Please help in any way that you can.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. Last go around was with the newer version.....not so much love for it. This? What I said.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness. This is definitely a french perfume...very sultry. Expect tons of compliments from everyone...I think this is my favorite perfume for a night out or a black tie affair...oh yes! Oolala girls..buy this one.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the fragrance many years ago by my sister-in-law.  I thought it was such a soft and alluring fragrance that I started using it.

            <li> I started using this when it came out.  (Long time ago lol) When I found out I could still get it I was so excited!  Didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed this scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just always loved this perfume and it&#x27;s the only one my husband likes.  I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> GF&#x27;s favorite.  Light fragrance.  Not heavy like some perfumes.  Long lasting.  GF spritzed dog and it lasted for at least 2 days.</li>
            <li> My mom wore this cologne for about the last 10 years of her life.  Her clothing was saturated with it and its scent still triggers memories of her.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me, either emotionally or physiologically, but I have come to love it as much as she did, and I have gotten several compliments from strangers in stores when wearing it.  It is sweet and old-fashioned, and very long lasting (at least for me).  Also the amount you get for the price is a true bargain these days.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this I just wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> This perfume is great. I have been using it for years.  It is hard to find now so I was glad I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> my wife liked it since it was a gift for Valentine Day,&lt;br /&gt;And because I also got 2-day free shipping, it ,saved my butt on this Hallmark holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably buy it for her again....</li>
            <li> Such a fresh and beautiful perfume. I wear in the evening and receive many compliments</li>
            <li> long lasting, sweet, feminine fragrance</li>
            <li> I could not believe how fast this item arrived! My Mom absolutely loved her perfume that I gave her for Christmas.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume - one of my favorites. However, the company has priced it out of my budget and I no longer buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Raffinee for years and to this day, I&#x27;m still getting comments.  I love it.  It cost more at stores.  That&#x27;s why I order it online and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding this parfume and now order it faithfully.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy. Nice fragance. Cross between a floral and a musk.&lt;br /&gt;Lighter than obsession .</li>
            <li> Raffinee is an amazing spray!  The smell is intoxicating and I get   compliments everywhere I go!  I&#x27;ve had men ask me the name of it, how  to spell it and who makes it! One gentleman actually told me that he  would have to tell his wife about Raffinee!  Ladies, I&#x27;m serious, this  fragrance is the bomb!  Even had women come to me and ask me what I was  wearing!  Raffinee is always going to be included in my fragrance collection!  Sincerely,  A Raffinee Fan!!!!!!!! Thanks to Amazon.com also!</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years. this shipment did not disappoint in terms of scent. However, the cost was considerably more than I am used to paying for this product.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for more than 30 years and I still love it. I wish there were more selections in sizes of product, perhaps a travel size.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT SMELLING STUFF. MAKES YOU DRUNK WITH LOVE WHEN SHE IS AROUND...GOTTA HAVE PERFUME. BUT BEWARE...CHILDREN ARE POSSIBLE RESULT OF WEARING THIS STUFF..SO....JUST BE CAREFUL....IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.</li>
            <li> I love Raffinee by Dana!  it works well for many women as it works with the body chemistry providing an individual scent.  This fragrance suits me with its floral/spice scent.  Whenever I wear this fragrance I always get lots of compliments!  I wish Dana would continue to manufacture Raffinee.</li>
            <li> Apparently no longer available - too bad because I have been wearing it for years!  Love it.  Will buy again if available</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and reminds me of Charles Of The Ritz Original which isn&#x27;t made anymore. It&#x27;s not exactly the same but it is close.</li>
            <li> It did not have the smell. I think it was old. I ordered multiple and I was not happy with the product.</li>
