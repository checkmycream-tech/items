            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>but i was so happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>After trying a lot of foundations, I&#x27;m so happy to have one that I love!  </li>
            <li>Maybe but it is a good makeup</li>
            <li>it leaves a nice dewy glow on the face &amp; covers face evenly &amp; the brush attachment is a great plus for easy application.</li>
            <li>Love this makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the brush applicator.</li>
            <li>I love the brush on top to apply.  </li>
            <li>Love the brush applicator.  </li>
            <li>does not strike me as over the top.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask?</li>
            <li>I went to L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s website to determine what shades are available and used that to compare to my own skin.</li>
            <li>and I love what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Easy &amp; love</li>
            <li>and I would easily pay $65 for another brand at a dept. store so $35.00 for 3 oz</li>
            <li>This makeup is so easy.</li>
            <li>The brush makes for easy application and it&#x27;s easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does give good coverage, Be sure to stand bottle upside down to ensure that cream comes out.</li>
            <li>goes and very smooth and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff, its not dry, and makes the skin look quite succulent!  </li>
            <li>The coverage is just right.  </li>
            <li>Quick ship as promised, new in original, sealed package</li>
            <li>but it does go on smooth, stays all day, does not dry your skin, blends perfectly, true color palate.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>I love this foundation but can&#x27;t find it in my local stores.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It might be worth it to write down the name of the shades you think best match your skin tone and then go to the L&#x27;oreal makeup section of your pharmacy to compare them with other products that come in that same color.</li>
            <li>so you can apply foundation either broadly or accurately to spots such as eye bags.</li>
            <li>I can finally achieve smooth application without getting the makeup all over my fingers.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes your skin glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finding the right tone for your skin is an individual experience but what I really like is the integrated brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great foundation that I&#x27;m sorry L&#x27;Oreal is discontinuing</li>
            <li>this goes on so smooth, hides imperfections and dark spots, and blends well!</li>
            <li>The names of the shades are not intuitive in terms of what you might normally think of as dark or light, so definitely don&#x27;t go by the name</li>
            <li>Very natural looking but not too sheer.  </li>
            <li>A lot of other makeup can look odd on dry skin spots and highlight them even more.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it will go bad, and the price was good.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it will go bad, and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores right now</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is dry and flaky right after washing and gets oily throughout the day, so I don&#x27;t usually apply it if my skin feels oily - those times I use a mineral powder foundation</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to a friend who has dry to normal to slightly oily skin.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly, a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A bit expensive - but worth it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like others do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when my skin feels very dry after washing (which is every morning)</li>
            <li> I think it is almost the same as it was in the tube, just a little dewier finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush us about an inch wide but with a slanted tip</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> The built in brush applicator makes it a snap to apply the makeup, although you need to be patient after you turn the dial to bring the makeup up into the brush - it sometimes is a little delayed and if you keep turning it, you&#x27;ll end up with a LOT of makeup on your brush!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is somewhat thick, so I would not recommend it for skin that is oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s being replaced by Visible lift \\&quot;Serum Absolute\\&quot; - NOT NEARLY AS GOOD A PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> But impossible to find.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this makeup. The brush is awesome!</li>
            <li> Best quality but worst shipping cost.</li>
            <li> I love the brush applicator. I can finally achieve smooth application without getting the makeup all over my fingers.  Hard to find in stores right now so I ordered from Amazon.  I hope it&#x27;s not being phased out.</li>
            <li> Always used the cream form of this which came in a tube, but they no longer make it, so now use this. Color is same as it was in tube form. I think it is almost the same as it was in the tube, just a little dewier finish.&lt;br /&gt;It does give good coverage, Be sure to stand bottle upside down to ensure that cream comes out. Use sparingly, a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I hope they bring it back to stores! Easy &amp; love the built in brush. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like others do.</li>
            <li> I love the brush on top to apply.  You are the only one that I have found that sells it.  Thank-you</li>
            <li> Love the brush applicator.  The coverage is just right.  Very natural looking but not too sheer.  After trying a lot of foundations, I&#x27;m so happy to have one that I love!  Please don&#x27;t stop making it, Loreal!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this makes you look younger as claimed but it does go on smooth, stays all day, does not dry your skin, blends perfectly, true color palate. But impossible to find. It&#x27;s being replaced by Visible lift \\&quot;Serum Absolute\\&quot; - NOT NEARLY AS GOOD A PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Finding the right tone for your skin is an individual experience but what I really like is the integrated brush. It makes for an even application without adding a mask of make-up. The brush us about an inch wide but with a slanted tip so you can apply foundation either broadly or accurately to spots such as eye bags.</li>
            <li> This is a great foundation that I&#x27;m sorry L&#x27;Oreal is discontinuing but I see I can still stock up so bought 3 bottles of it while Amazon still carries it. Hoarder you say? Maybe but it is a good makeup and I would easily pay $65 for another brand at a dept. store so $35.00 for 3 oz does not strike me as over the top. I know it&#x27;s my color, I don&#x27;t think it will go bad, and the price was good. What more could I ask?</li>
            <li> This is the best yet!  kill two birds with one stone...BRUSH INCLUDED!&lt;br /&gt;Great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;A bit expensive - but worth it!</li>
            <li> AH YES!  Another Loreal product that gets taken away from us.  This is amazing stuff, its not dry, and makes the skin look quite succulent!  I hope this seller keeps it around, as I was treated well and promptly.  I received it in 3 days!  THANKS SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> Quick ship as promised, new in original, sealed package</li>
            <li> Excellent price for this quality liquid foundation makeup.  Will definitely buy this product again.  It is no longer sold in stores.</li>
            <li> This makeup is so easy. The built in brush applicator makes it a snap to apply the makeup, although you need to be patient after you turn the dial to bring the makeup up into the brush - it sometimes is a little delayed and if you keep turning it, you&#x27;ll end up with a LOT of makeup on your brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is somewhat thick, so I would not recommend it for skin that is oily. I have combination skin that is dry and flaky right after washing and gets oily throughout the day, so I don&#x27;t usually apply it if my skin feels oily - those times I use a mineral powder foundation alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when my skin feels very dry after washing (which is every morning) this goes on so smooth, hides imperfections and dark spots, and blends well! A lot of other makeup can look odd on dry skin spots and highlight them even more. This stuff really makes your skin glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL WHAT SHADE YOU ORDER! I went to L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s website to determine what shades are available and used that to compare to my own skin. It might be worth it to write down the name of the shades you think best match your skin tone and then go to the L&#x27;oreal makeup section of your pharmacy to compare them with other products that come in that same color. (My local pharmacies have basically stopped selling this, which is why I started buying it on Amazon.) The names of the shades are not intuitive in terms of what you might normally think of as dark or light, so definitely don&#x27;t go by the name alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to a friend who has dry to normal to slightly oily skin. It seems to be promoted as an anti-aging makeup, but I&#x27;m 24 and I love what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation but can&#x27;t find it in my local stores.</li>
            <li> best liquid foundation i have used in years.  it has been discontinued in my local stores but i was so happy to find it on Amazon. it leaves a nice dewy glow on the face &amp; covers face evenly &amp; the brush attachment is a great plus for easy application.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. The brush makes for easy application and it&#x27;s easy to blend.  Doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, nor dries it out.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a long time.  goes and very smooth and looks very natural.  plus it has SPF protection.</li>
