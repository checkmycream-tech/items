    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent line for colored hair.</li>
            <li>However, this masque is the best conditioner for color I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Very good</li>
            <li>I got really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair as good as Absolut Repair one.</li>
            <li>It is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Great shipping, but the product itself is ok.</li>
            <li>Love you guys!</li>
            <li>Glad I found it at Amazon, it works wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li>Love what it does for my hair!  </li>
            <li>I just love this product, the smell...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal products for years and always been pleased.</li>
            <li>looks better.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>great job I.m sending a msg to my sister to buy the same</li>
            <li>It really does what it claims -- my color-treated hair is healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair styles more easily and overall</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good hair masque, but it was more liquid than I expected, so I used more than the usual with the others.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Expert Vitamino Color Masque from my hairstylist and when I saw that I could get it a lot cheaper on Amazon.com, I jumped at the chance to purchase another one.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and as promised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery, so I have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>could brush it in 5 seconds which would take me 5 mins with other masks :)</li>
            <li>I was very pleased and had a hard time finding it in the US, even at upscale hair dressers or beauty supply places.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few years and it is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>This is only product that I&#x27;ve used for color-treated hair that really works.</li>
            <li>I have coarse gray hair and have to color every two weeks because my hair grows fast.</li>

            <li> I have used this product when I lived in Malta and was recommended by my hairstylist out there.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years and it is fabulous.  Makes your hair feel and look like silk.</li>
            <li> Love you guys! What a product! I just put few amount in my hair and my hair became like butter could brush it in 5 seconds which would take me 5 mins with other masks :) great job I.m sending a msg to my sister to buy the same</li>

            <li> I got really happy with this product.It came on time, it wasn&#x27;t damaged and was what I was expecting.  Very good</li>
            <li> I just love this product, the smell... my hair is other after using it, softer!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had my hair colored in Germany and the hair dresser gave me a small trial size Masque. I was very pleased and had a hard time finding it in the US, even at upscale hair dressers or beauty supply places. Glad I found it at Amazon, it works wonders for my hair! Delivery was fast and as promised.</li>
            <li> Have used for several years.  Excellent line for colored hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal products for years and always been pleased. However, this masque is the best conditioner for color I&#x27;ve ever used. I have coarse gray hair and have to color every two weeks because my hair grows fast. Despite that the color fades before reapplication. And it feels \\&quot;good\\&quot; but never really silky. This product changed that--even though I only use it about once a week. I even got compliments on my hair--and nothing has changed but using this. My hair styles more easily and overall looks better. I&#x27;ll be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my hair!  Just wish it came in a pump format.</li>
            <li> un muy buen producto para mi cabello tinturado, muy recomendado estoy feliz el cambio para mi cabellos es muy bueno.</li>
            <li> Great shipping, but the product itself is ok. It&#x27;s very watery, so I have to use a lot. Plus it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair as good as Absolut Repair one. Tho it adds shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good hair masque, but it was more liquid than I expected, so I used more than the usual with the others.</li>
            <li> I have fine/thin hair and it&#x27;s the only conditioner I use. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair done and can use daily.</li>
            <li> I use this 2x week. I like it everything about it. The smell, the texture and the results. It is a good deal.</li>
