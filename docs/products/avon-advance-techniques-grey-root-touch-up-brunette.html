            <li>So, it may be more efficient to get color at your salon when you need it, but when you are pressed for time, this will do in an emergency.</li>

            <li>I have been using the Avon  Brunette Grey Root Touch-up for years - it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>This works wonderful on the grey.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The product has a nice, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and stays until you wash it out.</li>
            <li>For a half inch growth,  its ideal and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li>Love this for quick in between colorings touch ups.</li>
            <li>I covers well, has a nice applicator brush and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I now use a spray called Gray Away for Women that I find to  be a far superior product</li>
            <li>It provides great grey coverage allowing me to extend the time between coloring.</li>
            <li>Great solution to cover a bit of grey.  </li>
            <li>This gray coverage wand is easy to use, covers pretty well and is one of the most reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my black hair with auburn/copper highlights.  </li>
            <li>This product works great to cover grey and look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;.You</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t worth the 6 bucks</li>
            <li>This product works great for small touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>We tried several others, but this is his favorite.  </li>
            <li>The 2 in one grey touchup product I buy from CVS is much better.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I love this touch up for hiding my grey roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have grey roots that need touching up in between visits to the salon.  </li>
            <li>Too bad Avon discontinues so many items that are great.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than anything in stores and getting harder to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a cross between cheap perfume and baby products.</li>
            <li>It really works well---</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really cover my grays like I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others and they don&#x27;t go on smoothly, they are noticeable and they mess with the way my hair wants to lay.</li>
            <li>The smell is soft and not unpleasant and once it&#x27;s dry, you don&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
            <li>and I live overseas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very mascara like consistency, but it stays in your hair pretty well until your next wash and hides grey really well.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, not stiff or sticky like others.</li>
            <li>One - The brush is too soft and it does not transfer the color well when I apply it.</li>
            <li>Product seemed old; put it on roots and didn&#x27;t stay on...</li>
            <li>I like the fragrance, but it seems a bit watery and doesn&#x27;t cover as well as WOW</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products with harder brush bristles that work much better.</li>
            <li>Also the scent is so strong and not very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Not sure how long I will be able to get it through Amazon</li>
            <li>I have to go slowly when opening it as it can &amp;#34;spray out&amp;#34; if opened quickly.</li>

            <li> I have to go slowly when opening it as it can &amp;#34;spray out&amp;#34; if opened quickly.</li>
            <li> However, if you have several inches of grey showing, I can see where it might not work as well.</li>
            <li> use it on my greying eyebrows and it does cover the grey.</li>
            <li> The product does do what it says which is cover my grey roots.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my husband&#x27;s side burns where he is turning grey.</li>
            <li> The texture was on the dry side.</li>
            <li> There is barely anything inside it,  this type of products not sure why it doesn&#x27;t have proper seal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product is old or what,</li>
            <li> The  brunette color is not that dark as I have a lot of blonde  highlights</li>
            <li> Other than the tip of the brush with a blob of product, the rest of the brush is basically dry.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.....</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It looks like the container is empty.</li>
            <li> After having spent weeks without a chance to go to the hair dresser</li>
            <li> the product came empty.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it, it doesn&#x27;t cover the grey and only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> The brunette is not that dark, but it covers the grays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed the black version of this, and while my review there was just I like it.</li>
            <li> There is a perfumey smell, sort of like some shampoos, and a slight stiffness, like hairspray or gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s dried out or something.  </li>
            <li> Apply when hair is towel dried but still damp.</li>
            <li> I have been using Avon Root Touch up to cover my roots for at least 6 yrs now.</li>
            <li> Dried out and poor coverage</li>
            <li> The color is subtle and I do not detect a fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to apply and did not cover evenly.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t work well and the product was goopy on the wand and at the base of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Awful mascara brush</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Awful mascara brush it isn&#x27;t worth the 6 bucks</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It provides great grey coverage allowing me to extend the time between coloring. I&#x27;ve been using this for years.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast service!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it, it doesn&#x27;t cover the grey and only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t work well and the product was goopy on the wand and at the base of the cartridge.  My immediate instinct was to send it back!</li>
            <li> It is everything I had hoped it would be! Just like my hair stylist said it would be!</li>
            <li> Great to cover the grays in between touch ups. LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I just have a streak of white hair in front. The brush is like a brush for eyelashes, you can dip it and apply forever, and it doesn&#x27;t take the color. The brush tends to stain the scalp better than the hairs.</li>
            <li> Dried out and poor coverage</li>
            <li> I have tried several root touch up products for use that last week before visiting the stylist. This has been the best one by far. I covers well, has a nice applicator brush and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Does not cover grey,doesnt last all day,will will not buy again!</li>
            <li> Covers well, but can fade; can require a touch up or two before heading out. The product has a nice, fresh smell. I like that it&#x27;s not clumpy or waxy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase. The color is subtle and I do not detect a fragrance. I would definitely recommend this product for covering gray flyaways.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great and has a lovely scent. After showing the results to three of my friends, they ordered it too.</li>
            <li> This product works like a mascara for your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off, stays in until i wash my hair, and covers my gray until I color my hair.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product did not work well for me.  It was difficult to apply and did not cover evenly.  I now use a spray called Gray Away for Women that I find to  be a far superior product</li>
            <li> This gray coverage wand is easy to use, covers pretty well and is one of the most reasonably priced.  It does only last one day so it has to be applied daily.  I doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I think Avon had discontinued this product, so I was really happy when I found it on Amazon. It&#x27;s easy to use and stays until you wash it out. It is a perfect match for my hair color.</li>
            <li> I use this between trips to the salon for color.  It&#x27;s better than anything in stores and getting harder to find. I was surprised and happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> use it on my greying eyebrows and it does cover the grey. I have to go slowly when opening it as it can &amp;#34;spray out&amp;#34; if opened quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Avon  Brunette Grey Root Touch-up for years - it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> This product works great to cover grey and look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;.You can use it all over your head or just around your face. I just wish it was in waterproof.</li>
            <li> My husband has gray hair coming in on his sideburns, and he requested that I find a product to help. We tried several others, but this is his favorite.  Covers the gray, is cheap, and the color looks great.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.....Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This works wonderful on the grey. Covers great and it smells very light. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product - have tried others, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> This product is in a mascara like tube.  I&#x27;m not sure if the product is old or what, but when I pull out the brush it has the tiniest bit of product just on the end of the brush.  It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s dried out or something.  Other than the tip of the brush with a blob of product, the rest of the brush is basically dry.  Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it works great!</li>
            <li> Works great on my black hair with auburn/copper highlights.  Just wish it was a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> This is an Amazing product. I can no longer find it on the avon site. I was thrilled to find it and will always want more.</li>
            <li> It looks like the container is empty.There is barely anything inside it,  this type of products not sure why it doesn&#x27;t have proper seal.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  The color didn&#x27;t stick to my hair with the wand or by using my fingers.  The texture was on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent. Leaves hair soft, not stiff or sticky like others. The best of all hair mascaras I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The product does do what it says which is cover my grey roots. But I have two complaints. One - The brush is too soft and it does not transfer the color well when I apply it. I have to go over the strands multiple times to get the color on. I&#x27;ve used other products with harder brush bristles that work much better. Also the scent is so strong and not very pleasant. It&#x27;s like a cross between cheap perfume and baby products. The 2 in one grey touchup product I buy from CVS is much better. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed the black version of this, and while my review there was just I like it. After having spent weeks without a chance to go to the hair dresser I have to admit I love this touch up for hiding my grey roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very mascara like consistency, but it stays in your hair pretty well until your next wash and hides grey really well.</li>
            <li> Love this for quick in between colorings touch ups.</li>
            <li> Product seemed old; put it on roots and didn&#x27;t stay on... It was watery and had an odor! Waterproof mascara does a better job.</li>
            <li> I LOVE thus product from Avon.  It really works well---goes on smoothly and blends in  nicely onto the hair.</li>
            <li> This will get you through an extra couple of weeks until that next hair appointment.  One tube will last about a 18 months.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really cover my grays like I had hoped. Formula seems a bit watery. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> In a pinch, this covers your gray and you can go out without embarrassment.  But, with one shampoo, it is gone.  So, it may be more efficient to get color at your salon when you need it, but when you are pressed for time, this will do in an emergency.</li>
            <li> I have been using Avon Root Touch up to cover my roots for at least 6 yrs now. It goes on easy, blends well with my hair color and hides those greys beautifully! I even use it on my husband&#x27;s side burns where he is turning grey. It works like magic in between hair colorings and I won&#x27;t leave home without it. The smell is soft and not unpleasant and once it&#x27;s dry, you don&#x27;t really smell anything. No one can tell it is there. I&#x27;ve tried others and they don&#x27;t go on smoothly, they are noticeable and they mess with the way my hair wants to lay. This is the one product I have found that does none of those things and I always keep 2 on hand!</li>
            <li> It goes on well, without any clumps at all. The brunette is not that dark, but it covers the grays. There is a perfumey smell, sort of like some shampoos, and a slight stiffness, like hairspray or gel. The fewer grays you have, the better this will look -- no surprise there! But all in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> Great solution to cover a bit of grey.  It blends in well and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> the product came empty. I can´t send back because I just saw in my home and I live overseas. I wouldn´t buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works great for small touch-ups.  Not meant for coloring every root on your head.  I even use it on my eyebrows, which are graying.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product. I have grey roots that need touching up in between visits to the salon.  Tip:Apply when hair is towel dried but still damp. The  brunette color is not that dark as I have a lot of blonde  highlights and  it just blends perfectly. I have tried mousses and powders  that need lots of strokes to get the job done. However, if you have several inches of grey showing, I can see where it might not work as well. For a half inch growth,  its ideal and you cant beat the price! Love it. Too bad Avon discontinues so many items that are great.</li>
            <li> love It.  Only wish Avon didn&#x27;t discontinue you it.  Not sure how long I will be able to get it through Amazon</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance, but it seems a bit watery and doesn&#x27;t cover as well as WOW</li>
