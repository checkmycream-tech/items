            <li>The best oil- pricey, but lasts forever.</li>

            <li>It smells great, too.</li>
            <li>This works almost perfect but very pricey!  </li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>and so glad to have found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>amazing product that leaves your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>Has a lot of wonderful natural plant oils that make your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about the shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Hair is healthier and is more protected from the heat caused by styling when I use this oil.</li>
            <li>Love it .  </li>
            <li>In fact, just because it is Shu Uemera, it is probably full of very fine ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it any more effective than pure camellia oil or argan oil, and it is heavier than those.  </li>
            <li>My hair dries out easily after color treatments, but this helps a lot.  </li>
            <li>Makes my curly hair easy to brush</li>
            <li>Great soft clean scent.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic and works well in hydrating my hair.  </li>
            <li>Decided to get my second bottle through Amazon and it arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad oil by any stretch of the imagination.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my hair to be healthier and protected, it smells good and makes your hair softer since the firsts applications; and you just need a little amount with every application so it lasts a year or so</li>
            <li>--most of them are really worth the price due to their effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Though very stunning, as you can see from the pix, the bottle is see-through and the writing is TINY, TINY because it is written in about 7 languages.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>more then I expected!</li>
            <li>This has a very gentle scent that is completely tolerable.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel good, and you only need a little bit</li>
            <li>Makes your hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>Not effective for fine hair.</li>
            <li>As for shine, I&#x27;ve found other products that work better, and in my opinion, this oil even dulls a little bit.  </li>

            <li> Makes your hair feel good, and you only need a little bit</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> Not effective for fine hair.</li>
            <li> As for shine, I&#x27;ve found other products that work better, and in my opinion, this oil even dulls a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, the box it comes in is crystal clear with an elaborate floral graphic on the opposite side of the TINY print directions and TINY print ingredient list--this makes the ingredient list absolutely impossible to read without removing product from box (in order to avoid looking through 3 layers of tiny text and a graphic).  </li>
            <li> I have very heavy, thick, dull hair, so I am always looking for a super light oil that leaves terrific shine.  </li>
            <li> (and I have long hair) even using it daily.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pricey, but can last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I like to let my hair air dry about 80% and then apply it from the middle to the ends before bed.  </li>
            <li> Alas, I don&#x27;t think this oil is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Smells good without being horribly perfumey.</li>
            <li> Not to greasy and won&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> And, even then it is almost impossible to read the box without breaking it open, and laying it flat against plain white paper and viewing through a magnifying glass.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasted me over a year and half!  </li>
            <li> Once you do all that, you may be disappointed to find that the first two ingredients are cones followed by camellia oil.  </li>
            <li> So, no more than 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive but lasts a long time.  </li>

            <li> --most of them are really worth the price due to their effectiveness.  Alas, I don&#x27;t think this oil is worth it.  I have very heavy, thick, dull hair, so I am always looking for a super light oil that leaves terrific shine.  Based on reviews, I bought this oil but I don&#x27;t find it any more effective than pure camellia oil or argan oil, and it is heavier than those.  As for shine, I&#x27;ve found other products that work better, and in my opinion, this oil even dulls a little bit.  This is not a bad oil by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, just because it is Shu Uemera, it is probably full of very fine ingredients. However, I can only judge by effectiveness on me (3 stars), and for the price, I have to give it 2.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional problem is the packaging.  Though very stunning, as you can see from the pix, the bottle is see-through and the writing is TINY, TINY because it is written in about 7 languages.  Moreover, the box it comes in is crystal clear with an elaborate floral graphic on the opposite side of the TINY print directions and TINY print ingredient list--this makes the ingredient list absolutely impossible to read without removing product from box (in order to avoid looking through 3 layers of tiny text and a graphic).  And, even then it is almost impossible to read the box without breaking it open, and laying it flat against plain white paper and viewing through a magnifying glass.  Once you do all that, you may be disappointed to find that the first two ingredients are cones followed by camellia oil.  So, no more than 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I love it!</li>
            <li> This works almost perfect but very pricey!  Will get it again.</li>
            <li> You get a beautiful shine to your hair without it being greasy.  Just a few drops go a long way.  Rub it in your hands before putting it&lt;br /&gt;on your hair. I get so many compliments about the shine to my hair.  I just love it!</li>
            <li> As described. On time. Love this oil!!! Been using it for 3 years and so glad to have found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It really helps my hair to be healthier and protected, it smells good and makes your hair softer since the firsts applications; and you just need a little amount with every application so it lasts a year or so (and I have long hair) even using it daily.</li>
            <li> more then I expected!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and works well in hydrating my hair.  My hair dries out easily after color treatments, but this helps a lot.  You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot, just 2 pumps does the trick.  I like to let my hair air dry about 80% and then apply it from the middle to the ends before bed.  One bottle lasted me over a year and half!  Decided to get my second bottle through Amazon and it arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome. Smells good without being horribly perfumey. I can&#x27;t stand smelly hair products. This has a very gentle scent that is completely tolerable. Makes your hair feel good, and you only need a little bit so it&#x27;s pricey, but can last a very long time. Has a lot of wonderful natural plant oils that make your hair healthy. You can use it on your skin too.</li>
            <li> Not effective for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Great soft clean scent.  Makes your hair shiny and soft.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive but lasts a long time.  I have been using it for 18 months.</li>
            <li> Best oil ever. Period. Makes my curly hair easy to brush and it smells like a dream. My hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> The perfect hair oil! Not to greasy and won&#x27;t weigh your hair down. Hair is healthier and is more protected from the heat caused by styling when I use this oil. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> amazing product that leaves your hair shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is the best smoothing and nourishing products on the market.  Love it .  Thanks</li>
            <li> This oil for your hair conditions and smoothes. It smells great, too.</li>
            <li> The best oil- pricey, but lasts forever.</li>
