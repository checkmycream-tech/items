            <li>This truly is an incredible product.  </li>

            <li>The product was good for what made it to me !</li>
            <li>Again, the product was good, it was the customer service that I had a problem with !</li>

            <li>Outstanding beard softening combined with superb lather provides for a perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>(C.O. Bigelow) and smells great too.</li>
            <li>Great shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I discovered them on a trip to London, since then it has been great to find that I can purchase their products via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I were stranded on a desert island, this would be a great cream to be stranded with.  </li>
            <li>Great shave, great product</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I have greatly reduced that irritation and ingrown hairs with this product and the help of a pre shave oil.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream smells great and seems like it would be soothing to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a great deal too for the price.</li>
            <li>Lathers up great.  </li>
            <li>Great smell.  </li>
            <li>, the smell is amazing and it is just all around the best in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>, Petal Pusher Fancies, all great , organic products, give them a try.</li>
            <li>lathers up like whipped cream, and has a great coconut scent.</li>
            <li>Whips up very nicely.</li>
            <li>Very nice product</li>
            <li>Scent is amazing as others have pointed out!</li>
            <li>really nice!</li>
            <li>Good smell great lather</li>
            <li>Lather and scent are most excellent, I must say.  </li>
            <li>All of their shaving creams are excellent and they have many to choose from.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to lather and provides excellent glide and cushion during your shave.</li>
            <li>The coconut cream has a very light smell, which I like, and it feels very good on your skin.  </li>
            <li>great shaving cream, with great moisturizing properties, also if you love the smell of coconut and the tropics</li>
            <li>But this stuff works just as good.</li>
            <li>Try it out, good gift idea and always in stock: http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/product/index.jsp?productId&#x3D;3107645&amp;cp&#x3D;4090261.4090360.4248380</li>
            <li>All you need are a good shaver, blades, a good badger brush, and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li>Heard good things about Trumper</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Coconut Oil, Rose, and Almond scented - they are all great.</li>
            <li>I can assure you this is about as good as you can get.</li>
            <li>Has a good scent.</li>
            <li>It does not give me as good of a shave as I thought it would, but I don&#x27;t mind having it in my collection.</li>
            <li>It has this great coconut fragrance and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>The smell is intoxicating and once you get the lather figured out for the consistency you like you will get some of the best and most enjoyable shaves.</li>
            <li>Coconut version doesn&#x27;t smell as good as sandalwood but lathers much better!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it even for those who still use disposable cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>The oils are really nice and provide a good shave, but I would prefer a fragrance that lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Outstanding very nice Coconut aroma</li>
            <li>The TOBS produces a great shave and smells amazing, but the quality of this shave was better.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent!</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth!!  </li>
            <li>the scent is very nice and not too strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s simply amazing and the smell is to die for.</li>
            <li>Smell is amazing and hangs around for awhile which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Amazing lather.  </li>
            <li>Shaving cream mitigates skin dryness and provides a great smooth lather.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>the amazing coconut aroma is all but gone.</li>
            <li>Smooth, creamy and smells great while shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is plenty of shave creams and soaps out there that are paraben free and work great .</li>
            <li>The coconut smell is a nice touch but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you are not used to use this kind of  shaving creme find a youtube video that shows the instructions.</li>
            <li>Nice lather and protection.</li>
            <li>Lathers up really nice and protects well.</li>
            <li>I would say both products are about equal: great, luxurious lather for a well lubricated shave, But the TOBS also maintained its wonderful aroma during the shave.</li>
            <li>I also recommend the Rose and Violet fragrances.  </li>
            <li>The coconut scent is strong, but not overpoweringly so, and it lends a pleasant, relaxing feel to your morning shave.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, pleasant, but not my favorite, but the quality of the shave</li>
            <li>But it has a great lather ability and great for sensitive skin, like mine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have overwhelming amounts of fragrance mostly noted by cheaper brands trying to pass of good stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>This Coconut Oil Soft Shave Cream by Geo F. Trumper is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I love opening up the jar throughout the day just to smell that awesome natural coconut goodness!</li>
            <li>Smells great and really lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as described, happy with purchase</li>
            <li>It lathers well and gives a very smooth shave</li>
            <li>Has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>Thought it would have a more coconutty smell.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t potent to me.</li>
            <li>Bummer because my favorite part of shaving is the smell when I mix my lather.</li>
            <li>This is a truly outstanding shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The coconut oil shaving cream is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I like this one most.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Most of them are ok.</li>
            <li>and it is way better than the &#x27;just ok&#x27; shaving foams and gels i have tried before.</li>
            <li>It seems like it protects my skin better not alone when I am shaving but also during the day.</li>
            <li>As noted a better cream than Taylor of Bond.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The only criticism I&#x27;ll make is that I&#x27;d hoped to have a more impressive scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the coconut.</li>
            <li>I think most of us have way more product than we&#x27;ll ever use</li>
            <li>but we love the over indulgence.</li>
            <li>Anyway I prefer GFT products the most and</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this not knowing what I was getting into and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It makes shaving more interesting.</li>
            <li>This used to be my favorite shaving cream until i tried Art of Shaving Sandalwood scent.  </li>
            <li>As much as I love the TOBS, I&#x27;d have to say this gave me a better shave.  </li>
            <li>The TOBS smell is much much better.  </li>
            <li>and the difference was even more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>When I finished, my skin was smoother and seemed more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very rich.</li>
            <li>Glad I did...the consistency of the cream is every bit as good, the fragrance is pleasant, and I get an extra 10 grams for a couple of bucks cheaper.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream has a very clean scent.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream + a Feather blade is the single best shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>You just have to use a good brush to really lather it and work some of the moisturizers into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This definitely is my favorite shave cream and worth the price!</li>
            <li>I honestly questioned spending this much on a shaving cream with there being so many comparable products</li>
            <li>Easy to work with any brush.  </li>
            <li>Easy to lather.</li>
            <li>It rinses off easily and a breeze to apply and lather.</li>
            <li>but it is a quality product that I can easily recommend.</li>
            <li>The coconut smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a strong coconut scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild but very smooth and cushioning.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be able to whip up a face full of clouds.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have sensitive skin and want an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>Gives a really smooth shave with my DE razor.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as cheap as it seems.</li>
            <li>and I have uses many different types of shaving creams and so far Geo F. Trunper is the best brand.</li>
            <li>Just been reading about parabens , and don&#x27;t feel comfortable using any product that has them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only &amp;#34;criticism&amp;#34; is that the scent is nice in the tub, but once I put it in my shaving bowl and whip it into a lather I don&#x27;t smell that nice coconut aroma.</li>
            <li>This cream works into a beautiful smooth lather, especially with it, and I get great smooth shaves with minimal nicks and irritation.</li>
            <li>The latest addition to my supply is the Coconut oil fragrance--it is just like all the others I have--excellent quality, very creamy and easy on the face.  </li>
            <li>I have used this brand in the past and find it to be on of the best on the market for me.</li>
            <li>Worth the price !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of Taylor of Old Bond Street creams and while Taylor still makes a great product, Trumper&#x27;s Coconut is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried from other companies.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The regular Proraso shave cream is the best value if your skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine-</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great cream, but it is very comparable to Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Street creams</li>
            <li>However, the cream is soft, smooth, and lathers up really nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy smooth with a mild scent of coconut oil that fades soon after the shave but is pleasant while it last.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product that gave me an even better shave than I thought was possible.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted something better and this certainly fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and leaves skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It feels awesome, lathers unbelievably thick and slippery.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done with your shave, your skin will be nice and soft-</li>
            <li>It has a very manly smell, whereas this is more neutral.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I could have easily lost my senses and eaten this cream upon first smell.</li>
            <li>The scent of coconut is rather mild</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and consider myself to be super picky.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal GFT shaving cream customer.  </li>
            <li>All the same, I&#x27;m very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li>The density of the cream in the jar is amazing, you instantly feel that it is something special.</li>
            <li>I do believe I have found a new favorite shave cream.</li>
            <li>used to be my #1 cream but after using this, I now have a new favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, just a small amount whips a good lather.</li>
            <li>Very creamy smooth lather.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the quality is well worth the price and 2)</li>
            <li>Fresh coconut scent.</li>
            <li>Worth it IMO.</li>
            <li>Experiment and have fun pamper yourself. :</li>
            <li>This stuff is so exhilarating, I think I could go mental.  </li>
            <li>someone that&#x27;s used most of the well known brands (Truefitt &amp; Hill, Art of Shaving, Taylor of Old Bond St., and even some designer brands like Hermès)</li>
            <li>The most natural and well-defined coconut scented shave cream on the market.</li>
            <li>a small amount is necessary for a close, comfortable shave so it is also an excellent value.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not using a fine shaving brush, there&#x27;s no point using such a fine cream to shave with.</li>
            <li>, you may also like:  Mastey Traite Sulfate Free Normal</li>
            <li>None of these are the case, in fact it hits all the right notes and smells pretty darn manly for a coconut fragrance.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away my first time using this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cream lathers quick and is intense.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its worth $30, because the Proraso&#x27;s White Tub Soap ($10) and Taylor&#x27;s Avocado Cream ($15) both give me a better shave.</li>
            <li>and I received the item very fast.</li>
            <li>This cream is for those with discriminating taste and for those who prefer a \\&quot;pure and natural\\&quot; coconut scent as opposed to the synthetic car wash or powerful air-freshener type</li>
            <li>i started to do a little research and this one seemed like a good thing to try.</li>
            <li>As with all Trumper products this one is first  rate.  </li>
            <li>I first got it for him in London at Trumper and he hasn&#x27;t used anything else since.</li>
            <li>so this ought to last me a year or more.</li>
            <li>: I was hesitant to make this price jump at first but 1)</li>
            <li>Again stellar.  </li>
            <li>I have many shaving products since I got back into DE shaving.</li>
            <li>so why would you pay more for the same thing?</li>
            <li>First class product with integrity.</li>
            <li>I just wet my face with a warm washcloth and apply the cream with my fingers without any brush.</li>
            <li>First, I adore anything coconut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving creams and bought this on a whim.</li>
            <li>I really love the shave I get with that, but I decided to try this just as something different.  </li>
            <li>It just has a subtle scent and produces a great lather and soothing surface for shaving.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a straight razor, but it would be appropriate for cartridge or double edge razors as well.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the scent subdued - it doesn&#x27;t over power you like the aerosol brands, but it leaves the skin much smoother and the razor glides more</li>
            <li>Using a superfine badger brush and an almond sized amount of cream I can quickly create plenty of full of rich, thick lather for three passes.  </li>
            <li>Other products work as good or better for less money.</li>
            <li>This is exactly was real coconuts smells like.</li>
            <li>No more nicks or cuts, and acts as a great conditioner for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So I would say this is probably just about a year&#x27;s worth for someone who shaves their full face daily.</li>
            <li>It contains pure coconut oil</li>
            <li>It is important that you use a brush with this product (e.g., [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]), as you won&#x27;t get the same silky lather if you try to apply it with just your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There actually really isn&#x27;t much smell to coconut</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real fan of Geo F. Trumper shaving products.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know how well this moisturized until I used it on the ship and went out to the port of call.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps cushion your shave in addition to seal up your skin</li>
            <li>Additionally, it left a smooth shave and a moisturized face.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all the modern type shaving foams and gels from cans.</li>
            <li>They are very helpful.</li>
            <li>Light smell only.</li>
            <li>For a fantastic traditional style shaving experience, this is a must have cream in your cabinet.</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>I use a DE safety razor and a straight.  </li>
            <li>This has actual high grade coconut oil which really REALLY works into the lather and makes it very lubricating and smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but not a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Another of my favorites, the scent is subtle enough and refreshing while providing an incredibly rich and smooth lather.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin, helps shave close without wounding, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You may also like my other favorite things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I know, with all the strife going on in the world it seems a bit excessive to spend more than $60.00 a pound for shaving cream, but in this case it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that likes the smell of coconut and wants a close shave.</li>
            <li>I like it more than Castle Forbes and Razorock (Previous favorites).  </li>
            <li>an added bonus over Taylor products, the tub in which the cream came was filled to the top, whereas the majority of the Taylor creams I&#x27;ve purchased in the past have been less than full.  </li>
            <li>I higly reccomend buying this product, I will be a customer for life on this particular shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended despite the expense.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li>The scent is not as tropical as I expected, and is too light.  </li>
            <li>Geo F. Thumper Coconut Oil Soft Shaving Cream is a real keeper, but the purchase price could change your opinion on that &#x27;keeper&#x27; stuff after awhile.</li>
            <li>If you opt for a cream instead of a shaving soap, typically you get slightly denser lather (which helps the blade glide more easily).</li>
            <li>I normally use aerosol shave creams, but thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li>When i take a whiff of this, I imagine that I&#x27;m on a beach busting fresh coconuts open.</li>
            <li>It stays wet longer and whips very nicely with very little cream.  </li>
            <li>I happened to stay at a hotel in London right next to the Geo F Trumper shop</li>
            <li>I use DerbyExtra or Shark Super Chrome baldes on a Merkur long handle.</li>
            <li>It lubricated my face nicely and there is plenty of lather for 3 or 4 passes using a very small amount of the cream.</li>
            <li>I had been using another shaving cream for about 10 months and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>Relatively new to DE shaving and have tried about 6 creams.  </li>
            <li>This is my new shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Builds a quick, thick lather and leaves you soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The addition of the coconut oil is actually quite noticeable—my skin dries out relatively easily, and this cream moisturizes my skin and prevents dryness better than any other I&#x27;ve used before, including Taylor&#x27;s Avocado, which was the previous winner in this category.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>However, since this was my first time purhcasing this brand, I couldn&#x27;t help but open up the jar, take some between my fingers and rub them together while savoring the fragrance and texture of this luxurious cream.</li>
            <li>I was pleased and relieved to find that the fragrance was not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>Performance is exactly the same as TOBS -</li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>The oil lubricates my skin very well for super close shaves in three or less passes.</li>
            <li>On my first use I was pleasantly surprised with every stage, from first open to application, but truly wowed on the third pass.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not entirely the coconut smell I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of combos and have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was baking in the sun all day, but, my shaving area still stayed soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>still felt soft</li>
            <li>I find I don&#x27;t bother with a pre-shave oil nor use as much aftershave/moisturizer since using this regularly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real coconut oil that adds lubrication to the cream for shaving, which in my opinion is a big plus!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase and have become quite the fan of Geo F. Trumpers lately.</li>
            <li>Soft, aromatic, dreamy clouds on yoru face.</li>
            <li>All I can say about this product is wow...</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I have used so far, Kiss My Face, Pacific Shaving Company, How To Grow a Mustache</li>
            <li>Only need to use a peanut-sized dollup on a shaving brush to cover the whole face.</li>
            <li>I anticipate this stuff lasting much longer than the Proraso</li>
            <li>I have been using TOBS Jermyn Street Sensitive Skin shave cream.  </li>
            <li>The coconut smell is very subtle and nice but I am completely sold on the performance of the shave cream.</li>
            <li>Very subtle and nice aroma.  </li>
            <li>Honestly everu other cream is a little disappointing compared to this, so I rarely get anything else any more.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a stronger scent for such a high priced cream.</li>
            <li>Slick and smooth when shaving.</li>
            <li>Creamy and smooth and slick.  </li>
            <li>a very little goes a long way, noticeably more so than the others mentioned</li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]</li>
            <li>After a very long hiatus from using a brush/mug, because of reviews from others here, I re-visited the whole thing with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The lather was thick and easy to build.  </li>
            <li>This shaving cream produces such a thick lather with minimal water that I found enough left for 2 or more passes when I was done, after only dipping my silver tipped badger in lightly.  </li>
            <li>The lather is just as good as any other cream I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Some people remark that this one is a little more pricy, however with the money that one is saving with wet shaving as opposed to the cartridge shaves why not go the extra step and splurge on yourself.</li>
            <li>A little more expensive than Taylor&#x27;s, but very worth it.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount which in turn will give you a baby butt smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I can barely see I have used mine.</li>
            <li>starters, this cream has a fantastic texture; its consistency is thick and moist and it builds a lather quickly and without an excessive amount of effort.  </li>
            <li>The other reviewers said it best: thick, creamy, slick lather will little effort.</li>
            <li>I am getting far outweighs any minor smell issues.</li>
            <li>Being relatively new to wet shaving about 1 year I wanted to see if there was a difference.</li>
            <li>The lather is so thick and nice on the skin with a hint of coconut but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>SUPER THICK.  </li>
            <li>The coconut scent stays true to itself and isn&#x27;t too subtle or overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;LATHER: As noted above, a little bit lathers very well with a brush and mug.  </li>
            <li>After shaving there&#x27;s no coconut scent to compete with ones aftershave or cologne; which could be good or bad depending on your desire.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This truly is an incredible product.  </li>

            <li> The product was good for what made it to me !</li>
            <li> Again, the product was good, it was the customer service that I had a problem with !</li>

            <li> Great shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I discovered them on a trip to London, since then it has been great to find that I can purchase their products via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I were stranded on a desert island, this would be a great cream to be stranded with.  </li>
            <li> Great shave, great product</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>

            <li> This is a great shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream smells great and seems like it would be soothing to the skin.  </li>

            <li> Lathers up great.  </li>

            <li> , the smell is amazing and it is just all around the best in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> , Petal Pusher Fancies, all great , organic products, give them a try.</li>

            <li> Very nice product</li>
            <li> Scent is amazing as others have pointed out!</li>
            <li> really nice!</li>
            <li> Good smell great lather</li>
            <li> Lather and scent are most excellent, I must say.  </li>
            <li> All of their shaving creams are excellent and they have many to choose from.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to lather and provides excellent glide and cushion during your shave.</li>
            <li> The coconut cream has a very light smell, which I like, and it feels very good on your skin.  </li>
            <li> great shaving cream, with great moisturizing properties, also if you love the smell of coconut and the tropics</li>
            <li> But this stuff works just as good.</li>
            <li> Try it out, good gift idea and always in stock: http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/product/index.jsp?productId&#x3D;3107645&amp;cp&#x3D;4090261.4090360.4248380</li>
            <li> All you need are a good shaver, blades, a good badger brush, and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> Heard good things about Trumper</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Coconut Oil, Rose, and Almond scented - they are all great.</li>
            <li> I can assure you this is about as good as you can get.</li>
            <li> Has a good scent.</li>
            <li> It does not give me as good of a shave as I thought it would, but I don&#x27;t mind having it in my collection.</li>
            <li> It has this great coconut fragrance and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> The smell is intoxicating and once you get the lather figured out for the consistency you like you will get some of the best and most enjoyable shaves.</li>
            <li> Coconut version doesn&#x27;t smell as good as sandalwood but lathers much better!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it even for those who still use disposable cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> The oils are really nice and provide a good shave, but I would prefer a fragrance that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Outstanding very nice Coconut aroma</li>
            <li> The TOBS produces a great shave and smells amazing, but the quality of this shave was better.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent!</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth!!  </li>
            <li> the scent is very nice and not too strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s simply amazing and the smell is to die for.</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing and hangs around for awhile which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Amazing lather.  </li>
            <li> Shaving cream mitigates skin dryness and provides a great smooth lather.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> the amazing coconut aroma is all but gone.</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy and smells great while shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is plenty of shave creams and soaps out there that are paraben free and work great .</li>
            <li> The coconut smell is a nice touch but is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> If you are not used to use this kind of  shaving creme find a youtube video that shows the instructions.</li>
            <li> Nice lather and protection.</li>
            <li> Lathers up really nice and protects well.</li>
            <li> I would say both products are about equal: great, luxurious lather for a well lubricated shave, But the TOBS also maintained its wonderful aroma during the shave.</li>
            <li> I also recommend the Rose and Violet fragrances.  </li>
            <li> The coconut scent is strong, but not overpoweringly so, and it lends a pleasant, relaxing feel to your morning shave.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, pleasant, but not my favorite, but the quality of the shave</li>
            <li> But it has a great lather ability and great for sensitive skin, like mine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have overwhelming amounts of fragrance mostly noted by cheaper brands trying to pass of good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> This Coconut Oil Soft Shave Cream by Geo F. Trumper is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love opening up the jar throughout the day just to smell that awesome natural coconut goodness!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described, happy with purchase</li>
            <li> It lathers well and gives a very smooth shave</li>
            <li> Has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> Thought it would have a more coconutty smell.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t potent to me.</li>
            <li> Bummer because my favorite part of shaving is the smell when I mix my lather.</li>
            <li> This is a truly outstanding shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The coconut oil shaving cream is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the coconut smell.</li>
            <li> I like this one most.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Most of them are ok.</li>
            <li> and it is way better than the &#x27;just ok&#x27; shaving foams and gels i have tried before.</li>
            <li> It seems like it protects my skin better not alone when I am shaving but also during the day.</li>
            <li> As noted a better cream than Taylor of Bond.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The only criticism I&#x27;ll make is that I&#x27;d hoped to have a more impressive scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the coconut.</li>
            <li> I think most of us have way more product than we&#x27;ll ever use</li>
            <li> but we love the over indulgence.</li>
            <li> Anyway I prefer GFT products the most and</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this not knowing what I was getting into and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It makes shaving more interesting.</li>
            <li> This used to be my favorite shaving cream until i tried Art of Shaving Sandalwood scent.  </li>
            <li> As much as I love the TOBS, I&#x27;d have to say this gave me a better shave.  </li>
            <li> The TOBS smell is much much better.  </li>
            <li> and the difference was even more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> When I finished, my skin was smoother and seemed more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very rich.</li>
            <li> Glad I did...the consistency of the cream is every bit as good, the fragrance is pleasant, and I get an extra 10 grams for a couple of bucks cheaper.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream has a very clean scent.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream + a Feather blade is the single best shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> You just have to use a good brush to really lather it and work some of the moisturizers into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This definitely is my favorite shave cream and worth the price!</li>
            <li> I honestly questioned spending this much on a shaving cream with there being so many comparable products</li>
            <li> Easy to work with any brush.  </li>
            <li> Easy to lather.</li>
            <li> It rinses off easily and a breeze to apply and lather.</li>
            <li> but it is a quality product that I can easily recommend.</li>
            <li> The coconut smell is very mild.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a strong coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is mild but very smooth and cushioning.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be able to whip up a face full of clouds.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have sensitive skin and want an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Gives a really smooth shave with my DE razor.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as cheap as it seems.</li>
            <li> and I have uses many different types of shaving creams and so far Geo F. Trunper is the best brand.</li>
            <li> Just been reading about parabens , and don&#x27;t feel comfortable using any product that has them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;criticism&amp;#34; is that the scent is nice in the tub, but once I put it in my shaving bowl and whip it into a lather I don&#x27;t smell that nice coconut aroma.</li>
            <li> This cream works into a beautiful smooth lather, especially with it, and I get great smooth shaves with minimal nicks and irritation.</li>
            <li> The latest addition to my supply is the Coconut oil fragrance--it is just like all the others I have--excellent quality, very creamy and easy on the face.  </li>
            <li> I have used this brand in the past and find it to be on of the best on the market for me.</li>
            <li> Worth the price !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of Taylor of Old Bond Street creams and while Taylor still makes a great product, Trumper&#x27;s Coconut is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried from other companies.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The regular Proraso shave cream is the best value if your skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine-</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great cream, but it is very comparable to Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Street creams</li>
            <li> However, the cream is soft, smooth, and lathers up really nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy smooth with a mild scent of coconut oil that fades soon after the shave but is pleasant while it last.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product that gave me an even better shave than I thought was possible.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted something better and this certainly fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It feels awesome, lathers unbelievably thick and slippery.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done with your shave, your skin will be nice and soft-</li>
            <li> It has a very manly smell, whereas this is more neutral.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I could have easily lost my senses and eaten this cream upon first smell.</li>
            <li> The scent of coconut is rather mild</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and consider myself to be super picky.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal GFT shaving cream customer.  </li>
            <li> All the same, I&#x27;m very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li> The density of the cream in the jar is amazing, you instantly feel that it is something special.</li>
            <li> I do believe I have found a new favorite shave cream.</li>
            <li> used to be my #1 cream but after using this, I now have a new favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, just a small amount whips a good lather.</li>
            <li> Very creamy smooth lather.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the quality is well worth the price and 2)</li>
            <li> Fresh coconut scent.</li>
            <li> Worth it IMO.</li>
            <li> Experiment and have fun pamper yourself. :</li>
            <li> This stuff is so exhilarating, I think I could go mental.  </li>
            <li> someone that&#x27;s used most of the well known brands (Truefitt &amp; Hill, Art of Shaving, Taylor of Old Bond St., and even some designer brands like Hermès)</li>
            <li> The most natural and well-defined coconut scented shave cream on the market.</li>
            <li> a small amount is necessary for a close, comfortable shave so it is also an excellent value.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not using a fine shaving brush, there&#x27;s no point using such a fine cream to shave with.</li>
            <li> , you may also like:  Mastey Traite Sulfate Free Normal</li>
            <li> None of these are the case, in fact it hits all the right notes and smells pretty darn manly for a coconut fragrance.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away my first time using this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cream lathers quick and is intense.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its worth $30, because the Proraso&#x27;s White Tub Soap ($10) and Taylor&#x27;s Avocado Cream ($15) both give me a better shave.</li>
            <li> and I received the item very fast.</li>
            <li> This cream is for those with discriminating taste and for those who prefer a \\&quot;pure and natural\\&quot; coconut scent as opposed to the synthetic car wash or powerful air-freshener type</li>
            <li> i started to do a little research and this one seemed like a good thing to try.</li>
            <li> As with all Trumper products this one is first  rate.  </li>
            <li> I first got it for him in London at Trumper and he hasn&#x27;t used anything else since.</li>
            <li> so this ought to last me a year or more.</li>
            <li> : I was hesitant to make this price jump at first but 1)</li>
            <li> Again stellar.  </li>
            <li> I have many shaving products since I got back into DE shaving.</li>
            <li> so why would you pay more for the same thing?</li>
            <li> First class product with integrity.</li>
            <li> I just wet my face with a warm washcloth and apply the cream with my fingers without any brush.</li>
            <li> First, I adore anything coconut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving creams and bought this on a whim.</li>
            <li> I really love the shave I get with that, but I decided to try this just as something different.  </li>
            <li> It just has a subtle scent and produces a great lather and soothing surface for shaving.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a straight razor, but it would be appropriate for cartridge or double edge razors as well.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the scent subdued - it doesn&#x27;t over power you like the aerosol brands, but it leaves the skin much smoother and the razor glides more</li>
            <li> Using a superfine badger brush and an almond sized amount of cream I can quickly create plenty of full of rich, thick lather for three passes.  </li>
            <li> Other products work as good or better for less money.</li>
            <li> This is exactly was real coconuts smells like.</li>
            <li> No more nicks or cuts, and acts as a great conditioner for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So I would say this is probably just about a year&#x27;s worth for someone who shaves their full face daily.</li>
            <li> It contains pure coconut oil</li>
            <li> It is important that you use a brush with this product (e.g., [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]), as you won&#x27;t get the same silky lather if you try to apply it with just your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There actually really isn&#x27;t much smell to coconut</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real fan of Geo F. Trumper shaving products.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know how well this moisturized until I used it on the ship and went out to the port of call.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps cushion your shave in addition to seal up your skin</li>
            <li> Additionally, it left a smooth shave and a moisturized face.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the modern type shaving foams and gels from cans.</li>
            <li> They are very helpful.</li>
            <li> Light smell only.</li>
            <li> For a fantastic traditional style shaving experience, this is a must have cream in your cabinet.</li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> I use a DE safety razor and a straight.  </li>
            <li> This has actual high grade coconut oil which really REALLY works into the lather and makes it very lubricating and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but not a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Another of my favorites, the scent is subtle enough and refreshing while providing an incredibly rich and smooth lather.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin, helps shave close without wounding, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You may also like my other favorite things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> I know, with all the strife going on in the world it seems a bit excessive to spend more than $60.00 a pound for shaving cream, but in this case it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone that likes the smell of coconut and wants a close shave.</li>
            <li> I like it more than Castle Forbes and Razorock (Previous favorites).  </li>
            <li> an added bonus over Taylor products, the tub in which the cream came was filled to the top, whereas the majority of the Taylor creams I&#x27;ve purchased in the past have been less than full.  </li>
            <li> I higly reccomend buying this product, I will be a customer for life on this particular shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended despite the expense.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> The scent is not as tropical as I expected, and is too light.  </li>
            <li> Geo F. Thumper Coconut Oil Soft Shaving Cream is a real keeper, but the purchase price could change your opinion on that &#x27;keeper&#x27; stuff after awhile.</li>
            <li> If you opt for a cream instead of a shaving soap, typically you get slightly denser lather (which helps the blade glide more easily).</li>
            <li> I normally use aerosol shave creams, but thought I would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> When i take a whiff of this, I imagine that I&#x27;m on a beach busting fresh coconuts open.</li>
            <li> It stays wet longer and whips very nicely with very little cream.  </li>
            <li> I happened to stay at a hotel in London right next to the Geo F Trumper shop</li>
            <li> I use DerbyExtra or Shark Super Chrome baldes on a Merkur long handle.</li>
            <li> It lubricated my face nicely and there is plenty of lather for 3 or 4 passes using a very small amount of the cream.</li>
            <li> I had been using another shaving cream for about 10 months and wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> Relatively new to DE shaving and have tried about 6 creams.  </li>
            <li> This is my new shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Builds a quick, thick lather and leaves you soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The addition of the coconut oil is actually quite noticeable—my skin dries out relatively easily, and this cream moisturizes my skin and prevents dryness better than any other I&#x27;ve used before, including Taylor&#x27;s Avocado, which was the previous winner in this category.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> However, since this was my first time purhcasing this brand, I couldn&#x27;t help but open up the jar, take some between my fingers and rub them together while savoring the fragrance and texture of this luxurious cream.</li>
            <li> I was pleased and relieved to find that the fragrance was not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Performance is exactly the same as TOBS -</li>
            <li> Wow !</li>
            <li> The oil lubricates my skin very well for super close shaves in three or less passes.</li>
            <li> On my first use I was pleasantly surprised with every stage, from first open to application, but truly wowed on the third pass.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not entirely the coconut smell I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of combos and have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was baking in the sun all day, but, my shaving area still stayed soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> still felt soft</li>
            <li> I find I don&#x27;t bother with a pre-shave oil nor use as much aftershave/moisturizer since using this regularly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real coconut oil that adds lubrication to the cream for shaving, which in my opinion is a big plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase and have become quite the fan of Geo F. Trumpers lately.</li>
            <li> Soft, aromatic, dreamy clouds on yoru face.</li>
            <li> All I can say about this product is wow...</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I have used so far, Kiss My Face, Pacific Shaving Company, How To Grow a Mustache</li>
            <li> Only need to use a peanut-sized dollup on a shaving brush to cover the whole face.</li>
            <li> I anticipate this stuff lasting much longer than the Proraso</li>
            <li> I have been using TOBS Jermyn Street Sensitive Skin shave cream.  </li>
            <li> The coconut smell is very subtle and nice but I am completely sold on the performance of the shave cream.</li>
            <li> Very subtle and nice aroma.  </li>
            <li> Honestly everu other cream is a little disappointing compared to this, so I rarely get anything else any more.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a stronger scent for such a high priced cream.</li>
            <li> Slick and smooth when shaving.</li>
            <li> Creamy and smooth and slick.  </li>
            <li> a very little goes a long way, noticeably more so than the others mentioned</li>
            <li> NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]</li>
            <li> After a very long hiatus from using a brush/mug, because of reviews from others here, I re-visited the whole thing with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The lather was thick and easy to build.  </li>
            <li> This shaving cream produces such a thick lather with minimal water that I found enough left for 2 or more passes when I was done, after only dipping my silver tipped badger in lightly.  </li>
            <li> The lather is just as good as any other cream I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s very thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Some people remark that this one is a little more pricy, however with the money that one is saving with wet shaving as opposed to the cartridge shaves why not go the extra step and splurge on yourself.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than Taylor&#x27;s, but very worth it.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount which in turn will give you a baby butt smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I can barely see I have used mine.</li>
            <li> starters, this cream has a fantastic texture; its consistency is thick and moist and it builds a lather quickly and without an excessive amount of effort.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers said it best: thick, creamy, slick lather will little effort.</li>
            <li> I am getting far outweighs any minor smell issues.</li>
            <li> Being relatively new to wet shaving about 1 year I wanted to see if there was a difference.</li>
            <li> The lather is so thick and nice on the skin with a hint of coconut but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> SUPER THICK.  </li>
            <li> The coconut scent stays true to itself and isn&#x27;t too subtle or overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;LATHER: As noted above, a little bit lathers very well with a brush and mug.  </li>
            <li> After shaving there&#x27;s no coconut scent to compete with ones aftershave or cologne; which could be good or bad depending on your desire.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes shave my full face, otherwise always a little over half my neck daily and sometimes have my head shaved.</li>
            <li> (I have a very sensitive skin and a pretty tough beard.)</li>
            <li> I made the mistake for trying to save some money on a cheaper alternative but am back to high quality, a little more expensive, shave cream.  </li>
            <li> only real complaint is that the coconut scent is very mild and doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> the other brand definitely takes much longer to lather and breaks down easier.</li>
            <li> I have to smell it pretty hard.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond at the same time and their price was much less.</li>
            <li> 200g jar has lasted me 6 months so far and isn&#x27;t even half way gone.  </li>
            <li> To Dry Shampoo, 32 Fluid Ounce</li>
            <li> The price is compatible with other high end products and TOB has less product</li>
            <li> While you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Proraso cream, this was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The tub is larger then TOBS and is equal too or slightly nicer.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way so this will last you several months if you use a brush with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now tried Bigelow&#x27;s Eucalyptus, AOS Unscented, TOBS Coconut, TOBS Sandalwood and various other</li>
            <li> Of all those tried it&#x27;s the only one I find myself opening to smell at times other than shaving time.  </li>
            <li> Only down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this some time ago (probably over a year now), and still have over half left.</li>
            <li> In fact, after a few months (yes, a tub will last you a really long time)</li>
            <li> I was a bit afraid that it might be smell a bit too strong, or perhaps too &#x27;feminine&#x27; or maybe resemble something like a cheapo sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle but i very much like it.  </li>
            <li> Using only a small amount will give you at least 2 passes with enough left over to do a 3rd spot pass if needed.</li>
            <li> so the extra cost is offset a little.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that when I switch back to this from the Art of Shaving Cream, my skin gets a little irritated.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some other shaving creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> I could be going completely mental.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for about 5 years</li>
            <li> I might have expected a tin jar for the cost, but that&#x27;s not a big deal since the plastic is a heavy weight and feels substantial, not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rank it any higher than the experience of a Taylor&#x27;s cream which can be had for much cheaper($14).</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time because you just need a little dab on your shaving brush</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This 200 g tub is going to last me well close to a year if not more.</li>
            <li> See my other reviews for razor handle (Merkur), badger brush (Tweezerman) and DE blades (Derby)</li>
            <li> I extremely picky when it comes to shaving</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying some of the other fragrances.</li>
            <li> The scent is like none other.</li>
            <li> , I tried to contact the seller via email with absolutely no response !</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands shaving creams offered.</li>
            <li> I usually lather in a Georgetown scuttle and have no problem making enough for my 3 pass shave.</li>
            <li> The other criticism is price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be shopping for other Geo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as other creams and foams and a little bit creates a lot of lather.</li>
            <li> The lather is a little denser than TOBS and AOS but feels much less dry than those two after sitting on the face for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE:</li>
            <li> When the cream came to my house it was half empty because the lid wasn&#x27;t on tight</li>
            <li> Go ahead and slide that blade down your face.</li>
            <li> I use this with a badger brush and with a little bit of water it lathers extremely well.</li>
            <li> I use Jack Black bear lube as a preshave underneath it.</li>
            <li> and I rub a little Proraso Pre/Post shave cream on afterwards anyways.</li>
            <li> I have now used it for a little over a month</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to shave in the morning since you have to make the lather.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but a quality product.</li>
            <li> One of the few creams I can use everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but each container lasts about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with shave creams from the 3 T&#x27;s (Truefitt &amp; Hill, Geo F. Trumper, and Taylors of Old Bond St) and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Just a little on the tip of the brush and in a few seconds you have a very thick lather in the bowl and it will last for at least four passes if needed.</li>
            <li> I travel with a small bottle of it re-labeled for bath and body works</li>
            <li> I use cartridge blades and put the cream on with my fingers usually.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Art of Shaving</li>
            <li> This product created an effortless lather and a fairly slick shave, although I&#x27;ve never tried shaving soaps yet.</li>
            <li> Provides ample moisture afterwards and is a slick cream.</li>
            <li> and when I was done, I did my usual across-the-grain pass</li>
            <li> This is a little on the expensive side but it lasts me about a year shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> I am not an all-out shaving fanatic.</li>
            <li> I really do mean it, you know.  </li>
            <li> I mean this stuff comes all the way from England.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up a storm, but the scent is really weak.  </li>
            <li> It has an earthy, vaguely christmasy smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this product I was expecting a fake tropical coconut smell, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have this cream in your rotation, you&#x27;re crazy.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very creamy smooth lather. Whips up very nicely. Thought it would have a more coconutty smell.</li>
            <li> great shaving cream, with great moisturizing properties, also if you love the smell of coconut and the tropics this will put you on a beach in hawaii</li>
            <li> Will stick to lime but product is still very good.</li>
            <li> Aha! I do believe I have found a new favorite shave cream. I love this stuff, just a small amount whips a good lather. The coconut smell is a nice touch but is not overpowering. really nice! Gives a really smooth shave with my DE razor.</li>
            <li> As with all Trumper products this one is first  rate.  The coconut cream has a very light smell, which I like, and it feels very good on your skin.  It lathers well and gives a very smooth shave</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff!  I first got it for him in London at Trumper and he hasn&#x27;t used anything else since.</li>
            <li> So I have just switched to a double edge razor and started to use this cream with it. I use it with a badger brush and man does a smal amount of this lather a lot. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it even for those who still use disposable cartridge razors. I use this with a badger brush and with a little bit of water it lathers extremely well. This 200 g tub is going to last me well close to a year if not more.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but it isn&#x27;t potent to me. I have to smell it pretty hard. Bummer because my favorite part of shaving is the smell when I mix my lather. I do prefer the TOBS Mr. Taylor shave cream. But this stuff works just as good.</li>
            <li> Outstanding very nice Coconut aroma</li>
            <li> This is a truly outstanding shaving cream. It&#x27;s easy to lather and provides excellent glide and cushion during your shave. One of the few creams I can use everyday. the scent is very nice and not too strong.</li>
            <li> Coconut version doesn&#x27;t smell as good as sandalwood but lathers much better! There actually really isn&#x27;t much smell to coconut and I rub a little Proraso Pre/Post shave cream on afterwards anyways. Best combo ever! This is a little on the expensive side but it lasts me about a year shaving every other day. See my other reviews for razor handle (Merkur), badger brush (Tweezerman) and DE blades (Derby) I prefer- I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of combos and have fairly sensitive skin. The regular Proraso shave cream is the best value if your skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine- I travel with a small bottle of it re-labeled for bath and body works (C.O. Bigelow) and smells great too. Try it out, good gift idea and always in stock: http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/product/index.jsp?productId&#x3D;3107645&amp;cp&#x3D;4090261.4090360.4248380</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use Jack Black bear lube as a preshave underneath it. This cream works into a beautiful smooth lather, especially with it, and I get great smooth shaves with minimal nicks and irritation. I will be a lifetime user of this. Scent is amazing as others have pointed out!</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream. It&#x27;s not cheap but each container lasts about 6 months.  I extremely picky when it comes to shaving and I have tried a bunch of different types if shaving cream.  This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> After a very long hiatus from using a brush/mug, because of reviews from others here, I re-visited the whole thing with this purchase. What a delight! Smells great and really lathers nicely. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> When I received this cream on a recent evening I did not need a shave. However, since this was my first time purhcasing this brand, I couldn&#x27;t help but open up the jar, take some between my fingers and rub them together while savoring the fragrance and texture of this luxurious cream. I was pleased and relieved to find that the fragrance was not overwhelming at all. I was a bit afraid that it might be smell a bit too strong, or perhaps too &#x27;feminine&#x27; or maybe resemble something like a cheapo sunscreen. None of these are the case, in fact it hits all the right notes and smells pretty darn manly for a coconut fragrance. The density of the cream in the jar is amazing, you instantly feel that it is something special. I might have expected a tin jar for the cost, but that&#x27;s not a big deal since the plastic is a heavy weight and feels substantial, not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a big jar, you get a lot of cream for the money. I only shave twice a week so this ought to last me a year or more. I am not an all-out shaving fanatic. I use cartridge blades and put the cream on with my fingers usually. I will add to this review once I actually shave with it!</li>
            <li> The only reason this isn&#x27;t getting 5 stars is because it gums up my double edge. I tried the lime scent to see if it was my razor, but no it only happens with the coconut. I love the scent!</li>
            <li> This truly is an incredible product.  The smell is intoxicating and once you get the lather figured out for the consistency you like you will get some of the best and most enjoyable shaves.</li>
            <li> I know, with all the strife going on in the world it seems a bit excessive to spend more than $60.00 a pound for shaving cream, but in this case it&#x27;s worth it. Feels great on the skin, helps shave close without wounding, and a little goes a long way. All you need are a good shaver, blades, a good badger brush, and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
            <li> Long-time Truefitt &amp; Hill customer. Heard good things about Trumper so I bit the bullet and ordered it. Glad I did...the consistency of the cream is every bit as good, the fragrance is pleasant, and I get an extra 10 grams for a couple of bucks cheaper. Looking forward to trying some of the other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shaving cream.  Very good value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real fan of Geo F. Trumper shaving products.  I discovered them on a trip to London, since then it has been great to find that I can purchase their products via Amazon.  The coconut oil shaving cream is my favorite.  It just has a subtle scent and produces a great lather and soothing surface for shaving.  Highly recommended despite the expense.</li>
            <li> I had taken this cream on a cruise in April.  I had never used it before but figured I needed something moisturizing as I would be traveling to the Caribbean and would not be using pre-shave oil.  I really didn&#x27;t know how well this moisturized until I used it on the ship and went out to the port of call.  I was baking in the sun all day, but, my shaving area still stayed soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were stranded on a desert island, this would be a great cream to be stranded with.  It contains pure coconut oil so it&#x27;s almost as if you have the pre-shave oil built in.  Even with three passes using a [[ASIN:B001VCUQE6 20 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] blade my skin still felt soft and I had no cuts or nicks.  [[ASIN:B00020UQQQ Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Shave Cream Jar]] used to be my #1 cream but after using this, I now have a new favorite.  Try using [[ASIN:B0007M3ZKI Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food, 100ml]] before you shave and after.  I use it and it really helps cushion your shave in addition to seal up your skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also like my other favorite things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0007M3Z5S Geo F.

            <li> Another of my favorites, the scent is subtle enough and refreshing while providing an incredibly rich and smooth lather. Definitely a repeat buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected.  Very nice product and I received the item very fast.</li>
            <li> BOTTOM LINE: Worth every penny. Has ruined me for all others. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a point of reference I&#x27;ve now tried Bigelow&#x27;s Eucalyptus, AOS Unscented, TOBS Coconut, TOBS Sandalwood and various other cheaper options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE: I was hesitant to make this price jump at first but 1) the quality is well worth the price and 2) a very little goes a long way, noticeably more so than the others mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL: Note that this does NOT seem to be \\&quot;coconut scented.\\&quot;  You can smell the coconut oil in it but it is by no means overpowering.  The scent is very subtle but i very much like it.  Of all those tried it&#x27;s the only one I find myself opening to smell at times other than shaving time.  It has an earthy, vaguely christmasy smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LATHER: As noted above, a little bit lathers very well with a brush and mug.  The lather is a little denser than TOBS and AOS but feels much less dry than those two after sitting on the face for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE: Again stellar.  Especially noticeable on the third pass.  On my first use I was pleasantly surprised with every stage, from first open to application, but truly wowed on the third pass.  Additionally, it left a smooth shave and a moisturized face.  I find I don&#x27;t bother with a pre-shave oil nor use as much aftershave/moisturizer since using this regularly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The scent is like none other. I would recommend it just for that. But it has a great lather ability and great for sensitive skin, like mine. This is the only shaving cream I will be buying. I love the coconut smell.</li>
            <li> The product was good for what made it to me ! When the cream came to my house it was half empty because the lid wasn&#x27;t on tight, I tried to contact the seller via email with absolutely no response ! Again, the product was good, it was the customer service that I had a problem with ! Hope this is helpful to you with your decision !</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands shaving creams offered. This one is a winner! I trued this brand after reading someones reviews and recommendations.  I tried it, and never looked back.  I have been buying this product for the last 3-4 years. I have tried every fragrant offered. I like this one most.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The Coconut smell is not the greatest but it is actually coconut. It feels awesome, lathers unbelievably thick and slippery. Great shave, great product and you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> Good smell great lather</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about this product, don&#x27;t be. Just buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simply amazing and the smell is to die for. I usually buy Art of Shaving but I wanted something better and this certainly fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way so this will last you several months if you use a brush with it. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the modern type shaving foams and gels from cans. Most of them are ok. I happened to stay at a hotel in London right next to the Geo F Trumper shop but I didn&#x27;t buy in the shop but i woke my interest. So, after I got back to the US i started to do a little research and this one seemed like a good thing to try. I have now used it for a little over a month and it is way better than the &#x27;just ok&#x27; shaving foams and gels i have tried before. It seems like it protects my skin better not alone when I am shaving but also during the day. Dont be afraid of the price. i predict that the jar will last for a year or so (with one shave per day). I can barely see I have used mine. If you are not used to use this kind of  shaving creme find a youtube video that shows the instructions. They are very helpful.</li>
            <li> Fresh coconut scent. As noted a better cream than Taylor of Bond.Worth it IMO. Nothing like Taylor Grapefruit</li>
            <li> Excellent quality shaving cream. It doesn&#x27;t have overwhelming amounts of fragrance mostly noted by cheaper brands trying to pass of good stuff. This has actual high grade coconut oil which really REALLY works into the lather and makes it very lubricating and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t dry as quickly as other creams and foams and a little bit creates a lot of lather.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product. The lather was thick and easy to build.  Slick and smooth when shaving. I honestly questioned spending this much on a shaving cream with there being so many comparable products but I&#x27;m glad I did. This shaving cream produces such a thick lather with minimal water that I found enough left for 2 or more passes when I was done, after only dipping my silver tipped badger in lightly.  The only criticism I&#x27;ll make is that I&#x27;d hoped to have a more impressive scent. It&#x27;s light and not entirely the coconut smell I expected.  Don&#x27;t expect a strong coconut scent.  All the same, I&#x27;m very pleased with the cream.</li>
            <li> I normally use aerosol shave creams, but thought I would give this a try.  Bought the cream and a brush.  It takes a little longer to shave in the morning since you have to make the lather.  The scent is not as tropical as I expected, and is too light.  There is no trace of it once you are done shaving.  The oils are really nice and provide a good shave, but I would prefer a fragrance that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the coconut. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some other shaving creams. It also goes a looong ways. I purchased this some time ago (probably over a year now), and still have over half left. I sometimes shave my full face, otherwise always a little over half my neck daily and sometimes have my head shaved. So I would say this is probably just about a year&#x27;s worth for someone who shaves their full face daily.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described, happy with purchase</li>
            <li> This shaving cream has a very clean scent. Coconut oil is the creams calling card - not the coconut scent. It&#x27;s real coconut oil that adds lubrication to the cream for shaving, which in my opinion is a big plus! Unfortunately though, the enduring coconut scent that most of us wanted to experience, is subjected only to the cream inside the container. After shaving there&#x27;s no coconut scent to compete with ones aftershave or cologne; which could be good or bad depending on your desire.  Geo F. Thumper Coconut Oil Soft Shaving Cream is a real keeper, but the purchase price could change your opinion on that &#x27;keeper&#x27; stuff after awhile. Other products work as good or better for less money. But if you like it, go for it! Cheers!!!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome.  Creamy and smooth and slick.  Just get it!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Very subtle and nice aroma.  Nice lather and protection.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers said it best: thick, creamy, slick lather will little effort. Honestly everu other cream is a little disappointing compared to this, so I rarely get anything else any more. My wife even started using for shaving her legs.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving cream. Quality product. Light smell only. Reminds him of Hawaii. Will continue to buy Trumper products.</li>
            <li> I have many shaving products since I got back into DE shaving. I think most of us have way more product than we&#x27;ll ever use but we love the over indulgence. Anyway I prefer GFT products the most and this cream is no exception. The scent is mild but very smooth and cushioning. I usually lather in a Georgetown scuttle and have no problem making enough for my 3 pass shave. The price is compatible with other high end products and TOB has less product so it&#x27;s not as cheap as it seems.</li>
            <li> I had been using another shaving cream for about 10 months and wanted to try something new. Being relatively new to wet shaving about 1 year I wanted to see if there was a difference. The one that I was using before was an American made one and it wasn&#x27;t bad but compared to Geo&#x27;s shave cream it the other brand definitely takes much longer to lather and breaks down easier. Some people remark that this one is a little more pricy, however with the money that one is saving with wet shaving as opposed to the cartridge shaves why not go the extra step and splurge on yourself. Also the blades that one uses makes a difference in your shaving experience. Experiment and have fun pamper yourself. :}&lt;br /&gt;Big Tex</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  The aroma is excellent and the product itself is unbeatable.  I purchased this not knowing what I was getting into and fell in love with it.  I made the mistake for trying to save some money on a cheaper alternative but am back to high quality, a little more expensive, shave cream.  Shaving is one of those things you don&#x27;t want to skimp on product... I learned that after years of irritation and ingrown hairs.  I have greatly reduced that irritation and ingrown hairs with this product and the help of a pre shave oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving cream. I&#x27;ve only tried TOBS Sandalwood products, and they always seemed to be way over powering with the scent. With this product I was expecting a fake tropical coconut smell, but boy was I wrong. When i take a whiff of this, I imagine that I&#x27;m on a beach busting fresh coconuts open. This is exactly was real coconuts smells like. This product created an effortless lather and a fairly slick shave, although I&#x27;ve never tried shaving soaps yet. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase and have become quite the fan of Geo F. Trumpers lately. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Relatively new to DE shaving and have tried about 6 creams.  This is the best so far.  I like it more than Castle Forbes and Razorock (Previous favorites).  The next on my list to try will be Truefitt and Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream lathers quick and is intense.  Smell is amazing and hangs around for awhile which is nice.  Provides ample moisture afterwards and is a slick cream.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream smells great and seems like it would be soothing to the skin.  But it&#x27;s not good for sensitive skin.  It dries the skin and something in the mix leaves a burning sensation on the skin.  Will not be using this again.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with shave creams from the 3 T&#x27;s (Truefitt &amp; Hill, Geo F. Trumper, and Taylors of Old Bond St) and this one is no exception.  Using a superfine badger brush and an almond sized amount of cream I can quickly create plenty of full of rich, thick lather for three passes.  The pleasing coconut aroma is neither overpowering nor too subdued.  I use it with a straight razor, but it would be appropriate for cartridge or double edge razors as well.  It is important that you use a brush with this product (e.g., [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]]), as you won&#x27;t get the same silky lather if you try to apply it with just your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are still using goo in a can, do yourself a favor and upgrade your shave with this coconut oil shaving cream.  This is one of the best you can get.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves skin so soft. Def will be buying this again. It is a great deal too for the price.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t you know it.  Lather and scent are most excellent, I must say.  I really do mean it, you know.  I mean this stuff comes all the way from England.  How excellent is that?  I must say.  This stuff is so exhilarating, I think I could go mental.  Just kidding you know. Not really.  I could be going completely mental.</li>
            <li> Lathers up great.  Smells nice but not a strong smell.  I will buy again when I run out.  Works best when combined with a pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li> Has a very light scent. I was expecting a stronger scent for such a high priced cream. I&#x27;m used to the stronger scents of Taylors and Truefitt and Hill. The lather though is very good so I won&#x27;t fault them on that. I wouldn&#x27;t rank it any higher than the experience of a Taylor&#x27;s cream which can be had for much cheaper($14).</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent.  I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of Taylor of Old Bond Street creams and while Taylor still makes a great product, Trumper&#x27;s Coconut is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried from other companies.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, this cream has a fantastic texture; its consistency is thick and moist and it builds a lather quickly and without an excessive amount of effort.  The coconut scent is strong, but not overpoweringly so, and it lends a pleasant, relaxing feel to your morning shave.  The addition of the coconut oil is actually quite noticeable—my skin dries out relatively easily, and this cream moisturizes my skin and prevents dryness better than any other I&#x27;ve used before, including Taylor&#x27;s Avocado, which was the previous winner in this category.&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus over Taylor products, the tub in which the cream came was filled to the top, whereas the majority of the Taylor creams I&#x27;ve purchased in the past have been less than full.  Couple that with the larger container size, and you&#x27;ve got a winner.  If you&#x27;re looking for a cream with a pleasant coconut scent and excellent moisturizing properties, this is it.</li>
            <li> Excellent lather and it smells wonderful.  200g jar has lasted me 6 months so far and isn&#x27;t even half way gone.  Just a dab will do you.  This is my new shaving cream.  This stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaving cream.  Amazing lather.  SUPER THICK.  Easy to work with any brush.  Great smell.  Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for several years. Shaving cream mitigates skin dryness and provides a great smooth lather. This product is excellent in both regards.</li>
            <li> I have been using Geo F. Trumper shaving creams for almost 10 years now.  About 3 months ago I ran out and thought I would save some money by switching to the foam aerosol cans you buy at any retailer.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference - I used the aerosol can for two weeks and finally threw it in the trash and ordered another tub of the Coconut Oil shaving cream.  Not only is the scent subdued - it doesn&#x27;t over power you like the aerosol brands, but it leaves the skin much smoother and the razor glides more smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Coconut Oil, Rose, and Almond scented - they are all great.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is truly amazing. It&#x27;s the best shaving cream I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried many.  It lasts a long time because you just need a little dab on your shaving brush and you&#x27;ll be able to whip up a face full of clouds.  Soft, aromatic, dreamy clouds on yoru face. Go ahead and slide that blade down your face. The smoothness will amaze you. This product deserves 5 stars because it&#x27;s the best shaving cream. I can not recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> If you opt for a cream instead of a shaving soap, typically you get slightly denser lather (which helps the blade glide more easily). Well, this takes the cake. Honestly, a tiny bit of this stuff lathers to create a foamy cushion of coconut-infused bliss. When you&#x27;re done with your shave, your skin will be nice and soft- definitely no \\&quot;post-shave dryness\\&quot; with this stuff. You just have to use a good brush to really lather it and work some of the moisturizers into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that the coconut scent is very mild and doesn&#x27;t last too long. In fact, after a few months (yes, a tub will last you a really long time) the amazing coconut aroma is all but gone. That said, you&#x27;ll still have brilliant shaves with this stuff, even as you reach the bottom of the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone that&#x27;s used most of the well known brands (Truefitt &amp; Hill, Art of Shaving, Taylor of Old Bond St., and even some designer brands like Hermès) I can assure you this is about as good as you can get.</li>
            <li> Lathers up a storm, but the scent is really weak.  I didn&#x27;t tell my kids what the scent was and asked them to smell it and tell me what they thought it was.  They both said &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great cream, but it is very comparable to Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond Street creams and it actually looks just like it in the jar.  Performance is exactly the same as TOBS - so why would you pay more for the same thing?</li>
            <li> For a fantastic traditional style shaving experience, this is a must have cream in your cabinet. Smooth, creamy and smells great while shaving. Does not clog razor of all types!</li>
            <li> Lathers up really nice and protects well.The tub is larger then TOBS and is equal too or slightly nicer.The scent of coconut is rather mild so don&#x27;t let that scare you away.</li>
            <li> Very rich. Easy to lather. Has a good scent. A little pricey, but a quality product.</li>
            <li> The most natural and well-defined coconut scented shave cream on the market. Nothing artificial. The coconut scent stays true to itself and isn&#x27;t too subtle or overpowering. First class product with integrity. High quality! I love opening up the jar throughout the day just to smell that awesome natural coconut goodness! I wish Geo F. Trumper would make a coconut fragrance-spray to compliment my Creed Virgin Island Water. I simply apply before my shower. It rinses off easily and a breeze to apply and lather. It never clogs or builds up on my Mach 3 razor blade. I just wet my face with a warm washcloth and apply the cream with my fingers without any brush. No more nicks or cuts, and acts as a great conditioner for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried them all and consider myself to be super picky. This definitely is my favorite shave cream and worth the price! Highly recommended if you have sensitive skin and want an excellent shave. This cream is for those with discriminating taste and for those who prefer a \\&quot;pure and natural\\&quot; coconut scent as opposed to the synthetic car wash or powerful air-freshener type scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like this coconut, you may also like:  Mastey Traite Sulfate Free Normal To Dry Shampoo, 32 Fluid Ounce</li>
            <li> All I can say about this product is wow... It lathers wonderful, the smell is amazing and it is just all around the best in my opinion.  This shaving cream + a Feather blade is the single best shave I have ever had.  I higly reccomend buying this product, I will be a customer for life on this particular shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving cream. My only &amp;#34;criticism&amp;#34; is that the scent is nice in the tub, but once I put it in my shaving bowl and whip it into a lather I don&#x27;t smell that nice coconut aroma. The other criticism is price. I purchased a Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond at the same time and their price was much less. I would say both products are about equal: great, luxurious lather for a well lubricated shave, But the TOBS also maintained its wonderful aroma during the shave.</li>
            <li> The downside are the chemicals and the fact that it contains parabens. However, the cream is soft, smooth, and lathers up really nicely. It does not give me as good of a shave as I thought it would, but I don&#x27;t mind having it in my collection. I don&#x27;t think its worth $30, because the Proraso&#x27;s White Tub Soap ($10) and Taylor&#x27;s Avocado Cream ($15) both give me a better shave. (I have a very sensitive skin and a pretty tough beard.)</li>
            <li> I have used this brand in the past and find it to be on of the best on the market for me.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal GFT shaving cream customer.  The latest addition to my supply is the Coconut oil fragrance--it is just like all the others I have--excellent quality, very creamy and easy on the face.  I also recommend the Rose and Violet fragrances.  All of their shaving creams are excellent and they have many to choose from.  I like rotating them and using a different fragrance everday.  It makes shaving more interesting.</li>
            <li> Wow.  First, I adore anything coconut.  That being said, I could have easily lost my senses and eaten this cream upon first smell. A SUPERB shave.  If you&#x27;re not using a fine shaving brush, there&#x27;s no point using such a fine cream to shave with. INVEST. If you do, I promise you, this will be your greatest shave. In this order: apply cream, shave with grain, re-apply cream shave against grain. Take the extra time. Your face will feel a shave the level of which you cannot achieve anywhere else.  Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for about 5 years and I have uses many different types of shaving creams and so far Geo F. Trunper is the best brand.</li>
            <li> Great product. Builds a quick, thick lather and leaves you soft and smooth. Only down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut at all.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband and he loves it!!  Everything about this coconut oil shaving cream is perfection!  We will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> Outstanding beard softening combined with superb lather provides for a perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;Just a small amount is necessary for a close, comfortable shave so it is also an excellent value.</li>
            <li> This Coconut Oil Soft Shave Cream by Geo F. Trumper is an excellent product. It has this great coconut fragrance and goes on nicely. It only takes a small amount which in turn will give you a baby butt smooth shave. Using only a small amount will give you at least 2 passes with enough left over to do a 3rd spot pass if needed. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that likes the smell of coconut and wants a close shave.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why the 3 star rating. should have read the ingredients label before ordering, so I ended it up throwing this one in the trash, even though it performed very good.Just been reading about parabens , and don&#x27;t feel comfortable using any product that has them.&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of shave creams and soaps out there that are paraben free and work great . I have used so far, Kiss My Face, Pacific Shaving Company, How To Grow a Mustache, Petal Pusher Fancies, all great , organic products, give them a try.</li>
            <li> For my sensative skin this is the perfect shave cream. lathers up like whipped cream, and has a great coconut scent. The oil lubricates my skin very well for super close shaves in three or less passes. I use DerbyExtra or Shark Super Chrome baldes on a Merkur long handle. Only need to use a peanut-sized dollup on a shaving brush to cover the whole face. A little more expensive than Taylor&#x27;s, but very worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shaving creams and bought this on a whim. Wow ! The lather is so thick and nice on the skin with a hint of coconut but not overwhelming. Its not going to make you smell like you rubbed coconut scented sunscreen on your face. I had to adjust the amount used because I was used to using Proraso Sensitve. Just a little on the tip of the brush and in a few seconds you have a very thick lather in the bowl and it will last for at least four passes if needed. I just sent some to my son in the Navy. I highly recommend this stuff. I anticipate this stuff lasting much longer than the Proraso so the extra cost is offset a little. Worth the price !</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth!!  Smells great!!</li>
            <li> I use a DE safety razor and a straight.  While you can&#x27;t go wrong with the Proraso cream, this was fantastic.  It stays wet longer and whips very nicely with very little cream.  The coconut smell is very subtle and nice but I am completely sold on the performance of the shave cream.</li>
            <li> This used to be my favorite shaving cream until i tried Art of Shaving Sandalwood scent.  It&#x27;s still a very good shaving cream but I&#x27;ve noticed that when I switch back to this from the Art of Shaving Cream, my skin gets a little irritated.  Would recommend Art of Shaving over this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent!  The cream lathers easily--the fastest lather I have ever seen. It&#x27;s creamy smooth with a mild scent of coconut oil that fades soon after the shave but is pleasant while it last.  It lubricated my face nicely and there is plenty of lather for 3 or 4 passes using a very small amount of the cream. This is not an inexpensive shaving cream but it is a quality product that I can easily recommend. I&#x27;ll be shopping for other Geo. F. Trumper products.</li>
            <li> I have been using TOBS Jermyn Street Sensitive Skin shave cream.  I really love the shave I get with that, but I decided to try this just as something different.  As much as I love the TOBS, I&#x27;d have to say this gave me a better shave.  The TOBS smell is much much better.  It has a very manly smell, whereas this is more neutral.  The coconut smell is very mild.  The lather is just as good as any other cream I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s very thick and creamy.  I noticed a difference right away my first time using this and when I was done, I did my usual across-the-grain pass and the difference was even more noticeable.  The razor just glides across my skin like nothing.  It&#x27;s an amazing product that gave me an even better shave than I thought was possible.  The TOBS produces a great shave and smells amazing, but the quality of this shave was better.  When I finished, my skin was smoother and seemed more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product with no reservation.  The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite, pleasant, but not my favorite, but the quality of the shave I am getting far outweighs any minor smell issues.</li>
