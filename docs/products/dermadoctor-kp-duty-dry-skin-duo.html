            <li>Does a great job smoothing out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for exfoliating</li>
            <li>This product is Amazing!</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to buy this product because I did not want to spend $80 on a product that was either unsuccessful or marginally successful.  </li>
            <li>so I assume it is doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Fairly good</li>
            <li>i had been looking for a good product combo to help my kp.</li>
            <li>and I am very glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Im very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with KP duty.  </li>
            <li>have used all sorts of KP creams and they kind of work.  </li>
            <li>kind of pricy</li>
            <li>The cream does not perform as advertised at all &amp; to pay that kind of money for a so so product</li>
            <li>This may be the best product combo I&#x27;ve used thus far...</li>
            <li>This stuff worked great at first</li>
            <li>I have continued using both of the products and my arms have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I was charged an additional $22 to be able to pick up the item ?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been faithfully using for about 1 week now, and it&#x27;s gotten even better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% gone, but I would say about 90% and the redness is better.  </li>
            <li>For $80 I want it to look better, not just feel better.</li>
            <li>I am moving on to find a better solution for my baby.</li>
            <li>I had tried a lot of different products for my KP, but I am very happy with the results from Dermadoctor&#x27;s KP Duty.  </li>
            <li>Redness still occurs every once in a while, but for the most part its unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>For many years, I thought I had acne.  </li>
            <li>but Emu Oil is way better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>E oil also helps to lock in moisture. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have keratosis rubra and the glytone kit works much better at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you are going to be in the sun, make sure you use a lotion with SPF in addition to using the Glytone kit.  </li>
            <li>The scrub is ok</li>
            <li>Even with my mild case, there wasn&#x27;t a magic, immediate disappearance.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge improvement in my skin&lt;</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>And after 2 weeks her cheeks are smooth and you would never know she has KP.  </li>
            <li>I do like the way these products make my skin feel - silky &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>Worked amazing on my sons arms, not so much on his face.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that makes a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>and it was worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different things for my KP, and these two products in combination have worked the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Works quickly and makes your skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>Order came quickly and my return was processed quickly with no problem</li>
            <li>After the first use my arms were moisturized and SMOOTH, however, I did not see the quick results in redness and bumps that others mentioned.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!!</li>
            <li>well worth the money in my case.</li>
            <li>they should have money back policy for this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>Purchased this item hoping for some success, not a miracle.  </li>
            <li>thought it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still think its worth the investment</li>
            <li>Although it might work better for someone who has only mild KP.</li>
            <li>And besides, this product has mixed reviews on the internet, although most people report that they had success.  </li>
            <li>just follow the instructions and use the scrub on dry skin, i used a combo of the lotion that came with the pack and my own creme lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used many products and with varying degrees of success such as retin-a, salicylic acid creams, urea creams, tretinoin cream, and anti-inflammatories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought the trial size first though</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think this product was worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cure-all, but my skin is much, much smoother now, and I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li>The arm that has been treated for 2 months looks a bit better than the one treated for only one month, so it does seem that there is a cumulative improvement over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this to try, having KP on his face was starting to bother him at the age he is.</li>
            <li>If this product doesn&#x27;t work for you initially, try using it more often that the directions suggest.  </li>
            <li>This products works well if u use it consistently, but its does require consistent use.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally tried it,</li>
            <li>The cream is nice also, odorless, makes my skin feel soft and smooth, with a very slight greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>With recent research I stumbled across Black African Soap &amp; I&#x27;ve heard nothing but GREAT reviews for this stuff, so I&#x27;ve just purchased the soap &amp; some Amlactin!</li>
            <li>the bumps and redness have really reduced.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really saw a difference</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend these products!</li>
            <li>The exfoliate is very \\&quot;gritty\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, but it just didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I have never, ever had so much as a mark on these areas of skin before in my life.    </li>
            <li>I was hopping this product was really what it promised to be.</li>
            <li>I was very hurt to learn that there is no cure.  </li>
            <li>just googled it and found this link which is very helpful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did so much research on it &amp; found this product.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it and sells it in his office, but it is much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but I do think there are many other cheaper exfoliating products .&lt;br</li>
            <li>after just ONE month of using it every other day or so and keeping my skin hydrated, my skin is SO much better.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of buying this product, research further and ask yourself if it&#x27;s truly worth the cost!</li>
            <li>It appeared last winter when she was 9, it was mild then.  </li>
            <li>I had high hope for this product after reading a lot about it online.      </li>
            <li>For me, it was worth the higher cost than some other products...</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think this cream and scrub would make that much difference after trying a lot of different products</li>
            <li>, if you are thinking of buying this product try the trial size first to see if it will work for your kp, no kp is ever the same.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I have pretty severe keratosis on my upper arms and on my calves.</li>
            <li>first, I used the products only on one arm.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and nothing seems to clear my kp.  </li>
            <li>Helped me out after having a baby and wanting to get my skin clear again.</li>
            <li>I have had KP my whole life and had found nothing that actually helped.  </li>
            <li>There is no cure for KP, but at least with these products I&#x27;ll be able to wear short-sleeves this summer without being embarassed.</li>
            <li>Ive been using them both for about 2 months now and the bumps are nearly nonexistent.</li>
            <li>I would not be surprised</li>
            <li>; Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I used the scrub first, on DRY skin, then the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I buy Dermadoctor products before, always with the same success - Highly recomendable due quality and service.</li>
            <li>Also, the other reviews are right...</li>
            <li>I am sure this will last at least 6 months for the lotion, and longer for the scrub.  </li>
            <li>that was enough of a trial for me, clearly there was improvement.</li>
            <li>I have had KP on my outer upper arms for years (nearly 20) and nothing any MD has ever prescribed made the smallest dent.    </li>
            <li>but I use the scrub and the cream and in the last 2 weeks I am nearly cleared of KP.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 year old son who has keratosis pilaris on his upper arms and his cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I spent $100 on the scrub &amp; the moisturizer at Sephora &amp; it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>BUT, even \\&quot;a little rough\\&quot; in the second half of the day is better than it ever was before using this product.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is a little greasy but not unbearable, and the scrub feels very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>We all seem to have the dreaded chicken skin, and this seems to really do the trick at making that better.</li>
            <li>In fact, they are almost totally gone near the front of my upper arm.    </li>
            <li>In fact, I felt it actually got worse before it got better.  </li>
            <li>He said there really isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;cure,\\&quot; other than regular exfoliation.</li>
            <li>First, I want to say that a little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> I have had KP on my outer upper arms for years (nearly 20) and nothing any MD has ever prescribed made the smallest dent.    </li>
            <li> but I use the scrub and the cream and in the last 2 weeks I am nearly cleared of KP.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old son who has keratosis pilaris on his upper arms and his cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I spent $100 on the scrub &amp; the moisturizer at Sephora &amp; it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> BUT, even \\&quot;a little rough\\&quot; in the second half of the day is better than it ever was before using this product.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is a little greasy but not unbearable, and the scrub feels very gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> We all seem to have the dreaded chicken skin, and this seems to really do the trick at making that better.</li>
            <li> In fact, they are almost totally gone near the front of my upper arm.    </li>
            <li> In fact, I felt it actually got worse before it got better.  </li>
            <li> He said there really isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;cure,\\&quot; other than regular exfoliation.</li>
            <li> First, I want to say that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Price is a little high for my taste, but of course, it is cheaper than some of the prescription lotions.</li>
            <li> and I can not tell you how smooth and soft my arms feel (which is weird to say because they have always been so dry and rough).  </li>
            <li> later I discovered that it was complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The only change that happened was due to maybe smoother skin, but this can be achieved through just applying regular lotion.</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick and doesnt get absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li> I had a mild-to-medium case for about 6 years, and didn&#x27;t know what it was for a long time until I asked a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that my kp is starting to come back a little.</li>
            <li> and I have seen little change in the red bumps on my upper arms.  </li>
            <li> I saw other reviews that said the same.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> and Im only maybe a quarter thru the lotion and less than that on the scrub.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use, I do see some modest improvement in my KP, but in all fairness, my KP is pretty bad</li>
            <li> I use it now a few times a week and treat it like gold to last a while and its been working.</li>
            <li> But in reality the bumps are still there and the skin is rough.</li>
            <li> I sucked it up and spent the money for the KP duty duo set of exfoliator and scrub</li>
            <li> even the pink marks, which took a bit longer to disappear than the raised bumps did.</li>
            <li> - Expected product quality - Delivered before the expected day.</li>
            <li> The lotion is extremly thick and creamy, and my arms are really soft.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t work, there are other products on the market targeted for this skin condition.  </li>
            <li> Lasts about 1/2 of a day for me, and then my skin tends to get a little rough again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Treatment: I use the scrub 2 times a week, and use the cream once every other day (less than the recommended amount).</li>
            <li> The rednes is about 90% improved and the bumps, while still dark and visible have improved about 70% in smoothness.  </li>
            <li> I do think it helps with exfoliating, but not worth the money for me to help treat Keratosis Pilaris</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter suffers from moderate KP on her cheeks.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to really notice a difference, expensive but it definately has helped get rid of the bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> it reduced the bumps and redness slightly.</li>
            <li> My KP began to get worse and spread further down my arms.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is one or the other or maybe the combination of both</li>
            <li> only worse.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not only it did not help, but I think to some extent it made the problem worse.</li>
            <li> I actually think it made it look worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After Christmas, I went into Ulta store to pick up a few products.  </li>
            <li> For this being as expensive as it is, it does not work nearly as well as the Glytone KP Kit.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Dermadoctor.</li>

            <li> at least it did not worsen them.</li>
            <li> I have read some of the negative reviews for this product, and I feel sorry and frustrated for the folks who did not have success.</li>
            <li> the lotion is thick and doesnt smell fruity or flowery but works.</li>

            <li> It works almost instantly to get rid of your chicken skin!</li>

            <li> Mine has gotten progressively worse and even worse since I had my child.  </li>
            <li> It maybe even made it worse.</li>

            <li> It is expensive and it DOESNT WORK.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with some of the reviews, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad kp on my arms for the past 20 yrs and have tried everything! This stuff worked great at first but I have noticed that my kp is starting to come back a little. I have been using it twice a week for the past four months and the bumps and redness have really reduced. I wish I could afford to use the lotion every day but it is really expensive. I think the scrub will last me a year. I bought the trial size first though, if you are thinking of buying this product try the trial size first to see if it will work for your kp, no kp is ever the same.</li>
            <li> I bought the KP Regimen Kit about a month ago.  I have had KP my whole life and had found nothing that actually helped.  My KP began to get worse and spread further down my arms.  I bought these products and started using them immediately as directed.  After the first use my arms were moisturized and SMOOTH, however, I did not see the quick results in redness and bumps that others mentioned.  In fact, I felt it actually got worse before it got better.  I was just about to give up on the product when (about 1 month in) I started to see results.  I have continued using both of the products and my arms have never looked better.  I would say about 95% of my bumps are gone and I can not tell you how smooth and soft my arms feel (which is weird to say because they have always been so dry and rough).  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have had KP on my outer upper arms for years (nearly 20) and nothing any MD has ever prescribed made the smallest dent.    I live in Alabama and hated having to wear sleeves on 100+ degree days in July and August.  I have been using the KP Duty cream for about a month. Idon&#x27;t use the scrub, but use a salicylic acid wash with a loofah everytime I shower, then use the KP cream.  The results have been great. The rednes is about 90% improved and the bumps, while still dark and visible have improved about 70% in smoothness.  In fact, they are almost totally gone near the front of my upper arm.    Once my acne body wash is gone, I may try the KP scrub, too.</li>
            <li> Another product that claims to work for KP.  DONT BOTHER!  It is expensive and it DOESNT WORK.</li>
            <li> I find that you have to use the kit for it to work. I really saw a difference and I&#x27;ve had KP for over 10 years. I think the moisturizer doest work as well by itself.</li>
            <li> I was charged an additional $22 to be able to pick up the item ? was told it&#x27;s duties by the broker?</li>
            <li> nothing else got rid of the redness or bumps on the back of my upper arms.  this one did it.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter suffers from moderate KP on her cheeks. It appeared last winter when she was 9, it was mild then.  It disappeared over the summer, then came back this winter...only worse. Bumps covered both her cheeks.   I took her to a dermatologist who said there was nothing we could do. We tried everything over the counter, nothing helped. I did some online research and saw this product and decided to try it. I was upset because when I read the jar of the body scrub it said do not use on the face.  Well guess what? We did anyway and nothing bad happened. I had her use the scrub 2 times a week and the lotion every day morning and night.  I noticed a difference after a few days.  And after 2 weeks her cheeks are smooth and you would never know she has KP.  I HIGHLY recommend these products!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything and nothing seems to clear my kp.  Some products will reduce it but this is the best I have ever tried.  I am not sure if it is one or the other or maybe the combination of both but I use the scrub and the cream and in the last 2 weeks I am nearly cleared of KP.  Mine has gotten progressively worse and even worse since I had my child.  I hope this continues because I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to really notice a difference, expensive but it definately has helped get rid of the bumps on my arms. I use it now a few times a week and treat it like gold to last a while and its been working.</li>
            <li> I do like the way these products make my skin feel - silky &amp; smooth.  The exfoliate is very \\&quot;gritty\\&quot;...so I assume it is doing a good job.  This is just an observation, not a positive or negative comment.  The cream is nice also, odorless, makes my skin feel soft and smooth, with a very slight greasy feeling.  After several weeks of use, I do see some modest improvement in my KP, but in all fairness, my KP is pretty bad and I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that makes a significant difference.  This may be the best product combo I&#x27;ve used thus far...I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and see how things progress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different things for my KP, and these two products in combination have worked the best so far.  I noticed an almost immediate reduction in redness and bumps once I started using them.  I use the scrub twice a week and the lotion daily after I shower.  The lotion is a little greasy but not unbearable, and the scrub feels very gentle on the skin.  There is no cure for KP, but at least with these products I&#x27;ll be able to wear short-sleeves this summer without being embarassed.</li>
            <li> i have recently purchased the derma doctor kp duty kit. i do think that it helps. my skin definetly seems softer and smoother. it reduced the bumps and redness slightly. the lotion is thick and doesnt smell fruity or flowery but works. the scrub is sort of like rubbing sand all over your body but i think it really helps remove all the dead skin. all together i like it. it serves it purpose. a little on the expensive side but i guess you have to pay to get results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using lac lotion a Rx for about 3 years for my KP.  I could see and feel a difference in 2 days.  WOW!  I&#x27;ve been faithfully using for about 1 week now, and it&#x27;s gotten even better.  It&#x27;s not 100% gone, but I would say about 90% and the redness is better.  I was skeptical with some of the reviews, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and it was worth it!</li>
            <li> I have KP pretty bad on my arms. I used the scrub/lotion combo as directed until it ran out (about 2 months). My arms were definitely smoother &amp; softer, but it had no effect on the red, patchy appearance. For $80 I want it to look better, not just feel better. Although it might work better for someone who has only mild KP.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money! I bought this product after reading reviews as I have red spots(just like goosebumps) on my arms and thighs. I used it regularly for 2 months. The skin seemed softer but the spots didn&#x27;t disappear at all. Infact the skin seems to have become one shade darker which makes it look like spots are gone. But in reality the bumps are still there and the skin is rough. The cream is very thick and doesnt get absorbed into skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Does a great job smoothing out my skin.  Lasts about 1/2 of a day for me, and then my skin tends to get a little rough again.  BUT, even \\&quot;a little rough\\&quot; in the second half of the day is better than it ever was before using this product.  Price is a little high for my taste, but of course, it is cheaper than some of the prescription lotions.</li>
            <li> My baby has KP and this product did not improve his condition at all. at least it did not worsen them. I am moving on to find a better solution for my baby.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 weeks and I have seen little change in the red bumps on my upper arms.  The lotion is extremly thick and creamy, and my arms are really soft.  I will continue use, and hopefully the red bumps will go away.  But unless they do I won&#x27;t be spending $80 on the scrub and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/1/13&lt;br /&gt;So I really don&#x27;t think this product was worth the money for me.  I really wanted it to work, but it just didn&#x27;t.  I am going to save my money.</li>
            <li> I had tried a lot of different products for my KP, but I am very happy with the results from Dermadoctor&#x27;s KP Duty.  It&#x27;s not a cure-all, but my skin is much, much smoother now, and I will continue to use this product! For me, it was worth the higher cost than some other products...I feel like I can go sleeveless again!</li>
            <li> I had high hope for this product after reading a lot about it online.      I have KP on my butt :-(    After using these 2 products for a week, I now have a massive outbreak of itchy KP on my back, neck and chest.  I have never, ever had so much as a mark on these areas of skin before in my life.    A coincidence?  I don&#x27;t believe so.    I will discontinue use immediately.</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing! Works quickly and makes your skin so smooth. Helped me out after having a baby and wanting to get my skin clear again. THANKS!!</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe keratosis on my upper arms and on my calves. I sucked it up and spent the money for the KP duty duo set of exfoliator and scrub and I am very glad that I did. Ive been using them both for about 2 months now and the bumps are nearly nonexistent. Redness still occurs every once in a while, but for the most part its unnoticeable. Im very pleased with this purchase. Also, the other reviews are right...a little goes a long way with this product. Like I said, Ive been using for 2 months (scrub twice weekly, lotion twice daily) and Im only maybe a quarter thru the lotion and less than that on the scrub.</li>
            <li> These two products together took away the keratosis pilaris I had on the backs of my arms (from the wrist to the armpit). I had a mild-to-medium case for about 6 years, and didn&#x27;t know what it was for a long time until I asked a dermatologist. He said there really isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;cure,\\&quot; other than regular exfoliation. That&#x27;s when I found this product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I used the products only on one arm. After about a month, the treated arm looked and felt a lot smoother than the untreated one... that was enough of a trial for me, clearly there was improvement. Now, I have been using the products for about 2 months, and both arms have cleared up... even the pink marks, which took a bit longer to disappear than the raised bumps did. The arm that has been treated for 2 months looks a bit better than the one treated for only one month, so it does seem that there is a cumulative improvement over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment: I use the scrub 2 times a week, and use the cream once every other day (less than the recommended amount). I would not be surprised if my $80 supply lasts me a year... well worth the money in my case. If you are going to try it, give it time to work. Even with my mild case, there wasn&#x27;t a magic, immediate disappearance. Like i said: 1 month to see improvement, and after 2 months it&#x27;s gone. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I was hopping this product was really what it promised to be. However,$80 later I discovered that it was complete waste of money. Not only it did not help, but I think to some extent it made the problem worse. they should have money back policy for this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  I have tried all kinds of soaps and lotions,  but this is the only thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item hoping for some success, not a miracle.  I did not see any improvement at all.  I actually think it made it look worse. Subway it will work for someone else.</li>
            <li> Perfect Delivery (to Spain) - Expected product quality - Delivered before the expected day. I buy Dermadoctor products before, always with the same success - Highly recomendable due quality and service.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old son who has keratosis pilaris on his upper arms and his cheeks.  The dermatologist gave him lac-hydrin which did absolutly nothing.  I cam across this, and while expensive, thought it would be worth a try.  First, I want to say that a little goes a long way.  I am sure this will last at least 6 months for the lotion, and longer for the scrub.  He uses the scrub 2-3 times a week on his arms, and about 1-2 a week on his face.  The lotion is used twice a day, every day.  The lotion has no fragrance, which he appreciates. The scrub is not recommended for the face, but he has had no problem with it once or twice a week, it gets rubbed for just about 10 seconds.  The bumps on his cheeks have gone from about 15 per cheek to 3, and they are much smaller. This is after 2 weeks of use. The redness has even improved.  I am so glad I bought this to try, having KP on his face was starting to bother him at the age he is.</li>
            <li> I have had this set for years! It works almost instantly to get rid of your chicken skin!</li>
            <li> I have KP (just figured out what it is called)on my face only, and I have tried various products on my skin unsuccessfully. For many years, I thought I had acne.  But regardless of the acne products I used, the bumps would not go away.  One day, I happened to be surfing the internet and read an article about \\&quot;chicken skin.\\&quot;  It occurred to me then that I had this skin condition.  I was very hurt to learn that there is no cure.  I immediately began my research for something that could help my condition.  I tried Amlactin unsuccessfully, AHA lotion %10 unsuccessfully, and various scrubs and microdermabrasion kits unsuccessfully.  I even tried Glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and lactic acid peels.  None of these products worked to smoothen my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Christmas, I went into Ulta store to pick up a few products.  I decided to ask the store clerk about KP duty, a product I had read about on the internet.  I was reluctant to buy this product because I did not want to spend $80 on a product that was either unsuccessful or marginally successful.  And besides, this product has mixed reviews on the internet, although most people report that they had success.  I took a chance, and purchased both the moisturizer and the scrub.  I went home and started using these products immediately.  One thing that I noticed on the scrub container, it said the product is intended for the body (and not the face).  I did not let that deter me from using this product on my face.  I used the scrub first, on DRY skin, then the moisturizer.  The next day, I used both the scrub and the moisturizer twice.  By the third day of use, my skin was 98% smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with KP duty.  I have read some of the negative reviews for this product, and I feel sorry and frustrated for the folks who did not have success. I know from personal experience the pain and embarassment that comes with this skin condition.  If this product doesn&#x27;t work for you initially, try using it more often that the directions suggest.  If that doesn&#x27;t work, there are other products on the market targeted for this skin condition.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Fairly good but Emu Oil is way better and cheaper.  Great for exfoliating but I do think there are many other cheaper exfoliating products .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used all sorts of KP creams and they kind of work.  I recently tried Emu Oil.  It is inexpensive and worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://wonderoil.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just googled it and found this link which is very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-825-EMU%20OIL.aspx?activeIngredientId&#x3D;825&amp;activeIngredientName&#x3D;EMU%20OIL</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. I have tried all kinds of soaps and lotions,&lt;br /&gt;but this is the only thing that has worked for me and my family.  We all seem to have the dreaded chicken skin, and this seems to really do the trick at making that better.</li>
            <li> i had been looking for a good product combo to help my kp. it was getting really bad all over with the change in weather. after just ONE month of using it every other day or so and keeping my skin hydrated, my skin is SO much better. this stuff works amazingly!! just follow the instructions and use the scrub on dry skin, i used a combo of the lotion that came with the pack and my own creme lotion. vita. E oil also helps to lock in moisture. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I tried the kp duty lotion only.As I was afraid,it only made my skin softer but did nothing for the bumps or redness.I saw other reviews that said the same.Back to the drawing board</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple products and visited my dermatologist, but nothing worked as well as these products do!  I&#x27;m SO happy!!</li>
            <li> It needs time&lt;br /&gt;But I noticed a huge improvement in my skin&lt;br /&gt;It kind of pricy but it actually works</li>
            <li> This products works well if u use it consistently, but its does require consistent use. The &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; will come back once you stop using it, although it does take a while to come back. I still think its worth the investment</li>
            <li> I have been having horrible KP on my arms, &amp; thighs since having my son so desperate for a cure (unfortunately there isn&#x27;t one) I did so much research on it &amp; found this product. I spent $100 on the scrub &amp; the moisturizer at Sephora &amp; it did absolutely nothing. It maybe even made it worse. I really had my hopes up.. :( With recent research I stumbled across Black African Soap &amp; I&#x27;ve heard nothing but GREAT reviews for this stuff, so I&#x27;ve just purchased the soap &amp; some Amlactin! *my fingers are crossed*</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!! It works wonders!</li>
            <li> I used this and I don&#x27;t see a huge difference. I do think it helps with exfoliating, but not worth the money for me to help treat Keratosis Pilaris</li>
            <li> Worked amazing on my sons arms, not so much on his face.  I have KP on the backs of my arms, after using about 3 times my KP is almost gone!</li>
            <li> For this being as expensive as it is, it does not work nearly as well as the Glytone KP Kit.  I have keratosis rubra and the glytone kit works much better at a fraction of the price.  My dermatologist recommended it and sells it in his office, but it is much cheaper on Amazon.  You have to keep using it, since there is no cure.  I use it in combination with a prescription lotion that combats the redness.  If you have regular KP, it should do wonders.  Also, if you are going to be in the sun, make sure you use a lotion with SPF in addition to using the Glytone kit.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Dermadoctor.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for my KP!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this cream and scrub would make that much difference after trying a lot of different products but this does make a difference on my bumpy arms. Glad I finally tried it,</li>
            <li> The scrub is ok but then what scrub isn&#x27;t? The cream does not perform as advertised at all &amp; to pay that kind of money for a so so product well all I can say is &amp;#34;Good advertising!&amp;#34; Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I returned this - I didn&#x27;t realize it was not for facial use. Order came quickly and my return was processed quickly with no problem</li>
            <li> The lotion is terrible. I am reviewing this product after using it about one year ago. I used the entire product and literally, there was no change. The only change that happened was due to maybe smoother skin, but this can be achieved through just applying regular lotion. I have used many products and with varying degrees of success such as retin-a, salicylic acid creams, urea creams, tretinoin cream, and anti-inflammatories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to believe that many reviews on Amazon are fake, especially with this product. If you are thinking of buying this product, research further and ask yourself if it&#x27;s truly worth the cost!</li>
