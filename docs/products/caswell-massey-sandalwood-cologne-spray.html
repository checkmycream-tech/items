            <li>This is an excellent sandalwood cologne!</li>
            <li>This is the best sandalwood cologne there is on the market.  </li>
            <li>Has a very good aroma.</li>
            <li>Good scents!    </li>
            <li>It is a welcome addition  to my sandalwood collection, but I&#x27;m still looking for the heavier sandalwood scent that eludes me.</li>
            <li>A great scent, just not for men in my opinion.    </li>
            <li>This is a great scent for summer evenings, because it doesn&#x27;t disappear in a flash.</li>
            <li>The Sandalwood Cologne Spray is a great change of pace.  </li>
            <li>Great value for a sandalwood.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent of a Sandalwood and soap.</li>
            <li>Everyone tells me I smell really good.  </li>
            <li>Fascinating scent.</li>
            <li>Good vender</li>
            <li>There are a lot of good sandalwood colognes out there that cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>Smells good after about an hour.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good, but not sandalwood.</li>
            <li>love this also smells great,  </li>
            <li>the ladies love it!</li>
            <li>Bought for my son and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>He has always loved Caswell and Massey&#x27;s products and this is his favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice decorative bottle if that sways your fancy.    </li>
            <li>It is a very strong sweet scent that doesn&#x27;t hint at all, which is what I believe a great men&#x27;s cologne should do,</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this scent for many years now, and so glad to find it here on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Strong!</li>
            <li>Very strong and potent, lasted for 12+ hours.</li>
            <li>I love sandalwood</li>
            <li>My husband told me not to wear it any more.</li>
            <li>Cons or More</li>
            <li>I do think this one is more &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; ie, more alcoholy than others, and has notes of citrus and cedar wood.  </li>
            <li>(but in a charming way), and at the end good old soap.  </li>
            <li>Love their products.</li>
            <li>There are also many affordable ones out there, but most of them do not smell anything like sandalwood.</li>
            <li>like I am you will surely like this cologne.</li>
            <li>I spray it liberally--especially all over my hair and on whatever I&#x27;m wearing on top.</li>
            <li>I would say I get more compliments on it from women than men.</li>
            <li>Sandlewood is his favorite, however, I found out by shopping at the stores that carry Caswell -Massey that it is being discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Gotta love a product from the oldest apothecary in the USA.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne and the sandalwood fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love Caswell  Massey products.</li>
            <li>I love to smell this cologne.</li>
            <li>That warm, clean tropical scent will drive women nuts.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, well worth the price, very impressive, well liked by many - especially women. . .</li>
            <li>After that first hour it starts smelling like sandalwood, and really good.</li>
            <li>This is a strong smelling substitute for the geo trumper version which I really love.</li>
            <li>Instead, it is overly sweet, cloying and smells more like a urinal deodorant cake than anything else.</li>
            <li>overwhelming or sweet, one can wear it on any occasion.</li>
            <li>this is light and sweet-sandalwoody.  </li>
            <li>It is woodsy and light.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a light perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a glass bottle and that will hold the scent for years - glass bottles are extremely important in this regard.</li>
            <li>Attribute it to buying a fragrance I had never smelled over the Internet, but I did think \\&quot;sandalwood\\&quot; would be a pretty safe bet.  </li>
            <li>The scent did not even resemble the original fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has a very enduring longevity - 8-12 hrs easy - and that is one very significant point to have in colognes.</li>
            <li>Caswell-Massey was recommended to me on a Shaving forum and when I saw it available on Amazon for Under $25 I quickly added it to my shopping cart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could still smell the clean soapy smell of the Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries quickly to leave a light, clean, woodsy aroma that people don&#x27;t notice unless they&#x27;re close to me, but when they are, they say things like \\&quot;What shampoo do you use?</li>
            <li>It makes special occasions special.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good sandalwood cologne that is affordable and actually smells like sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is a light, fresh cologne that I have been wearing for over 20 years and to this day continue to receive compliments.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is not bad</li>
            <li>Instead it was very overpowering and had a pure &#x27;cologne&#x27; kind of pungency.  </li>
            <li>Love the conogne and recieved before promosed time, will order agan from Top Ten.</li>
            <li>A more feminine Sandalwood scent that you would normally find in perfume rather than cologne.</li>
            <li>Fast becoming my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li>Lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>Smells more like Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Nice amount, 3.4 oz, and it should last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite version of sandalwood spray.. Smells more like sharp baby powder.</li>
            <li>If you judge it right out of the bottle, you might not like it.</li>
            <li>Even when I wore it to work it lasted all day which is amazing since it was a hot summer day doing physical work and sweating a lot.</li>
            <li>Initially it was marketed as a unisex fragrance, I find it more on the feminine side, wish they could make it more masculine</li>
            <li>sandalwood oil is much and far better that</li>
            <li>I love the subtle, rich, enticing scents of Sandalwood and find the cologne to be an outstanding value for the price.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like lemon pledge.</li>
            <li>Very distinctive!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more orders.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it stunk.</li>
            <li>A very masculine woodsy, but clean scent.</li>
            <li>Someone passed by me once and said they just wanted to stand there and stiff because they loved it.  </li>
            <li>You would be hard pressed to find a better Sandalwood cologne for a better price.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fresh, masculine, natural aroma.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sandalwood that settles down soon after it is applied.</li>
            <li>One only needs a drop of this, otherwise it will be too strong.</li>
            <li>It is hard to see good products disappear.</li>
            <li>Some things are absolutely timeless.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The scent is very persistent.</li>
            <li>It had a very old-fashioned smell to me.</li>
            <li>I have never had a cologne that I like as much as this one.  </li>
            <li>Not certain how this would be considered \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; as it&#x27;s definitely more of a guy&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li>But this carried more of a sharp, chemical smell than anything else.  </li>
            <li>Sandelwood cologne spray has  a lovely scent for everyday ware..</li>
            <li>I am familiar with many different sandalwood scents-- mysore, Australian, Indonesian, Chinese bee &amp; flower co., red sandalwood--</li>
            <li>I have to have a new bottle every Christmas,</li>
            <li>sandalwood has always a favorite of myself and my sons  not overwhelming or fruity by any means.  </li>
            <li>It does not have the powerful woody spicy notes that some other do, but it is nonetheless a very pleasing fragrance.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>wonderful!\\&quot; People especially notice it during quick social hugs.</li>
            <li>wrote to Big Fly, the seller, and they offered to return the purchase price less shipping and postage and less a 15% re-stocking fee charged against my cost.</li>
            <li>far I have worn it twice.</li>
            <li>I was very sweaty by the end of the shift and yet the entire drive home</li>
            <li>Smells nothing like real sandalwood cologne should.&lt;br /&gt;Overly sweet &amp; floral and at least to me, nauseating smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many different Sandalwood products for a while now and was recently presented with a conundrum: find a new cologne after my past brand up and vanished from the local cologne store.</li>
            <li>The first whiff is really sharp and spicey...</li>
            <li>The first resinous, turpentine-y blast smells like a sawmill, and as the scent continues it reminds me a bit of other sandalwood classics -- Habit Rouge, the aforementioned Piping Rock, Jade East</li>
            <li>Complex scent, not overpowering, not too sweet, but not sharp either.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many different Sandalwood products for a while now and was recently presented with a conundrum: find a new cologne after my past brand up and vanished from the local cologne store.</li>
            <li> The first whiff is really sharp and spicey...</li>
            <li> The first resinous, turpentine-y blast smells like a sawmill, and as the scent continues it reminds me a bit of other sandalwood classics -- Habit Rouge, the aforementioned Piping Rock, Jade East</li>
            <li> Complex scent, not overpowering, not too sweet, but not sharp either.</li>
            <li> I do not know what I will do after this gift is gone as the other brands of sandalwood colognes do not smell anywhere near this brand, and my husband does not like any of the others.  </li>
            <li> This cologne is not overpowering and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled fragrances with a sandalwood base and loved them.  </li>
            <li> Lemon Pledge is a only a slight exaggeration</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who wears expensive French floral perfume on special evenings, but this sandalwood cologne has been my everyday, all the time, scent for over twenty years.</li>
            <li> I only sprayed a little on my forearm and despite two soapy latherings, I am still being tormented by the stench of it.</li>
            <li> Caswell-Massey Sandalwood was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not real powerful...</li>
            <li> Not even remotely close.</li>
            <li> It just smells bitter and woodsy.</li>
            <li> Item as described, service as expected.</li>

            <li> I tested it a few times to make sure I hated it as much as I thought</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A great smelling fragrance for the collection!  I would purchase again, no doubt.</li>
            <li> This really disappointed me. It did not smell like sandalwood at all. Instead it was very overpowering and had a pure &#x27;cologne&#x27; kind of pungency.  I tested it a few times to make sure I hated it as much as I thought but I had to take a shower every time because I couldn&#x27;t stand smelling myself.  Not exaggerating at all.  Also it was unreturnable, so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  If you are looking for something that actually smells like sandalwood, this is NOT for you.</li>
            <li> this is light and sweet-sandalwoody.  Everyone tells me I smell really good.  I&#x27;m also allergic to perfume and this doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.  They need to stock up on it though.  Last time it was low on stock and I had to wait about 3 weeks for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on this, I don&#x27;t often wear cologne.  But this carried more of a sharp, chemical smell than anything else.  My wife hated it.</li>
            <li> Has a very good aroma. Bought for my son and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells nothing at all like Sandalwood. Not even remotely close. It smells exactly like lemon pledge. If you want to smell like you&#x27;ve been cleaning all day with lemon pledge then this is the odor for you! YUK!!</li>
            <li> Fascinating scent. Very distinctive!</li>
            <li> sandalwood has always a favorite of myself and my sons  not overwhelming or fruity by any means.  besides....the ladies love it!</li>
            <li> Thought I had perhaps found a scent of sandalwood. I have not found it in this product. A costly $35 mistake. Not sure that this is useful for any other use, because it&#x27;s an overpowering bad smell. I&#x27;d hate to even use it as a gift! My search continues.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this scent for many years now, and so glad to find it here on Amazon!  Good scents!    Cheers!</li>
            <li> This is a nice sandalwood that settles down soon after it is applied. It does not have the powerful woody spicy notes that some other do, but it is nonetheless a very pleasing fragrance. It is a welcome addition  to my sandalwood collection, but I&#x27;m still looking for the heavier sandalwood scent that eludes me.</li>
            <li> I love sandalwood but this cologne isn&#x27;t even close. Instead, it is overly sweet, cloying and smells more like a urinal deodorant cake than anything else. I only sprayed a little on my forearm and despite two soapy latherings, I am still being tormented by the stench of it.</li>
            <li> This has become my \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; once again.  I just cannot afford the \\&quot;Tam Dao\\&quot; for $108.00 a bottle, this is a close second and actually is a bit stronger.  Not certain how this would be considered \\&quot;unisex\\&quot; as it&#x27;s definitely more of a guy&#x27;s scent.  It is woodsy and light.  I&#x27;ll be back for more orders.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Unpleasant scent. Somewhat sandalwoody, but with other notes that clash. My husband told me not to wear it any more. I had to agree.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my other half for Christmas. He has always loved Caswell and Massey&#x27;s products and this is his favorite. Everyone loves it and it is one of the oldest fragrances used. Some things are absolutely timeless.</li>
            <li> Sandelwood cologne spray has  a lovely scent for everyday ware..Since it is .not overwhelming or sweet, one can wear it on any occasion.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite version of sandalwood spray.. Smells more like sharp baby powder.</li>
            <li> While this is advertised as a unisex cologne, it, in my opinion, lies heavily on the feminine side of the Sandalwood scent. I&#x27;ve purchased many different Sandalwood products for a while now and was recently presented with a conundrum: find a new cologne after my past brand up and vanished from the local cologne store. So I took a risk on this one having purchased from Caswell-Massey before with positive outcomes and sadly found that wearing this cologne is like wearing my grandmothers perfume. It is a very strong sweet scent that doesn&#x27;t hint at all, which is what I believe a great men&#x27;s cologne should do, hint. This is what I would expect from a woman&#x27;s perfume. A great scent, just not for men in my opinion.    Pros- A little goes a long way. Even if you used this every day I couldn&#x27;t see having to restock for AT LEAST a few years. Very strong and potent, lasted for 12+ hours. Nice decorative bottle if that sways your fancy.    Cons or More Pros- A more feminine Sandalwood scent that you would normally find in perfume rather than cologne.</li>
            <li> This fragrance introduced me to sandalwood.  I cannot get used to any other scent that goes by that name.  I do think this one is more &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; ie, more alcoholy than others, and has notes of citrus and cedar wood.  Initially it was marketed as a unisex fragrance, I find it more on the feminine side, wish they could make it more masculine and I&#x27;m not sure what to suggest they change.  I am open to ideas.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time there was a scent called Piping Rock -- it was about the driest, cleanest sandalwood scent ever. This stuff is a bit sweeter and spicier, but not all that different. The first resinous, turpentine-y blast smells like a sawmill, and as the scent continues it reminds me a bit of other sandalwood classics -- Habit Rouge, the aforementioned Piping Rock, Jade East (but in a charming way), and at the end good old soap.  This is a great scent for summer evenings, because it doesn&#x27;t disappear in a flash. I recommend walking through a few sprays of this after a shower. But a word of warning -- there really are benzene ring compounds in there, and this stuff can stain a white shirt like crazy.  Don&#x27;t worry. That warm, clean tropical scent will drive women nuts.</li>
            <li> love this also smells great,  thank you</li>
            <li> I am familiar with many different sandalwood scents-- mysore, Australian, Indonesian, Chinese bee &amp; flower co., red sandalwood-- and this is not sandalwood. It just smells bitter and woodsy. I can imagine people liking this but it will not satisfy your craving for that scent. Lemon Pledge is a only a slight exaggeration</li>
            <li> I have this and have had the trumper. This is a strong smelling substitute for the geo trumper version which I really love. One only needs a drop of this, otherwise it will be too strong. It probably lasts half a day before fading away. I&#x27;ve had this bottle 4yrs but do not use it everyday like I used to use the trumper version, but if your budget won&#x27;t allow the trumper then you may like this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the sandalwood cologne for my husband.  He was very happy with the gift. The order arrived in a timely manner and in excellant condition. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love their products. Good vender</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good sandalwood cologne that is affordable and actually smells like sandalwood. There are a lot of good sandalwood colognes out there that cost an arm and a leg. There are also many affordable ones out there, but most of them do not smell anything like sandalwood. Caswell-Massey was recommended to me on a Shaving forum and when I saw it available on Amazon for Under $25 I quickly added it to my shopping cart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have worn it twice. Once out with the family and once to work. It has a pleasant scent of a Sandalwood and soap. A very masculine woodsy, but clean scent. The scent is very persistent. I find that I can use a small amount and it is not overpowering and it lasts all day long. Even when I wore it to work it lasted all day which is amazing since it was a hot summer day doing physical work and sweating a lot. I was very sweaty by the end of the shift and yet the entire drive home I could still smell the clean soapy smell of the Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a fan of Sandalwood like I am you will surely like this cologne. You would be hard pressed to find a better Sandalwood cologne for a better price. If you never smelled Sandalwood before and not sure if you would like it, you may want to sample this at a department store first because Sandalwood can be an acquired taste.</li>
            <li> The Sandalwood Cologne Spray is a great change of pace.  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  It makes special occasions special.</li>
            <li> Strong! One spray, into the air and I walk into it...and that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed. Complex scent, not overpowering, not too sweet, but not sharp either. Great value for a sandalwood. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the conogne and recieved before promosed time, will order agan from Top Ten.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is a light, fresh cologne that I have been wearing for over 20 years and to this day continue to receive compliments.  I initially thought the cologne was for men and then discovered it was also for women. I love the subtle, rich, enticing scents of Sandalwood and find the cologne to be an outstanding value for the price.</li>
            <li> i bought it because I like sandalwood. I was expecting a light perfume. this is quite heavy. it ended up being my air freshener...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who wears expensive French floral perfume on special evenings, but this sandalwood cologne has been my everyday, all the time, scent for over twenty years. I spray it liberally--especially all over my hair and on whatever I&#x27;m wearing on top. It dries quickly to leave a light, clean, woodsy aroma that people don&#x27;t notice unless they&#x27;re close to me, but when they are, they say things like \\&quot;What shampoo do you use? Your hair smells wonderful!\\&quot; People especially notice it during quick social hugs. I would say I get more compliments on it from women than men. Often I hear, \\&quot;I usually don&#x27;t like perfume or cologne, but I like that one!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say it&#x27;s definitely a unisex cologne...a superb one!</li>
            <li> Very subtle &amp;#34;adult smelling&amp;#34; cologne. Not real powerful...just &amp;#34;there&amp;#34; which is how a cologne should be. My wife loves it. Fast becoming my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like sandalwood.  Smells more like Old Spice.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this scent for years.  Sandlewood is his favorite, however, I found out by shopping at the stores that carry Caswell -Massey that it is being discontinued.  I was ecstatic to find this bottle on Amazon.  I do not know what I will do after this gift is gone as the other brands of sandalwood colognes do not smell anywhere near this brand, and my husband does not like any of the others.  It is hard to see good products disappear.</li>
            <li> Gotta love a product from the oldest apothecary in the USA. Our colonial forebears -- including George Washington -- used Caswell Massey products. I really enjoy the fresh, masculine, natural aroma.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances not overwhelming. Lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> Item as described, service as expected.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch or something, but this was a mistake.  Attribute it to buying a fragrance I had never smelled over the Internet, but I did think \\&quot;sandalwood\\&quot; would be a pretty safe bet.  Smelled rotten.  Would not recommend...</li>
            <li> Love this cologne and the sandalwood fragrance. Love Caswell  Massey products. I will continue to buy products from this company especially this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Caswell-Massey Sandalwood was a huge disappointment. The scent did not even resemble the original fragrance. I am not sure what is the reason for the difference may be, perhaps the brand name was sold to a discount perfumer. Smelled like moldy wood rather than any rendition of sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to Big Fly, the seller, and they offered to return the purchase price less shipping and postage and less a 15% re-stocking fee charged against my cost. Something smells!</li>
            <li> Smells good after about an hour. The first whiff is really sharp and spicey... If you judge it right out of the bottle, you might not like it. After that first hour it starts smelling like sandalwood, and really good.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sandalwood cologne! It has a very enduring longevity - 8-12 hrs easy - and that is one very significant point to have in colognes. Put it on in the morning and not worry with it throughout the entire day. Nice amount, 3.4 oz, and it should last for quite awhile. It&#x27;s in a glass bottle and that will hold the scent for years - glass bottles are extremely important in this regard. In conclusion, well worth the price, very impressive, well liked by many - especially women. . .</li>
            <li> This is the best sandalwood cologne there is on the market.  This cologne is not overpowering and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> husband loves the scent and so do I</li>
            <li> This perfume is not bad but I am inclined to agree with one of the reviewers who thought this smelled like lemon pledge. It&#x27;s certainly not sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I was looking for sandalwood smell, but i did not found it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, but not sandalwood. They have made me fool in the name of sandalwood&lt;br /&gt;Mysore sandalwood oil is much and far better that this product.</li>
            <li> Smells nothing like real sandalwood cologne should.&lt;br /&gt;Overly sweet &amp; floral and at least to me, nauseating smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Sandalwood spray for years. It has a subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  I hope Caswell-Massey makes this for years.</li>
            <li> It smells like freedom, masculinity, and pragmatism. MERICA!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled fragrances with a sandalwood base and loved them.  This one is not quite what I expected  from the reviews I read that raved about it.  It had a very old-fashioned smell to me.</li>
            <li> I believe it depends on a persons body chemistry how it&#x27;s going to smell after it settles. At first I thought it stunk. But after it settled it was a totally different aroma.  Either you love or hate it. I have never had a cologne that I like as much as this one.  I have to have a new bottle every Christmas, Mothers Day, my birthday, and sometimes in between. I love to smell this cologne. I spray my bed pillows with it, use a little as air freshener sometimes.  Someone passed by me once and said they just wanted to stand there and stiff because they loved it.  I&#x27;m addicted.  Hubby loves it too.</li>
