            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>the color amazing</li>
            <li>It will probably look nice in the summer when I get darker.</li>
            <li>It came really nicely packaged, so thumbs up to the retailer for that.</li>
            <li>i can honestly say that this lipcolor does not budge.</li>
            <li>It arrived before it was supposed to arrive which was perfect because she wanted to wear it for a New Year party.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, vibrant makeup and the velvetines are absolutely superb and by far by favorite products in the line.</li>
            <li>I love this matte lip stain, and the color is outstanding either as a full on bright layer or distributed very lightly as a coral lip blush.</li>
            <li>Perfect enough to wear to my wedding.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this MATTE lipgloss.</li>
            <li>is more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; but lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more colors from Lime Crime.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this Suedeberry Gloss.  </li>
            <li>I do love it</li>
            <li>I love the color but not a fan of the consistency.</li>
            <li>ive always wanted a velvetine and after trying this on i fell in love.</li>
            <li>n doesn&#x27;t stay on all day-- love</li>
            <li>i really love it</li>
            <li>Not what I wanted but with a top coat stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I bought this product as a Christmas gift for my sister, and she fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>suedeberry is much more orange-y than it looks.&lt;br /&gt;yes</li>
            <li>I bought this item because a famous dresser in Taiwan recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would love to go to a party with this.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick soo</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>because it is the best I have had in a long long time I will recommend this product to my family and friends it is awesome</li>
            <li>Still, I love Lime Crime and the staying power is fantastic, so I will be keeping it.</li>
            <li>Was excited to purchase this since it was a Make-up Artist top pick.</li>
            <li>Quick drying and ultra matte finish just the way I like!</li>
            <li>The color is a gorgeous vivid coral shade.</li>
            <li>This lip gloss flaked off, wasn&#x27;t smooth, and didn&#x27;t look velvety,</li>
            <li>So I put a gloss over it, which also helps to smooth any lip lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li>THAT is a fantastic lipstick.</li>
            <li>The color is nice in the bottle, but on my lips it dries to a kind of neon-peach color, which is only flattering in some types of light.</li>
            <li>also, and this is important</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to try this...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would note that you should apply this with a lip brush for precision, the applicator doesn&#x27;t go on very crisp.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try one, needed a nice festive red for the holidays</li>
            <li>I barely had to add more to my lips after eating/ drinking...</li>
            <li>This photographs VERY well!</li>
            <li>I am glad I finally bit the bullet and bought a tube.  </li>
            <li>im totally buying more shades.</li>
            <li>It is just like what he said - pretty color and not too shiny.</li>
            <li>much!..</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in different colors.</li>
            <li>What a waste of good money.</li>
            <li>, it is unwearable on me, I really wanted to like it as I love the red velvet</li>
            <li>Also, it is nowhere near as drying as Red Velvet, which is nice for summer.</li>
            <li>The quality is far superior to other products you might buy.</li>
            <li>took it to a water park and really didn&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>
            <li>I really like that I can put it on in the morning, and it doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my coffee cup.</li>
            <li>the color though--- too much</li>
            <li>very dissapointed with it.</li>
            <li>Really expected a lipgloss instead it&#x27;s more of a matte paint textured lipstick.</li>
            <li>it applies like a gloss and dries very matte...</li>
            <li>so giving them some love with a sheer lip balm or butter will take care of that problem (i use maybeline baby soft lips clinical).</li>
            <li>I really wish there was a shade inbetween Suedeberry and the Red Velvet.  </li>
            <li>the formula is soft, and even though it&#x27;s matte</li>
            <li>It takes 3 coats to get it near opaque and even then you can still see through.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of thinking, because this product was so expensive, it might actually be good quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard major hype about Lime Crime</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I like to draw my lipline outside my natural lips,</li>
            <li>so matte that it was actually flaking off my lips, but it wouldn&#x27;t stay anywhere near the middle/inner parts of my lips.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Imagine that, 13 year old girl turning down lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not completely drying on the lips.</li>
            <li> this is a matte, it will stay put but dry the hell out of your lips.</li>
            <li> was very dry looking.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even look like the same color once it dried.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> You only need a very little bit, and it does almost act like a stain although very thin it moves around quickly and then after a few minutes will dry to a matte.</li>
            <li> i mean you&#x27;d really have to try hard to smudge it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> As if i would give a Limecrime product anything less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> the color is vibrant even with a thin coat!</li>
            <li> this was not exactly easy either.</li>
            <li> Also from trial and error I would recommend wearing it as is and do not top with a gloss if you want to extend the wear of the application.  </li>
            <li> She noticed the bad smell and taste, too, and actually told me she didn&#x27;t want it.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the color was atrocious, but even worse, when I put the gloss on my lips, I was struck by its unpleasant smell and taste.  </li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong when you buy Lime Crime.</li>
            <li> buy lipstick this expensive for myself, but it was a must have for her as she&#x27;s a makeup artist.  </li>
            <li> It was opaque and pastel-looking and just overall disgusting.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Too bad they dont have it anymore.</li>
            <li> If you are a limecrime newbee you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now I just feel stupid.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Goes on nice and vibrant. I apply it in the mornings and eat, drink, whatever, and don&#x27;t have to reapply! Only warning, it WILL stain your clothes if you drop it while applying.</li>
            <li> This was so perfect. Perfect enough to wear to my wedding. Love this color. A little pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> acts as a lip stain, it last all day. took it to a water park and really didn&#x27;t have to reapply.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this MATTE lipgloss. The color is a gorgeous vivid coral shade. It lasts all day, not drying on the lips at all. I barely had to add more to my lips after eating/ drinking...that&#x27;s how good the staying power is. Doesn&#x27;t stain the lips once you take it off. I have NYX matte lip glosses and the consistency of this product is more &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; but lasts longer. Will be purchasing more colors from Lime Crime.</li>
            <li> The velvetines collection is amazing in color and lasts hours! I get tons of compliments every time I use it!</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong when you buy Lime Crime. The quality is far superior to other products you might buy. If you are looking for something that makes a statement, look no further. This photographs VERY well! You WILL receive compliments!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of thinking, because this product was so expensive, it might actually be good quality.  Now I just feel stupid.  First of all, the color was atrocious, but even worse, when I put the gloss on my lips, I was struck by its unpleasant smell and taste.  I thought it might just be me, so I gave it to my daughter. She noticed the bad smell and taste, too, and actually told me she didn&#x27;t want it.  Imagine that, 13 year old girl turning down lip gloss.  Anyway, I can&#x27;t use it, I can&#x27;t give it away, I might as well just toss it in the trash. What a waste of good money.</li>
            <li> Was excited to purchase this since it was a Make-up Artist top pick. This lip gloss flaked off, wasn&#x27;t smooth, and didn&#x27;t look velvety, was very dry looking. Would not recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this Suedeberry Gloss.  The color lasts for hours.  I had seen this item on Pinterest months ago, a kept talking myself out of buying it.  I am glad I finally bit the bullet and bought a tube.  I really wish there was a shade inbetween Suedeberry and the Red Velvet.  I really like that I can put it on in the morning, and it doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my coffee cup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard major hype about Lime Crime so I wanted to try one, needed a nice festive red for the holidays so I ordered the Suedeberry. I do love it but it takes some working with. It&#x27;s super pigmented!!! You only need a very little bit, and it does almost act like a stain although very thin it moves around quickly and then after a few minutes will dry to a matte. I love the color but not a fan of the consistency. So I put a gloss over it, which also helps to smooth any lip lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li> ive always wanted a velvetine and after trying this on i fell in love. the formula is soft, and even though it&#x27;s matte it&#x27;s not completely drying on the lips. the color is vibrant even with a thin coat! im totally buying more shades.</li>
            <li> Dries ur lips n doesn&#x27;t stay on all day-- love the color though--- too much $ n it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for our daughter for Christmas.  I would NEVER in a million years buy lipstick this expensive for myself, but it was a must have for her as she&#x27;s a makeup artist.  At any rate, the package wasn&#x27;t supposed to be in until after Christmas, but we got in two days without paying for expedited shipping. LOVE YOU Lime Crime!</li>
            <li> I bought this because youtube beauty gurus were raving about how it basically lasts all day with one application, I have found this to not be the case.  Also from trial and error I would recommend wearing it as is and do not top with a gloss if you want to extend the wear of the application.  Also  the product itself was smaller than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its just the one I got but mine was fluorescent orange, not a retro red at all, it is unwearable on me, I really wanted to like it as I love the red velvet one but this color was not flattering on me at all, it doesn&#x27;t have any red in it just bright,bright orange reminds me of the &#x27;80&#x27;s. very dissapointed with it.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to show up like a lip stain (think natural-looking, somewhat sheer), but it looked like I put paint, like you would use on a wall, on my lips. It was opaque and pastel-looking and just overall disgusting. It didn&#x27;t even look like the same color once it dried. I could use this for face paint. Needless to say, I threw it away. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I purchased the Lime Crime Velveteen in Red Velvet. THAT is a fantastic lipstick. However, this one is not as emolient or opaque. It takes 3 coats to get it near opaque and even then you can still see through. I like to draw my lipline outside my natural lips, so lipsticks that aren&#x27;t 100% opaque often give that away. The color is nice in the bottle, but on my lips it dries to a kind of neon-peach color, which is only flattering in some types of light. I am an NC30 and would not recommend this color to medium skinned women. Still, I love Lime Crime and the staying power is fantastic, so I will be keeping it. It will probably look nice in the summer when I get darker. Also, it is nowhere near as drying as Red Velvet, which is nice for summer. It came really nicely packaged, so thumbs up to the retailer for that.</li>
            <li> Best lipstick ever!! Bright luscious color, tons of compliments and stays on until you take it off or someone kisses it off :o)</li>
            <li> the color amazing i really love it i only have to apply a lip gloss or lip palm to avoid lips dryness</li>
            <li> because it is the best I have had in a long long time I will recommend this product to my family and friends it is awesome</li>
            <li> Really expected a lipgloss instead it&#x27;s more of a matte paint textured lipstick. Not what I wanted but with a top coat stays on all day.</li>
            <li> As if i would give a Limecrime product anything less than 5 stars. HA! If you are a limecrime newbee you will not be disappointed. Beautiful, vibrant makeup and the velvetines are absolutely superb and by far by favorite products in the line. Great by themselves or paired with a creamy lipstick for a nice ombre lip. Quick drying and ultra matte finish just the way I like!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a Christmas gift for my sister, and she fell in love with it. She couldnt stop thanking me for it. It arrived before it was supposed to arrive which was perfect because she wanted to wear it for a New Year party. I would like to purchase this again but this time for myself now. Too bad they dont have it anymore.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to try this...it ended up to be a let down.&lt;br /&gt;the suedeberry is much more orange-y than it looks.&lt;br /&gt;yes it applies like a gloss and dries very matte... so matte that it was actually flaking off my lips, but it wouldn&#x27;t stay anywhere near the middle/inner parts of my lips.&lt;br /&gt;removing this was not exactly easy either.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because a famous dresser in Taiwan recommend it. It is just like what he said - pretty color and not too shiny. I would love to go to a party with this.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!!..I love this lipstick soo much!..I hope they make and sell more soon! I love the quality and color!..:D I always get compliments in it!..:D</li>
            <li> i can honestly say that this lipcolor does not budge. i mean you&#x27;d really have to try hard to smudge it. i&#x27;ve worn it to a gallery opening that i was in and i drank and ate for 5 hours and it didn&#x27;t fade at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would note that you should apply this with a lip brush for precision, the applicator doesn&#x27;t go on very crisp. also, and this is important: EXFOLIATE YOUR LIPS AND APPLY SOME MOISTURE BEFORE USING. this is a matte, it will stay put but dry the hell out of your lips. so giving them some love with a sheer lip balm or butter will take care of that problem (i use maybeline baby soft lips clinical).</li>
            <li> This is a re-order for me. I love this matte lip stain, and the color is outstanding either as a full on bright layer or distributed very lightly as a coral lip blush. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I will be buying more in different colors.</li>
