            <li>Great product,</li>
            <li>But it is a great Solution for once in a while, when You are in a hurry...</li>
            <li>Klorane does a great job; it is pricier, but in this category of product</li>
            <li>Nice neutral smell, cleanses well, and provides awesome body &amp; volume.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I heard great things about it.</li>
            <li>This is great to use for the days that you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair and it does hide the oil so that your hair looks good.</li>
            <li>used this product sparingly both times...found that it worked great as an in-between refresher and was good with volume and smelled nice.</li>
            <li>True, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product many times and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>One of the best (if not the best) dry shampoos around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this but find the non-aeorsol version is more effective.</li>
            <li>Give us more bang for our buck Klorane!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The smell could be worked out to be more pleasant.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It is so amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for years, It is the best one on the market and really works.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Still sprays on powdery, but blends in nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of tricks</li>
            <li>The Klorane scent is very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I love love this product!</li>
            <li>This is by the far the very best.</li>
            <li>My hair was very full and my scalp felt clean and smelled great too.</li>
            <li>On a positive note the fragrance of the product is very pleasant, though a bit strong.</li>
            <li>It smells good and fresh!  </li>
            <li>Goes on clean and has a good texture, not sticky like so many others.</li>
            <li>maybe more so when it&#x27;s not used for a week or so.  </li>
            <li>its like magic.</li>
            <li>I love all Klorane products.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product in my Birchbox one month and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Spray on before bed and let it do its magic overnight.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>Much better than kerastaze.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I found in the stores.</li>
            <li>It appears the top blew off and dispensed all of the product into the cap.</li>
            <li>I think that has more to do with how Im probably applying it, rather than the product.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I know I love to gaze into the mirror at my hair</li>
            <li>but I guess if I washed my hair more, that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li>Batiste is okay</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Smelled good and worked great, but I only used it 3-4 times before it was gone!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried suave (eh, ok), tressame, not your mothers, and a few more and honestly, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a dry shampoo, this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>THE best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Hair looks very natural after use, very easy to apply and it&#x27;s smells really good.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried-excellent for my fine hair-adds volume besides cleaning my hair</li>
            <li>It is easy to wash out as well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased one about 3 months ago and liked it so much that I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>Lets face it, we have so many chores to do on our face, body, hair nails, toes, cook, clean, kids, rotten husbands,</li>
            <li>Has a baby powder smell that&#x27;s not too strong and does the job well.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample size and have not been able to find full size anywhere.</li>
            <li>item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and \\&quot;bed-head\\</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and actually makes my hair look fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>after 4-5 light uses, I wrote it off as probably a defective spray mechanism.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go even one day without washing my hair, so this is great on the mornings when I simply can&#x27;t get up on time.</li>
            <li>This has made my blowouts easily last 4 days and look great.  </li>
            <li>What I find strange, is sometimes it works beautifully, and sometimes, it just doesnt seem to take..</li>
            <li>Light, clean feeling without build up.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, keeps my hair fresh, and full of body.</li>
            <li>Ive tried MANY dry shampoos, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>the reason i&#x27;m giving it 3 stars- is simply for its amazing smell!</li>
            <li>(*This review is for the product, not the seller-seller was most helpful and did return the first item for replacement.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beauty is playing, but I&#x27;m pretty sure someone used this product before it was mailed to me.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is great.  </li>
            <li>It does clean your hair well and no oil appeared all day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling all that clean.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy this product again, it&#x27;s some of the best dry shampoo on the market and worth the price (over some US drug-store brands).</li>
            <li>Works great on dark or light hair if used correctly.</li>
            <li>it really is &#x27;just an okay&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now been 36 hrs since I washed my hair, and it&#x27;s so full of volume</li>
            <li>This is by far the best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all, and this is the best dry shampoo I have used thus far.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best scented dry shampoo I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>The best dry shampoo I have used so far is kms hairplay.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time ordering and it works just as good as the first, and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I like this in a pinch - i.e., provides a quick freshen-up.  </li>
            <li>Pro-tip: use overnight for super volume in the morning.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m out the door quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the smell &amp; highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Just use a powder, which is more effective and less disruptive to the environment and your lungs.</li>
            <li>find another dry shampoo - there are tons out there that I am sure have a better container.  </li>
            <li>Its a full time job just to stay young and fit and non fat with perfect thick hair and for what?</li>
            <li>The smell was fine, but overall, I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>Nice that this stuff just proceeded to turn my hair GREY and didn&#x27;t clean it at all.  </li>
            <li>This product is a must have for intensely busy women who still want their hair to look great but don&#x27;t have the time for daily styling sessions.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a nice alternative to a shower when you are low on time.  </li>
            <li>i first used this product when it was a sample in my BirchBox, but I bought the full size product here on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Was it worth waiting for it to ship, while I could have just gone to the beauty supply store?..</li>
            <li>Was it worth the money?..</li>
            <li>and it looks fresh</li>
            <li>and you think your hair may not smell so fresh?  </li>
            <li>The product overall is nice.</li>
            <li>I do not think this product is really worth an additional $15</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>This version is to be used on freshly washed hair (for some texture).</li>
            <li>My very fine hair seems to look better when I shampoo it less often.</li>
            <li>My hair felt fresh and clean, and it lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and it works, other than the color difference.  </li>
            <li>yeah right.</li>
            <li>On days when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair, this product really helps clean my hair and it saves time.</li>
            <li>You can get the same results by using a cheap dry shampoo but this one was still very nice</li>
            <li>A few quick sprays, a couple of minutes to let it do its thing, then brush it out and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>Great product--feels, smells, works and applies much better than other dry shampoos (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot--e.g.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of dry shampoos and this one absorbs so quickly and easily, and has the nicest, clean and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>The concept of dry shampoo is amazing-</li>
            <li>I really cannot say enough amazing things about this product.  </li>
            <li>not sure why this one doesnt have more reviews ?!?!</li>
            <li>Klorane is just what it says it is - gentle - and is effective at giving my hair a quick clean and a little lift.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best dry shampoo for oily hair.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best dry shampoo you can buy on the market.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t have to use very much</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be looking elsewhere for a better product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is extremely healthy, and at the same time, it can appear oily (even just hours after I wash it).</li>
            <li>Works great just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Or do we look pretty for ourselves?</li>
            <li>I have to use more of the aerosol for the same effect.</li>
            <li>It seems as though the product evaporated because I did not use it all in my first use.</li>
            <li>I have been a big loyal fan of kerastaze for years, but their dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t even get close as good as this.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I had been in the market for a great dry shampoo and after reading several reviews I decided to purchase the Klorane Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>&quot; in the morning is pretty much my norm</li>
            <li>Also the white film isn&#x27;t cakey and easily rubbed off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most brands, and while they all have their perks, Klorane is the only product that makes my hair actually feel clean.</li>
            <li>This product is way way better than the powder type dry shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Some dry shampoos leave your hair feeling more greasy or you have to use a ton of it to take the grease out but not the case with Klorane.</li>
            <li>However, after I spray the contents in my hair unlike most of the reviews I read --- After letting the product dry on my hair, I tilt my head/hair towards the floor and use my blow dryer for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used lots).</li>
            <li>I love this dry spray shampoo.  </li>
            <li>And they are coming out in common stores like walmart and target, for awhile there salons and beauty supply stores had the best dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and like to take a periodic break from the daily washing and blow-dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine, oily hair that needs to be washed daily.</li>
            <li>My hair is looking better than ever since I started using Klorane Dry Shampoo!</li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and you can&#x27;t barely tell your didn&#x27;t actually wash your hair, even if it was really oily before.</li>
            <li>Really does make day old hair look fresh.  </li>
            <li>But it does have to sit for 5 minutes and you do have to brush it through very well</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find it with free shipping, or at a close retailer, but no such luck yet.</li>
            <li>Smells like baby powder, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have color on my hair so don&#x27;t really like the idea of shampooing every day....</li>
            <li>WOW !!!</li>
            <li>But it leaves you hair incredibly soft and your fingers will glide right through.</li>
            <li>I tried this product (like many other customers) because it was recommend by &#x27;allure.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Most of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried have an overpowering and per-fumy scent that I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs oil better than the clear dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is light, doesn&#x27;t have the typically cloying or chemical smells of most dry shampoos, and gives my relatively limp hair some nice volume.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Now I can come home, blow dry the roots, spray some dry shampoo on and - voila! - good as new.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that I have to wash everyday or its greasy.</li>
            <li>This is your new &amp;#34;Best Friend&amp;#34; in a can!</li>
            <li>I have become a huge fan of dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>When this particular shampoo was recommended by Allure as well as FabFitFun.com</li>
            <li>Once I was finished spraying it on, the powder didn&#x27;t come out at all, and I looked twenty years older.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the company has not fixed the problem, as top reviews seem to be from years ago.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>There is only one more thing I can say about Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo with Oat Milk, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>but I find that Klorane works way better and takes little effort.</li>
            <li>little more money than I wanted to spend but</li>
            <li>Afterwards I brush and my hair is clean, soft, shiny, and still the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a gentle fragrance which is not harsh or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is essential to keeping my hair looking fresh while traveling</li>
            <li>I just spray it in, wait two minutes, brush it out, and style normally.</li>
            <li>The smell of this one (in comparison to the green top version) is heavenly.</li>
            <li>it immediately gets rid of the oily sheen, though if you have fine hair you probably still need to shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li>When my hair is on the greasy side and somewhat clumping, I spray the heck out of it with Klorane Dry Shampoo, and I can definitely go one more day without shampooing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look as good as a real shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t look like the greasy mess I would have had to subject my friends and co-workers to without it.  </li>
            <li>The seller replaced that one with a new one which I was again only able to use once, and then found that it was completely empty.</li>
            <li>With my oily hair, I have washed my hair daily for my whole life, much to the consternation of my hairdressers.</li>
            <li>highly recommend if you are sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li>This gentle dry shampoo seems to be exactly what my hair needs.</li>
            <li>So, I was really excited that I finally found a dry shampoo that really worked.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this bottle was the last time.</li>
            <li>Klorane has come up with a dry shampoo that is as close as you can get to fresh hair without water.</li>
            <li>I honestly was not very impressed...</li>
            <li>I have to use it very sparingly so that I&#x27;m able to brush out the white, but there&#x27;s still a slight color difference (only I would notice it).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 2 weeks old.  </li>
            <li>This product really soaks up the extra oil in my scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bringing it back to college with me in a few days, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be useful when I inevitably decide to skip my morning shower to catch some extra sleep.</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I just ran out.</li>
            <li>I have ridiculously oily hair if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday, and this actually makes my hair appear clean and free of oil, and freshly washed.  </li>
            <li>The smell is clean, no chemicals or heavy perfume.   </li>
            <li>My wife had previously used this product and liked it so much we ordered it again, but this time it was a failure.</li>
            <li>This does not leave a white residue, has no strong odor, and easily brushes through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have to give this only one star because, despite being a fairly large bottle, I only got 3, maybe 3.5 uses out of it</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and it&#x27;s really time consuming to keep up with-</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li>Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo works wonders.</li>
            <li>have now received 2 shipments of the \\&quot;Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo with Oat Milk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to wash it too much, this dry shampoo makes life easier.  </li>
            <li>I only got three uses out of the large size can before it went flat</li>
            <li>I had never used dry shampoo in the past and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>It goes super fast - there are hardly any uses - which makes it extra pricey.</li>
            <li>I usually spray this in my hair at night and wake up with clean looking hair.</li>
            <li>This little product will keep hair looking fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>used to wash it everyday, but my hair became very frizzy !!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on the positive reviews from other online purchasers.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft (not crunchy), and the initially white color fades after a brush through.</li>
            <li>In the morning the white layer was completely gone.</li>
            <li>The first time I suddenly had an empty can</li>
            <li>now i wash less, and with the natural oils, my hair hs never looked to so healthy and less hair loss when i wash my hair !!  </li>
            <li>I probably could have gone a whole other day without washing too.</li>
            <li>Now they are coming out will all kinds of new dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>The first one I received worked only once, and then the can was empty due to a faulty aerosol system causing the product to leak completely out of the sides.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>So I spray this on my hair and it makes it full of volume, thick, non greasy which is a crime against humanity,</li>
            <li>I want to lay around in an old nightgown on the sofa, watch movies eat ice cream and pizza and not wash my hair and blow dry it, protein it, protect it, iron it blah blah.</li>
            <li>I am constantly on the move and don&#x27;t have time every day to blow out my long, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I usually wash my hair everyday, but was able to skip a day or two between washings with this product.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is how quickly I go through a bottle…</li>
            <li>But maybe thats because I sprayed a little too much than I was suppose to.</li>
            <li>With this dry shampoo, I am able to wash my hair every other day and not feel self-conscious in the least.</li>

            <li> Klorane does a great job; it is pricier, but in this category of product</li>
            <li> Nice neutral smell, cleanses well, and provides awesome body &amp; volume.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I heard great things about it.</li>
            <li> This is great to use for the days that you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair and it does hide the oil so that your hair looks good.</li>
            <li> used this product sparingly both times...found that it worked great as an in-between refresher and was good with volume and smelled nice.</li>
            <li> True, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> One of the best (if not the best) dry shampoos around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this but find the non-aeorsol version is more effective.</li>
            <li> Give us more bang for our buck Klorane!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> The smell could be worked out to be more pleasant.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It is so amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years, It is the best one on the market and really works.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Still sprays on powdery, but blends in nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of tricks</li>
            <li> The Klorane scent is very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I love love this product!</li>
            <li> This is by the far the very best.</li>
            <li> My hair was very full and my scalp felt clean and smelled great too.</li>
            <li> On a positive note the fragrance of the product is very pleasant, though a bit strong.</li>
            <li> It smells good and fresh!  </li>
            <li> Goes on clean and has a good texture, not sticky like so many others.</li>
            <li> maybe more so when it&#x27;s not used for a week or so.  </li>
            <li> its like magic.</li>
            <li> I love all Klorane products.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Nice light scent.  </li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in my Birchbox one month and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> Spray on before bed and let it do its magic overnight.  </li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> Much better than kerastaze.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I found in the stores.</li>
            <li> It appears the top blew off and dispensed all of the product into the cap.</li>
            <li> I think that has more to do with how Im probably applying it, rather than the product.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I know I love to gaze into the mirror at my hair</li>
            <li> but I guess if I washed my hair more, that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> Batiste is okay</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Smelled good and worked great, but I only used it 3-4 times before it was gone!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried suave (eh, ok), tressame, not your mothers, and a few more and honestly, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a dry shampoo, this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> THE best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Hair looks very natural after use, very easy to apply and it&#x27;s smells really good.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried-excellent for my fine hair-adds volume besides cleaning my hair</li>
            <li> It is easy to wash out as well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased one about 3 months ago and liked it so much that I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> Lets face it, we have so many chores to do on our face, body, hair nails, toes, cook, clean, kids, rotten husbands,</li>
            <li> Has a baby powder smell that&#x27;s not too strong and does the job well.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample size and have not been able to find full size anywhere.</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and \\&quot;bed-head\\</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and actually makes my hair look fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> after 4-5 light uses, I wrote it off as probably a defective spray mechanism.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go even one day without washing my hair, so this is great on the mornings when I simply can&#x27;t get up on time.</li>
            <li> This has made my blowouts easily last 4 days and look great.  </li>
            <li> What I find strange, is sometimes it works beautifully, and sometimes, it just doesnt seem to take..</li>
            <li> Light, clean feeling without build up.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely, keeps my hair fresh, and full of body.</li>
            <li> Ive tried MANY dry shampoos, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> the reason i&#x27;m giving it 3 stars- is simply for its amazing smell!</li>
            <li> (*This review is for the product, not the seller-seller was most helpful and did return the first item for replacement.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beauty is playing, but I&#x27;m pretty sure someone used this product before it was mailed to me.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is great.  </li>
            <li> It does clean your hair well and no oil appeared all day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling all that clean.</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy this product again, it&#x27;s some of the best dry shampoo on the market and worth the price (over some US drug-store brands).</li>
            <li> Works great on dark or light hair if used correctly.</li>
            <li> it really is &#x27;just an okay&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been 36 hrs since I washed my hair, and it&#x27;s so full of volume</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, and this is the best dry shampoo I have used thus far.  </li>
            <li> It is by far the best scented dry shampoo I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo I have used so far is kms hairplay.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time ordering and it works just as good as the first, and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I like this in a pinch - i.e., provides a quick freshen-up.  </li>
            <li> Pro-tip: use overnight for super volume in the morning.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m out the door quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell &amp; highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Just use a powder, which is more effective and less disruptive to the environment and your lungs.</li>
            <li> find another dry shampoo - there are tons out there that I am sure have a better container.  </li>
            <li> Its a full time job just to stay young and fit and non fat with perfect thick hair and for what?</li>
            <li> The smell was fine, but overall, I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> Nice that this stuff just proceeded to turn my hair GREY and didn&#x27;t clean it at all.  </li>
            <li> This product is a must have for intensely busy women who still want their hair to look great but don&#x27;t have the time for daily styling sessions.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a nice alternative to a shower when you are low on time.  </li>
            <li> i first used this product when it was a sample in my BirchBox, but I bought the full size product here on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Was it worth waiting for it to ship, while I could have just gone to the beauty supply store?..</li>
            <li> Was it worth the money?..</li>
            <li> and it looks fresh</li>
            <li> and you think your hair may not smell so fresh?  </li>
            <li> The product overall is nice.</li>
            <li> I do not think this product is really worth an additional $15</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> This version is to be used on freshly washed hair (for some texture).</li>
            <li> My very fine hair seems to look better when I shampoo it less often.</li>
            <li> My hair felt fresh and clean, and it lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and it works, other than the color difference.  </li>
            <li> yeah right.</li>
            <li> On days when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair, this product really helps clean my hair and it saves time.</li>
            <li> You can get the same results by using a cheap dry shampoo but this one was still very nice</li>
            <li> A few quick sprays, a couple of minutes to let it do its thing, then brush it out and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> Great product--feels, smells, works and applies much better than other dry shampoos (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot--e.g.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of dry shampoos and this one absorbs so quickly and easily, and has the nicest, clean and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> The concept of dry shampoo is amazing-</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough amazing things about this product.  </li>
            <li> not sure why this one doesnt have more reviews ?!?!</li>
            <li> Klorane is just what it says it is - gentle - and is effective at giving my hair a quick clean and a little lift.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best dry shampoo for oily hair.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best dry shampoo you can buy on the market.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t have to use very much</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be looking elsewhere for a better product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely healthy, and at the same time, it can appear oily (even just hours after I wash it).</li>
            <li> Works great just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Or do we look pretty for ourselves?</li>
            <li> I have to use more of the aerosol for the same effect.</li>
            <li> It seems as though the product evaporated because I did not use it all in my first use.</li>
            <li> I have been a big loyal fan of kerastaze for years, but their dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t even get close as good as this.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I had been in the market for a great dry shampoo and after reading several reviews I decided to purchase the Klorane Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> &quot; in the morning is pretty much my norm</li>
            <li> Also the white film isn&#x27;t cakey and easily rubbed off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most brands, and while they all have their perks, Klorane is the only product that makes my hair actually feel clean.</li>
            <li> This product is way way better than the powder type dry shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Some dry shampoos leave your hair feeling more greasy or you have to use a ton of it to take the grease out but not the case with Klorane.</li>
            <li> However, after I spray the contents in my hair unlike most of the reviews I read --- After letting the product dry on my hair, I tilt my head/hair towards the floor and use my blow dryer for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used lots).</li>
            <li> I love this dry spray shampoo.  </li>
            <li> And they are coming out in common stores like walmart and target, for awhile there salons and beauty supply stores had the best dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and like to take a periodic break from the daily washing and blow-dry.</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair that needs to be washed daily.</li>
            <li> My hair is looking better than ever since I started using Klorane Dry Shampoo!</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and you can&#x27;t barely tell your didn&#x27;t actually wash your hair, even if it was really oily before.</li>
            <li> Really does make day old hair look fresh.  </li>
            <li> But it does have to sit for 5 minutes and you do have to brush it through very well</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could find it with free shipping, or at a close retailer, but no such luck yet.</li>
            <li> Smells like baby powder, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have color on my hair so don&#x27;t really like the idea of shampooing every day....</li>
            <li> WOW !!!</li>
            <li> But it leaves you hair incredibly soft and your fingers will glide right through.</li>
            <li> I tried this product (like many other customers) because it was recommend by &#x27;allure.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Most of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried have an overpowering and per-fumy scent that I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs oil better than the clear dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is light, doesn&#x27;t have the typically cloying or chemical smells of most dry shampoos, and gives my relatively limp hair some nice volume.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Now I can come home, blow dry the roots, spray some dry shampoo on and - voila! - good as new.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that I have to wash everyday or its greasy.</li>
            <li> This is your new &amp;#34;Best Friend&amp;#34; in a can!</li>
            <li> I have become a huge fan of dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> When this particular shampoo was recommended by Allure as well as FabFitFun.com</li>
            <li> Once I was finished spraying it on, the powder didn&#x27;t come out at all, and I looked twenty years older.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the company has not fixed the problem, as top reviews seem to be from years ago.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> There is only one more thing I can say about Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo with Oat Milk, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> but I find that Klorane works way better and takes little effort.</li>
            <li> little more money than I wanted to spend but</li>
            <li> Afterwards I brush and my hair is clean, soft, shiny, and still the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a gentle fragrance which is not harsh or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This is essential to keeping my hair looking fresh while traveling</li>
            <li> I just spray it in, wait two minutes, brush it out, and style normally.</li>
            <li> The smell of this one (in comparison to the green top version) is heavenly.</li>
            <li> it immediately gets rid of the oily sheen, though if you have fine hair you probably still need to shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> When my hair is on the greasy side and somewhat clumping, I spray the heck out of it with Klorane Dry Shampoo, and I can definitely go one more day without shampooing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look as good as a real shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t look like the greasy mess I would have had to subject my friends and co-workers to without it.  </li>
            <li> The seller replaced that one with a new one which I was again only able to use once, and then found that it was completely empty.</li>
            <li> With my oily hair, I have washed my hair daily for my whole life, much to the consternation of my hairdressers.</li>
            <li> highly recommend if you are sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li> This gentle dry shampoo seems to be exactly what my hair needs.</li>
            <li> So, I was really excited that I finally found a dry shampoo that really worked.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this bottle was the last time.</li>
            <li> Klorane has come up with a dry shampoo that is as close as you can get to fresh hair without water.</li>
            <li> I honestly was not very impressed...</li>
            <li> I have to use it very sparingly so that I&#x27;m able to brush out the white, but there&#x27;s still a slight color difference (only I would notice it).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 2 weeks old.  </li>
            <li> This product really soaks up the extra oil in my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bringing it back to college with me in a few days, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be useful when I inevitably decide to skip my morning shower to catch some extra sleep.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I just ran out.</li>
            <li> I have ridiculously oily hair if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday, and this actually makes my hair appear clean and free of oil, and freshly washed.  </li>
            <li> The smell is clean, no chemicals or heavy perfume.   </li>
            <li> My wife had previously used this product and liked it so much we ordered it again, but this time it was a failure.</li>
            <li> This does not leave a white residue, has no strong odor, and easily brushes through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to give this only one star because, despite being a fairly large bottle, I only got 3, maybe 3.5 uses out of it</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and it&#x27;s really time consuming to keep up with-</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li> Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo works wonders.</li>
            <li> have now received 2 shipments of the \\&quot;Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo with Oat Milk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wash it too much, this dry shampoo makes life easier.  </li>
            <li> I only got three uses out of the large size can before it went flat</li>
            <li> I had never used dry shampoo in the past and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> It goes super fast - there are hardly any uses - which makes it extra pricey.</li>
            <li> I usually spray this in my hair at night and wake up with clean looking hair.</li>
            <li> This little product will keep hair looking fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> used to wash it everyday, but my hair became very frizzy !!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the positive reviews from other online purchasers.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft (not crunchy), and the initially white color fades after a brush through.</li>
            <li> In the morning the white layer was completely gone.</li>
            <li> The first time I suddenly had an empty can</li>
            <li> now i wash less, and with the natural oils, my hair hs never looked to so healthy and less hair loss when i wash my hair !!  </li>
            <li> I probably could have gone a whole other day without washing too.</li>
            <li> Now they are coming out will all kinds of new dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> The first one I received worked only once, and then the can was empty due to a faulty aerosol system causing the product to leak completely out of the sides.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> So I spray this on my hair and it makes it full of volume, thick, non greasy which is a crime against humanity,</li>
            <li> I want to lay around in an old nightgown on the sofa, watch movies eat ice cream and pizza and not wash my hair and blow dry it, protein it, protect it, iron it blah blah.</li>
            <li> I am constantly on the move and don&#x27;t have time every day to blow out my long, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair everyday, but was able to skip a day or two between washings with this product.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how quickly I go through a bottle…</li>
            <li> But maybe thats because I sprayed a little too much than I was suppose to.</li>
            <li> With this dry shampoo, I am able to wash my hair every other day and not feel self-conscious in the least.</li>
            <li> It did indeed make my hair look clean, but the smell is quite unappealing.  </li>
            <li> Because there is only enough dry shampoo for one application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY, expensive, name brand, dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos and none of them compare to Klorane.</li>
            <li> Tried other dry shampoos that are clear and it doesn&#x27;t absorb oil well, it&#x27;s as if spraying regular hairspray.  </li>
            <li> No flaking and long lasting.</li>
            <li> but the can didn&#x27;t last took long.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo I have ever used that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY dry shampoo that has ever worked on my hair.</li>
            <li> A solid choice for dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It makes my blow dry last longer.</li>
            <li> The only dry shampoo I&#x27;ll use</li>
            <li> I have tried various other products but keep coming back to this brand.  </li>
            <li> But I am just 1 opinion out of many and I am just an angry tiny little woman who needs to rule the world</li>
            <li> Definitely gives dirty or clean hair volume!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful to not buy the aerosol version as the propellant doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> She used the product once and the next day the can was empty.</li>
            <li> Used twice in a 10 day period, the 3rd time, it was empty, with no compression at all.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li> in the long run time is money so it was worh it</li>
            <li> my long hair.</li>
            <li> Either way, two times is more than a coincidence and it&#x27;s too expensive to be losing half the contents each time.</li>
            <li> However, the bottle does not last long (~2-3 weeks tops, with every other day use), making the price of one unit unjustified.</li>
            <li> A couple days later I went to use the product again and was baffled to find that it was EMPTY!</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried every dry shampoo under the sun, this one reigns supreme.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the dry shampoo performs on those days when I can&#x27;t wash my hair</li>
            <li> this dry shampoo saves me from having to wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li> i have used LOTS of dry shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Try a non-aresol dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have had platinum blond hair for over 2 years, and I&#x27;ve had to use every dry shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> It is my go to dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works well</li>
            <li> so I have ordered and will try another dry shampoo to compare.</li>
            <li> This is my Holy Grail dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> used.i have thin blonde hair that gets greay fast.</li>
            <li> I adore this dry shampoo and have tried several other cheaper options…which can&#x27;t even come close!  </li>
            <li> Most of the others (even the very expensive ones) are closer to mat hair spray, and make hair sticky.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for in a dry shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy Klorane as my go-to dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Problem is The can is tiny and there is only maybe 3-4 uses in each can if you have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It gives my fine, thin hair bulk and actually makes it look thick!  </li>
            <li> I compared the ingredients of the most least expensive dry shampoo (5 oz) and this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% obsessed with this dry shampoo especially on days where I really don&#x27;t feel like washing/drying/styling, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel  like I am &#x27;wearing&#x27; a dry shampoo, which is the way I felt with the other products.  </li>
            <li> It is not a harsh, hard product.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I only used it maybe 6 or 7 times and its gone.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle product, but works as expected.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my hair can get that oily look after only a few hours;</li>
            <li> but it finishes faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> so I was curious to see how Klorane would handle it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the need to do so is exacerbated my frequent early morning trips to the gym.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of the batisse dry shampoo and decided to give this a shot!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this dry shampoo really helps in a pinch!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking a little flat and a bit powdery.</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair it will show up in your scalp as white, but fear not, just wait a few minutes and brush it out.  </li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo at least three times a month, and have never had a bottle that only lasted one use.</li>
            <li> It has allowed me to wash my hair every other day and keep my highlighted hair healthier.</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any powder residue, either, which I have run into with other products.</li>
            <li> I just spent $20 on this and the bottle emptied after 2 times using it!</li>
            <li> I have found cheaper at other stores.</li>
            <li> Been around cigarette smoke or other odors</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and was concerned about the product container leaking, but I did not have that experience.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, coarse and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> When I use the klorane dry shampoo it gets rid of the oily look, yea, but it leaves my hair feeling harsh and brassy...and also, my hair is dark brown, and klorane leaves white flaky particles whenever I spray even a small amount of it into the roots.</li>
            <li> I have dry end and do not want to shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> so I can only conclude that it leaks slowly --</li>
            <li> one can dried up and I was unable to use after one brief use weeks earlier.  </li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint is the can is so damned small.</li>
            <li> a little spray of this, and it is gone.  </li>
            <li> If you have very dark hair, do NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is so disappointing because I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> I work out every day and don&#x27;t won&#x27;t to wash my hair everyday as it strips the oils.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and get my hair blow dried.</li>
            <li> If you do not wish or have time to wash your hair, you spray and wait a few minutes, then brush and all folds in place</li>
            <li> I workout everyday and this allows me to skip washing and my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> Freshens hair without spending all the time I was washing, blowdrying, straightening and then added a few curls.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t have an awful, heavy scent, doesn&#x27;t cause the room I&#x27;m in to suffocate me when I use it, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue once it&#x27;s brushed in, while still actually working.</li>
            <li> Every other time I have used this product it has lasted me at least 10 uses.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money, product, and bad for the environment as I threw away several cans after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> Not worth that price!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dull or fake like some other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> NOT PLEASED.</li>
            <li> The only problem is I get bored with its smell:/</li>
            <li> Allows me to go at least two or three days without washing my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and wash my hair every three to four days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after 2 attempts to purchase and use, I will NOT buy this again as it is too expensive to only be usable ONE TIME.</li>
            <li> i usually go 4 days without washing my hair and now extended it to 6 days !!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and gets that oily look after just 1 day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> We probably got a lemon, but still frustrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this problem is with this specific supplier or the manufacturers, but either way I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I wish this product was not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Klorane, WTF???</li>
            <li> I like the product but find it too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the worst of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, like Redken, which were horrible.</li>
            <li> Mothers who drive us crazy on the phone, taking vitamins, exercise, what to eat etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my bad</li>
            <li> They suck bad, in alot of ways.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also unfortunate and annoying because I paid $18 for this product!</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do like this product because it doesnt have a horrible after smell, and it doesnt leave a goopy residue on my scalp.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish this product was not so expensive. When i use it I can go about 1-3 days without washing my hair. It&#x27;s the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found. But it does have to sit for 5 minutes and you do have to brush it through very well or you&#x27;ll have white hair. It does spray on white too. Now they are coming out will all kinds of new dry shampoos. And they are coming out in common stores like walmart and target, for awhile there salons and beauty supply stores had the best dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years, It is the best one on the market and really works. I work out every day and don&#x27;t won&#x27;t to wash my hair everyday as it strips the oils.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for in a dry shampoo!  It smells good, the aerosol spray is perfect and my hair feels great afterwards. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough amazing things about this product.  As someone who has tried every dry shampoo under the sun, this one reigns supreme.  I am constantly on the move and don&#x27;t have time every day to blow out my long, naturally curly hair.  Unfortunately, the need to do so is exacerbated my frequent early morning trips to the gym.  But this product has saved me.  Now I can come home, blow dry the roots, spray some dry shampoo on and - voila! - good as new.  This product is a must have for intensely busy women who still want their hair to look great but don&#x27;t have the time for daily styling sessions.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.  This little product will keep hair looking fresh all day.  I have tried various other products but keep coming back to this brand.  No flaking and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is great.  It has allowed me to wash my hair every other day and keep my highlighted hair healthier.</li>
            <li> I like the way the dry shampoo performs on those days when I can&#x27;t wash my hair but I&#x27;ve bought it twice and each time the contents escape when it&#x27;s capped and sitting.  The first time I suddenly had an empty can after 4-5 light uses, I wrote it off as probably a defective spray mechanism.  This time I noticed that the white stuff all over the inside of the cap (I hadn&#x27;t used it in a week or so) so I can only conclude that it leaks slowly -- maybe more so when it&#x27;s not used for a week or so.  Either way, two times is more than a coincidence and it&#x27;s too expensive to be losing half the contents each time.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works very well. On days when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair, this product really helps clean my hair and it saves time. My very fine hair seems to look better when I shampoo it less often. This gentle dry shampoo seems to be exactly what my hair needs. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> its like magic. seriously best stuff i have used.i have thin blonde hair that gets greay fast. this is a miracle product for me. umpf and no grease. great for post gym workouts!!!</li>
            <li> I have become a huge fan of dry shampoo.  I have greasy hair by the time the evening rolls around so it&#x27;s a nice alternative to a shower when you are low on time.  I even use it before going to the gym on weekends since I don&#x27;t want to leave the house with a greasey head of hair.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Light, clean feeling without build up. I travel a lot and get my hair blow dried. This is essential to keeping my hair looking fresh while traveling</li>
            <li> Klorane is just what it says it is - gentle - and is effective at giving my hair a quick clean and a little lift. I have fine hair and like to take a periodic break from the daily washing and blow-dry. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any powder residue, either, which I have run into with other products. The smell is clean, no chemicals or heavy perfume.   If I use it in the morning to get through the day, I definitely need to wash my hair by the evening, but it holds up well for 10+ hours. I will plan to take this when I travel.</li>
            <li> You can get the same results by using a cheap dry shampoo but this one was still very nice</li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo I have ever used that works. My hair always gets greasy the day after I wash it and this dry shampoo saves me from having to wash my hair every day. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo. I was given a sample size and have not been able to find full size anywhere. It leaves your hair soft (not crunchy), and the initially white color fades after a brush through.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used. It absorbs oil better than the clear dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. It smells good and fresh!  Also the white film isn&#x27;t cakey and easily rubbed off. Tried other dry shampoos that are clear and it doesn&#x27;t absorb oil well, it&#x27;s as if spraying regular hairspray.  But klorane does best job for my hair!</li>
            <li> Hair looks very natural after use, very easy to apply and it&#x27;s smells really good. I love all Klorane products.</li>
            <li> I just spent $20 on this and the bottle emptied after 2 times using it! it&#x27;s 2 weeks old.  NOT PLEASED. find another dry shampoo - there are tons out there that I am sure have a better container.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time! I bought it a couple of weeks ago when I tore my patellar tendon and found out I was going to be in a leg brace for 8 weeks. It works great. I just spray it in, wait two minutes, brush it out, and style normally. I&#x27;m bringing it back to college with me in a few days, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be useful when I inevitably decide to skip my morning shower to catch some extra sleep. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, and this is the best dry shampoo I have used thus far.  This does not leave a white residue, has no strong odor, and easily brushes through my hair.  It is not a harsh, hard product. It leaves my hair soft and smooth.  It is easy to wash out as well.  I don&#x27;t feel  like I am &#x27;wearing&#x27; a dry shampoo, which is the way I felt with the other products.  i first used this product when it was a sample in my BirchBox, but I bought the full size product here on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  I will continue to buy Klorane as my go-to dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!!  It works really well.  I like the way it makes my hair feel after using it.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I had been in the market for a great dry shampoo and after reading several reviews I decided to purchase the Klorane Dry Shampoo.  I have ridiculously oily hair if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday, and this actually makes my hair appear clean and free of oil, and freshly washed.  The downside is that I have light/medium brown hair, and the product comes out in a hairspray form, but comes out white.  And it literally made me look I had gray hair.  I have to use it very sparingly so that I&#x27;m able to brush out the white, but there&#x27;s still a slight color difference (only I would notice it).  If you&#x27;re blond, this is perfect!  It smells good, and it works, other than the color difference.  If you have very dark hair, do NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle product, but works as expected. It lets me get away with not washing my hair and getting rid of that oily look. I have thin hair and gets that oily look after just 1 day. So everyone who says it doesn&#x27;t work, uh it&#x27;s not meant to be a miracle product. Try showering!</li>
            <li> i have used LOTS of dry shampoos.  This is my favorite.  Really does make day old hair look fresh.  Nice light scent.  Not white residue</li>
            <li> I used this product only one time and it will no longer spray!  this is a total waster of money. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Klorane has come up with a dry shampoo that is as close as you can get to fresh hair without water. It has a gentle fragrance which is not harsh or overpowering.  There is only one more thing I can say about Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo with Oat Milk, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have to give this only one star because, despite being a fairly large bottle, I only got 3, maybe 3.5 uses out of it and I only have shoulder length, semi-oily hair.  It did indeed make my hair look clean, but the smell is quite unappealing.  I&#x27;ll definitely be looking elsewhere for a better product.  Pass on this one, folks.</li>
            <li> This product allows me to double the length of time between shampooing. My hair looks best on days 3&amp;4 because of this product. It gives my fine, thin hair bulk and actually makes it look thick!  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dull or fake like some other dry shampoos. GreatGreatGreat.</li>
            <li> I tried this product (like many other customers) because it was recommend by &#x27;allure.&#x27; I honestly was not very impressed...the reason i&#x27;m giving it 3 stars- is simply for its amazing smell! It is by far the best scented dry shampoo I have ever purchased. aside from that...it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. My hair is very long and it&#x27;s really time consuming to keep up with- so I like to skip a day of washing it. Also, I am allergic to any and all hair coloring-(I can only use henna). My hair is extremely healthy, and at the same time, it can appear oily (even just hours after I wash it). When I use the klorane dry shampoo it gets rid of the oily look, yea, but it leaves my hair feeling harsh and brassy...and also, my hair is dark brown, and klorane leaves white flaky particles whenever I spray even a small amount of it into the roots. The best dry shampoo I have used so far is kms hairplay. The only problem is I get bored with its smell:/</li>
            <li> Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo works wonders. I usually wash my hair everyday, but was able to skip a day or two between washings with this product. It smells lovely, keeps my hair fresh, and full of body. Unfortunately, I was only able to get one or two uses per can as the contents leak out when not in use. I sent several back for a replacement and to no avail the same thing happened each time. The company needs to rethink how to properly dispense the product. A waste of money, product, and bad for the environment as I threw away several cans after only a few uses. Try a non-aresol dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have had platinum blond hair for over 2 years, and I&#x27;ve had to use every dry shampoo on the market. When this particular shampoo was recommended by Allure as well as FabFitFun.com I thought, \\&quot;This must be the dry-shampoo of all dry-shampoo&#x27;s!\\&quot; So, I purchased it. The first time I used this bottle was the last time. Why?...Because there is only enough dry shampoo for one application. I use dry shampoo at least three times a month, and have never had a bottle that only lasted one use. Also there were white spots all over my room where the shampoo leaked. Did the product work?...Well it worked but compared to others, its sub-par ... it really is &#x27;just an okay&#x27; shampoo. The smell was fine, but overall, I&#x27;ve had better. Was it worth waiting for it to ship, while I could have just gone to the beauty supply store?..No. Was it worth the money?..It was okay. I have found cheaper at other stores. Also, I need hair products that last, and this one doesnt - which adds $$$ up as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY, expensive, name brand, dry shampoos.  This is hands down my favorite.  I think it works the best.  Smells nice.  Still sprays on powdery, but blends in nicely.  I wish I could find it with free shipping, or at a close retailer, but no such luck yet.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo. I used to bring it from France and I&#x27;m so happy to have found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking a little flat and a bit powdery. But maybe thats because I sprayed a little too much than I was suppose to. It does clean your hair well and no oil appeared all day.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and wash my hair every three to four days. This is one of the best I have ever used, I have purchased it again and again. It is my go to dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample in my birchbox and had to buy...I have fine, oily hair that needs to be washed daily. I&#x27;ve tried suave (eh, ok), tressame, not your mothers, and a few more and honestly, this stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s now been 36 hrs since I washed my hair, and it&#x27;s so full of volume, it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m addicted. This is hands down the best dry shampoo for oily hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos. This is by the far the very best. Allows me to go at least two or three days without washing my hair</li>
            <li> Amazing. My ONLY complaint is the can is so damned small. I need like 30 of them. But it leaves you hair incredibly soft and your fingers will glide right through. I can&#x27;t go even one day without washing my hair, so this is great on the mornings when I simply can&#x27;t get up on time. I&#x27;ve tried other products, like Redken, which were horrible. This. This is the only one you want.</li>
            <li> I like this in a pinch - i.e., provides a quick freshen-up.  Sometimes my hair can get that oily look after only a few hours; a little spray of this, and it is gone.  I do not care for the smell, but it fades away (thank goodness).</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy this product again, it&#x27;s some of the best dry shampoo on the market and worth the price (over some US drug-store brands).</li>
            <li> With my oily hair, I have washed my hair daily for my whole life, much to the consternation of my hairdressers. With this dry shampoo, I am able to wash my hair every other day and not feel self-conscious in the least. My hair is looking better than ever since I started using Klorane Dry Shampoo!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in my Birchbox one month and fell in love.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of dry shampoos and this one absorbs so quickly and easily, and has the nicest, clean and fresh scent.  Most of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried have an overpowering and per-fumy scent that I can&#x27;t stand.  I&#x27;ll be using this product from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY dry shampoo that has ever worked on my hair. I have very fine hair that I have to wash everyday or its greasy. So, I was really excited that I finally found a dry shampoo that really worked. The only complaint I have is that I only used it maybe 6 or 7 times and its gone. Works great just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I read about this on Cup of Jo and Refinery 29, and it does not disappoint. Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used and smells wonderful. Pro-tip: use overnight for super volume in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this dry shampoo really helps in a pinch!  When my hair is on the greasy side and somewhat clumping, I spray the heck out of it with Klorane Dry Shampoo, and I can definitely go one more day without shampooing. HELPFUL HINT:  Spray on before bed and let it do its magic overnight.  It doesn&#x27;t look as good as a real shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t look like the greasy mess I would have had to subject my friends and co-workers to without it.  I purchased one about 3 months ago and liked it so much that I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> True, it works wonderfully. If you do not wish or have time to wash your hair, you spray and wait a few minutes, then brush and all folds in place and it looks fresh</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a dry shampoo, this is one of the best.  Leaves no white residue if you blend it in.  I use Klorane if I&#x27;m just looking to feel cleaner, and I use Oribe (or both) if I&#x27;m also looking for fullness.  The Klorane scent is very mild and pleasant.  They also have a travel size which is great for trips.  A solid choice for dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> i was looking for powder.. this is spray. It&#x27;s my bad i didn&#x27;t read the description well.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is light, doesn&#x27;t have the typically cloying or chemical smells of most dry shampoos, and gives my relatively limp hair some nice volume. it immediately gets rid of the oily sheen, though if you have fine hair you probably still need to shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> This is the one girls!  It works great. This absorbs the oil without making your hair too powdery. This is my must have for travel to keep a blow out going so I don&#x27;t have to take my hair products/tools.  This has made my blowouts easily last 4 days and look great.  Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most brands, and while they all have their perks, Klorane is the only product that makes my hair actually feel clean. Most of the others (even the very expensive ones) are closer to mat hair spray, and make hair sticky. I love this one.</li>
            <li> The concept of dry shampoo is amazing- and this product works wonders. I can go 4 days between washes and I have oil hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful to not buy the aerosol version as the propellant doesn&#x27;t last.  I only got three uses out of the large size can before it went flat (no leaking sounds to indicate an issue after the last use).</li>
            <li> THE best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Much better than kerastaze. I have been a big loyal fan of kerastaze for years, but their dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t even get close as good as this.</li>
            <li> This is great to use for the days that you don&#x27;t want to wash your hair and it does hide the oil so that your hair looks good.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product. It makes my blow dry last longer. I workout everyday and this allows me to skip washing and my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this before we went on a cruise.  I used it every morning and it worked great!  Granted, I wasn&#x27;t going out on the town, but it worked well for just getting up in the morning and laying by the pool or beach.  I&#x27;m a \\&quot;shampoo every morning\\&quot; type of girl, except on vacations when I shower before dinner.  It did it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s very easy to use and you can&#x27;t barely tell your didn&#x27;t actually wash your hair, even if it was really oily before.</li>
            <li> This is your new &amp;#34;Best Friend&amp;#34; in a can! In a rush and no time to wash your hair?  Been around cigarette smoke or other odors and you think your hair may not smell so fresh?  Klorane will amaze you!  I&#x27;ve used it with my Hospice patients and in dementia care.  It is so amazing.  Please try it, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works better than anything else I found in the stores. Has a baby powder smell that&#x27;s not too strong and does the job well.</li>
            <li> Great product--feels, smells, works and applies much better than other dry shampoos (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot--e.g. Pssssst!, Batiste, Drybar, Oscar Blandi, Bumble and bumble, etc.). However, the bottle does not last long (~2-3 weeks tops, with every other day use), making the price of one unit unjustified. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper solution that lasts longer, do Batiste.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works well but the can didn&#x27;t last took long. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> My wife had previously used this product and liked it so much we ordered it again, but this time it was a failure. She used the product once and the next day the can was empty. It appears the top blew off and dispensed all of the product into the cap. We probably got a lemon, but still frustrating.</li>
            <li> (*This review is for the product, not the seller-seller was most helpful and did return the first item for replacement.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now received 2 shipments of the \\&quot;Klorane Gentle Dry Shampoo with Oat Milk\\&quot;. The first one I received worked only once, and then the can was empty due to a faulty aerosol system causing the product to leak completely out of the sides. The seller replaced that one with a new one which I was again only able to use once, and then found that it was completely empty. What a WASTE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product sparingly both times...found that it worked great as an in-between refresher and was good with volume and smelled nice. Unfortunately after 2 attempts to purchase and use, I will NOT buy this again as it is too expensive to only be usable ONE TIME. Klorane, WTF???</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> It works Well! Great product, but it finishes faster than expected.  But it is a great Solution for once in a while, when You are in a hurry...</li>
            <li> one can dried up and I was unable to use after one brief use weeks earlier.  I like the product but find it too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times and it works great.  I highly recommend it.  Just not from this seller!!!!  I don&#x27;t know what kind of tricks ASAP Beauty is playing, but I&#x27;m pretty sure someone used this product before it was mailed to me.  When I alerted the seller of this, they told me to pound sand.  The bottle worked for one-and-a-half uses!  Every other time I have used this product it has lasted me at least 10 uses.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo! Smells like baby powder, but it works very well. The smell wears off in minutes.</li>
            <li> I do like this product because it doesnt have a horrible after smell, and it doesnt leave a goopy residue on my scalp.  What I find strange, is sometimes it works beautifully, and sometimes, it just doesnt seem to take..I think that has more to do with how Im probably applying it, rather than the product. Ive tried MANY dry shampoos, and this is by far the best. I just purchased the 4 travel size since I travel a lot too. highly recommend if you are sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li> Definitely gives dirty or clean hair volume!  I love the smell &amp; highly recommend it.  My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the batisse dry shampoo and decided to give this a shot!! i usually go 4 days without washing my hair and now extended it to 6 days !! WOW !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wash it everyday, but my hair became very frizzy !! now i wash less, and with the natural oils, my hair hs never looked to so healthy and less hair loss when i wash my hair !!  ( I do need to shampoo twice and then condition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff !! gonna try out suave brand too....not sure why this one doesnt have more reviews ?!?!</li>
            <li> I love love this product! Lets face it, we have so many chores to do on our face, body, hair nails, toes, cook, clean, kids, rotten husbands, Mothers who drive us crazy on the phone, taking vitamins, exercise, what to eat etc. Its a full time job just to stay young and fit and non fat with perfect thick hair and for what? So tiny brained men wont dump us for younger women?  Or do we look pretty for ourselves? I know I love to gaze into the mirror at my hair and I even have a set of vintage crowns I wear around the house just cause I feel like it. Some days I dont want to look like a perfect cupcake. I want to lay around in an old nightgown on the sofa, watch movies eat ice cream and pizza and not wash my hair and blow dry it, protein it, protect it, iron it blah blah. So I spray this on my hair and it makes it full of volume, thick, non greasy which is a crime against humanity, yeah right. Anyway it does hold off sweat if you work out or oil, or anything that could happen. Maybe saled dressing flung off your fork onto your hair as you hurled the fork at your husband. BAM this product will absurb it. Problem is The can is tiny and there is only maybe 3-4 uses in each can if you have long thick hair. Give us more bang for our buck Klorane! PLus whats in this stuff? I have not researched it yet. It works. The smell could be worked out to be more pleasant. Its not horrible but not great either! This product is way way better than the powder type dry shampoo&#x27;s. They suck. They suck bad, in alot of ways. But I am just 1 opinion out of many and I am just an angry tiny little woman who needs to rule the world</li>
            <li> I adore this dry shampoo and have tried several other cheaper options…which can&#x27;t even come close!  My only complaint is how quickly I go through a bottle…but I guess if I washed my hair more, that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best dry shampoo you can buy on the market. I&#x27;ve tried several different dry shampoos and none of them compare to Klorane. Batiste is okay but I find that Klorane works way better and takes little effort. Some dry shampoos leave your hair feeling more greasy or you have to use a ton of it to take the grease out but not the case with Klorane. This is all I will buy now. Highly recommend! You will not be dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and has a good texture, not sticky like so many others. Love it! The only dry shampoo I&#x27;ll use</li>
            <li> This is the worst of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. It goes super fast - there are hardly any uses - which makes it extra pricey. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling all that clean. And frankly, a spray just doesn&#x27;t make sense. Why inhale all of those particles? Just use a powder, which is more effective and less disruptive to the environment and your lungs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the positive reviews from other online purchasers.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I had never used dry shampoo in the past and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  A few quick sprays, a couple of minutes to let it do its thing, then brush it out and you&#x27;re good to go.  I have fine hair and \\&quot;bed-head\\&quot; in the morning is pretty much my norm so I was curious to see how Klorane would handle it.  No problems...smoothed everything back into place.  I have color on my hair so don&#x27;t really like the idea of shampooing every day....Klorane has made a difference....and it&#x27;s a great time saver too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get an itchy scalp when I use this product.  My hair was very full and my scalp felt clean and smelled great too.</li>
            <li> Nice that this stuff just proceeded to turn my hair GREY and didn&#x27;t clean it at all.  Once I was finished spraying it on, the powder didn&#x27;t come out at all, and I looked twenty years older.  All hype, I&#x27;m telling you.  And my hair wasn&#x27;t any cleaner than it was before.  Don&#x27;t buy this stuff...it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and was concerned about the product container leaking, but I did not have that experience. The product overall is nice. However, after I spray the contents in my hair unlike most of the reviews I read --- After letting the product dry on my hair, I tilt my head/hair towards the floor and use my blow dryer for about 2-3 minutes. Afterwards I brush and my hair is clean, soft, shiny, and still the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue with the product is the price ... $18 vs $3. I compared the ingredients of the most least expensive dry shampoo (5 oz) and this one. The Klorane product (3.2 oz) contains the following \\&quot;extra\\&quot;: Oryza Sativa (Rice) Starch (Oryza Sativa), Avena Sativa (Oat)  Cyclodextrin, Cyclomethicone. I do not think this product is really worth an additional $15 so I have ordered and will try another dry shampoo to compare. On a positive note the fragrance of the product is very pleasant, though a bit strong.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Smells wonderful and actually makes my hair look fresh and clean.  I have tried other products and been disappointed.  Klorane does a great job; it is pricier, but in this category of product I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Smelled good and worked great, but I only used it 3-4 times before it was gone!!! Not worth that price!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but only treat myself every now and then because it&#x27;s expensive for a college student. I started using this stuff in France. It&#x27;s the only dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t have an awful, heavy scent, doesn&#x27;t cause the room I&#x27;m in to suffocate me when I use it, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue once it&#x27;s brushed in, while still actually working. My favorite dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used lots).</li>
            <li> Used twice in a 10 day period, the 3rd time, it was empty, with no compression at all.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A RIP OFF!.  Would not use again.  Apparently the company has not fixed the problem, as top reviews seem to be from years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this but find the non-aeorsol version is more effective. I have to use more of the aerosol for the same effect.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I just ran out. I absolutely love this stuff. Since it leaves a white layer on your hair after you spray, what I did was spray it on at night and let it absorb while I slept. In the morning the white layer was completely gone. My hair felt fresh and clean, and it lasted the whole day. I probably could have gone a whole other day without washing too. Since I&#x27;ve run out, I&#x27;ve decided to give a cheaper brand a chance in order to spare my wallet (I&#x27;m giving Pssssst! a chance, fingers crossed!), but if I don&#x27;t like it, I am totally coming back to Klorane. Such a time-saver, and totally works wonders.</li>
            <li> I love this dry spray shampoo.  If you have dark hair it will show up in your scalp as white, but fear not, just wait a few minutes and brush it out.  Nice neutral smell, cleanses well, and provides awesome body &amp; volume.</li>
            <li> Love this product! This is the 2nd time ordering and it works just as good as the first, and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I heard great things about it. The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t have to use very much and it worked well. A couple days later I went to use the product again and was baffled to find that it was EMPTY! I had only used it ONCE!! This is so disappointing because I really do like this product. It&#x27;s also unfortunate and annoying because I paid $18 for this product! I am very unhappy with this purchase. It seems as though the product evaporated because I did not use it all in my first use. I&#x27;m not sure if this problem is with this specific supplier or the manufacturers, but either way I am very disappointed. The only reason this gets a 2 star review rather than a 1 star is because the product itself actually works well.</li>
            <li> One of the best (if not the best) dry shampoos around. Worth the price. Works great on dark or light hair if used correctly. Nonirritating to my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is my Holy Grail dry shampoo. This product really soaks up the extra oil in my scalp. I have dry end and do not want to shampoo everyday. This product helps prolong my wash and blow out for several days. I usually spray this in my hair at night and wake up with clean looking hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, coarse and thick hair.  I don&#x27;t like to wash it too much, this dry shampoo makes life easier.  Freshens hair without spending all the time I was washing, blowdrying, straightening and then added a few curls.  Would recommend to others!!!&lt;br /&gt;A little more money than I wanted to spend but in the long run time is money so it was worh it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% obsessed with this dry shampoo especially on days where I really don&#x27;t feel like washing/drying/styling, etc. my long hair. The smell of this one (in comparison to the green top version) is heavenly. This version is to be used on freshly washed hair (for some texture). I&#x27;ll be stocking up soon!</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried-excellent for my fine hair-adds volume besides cleaning my hair so I&#x27;m out the door quickly.</li>
