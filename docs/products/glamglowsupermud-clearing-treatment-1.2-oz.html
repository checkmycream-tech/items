            <li>I ended up just buying this from Sephora, and was very happy with my results.</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve always been on the lookout for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; clay and mud masks.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome at cleaning out pores, you can see where it has pulled out the oil when the mask dries!  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this is a great product!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to have my friends and family try it out and see how awesome it is.</li>

            <li>product has been the best I&#x27;ve come across in years and</li>
            <li>This is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve come along in my career of cosmetology.&lt;br /&gt;After using it every 3 days or so for a month</li>
            <li>Wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I use it both as a mask and as a spot treatment (it is especially effective when I get pesky breakouts during that time of the month).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an awesome mask.</li>
            <li>but it works great!</li>
            <li>this is the best mud I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Wonderful skin treatment.  </li>

            <li>I will say however that I was not overly impressed with the shipping and packaging of the item.  </li>

            <li>Love this product is wonderful</li>
            <li>This mask has so many beneficial ingredients and feels great!</li>
            <li>This mask is wonderful and makes my skin look and feel 10 times better.  </li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this face mask if just the best!</li>
            <li>I need to stop buying this kind of nonsense and just go to a dermatologist!</li>
            <li>While I was glad with the results, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>I also like the luminizing mask from REN to use after this one just to give my skin a more plump awesome look!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good in that it makes the skin feel great after use.</li>
            <li>Nice!  </li>
            <li>My makeup looks more flawless, when I put it on after using the mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many reviews on here and youtube saying this is the best stuff for blackheads.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this would work on more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin, but then again, I don&#x27;t think perfectly complected people are spending an arm and a leg on products for skin issues.  </li>
            <li>Over all, I would say it&#x27;s a good luxury product if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, and it would also make a great gift.</li>
            <li>But I can say when you get an authentic version of this it&#x27;s absolutely awesome</li>
            <li>This mud treatment is spectacular!</li>
            <li>Basically every woman should own this stuff!</li>
            <li>Nice quality product, beautiful packaging, and</li>
            <li>She says it feels wonderful after use and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Great seller, better price here than at Sephora!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to rinse off, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or sting while it&#x27;s on, and when you rinse it off you&#x27;ll find gorgeous, supple, glowy and perfect skin.</li>
            <li>good good great love it!</li>
            <li>Very good mask, I love it, and I will buy it again</li>
            <li>Good mask after I uses</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of it.</li>
            <li>it is a good product thought.</li>
            <li>Good product, but felt that the package and jar had been opened.</li>
            <li>consistency and color was surprising.</li>
            <li>I struggled a bit getting it evenly distributed before it started drying, which is does fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product, but not for the price.</li>
            <li>Ordered for my wife expecting that products &amp;#34;Fulfilled By Amazon&amp;#34; were good quality.</li>
            <li>It is a good product in a good price.</li>
            <li>makes your skin feel good and helped somewhat.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the product, I bought it on Amazon because it was a lot cheaper than Sephora.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>good .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read nothing but good things about this product</li>
            <li>Good remedy if u have greasy skin it absorbs everything i will order again once i run out..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize what a good job it was doing until I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>Always follow up with a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good at purifying the skin and clearing pores.  </li>
            <li>Its a good product</li>
            <li>but I works good.</li>
            <li>Read a lot of good reviews for this</li>
            <li>All my friends loved it, so I decided to splurge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about once a week for two months now (mostly just on my nose and cheeks, since those are my problem areas), and I&#x27;m incredibly underwhelmed.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make me break out which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>It really is a good product, but buy it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t good for my skin.</li>
            <li>All In all a good product.</li>
            <li>Loved the product.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to order this product but family members had used it and loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a product that needs to be used a lot to keep good results, keep that in mind.</li>
            <li>It feels good and is relaxing</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Loved how this product worked.  </li>
            <li>It is good for clearing, but doesn&#x27;t work for acne treatment.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Always a quality product with no issues and a good Seller.</li>
            <li>and he loved the results and</li>
            <li>I did not want to pay the price of retail and good ol amazon</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolitely loved it</li>
            <li>Good spot treatment too</li>
            <li>Feels good and makes you look good.</li>
            <li>great product, effective for my acne.</li>
            <li>Tried a knockoff and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good.</li>
            <li>A friend shared with me and I loved it....</li>
            <li>Good product&lt;br /&gt;Higly</li>
            <li>I saw both good reviews on Amazon as well as Sephora but this product was cheaper on Amazon (about $10 cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It is a good mask.</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff-</li>
            <li>Your face feels so smooth afterwards, and it&#x27;s just an awesome mask to watch work.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product from Sephora before and loved it.</li>
            <li>it looks good.</li>
            <li>This product does a good job at removing excess oils in my T-zones.</li>
            <li>Warm water rinse in the am and some moisturizer, and your make up goes on great....</li>
            <li>I have already use this mask for 5 or 6 times but I do not see any good changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>they loved it.  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels so good within minutes of application.</li>
            <li>The product is good, it did bring a bit up out of my pores.  </li>
            <li>so i knew I loved</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40, so it&#x27;s good for all ages that need a pore-cleaner-outer.</li>
            <li>Loved how my skin felt after , and it smelled really good.</li>
            <li>I guess it feels good when it dries because you can feel you face tightened.</li>
            <li>However, this works surprisingly well to help my acne heal after it&#x27;s popped up.  </li>
            <li>though I already knew from Jen that it was good stuff</li>
            <li>Clears up skin and leaves it feeling smooth and gorgeous!!</li>
            <li>(and if you&#x27;ve had acne, you know that&#x27;s a good feeling).</li>
            <li>and it did feel good on my face and smelled like mint meets licorice.</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>Its a good mask but not for clearing up skin as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of removing oil and dirt, as well as minimizing pores.  </li>
            <li>all which are very nice, effective, and pricey themselves compared to Queen Helene.</li>
            <li>After just one use my skin looks so clean and feels great!</li>
            <li>This seemed to be the best price I could find, so Im pretty happy about that.</li>
            <li>The product itself was amazing,  and it was easily the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and take off!!</li>
            <li>I am a true believer in this stuff - it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin so anything that literally pulls the crud out of my pores is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product and received it in about four days, I was very pleased with the shipping speed.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with its results.</li>
            <li>Great you can see it working on your face too not like most masks</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and so happy I got a deal and saved like $30 when I got it on here rather than Sephora.</li>
            <li>I thought I would splurge and try it since it had so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Was psyched to try this product after reading the many great reviews...</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product itself is great .</li>
            <li>She was very pleased with the results, used it one evening</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also great for taking the dirt out of your pores on the top layer</li>
            <li>Im very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Works great as a mask but even better as a spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it -</li>
            <li>Nice product with good value.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this product after having read all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I ordered this product, with all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Best way to deal with it is to get our hormones tested and find the right skin care regimen and stick to it for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li>then I use a biore strip right after and it works great!</li>
            <li>Love love this mask!!</li>

            <li>Plus the rest of my skin looks amazing just after one use.</li>
            <li>Really liked the way my face looked after using</li>
            <li>A nice exfoliator has been just as effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially magical after camping or traveling when you don&#x27;t have the time to give your skin as much attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ingredients can&#x27;t stay stable and effective in jar packaging.</li>
            <li>I bought one from Sephora before, and the product was really nice.</li>
            <li>Very tingling and makes your face feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this stuff</li>
            <li>This treatment really makes my skin look great!  </li>
            <li>Beware this snake oil, it do more harm then good.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best to apply and then jump into the shower when you&#x27;re ready to take it off.</li>
            <li>What kind of company is this?</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the purchase and would recommend it to friends going forward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross/awesome to see it pulling out all the dirt/oil/sebum from your pores.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like a mixture of peppermint and licorice.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin feel really nice when I washed it off.</li>
            <li>Nice scrubbing beads/stones.</li>
            <li>My Daughter and I are loving this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading many many great reviews on it online and after a lot of deliberation over whether I wanted to spend almost $50 on a face mask.</li>
            <li>It works nice</li>
            <li>I also liked how this could be used as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Loved it and had to buy more.</li>
            <li>I liked how it felt afterwards and how it worked on whiteheads</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice mask</li>
            <li>So nice to buy something that lives up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>It rinses nicely</li>
            <li>This product did make my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought this was going to be a waist of money.</li>
            <li>Nice for oily people I think since its a bit drying.</li>
            <li>I felt that my skin really glowing and all problems solved :D</li>
            <li>I was hearing so many good things about this stuff</li>
            <li>Im really loving this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I had a sample of another mask by this brand that I really liked.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s always good :)</li>
            <li>My skin was in good condition beforehand, but I did notice a smoother, more porcelain-like texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using, and if my results continue to be good, I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>just cuz it&#x27;s a nice mask when I want to relax.</li>
            <li>It removed everything from my pores, made my skin feel nice and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and it really does work great!</li>
            <li>The one from Sephora was incredible, it cleared my face right up.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this out because of all the great reviews it had gotten.  </li>
            <li>I still feel like it&#x27;s worth using for the pore diminishing effects alone!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>smells great and is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used in a long time</li>
            <li>This one comes off very easily with warm water and</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly once applied and skin looked and felt great immediately afterward.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and a great product.</li>
            <li>Its super great</li>
            <li>It goes on well, dries quickly, smells great, and does what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Theres&#x27; something really satisfying about being able to see the oil it extracts from my pores!  </li>
            <li>I have not used this type of mud mask before, so I made sure to look at reviews with step-by-step photos etc, but I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have this mask as it is totally amazing for combination skin!</li>
            <li>This mask was pretty good!</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the better your skin will be!</li>
            <li>Gets the gunk right out!!!</li>
            <li>My new favorite product!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best masked I have tried.</li>
            <li>The most effective I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s the most amazing mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The best of all clay mask out there really do what is should do , best for acne as well , definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the value and works great.</li>
            <li>So I guess it was well worth the money if it works and makes her happy.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they gave more for the price.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and pores almost invisible, but cleans them out good.</li>
            <li>Nice mask that is really refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Even though I haven&#x27;t seen wonderful results, I love the smell and process of using this product so much that I&#x27;ll probably try more glamglow products</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s lots of acidic type of natural ingredients that are so awesome for treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy and surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This product is so great I can see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use too!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product!  </li>
            <li>worth the $70 price tag at sephora, but soooo very nice to get on here for $35.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery, great price, and a great product.</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing, wonderful, and gross.</li>
            <li>Love this mask.....makes my skin amazing :)</li>
            <li>Also it is great that Amazon has such a great price for it.</li>
            <li>I apply it where patches are, and after waiting 10-20 minutes and removal, i am good for 4 to 5 days in the winter (1.5 to 2 weeks in the summer) without doing anything special to my face besides preventative care.</li>
            <li>Great product and its so much cheaper here on Amazon than at Sephora!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and when comparing prices you really can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
            <li>Amazing how this product has gotten rid of my blackheads love love love it.</li>
            <li>Great product for some but unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having magic mud in a bottle, I saw results very quickly with this product!</li>
            <li>mask is very smooth</li>
            <li>I washed my face and it was very smooth afterwards  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny and has made my skin pretty flawless!</li>
            <li>To be fair, I don&#x27;t have problem skin, so it might just be that I&#x27;m lucky.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use I like it very much and gonna be my best product</li>
            <li>Good quality, shipping very fast!</li>
            <li>and I was super excited to get GlamGlow since I had heard so many great things.</li>
            <li>so she must love it.</li>
            <li>It really clears up chin bumps and turns into a great scrub when you wash it off with water and your hands.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mask and I will continue to repurchase it.</li>
            <li>The aztec mask has to be used at night because the pulsing makes your skin red for hours, this one makes your skin look perfect as soon as you rinse it off.</li>
            <li>Love it can&#x27;t wait to buy more</li>
            <li>This is the best facial item you can try.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel after.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I had better masks for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and makes my pores tiny!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Love this item, you can feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>just need to use it more often</li>
            <li>but I appreciate it :-)  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The mask itself came in SUPERB condition, and it arrived earlier than stated/expected.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, I tried GlamGlow and have gotten SO MANY COMPLIMENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar, the foil that was supposed to seal the jar was already peeled off and was just set on top.</li>
            <li>The indian clay mask works better than this</li>
            <li>Ahhhh I love this stuff 😍</li>
            <li>but it costs 10 times more.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I tried adding more water to reconstitute it, but I just got a chunky watery mixture.</li>
            <li>wish the smell was better</li>
            <li>Safe to say I will not be buying this ever again or buying anything from cosabeauty.&lt;br /&gt;Update: The seller refunded 50%.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>and I love the way it feels when it is applied.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels when I take it off, but it hasn&#x27;t improved my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again. :)</li>
            <li>I think I like this one better.</li>
            <li>love it love it love.</li>
            <li>You can see you skin is way much better than before.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love it it worked so well</li>
            <li>It shrinks pores and makes your skin smooth and glow!</li>
            <li>Love this product  Your skin will love it too.  </li>
            <li>Worked okay on blackhead.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li>i just love glam glow</li>
            <li>its ok, doesn&#x27;t pull anything out of my pores like advertised.</li>
            <li>the more I used it the better my skin got.  </li>
            <li>top of it all, I didn&#x27;t see any sort of improvement to my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin felt softer and smoother than it had in many years.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it helps my skin look so much better when I think to use it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I put the mask on after a shower when my skin would be most receptive to the mask and all of its ingredients.</li>
            <li>Even after a night out with cream and makeup, my face looks a million times better.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>You cannot tell from the picture how awesome is the white box that packages this product.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the spa feeling.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite cleansing products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously magic mud.</li>
            <li>The best reviews I found were on You-Tube, especially because there are tutorials.</li>
            <li>It was purchased as a gift for my mom, she says she loves it and that has helped a lot with your skin problems, I have not used myself, but looks good, has clear instructions, good presentation and arrived at scheduled time</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>LOVE this mask.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe I need more than one application to see the results that others did</li>
            <li>If you have the money to spare and want to try this out for yourself then ok, otherwise I suggest looking for something else.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure their is another product out there</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s just OK and overpriced.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week and after just two treatments my face looked so much better.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d buy it more often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic, but temporary magic.</li>
            <li>the more</li>
            <li>I will for sure be buying this again.</li>
            <li>Love it love it</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Love the way skin feel afterwards</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>The smell is not horrible, I love the feel of it on my face</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the feel of it.</li>
            <li>I thought the product was OK.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easiest to apply with a makeup brush so the oil from your fingers don&#x27;t interfere with what the mask is designed to do! :)</li>
            <li>I hope you have a better result</li>
            <li>It made my skin more oily and caused me to have more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I also love that I can see the mask pulling all the dirt out of my skin, and I also leave it as a spot treatment overnight.</li>
            <li>Wanted to love it, but won&#x27;t be subjecting myself to that again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolutely phenomenal product and has become a staple to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I even think my pores a getting more dirtier.</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar, there was mud around the edge and on the underside of the top.</li>
            <li>was looking some what better</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and more of this</li>
            <li>The product is okay.</li>
            <li>Does EVERYTHING it says it will and more.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than the mud treatment I had at a spa (birthday gift).  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s vegan</li>
            <li>Using the two products together, I have never had better skin in my life.  </li>
            <li>The Glamglow clears everything from my skin, reduces pores, exfoliates, and then the Bel Essence hydrates my skin better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>tried.mglow clears everything from my skin, reduces pores, exfoliates, and then the Bel Essence hydrates my skin better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>but it will make your skin breathe and feel better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin felt after I rinsed the mask off.  </li>
            <li>As the mask was drying, I felt like it was pulling the oil out of more pores.</li>
            <li>It works much better than I thought.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can honestly see the mask pulling buildup from your pores as it dries, and when you wash it off your skin feels soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>Hopefully when I run out, I won&#x27;t need to order more, but if I have to, I</li>
            <li>Buy it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>I like the product, however I didn&#x27;t get the results that many others did.</li>
            <li>and I consider it more of a splurge.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>Fastest shipping ever &amp; free!</li>
            <li>and I put this mask on and it takes most of it out.</li>
            <li>this face pack is just okay</li>
            <li>and surely overpriced!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do any miracles</li>
            <li>so I imagine I&#x27;ll be able to use it for a while.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a clay mask, I&#x27;m sure you can find something alot cheaper (this product retails for $69.00 in the stores) that will work just as well.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m sure you could do it more often, but my skin seems to react to everything</li>
            <li>Why do so many people like this product?</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, most of those people get a lot of items for free and don&#x27;t always give honest reviews.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have been hearing all the hype about this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, but it&#x27;s freaky to watch the stuff come out of your pores.</li>
            <li>And not so magic to lighten my complexion.</li>
            <li>This product is one of the best facial masks I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love how it pulls oils out of the pores.</li>
            <li>I was anticipating a product that cleared out pores more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using this because I am hoping that there will be a cumulative effect and the more I use it the better my pores will be.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li>It is 100% authentic-</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite masks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I just received my Glamglow today and I am already in love.</li>
            <li>I have many friends who own this product, and I am so happy to finally have my own.</li>
            <li>I love that this mask shows you where your face is dirtiest.</li>
            <li>I love the product..</li>
            <li>skin comes into contact with so many toxins throughout the day:</li>
            <li>But it turns out I love it.</li>
            <li>It works OK</li>
            <li>I Love Amazon</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my all time favorite one stop shopping</li>
            <li>In one treatment, my skin is getting better.</li>
            <li>That said, I love this mask.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because of the price, not performance-if money is not a factor for you, then you will probably love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I am not 100% sure if it is their product or just how Glam Glow packages their product..</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying love love love....</li>
            <li>it leaves your face feeling smooth, glowing, and amazing...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>always finds a better deal.</li>
            <li>I saw glam glow on Pinterest and it looked interesting.</li>
            <li>I love my glamglow mask.</li>
            <li>so will see how it does after more uses.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this face mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just a pricey product to not be in love</li>
            <li>But more gunk on the strip compared to using it alone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I got it</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>And I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

            <li>Of course I would love to see a price reduction, who wouldn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li>Speaking of chemicals, I&#x27;ve read elsewhere that the ingredients in this really aren&#x27;t great for your skin.</li>
            <li>After you use it you can literally see the immediate difference and your face feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>but I always follow with a toner to be sure.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>this is the same stuff i get from online sephora and its great!</li>
            <li>I had some of the &amp;#34;oil spots&amp;#34; in places on my cheeks and forehead that I did not expect, and I almost feel as if those pores are MORE visible than before, though that may be just because the mask brought their existence to my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And when it dries on top of the pores it makes them stand out...</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>

            <li>I will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mask.</li>
            <li>Also I love when you have it on you can see it working.</li>
            <li>This mask was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Many people have been telling me my face  has been glowing.</li>
            <li>I wish it sucked out more gunk than it does.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to all my friends who use masks too &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>be using often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li>The mask felt really great on, but it didn&#x27;t pull much out of my pores and I felt like I broke out more after using it.</li>
            <li>Product had leaked out of the slit and was smeared all over the top as well.</li>
            <li>everything looks better</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so much better the two days after.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Use a foundation brush to apply...much better than finger</li>
            <li>I would recommend kerstin florian mud, which I had much better results.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>is very refreshing and cool.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this product, it can be bought in some make-up stores</li>
            <li>but you will pay more.</li>
            <li>Even the guys who would never admit they&#x27;ve used it love it.</li>
            <li>I need more.</li>
            <li>Clogged pores look more bumpy</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this on here before Sephora picked it up as a line staple.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I love the price even better.</li>
            <li>am I glad she did.</li>
            <li>I have been an esthetician for 10 years and this mask is even better than the pharmaceutical grade masks I have used at work.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy more for my stubborn skin.</li>
            <li>It heals and calms my cystic acne and blemishes and makes my skin feel amazingly smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>tend to get a rash from many products but this one has given me no reaction at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an AWESOME facial mask!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I just love the results, I was looking for an all in one mask that would treat all my skin problems.</li>
            <li>I could never justify the price, but my curiosity finally got the best of me.</li>
            <li>There are things you can purchase at Walgreens that work better than this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin in a lot more smoother.</li>
            <li>and I think my pores and texture of my skin are looking much better.</li>
            <li>Great product, but very pricey for what you get.  </li>
            <li>It just keeps getting better with each use.</li>
            <li>I took pictures but wasn&#x27;t able to upload them to this review.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I&#x27;ve had a couple of tours of Accutane that made it much, much better.  </li>
            <li>In my experience, most of what I&#x27;ve tried works better for preventing acne, but not so well after it&#x27;s popped up.  </li>
            <li>It was indeed interesting to see.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this before I run out:)</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>However, I used it anyway and for the results I have seen in my skin&#x27;s texture and the $20 I am saving, I&#x27;m okay with</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love the mask.</li>
            <li>Love the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It cleaned most of my blackheads.</li>
            <li>When I wash it off my skin feels so much better and cleaner, and so many blackheads were gone.</li>
            <li>Even better is that here on Amazon this product is a lot cheaper than I&#x27;ve seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li>my favorite face mask on the market.</li>
            <li>Overall, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the product</li>
            <li>, the better it works...would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Also...when I received mine, the top layer was already semi-dried out.</li>
            <li>This mask is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love how you can literally watch the dirt being removed from your face even after washing it.  </li>
            <li>I love love love how my face feels.</li>
            <li>Pores were noticeable smaller and complexion looked wonderful</li>
            <li>more case of hope springs eternal.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the results .</li>
            <li>my texture looked immediately better.</li>
            <li>i brought one in hk store , which contained more leaves than the one from here .</li>
            <li>And this is more watery</li>
            <li>Love this mask</li>
            <li>I purchased this product from amazon because the price was better than sephora.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was recommended to me by a friend a my nail salon, and I am so glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>This product is EXCELLENT in getting rid on pimples, and especially at the onset of a breakout.</li>
            <li>I love and need to buy more soon.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this mask?</li>
            <li>but nothin my favorite moisturizer could not fix.</li>
            <li>This product is okay...</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>face mask is nice, it makes your skin smooth and gets very clean.</li>
            <li>, my face felt so clean and soft after using, this was the best price i could find</li>
            <li>I also own a Clarisonic which has been helping to keep those pores clean.</li>
            <li>main thing I like is that it&#x27;s great for spot treatments</li>
            <li>But in reality - nothing has been pulled out of your pores - you just have some nice clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>It been two weeks of using it every couple days and its turning my skin back to its original bright and beautiful self.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this treatment after seeing it all over the internet and having heard great things.  </li>
            <li>definitely nice to have though I use it when I have any special occasion or pictures taken</li>
            <li>and I can see her skin clearing up, which is great for a 14 year old!!</li>
            <li>is all it says it is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been putting on a full face mask once a week since receiving this product &amp; my skin feels amazing &amp; is clearer.&lt;br /&gt;Fewer</li>
            <li>like most people are saying :) its basically a nice mask that leaves you with a fresh face feeling but isnt a miracle working solution.</li>
            <li>First the mask worked like all the good reviews and hype said it would.</li>
            <li>I feel like I could find things that work just as well for cheaper, but with the discounted price it is a pretty good purchase.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>Purchasing it from Amazon was also a good idea because if you get it at Sephora it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>This mask is very soothing and has a cooling tingle, and smells nice!</li>
            <li>First off, i loved it.</li>
            <li>the results are instant and amazing !!</li>
            <li>I recently ordered GLAMGLOW from amazon, and it is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep on for a full 20 minutes (even after it dries) and you will be amazed!</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!!</li>
            <li>This is Definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the splurge!!</li>
            <li>It is a bit spendy, BUT worth EVERY penny!!</li>
            <li>Its amazing really deep cleans your face and its great for spot treatments also .</li>
            <li>Clears up most breakouts very quickly.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product and does a good job cleaning your skin on a deep level.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>New favorite beauty product!!</li>
            <li>You can see immediate results and see the blackheads and pores being sucked clean!</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after using this treatment!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is also good at shrinking large or noticeable pores.  </li>
            <li>Very true to its hype.</li>
            <li>Glamglow is on the top of my list, and I love that you can SEE the dirt coming right out of your pores!</li>
            <li>Amazing product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is amazing and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mask it leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it primarily just on my nose and forehead, which are my problem-areas, and that seems to be working well. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it four times so far and each time I&#x27;m just as happy as the time before.</li>
            <li>but i love how it makes your skin feels smooth and blowy afterwards</li>
            <li>I have used this glamglow mask several times from Sephora samples and from friends, and it has been incredible for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Yes, my pores are diminished, but more importantly, my breakouts are gone.</li>
            <li>More importantly, I think it just isn&#x27;t the product for my skin type.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it has reduced my acne almost completely.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been pretty impressed  </li>
            <li>Really happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost of the treatment just to obtain the star spangled box - if you like that kind of thing.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>I liked this product as first glance, it smells nice and feels cool when put on your face.</li>
            <li>But they are both good products and buying them off of Amazon is much cheaper than Sephora.</li>
            <li>but it was good to try, but did not heal any of my existing pimples or really do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>Took the stubborn blackheads right off my face...worth the price!!  </li>
            <li>The mask didn&#x27;t dry my face out which was surprising in a good way.</li>
            <li>Amazing product right here</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and it keeps my skin looking beautiful!</li>
            <li>The first time you use it, you can see the difference on your face, I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I bought the full size from Amazon!</li>
            <li>Really cool when it dries!</li>
            <li>but t significantly makes your skin look better.</li>
            <li>It is a more pricy mask but believe me it is seriously worth it!</li>
            <li>Other than that, i was very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>&quot; SO TRUE!</li>
            <li>out of my pores was so cool!  </li>
            <li>As of recently i&#x27;ve been using it as a spot treatment, and good lord almighty does it work!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really cool to see it working!</li>
            <li>I love how clean my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite scent, but masks aren&#x27;t really there to smell amazing.</li>
            <li>It is easy to spread on and to wash off.  </li>
            <li>Whereas I just like to keep my face clean and blemish free, not to mention youthful!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>Easy rince off with water.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This product is pretty great, I noticed a difference within the first use.</li>
            <li>wow I really was impressed with this mask.</li>
            <li>And I love seeing my pores clean themselves out.</li>
            <li>but when I compared this product to one that I had bought at sephora, it did not smell as strong, or have a seal.</li>
            <li>It has a strong eucalyptus smell that reminds me of the coast of Northern California.</li>
            <li>loved it when I first used it &amp; thought it was so cool that you could see the places where it was working</li>
            <li>Very cool to see the stuff that comes out of your pores float to the surface - leaves skin smooth immediately after,</li>
            <li>Well this stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it my skin had an amazing glow....</li>
            <li>Amazing resutls from the first use</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full retail price for this.</li>
            <li>I liked this product from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it on Amazon instead of paying full price for it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it i saw a noticeable difference in the size of my pores and i really liked the tingling sensation it gives.</li>
            <li>We leave it on for the full 20 minutes and you will see the stuff that comes out of your pores pooling on top of the mud.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this on its own -</li>
            <li>I really liked the product at first</li>
            <li>This makes it the perfect mask to do right before an important event, such as a wedding or a presentation.</li>
            <li>It is so amazing my skin is more clear and softer after one time!!</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as fine as I would like</li>
            <li>In reality, when I started applying it, the product was light and easily spreadable.</li>
            <li>Everything seemed fine until I opened it and tried to use it</li>
            <li>My husband is always like... \\&quot;wow that&#x27;s cool, but I don&#x27;t understand how it works\\&quot;, lol.</li>
            <li>it was fine.</li>
            <li>My skin looks like fine porcelain.  </li>
            <li>I love Glam Glow Super Mud Clearing Treatmeat.</li>
            <li>so it might work people with more mild acne?</li>
            <li>For reference i&#x27;m a teenager with mild acne, mostly whiteheads along my cheeks and chin and neck...</li>
            <li>My skin is bright and clear!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing has a slight minty smell and just feels so great on your skin.</li>
            <li>Works great and clears up my skin and makes it super soft in just a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>Read many reviews about how amazing this product was, and decided to try it, while silently praying it truly worked because it is very pricey..let me tell you it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My skin is still so smooth and bright, and it feels very soft.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, I wish they made large portions that don&#x27;t cost a million dollars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been blessed with nice skin, and have always had issues with large pores and a little redness, even despite my best efforts.</li>
            <li>After the very first use I could see (and feel!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little better than a grocery store clay mask, but not so much better as to warrant the greatly elevated price.</li>
            <li>Everywhere I put this &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34;, huge spots of acne emerged.</li>
            <li>Noticed a huge difference in the apparence of my blackheads after 1 use.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re all huge fans.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my complexion.</li>

            <li>Overall great product, I&#x27;m seeing improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t require much to render amazing results.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using the product.</li>
            <li>I use this product as a spot treatment primarily now, in an effort to conserve the mud/cream.</li>
            <li>I read about this product for months on various blogs and heard nothing but great things.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great product just wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li>works well leaving my face smooth and refreshed with</li>
            <li>It does make your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the size of the product would be worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I hoped for the best but anticipated a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Overall a great mask to incorporate into my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin does glow with a fresh flush after using.  </li>
            <li>Once you wash it off, your skin feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Really fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Pores are minimized and face looks so smooth.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH AND HAVE NOTICED ANY BLACKHEADS HAVE DIMINISHED.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing about this product that is worth more than $10.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>and you get 2 packets of each type of glamglow, also the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried the supermud, and it makes your skin feel great, but not a miracle treatment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this has gotten such great reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap, so I didn&#x27;t want to pay the Sephora prices, but I was a bit hesitant to buy this from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is such a great mask..</li>
            <li>It smells great, like I was getting a facial at a spa.  </li>
            <li>After each use my face feels refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes the $$ more worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to know that a clearing mask WILL cause you to break out in a day or two.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works nicely and you can really see it pulling the gunk out of your pores.</li>
            <li>Probably better off just buying the real thing at Sephora for $10 dollars more.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My daughter has had really good results with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>My face feels super clean, smooth and tighter!</li>
            <li>I have always had larger pores on my nose and blackheads and after reading so many good reviews on this product and a friend&#x27;s recommendation, I decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it one star is because it smells good and feels refreshing when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>My face feels super clean after applying and rinsing, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Worth the price, face became very smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li>It gets a lot of the gunk out right away and, after continued use, my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li>the gunk out of your pores&amp;#34; and being able to see the stuff coming out right before your eyes.</li>
            <li>overall a great well worth buy!</li>
            <li>If you use the full face application as opposed to the spot treatment option it runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Super-Mud has a pleasant fragrance, which is barely noticeable -</li>
            <li>Overall I am in LOVE with GLAMGLOW!!</li>
            <li>It is very useful.</li>
            <li>Its great to see all the circles of cleaned out pores on your face and the way it leaves your skin after, super soft and vibrant -- AMAZINGGGGG!!!</li>
            <li>Seller sent product quickly and it arrived in perfect condition for less then what I would have paid if I had gone to the store to purchase it.</li>
            <li>The only kind of acne it doesn&#x27;t seem to drastically help is cystic acne, but otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many high end products including philosophy microderm and kinerase, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It starts to make my skin feel very tight while I&#x27;m using it, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference after the first time like many people had said.</li>
            <li>and it would always leave my face feeling clean and so so smooth.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly at minimizing your pores (which is the main reason I wanted to try it)</li>
            <li>Used about 12 times makes your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Ordering &amp; delivery quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it&#x27;s like a magic wand, and kinda gross how much oil it absorbs but really good for skin.</li>
            <li>I loved it, but they need to find a better container to put this in so it doesn&#x27;t dry out and get all crusty.</li>
            <li>Overall though, flippin&#x27; amazing!</li>
            <li>It is a good product and it makes my skin smooth and clear, but is it worth spending almost $50 dollars for it?</li>
            <li>when i received mine it was water downed and not like the original one you buy at Sephora</li>
            <li>What I will tell you is that I am VERY pleased and surprised at the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An examination with a 10x mirror showed no whiteheads and significantly shrunken pores.</li>
            <li>Benonite is significantly cheaper and has works wonders.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this after reading all the glowing reviews</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>but I was too excited to care</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I have pretty healthy skin</li>
            <li>I love this mask so much!</li>
            <li>I notice when I do my pours look smaller, my skin feels better, and I look much better too!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this clearing treatment; however, it has done nothing for my skin any time I have used it.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine has the original GLAMGLOW mask (the tingling &amp; exfoliating one)</li>
            <li>My face looks like a post-apocalyptic hellscape every time I use this stuff, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not tried the product yet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s already used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just use the suggested amount and it will make your money worth it!</li>
            <li>Admittedly, the first time you use this you will see the most results.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>It took about two weeks of use (one use a week) for me to notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I use it weekly and would say its worth the tag!</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>She loved it and apparently her husband does too.</li>
            <li>I figured it was truly more hype than anything, but this really works well!</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>This is worth the price!</li>
            <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>My husband used a Biore blackhead strip, saw so much more of a result from the strip that this treatment (and much cheaper too!).  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this when I read about it online.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited for this product</li>
            <li>Not like the original.</li>
            <li>I am sure we are paying for the packaging that comes with the mask, because the info card is so pretty.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my glam glow</li>
            <li>I have samples of the original product from Sephora and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>When I got it I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed in the slightest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my blackheads have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this mask, my blackheads weren&#x27;t all cleared up, but most of them were to the surface</li>
            <li>This stuff is on the pricy side, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I was really excited after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with many, many products in my many years, and I have never seen one that made my pores visibly smaller!  </li>
            <li>Makes your face feel great, does not clear blackheads.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Worth having!</li>
            <li>Worth all the hype!</li>
            <li>The other mask by glam glow smells better, but I honestly think this one might be better for my skin.</li>
            <li>Yes, this mask is great and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or cause it to break out after use.</li>
            <li>Yes it will clean my skin well</li>
            <li>kind of late lol</li>
            <li>but it did make my skin super smooth after washing it off</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t help to clean my pores like it says and make my skin &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; after using it.</li>
            <li>the clean feel it leaves, but for the price I&#x27;m not blown away.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed, my skin hadn&#x27;t looked that clean in years.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after.</li>
            <li>and it eventually dawned on me that I should use toner after the mask to help clean out any mask residue in my pores.</li>
            <li>it gets the skin really clean</li>
            <li>i would not use more than 2-3 times a week (just because it may cause the skin to be more sensitive and increasing the chance of clogging up your pores.</li>
            <li>calcium bentonite clay available on amazon is far much effective than this and cost just 7 dollars and some cents for a pound.&lt;br /&gt;Further</li>
            <li>I ordered Glam Glow on a recommendation from a friend, as I was looking for a beauty product that would help clean out and shrink my pores as well as address the &amp;#34;orange</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, plus it smells natural and great!</li>
            <li>wanted this to clean out the pores on my T.zone and close them up.</li>
            <li>Gives your face a really clean feeling in just 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really clean out my pores as well as Biore.  </li>
            <li>They also make a matching cleanser that literally makes your skin feel so clean once you use it.  </li>
            <li>It just makes your skin feel so clean and toned and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>There should be a foil safety seal, sealing your product and keeping it clean and moist.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product, it is soft and light yet effective.</li>
            <li>I used a clean foundation brush to apply it.</li>
            <li>It put my pores clean up.</li>
            <li>lets just say my face was not as clean as I thought it was..</li>
            <li>but after I wiped it clean</li>
            <li>Not to mention my skin felt incredibly clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The shipping was excellent,  even though it was standard, it still came early.</li>
            <li>I apply this mask to my clean face, let it sit for 15-20 mins, and rinse.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would clean out and shrink my pores like it claimed, but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all.</li>
            <li>My skin did not looked like my pores where all sucked clean.</li>
            <li>after using it it leaves my face smooth, and it does give me a nice glow but as far as clearing up acne and blackheads this product just did not work for me.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2. smells very natural with a nice fragrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mask, pretty straight forward but the best thing about these tutorials is that these girls wear makeup regularly.</li>
            <li>Lush sells a chocolate mask for way cheaper and works better!</li>
            <li>and my skin is clear and smooth!!</li>
            <li>My skin was very smooth after using the mask, but I didn&#x27;t really see the oils being &amp;#34;sucked&amp;#34; out of my skin as I&#x27;ve seen this product advertised.</li>
            <li>Having paid full price elsewhere the first time, I was very happy to find it for less on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it doesnt seem too special too me.</li>
            <li>As it is, the ingredients list doesn&#x27;t have anything really special.</li>
            <li>Not anything special.</li>
            <li>but what makes this one special is the tightness that it gives your face along with a glow</li>
            <li>My problem is large pores and blackheads that I have never been able to get rid of no matter what I try.</li>
            <li>Biore sells special &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; strips for this purpose.</li>
            <li>I purchased it right away, I think I found my miracle!</li>
            <li>so i moisturize right away!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soo smooth after the first use!</li>
            <li>It seems to dry the acne out and while it doesn&#x27;t go away quickly, it seems to greatly diminish its appearance over night.  </li>
            <li>, you can see it working, and your skin will feel smooth, clean, and fresh after.  </li>
            <li>At first when it arrived, although in great time, I suspect it had been opened before and quite possibly used.  </li>
            <li>When I was washing it off my face began burning and turned bright red.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin SO soft and it has an amazing texture.</li>
            <li>Works pretty darn good, makes your skin soft and clears out your pores.</li>
            <li>You know, the product wasn&#x27;t as a great as I expected.</li>
            <li>product is what expected and did everything that I wanted to do and no problems with shipping and just great with product</li>
            <li>To buy friends, she said after the use super good, show me the photo works, the black head on nose less, she is very happy, when discounted buy price is cheap</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I have had no issues with sensitivity and my face is always calm and smooth after a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>My advice: buy clay for health and beauty from a natural pharmacy and make your own mask.</li>
            <li>hey if its good enough for Hollywood, its good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I use this as a full mask once a week and do spot treatments during the week.</li>
            <li>I will buy from this seller again when I need more, thank you soooo much.</li>
            <li>and you could absolutely tell where I had put on the product for many hours after its use.</li>
            <li>I thought, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not going to be this magical cure-all mud that makes your problem skin vanish overnight.&amp;#34; And it wasn&#x27;t, but it does its job very well.</li>
            <li>This formula definitely stirs things up under your skin but in a good way.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got lucky or if they decided to stop opening the containers but mine came sealed and clean and in the cutest packaging.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that the hype is all true.</li>
            <li>My favorite mask in the whole world</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool because you can SEE it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product goes on cool and tingly.</li>
            <li>This stuff really seems to work better than any product I have used.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product because it really cleans out your pores.</li>
            <li>more if you really want to use charcoal for face pack one can buy charcoal capsules and make a facepack out of that.</li>
            <li>this was a good product and you definitely feel it working</li>
            <li>I purchased GlamGlow after hearing rave reviews but did not want to pay full price.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit off and does not work like the true glam glow mask.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>It looks cool when it dries but why pay just for that.</li>
            <li>my face is softer and super clean</li>
            <li>This mask works best if you use it at least 3 days a week.  </li>
            <li>You can see all the oil in your pores being extracted from your skin, and it&#x27;s kinda cool and gross.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite products, highly recommend !</li>
            <li>When I got it,, it almost full out</li>
            <li>I have done two full masks two or three days apart, and twice I have used it as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>When I tried it I absolutely loved it, my face felt smoother, pores were instantly smaller</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel super clean.</li>
            <li>After receiving a pre-opened, pre-used product, I drove my butt to Sephora and bought one at full price.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous face mask, worth every</li>
            <li>My face always feel super clean after I use it, but</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it, but after the second and third time I was even more impressed.</li>
            <li>I have used as a spot treatment and full mask.</li>
            <li>and they are all true.</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up my skin and give it a nice radiant glow.  </li>
            <li>and it really seemed to improve the vibrance of my skin and make my (recently more noticeable) pores appear</li>
            <li>It also goes a good job at clearing up my pores and making them appear smaller.</li>
            <li>Either way, I won&#x27;t buy from Amazon again and will just pay full price at Sephora.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and cant really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>- I suppose it&#x27;s an ok mask, but don&#x27;t expect to be really wowed.</li>
            <li>I will order from Sephora where it is for sure the real thing.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have to do a full mask</li>
            <li>(yes it comes in the cool box)</li>
            <li>Product probably works really well for most people.  </li>
            <li>gone!!!!I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should spend so much on a product if I didn&#x27;t know how it work because on the website it was about $70 and when I saw it on here I had to get it.</li>
            <li>Even though it was kind of gross to see how much oil was being drawn from my skin, I liked to see that it was working so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Have it to two other friends as a birthday gift and they were super happy with it and felt it was original.</li>
            <li>Works great on black heads,  leaves the skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty cool!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Washing the mask off was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It is strong when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Compared to borghese&#x60;s fango, this one is more gentle, and as fresh and clean as&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many other reviews the scent is very appealing and the mask does</li>
            <li>Lets just say all the hype is true but then again it may not be all that great to other people.</li>
            <li>For the price, I make sure to save it for only the most special occasions.</li>
            <li>I had read other reviews where people experienced break outs after use.</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazing after the first use and I&#x27;ve used it a couple more times since then over the last week.</li>
            <li>i rather pay a little more at sephora to receive good quality.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet tried using it as a preventative measure since the cost is pretty high, but am LOVING it as a spot treatment after my skin has flared up.  </li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve figured what I&#x27;d get for the price but the real product is worth it!!</li>
            <li>Glam glow leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Your skin feel clean and fresh after .</li>
            <li>It looks fresh squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The feeling afterwards is CLEAN &amp; FRESH.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly through the mail and provider who sent it so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>and I quickly forgot about it as it got lost in my sample abyss.</li>
            <li>I WILL GET MY MORE BACK :)</li>
            <li>you can actually see it pulling the oil and gunk out of your pores, which is simultaneously gross and awesome.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and was hoping that GlamGlow would rid that</li>
            <li>but it should&#x27;ve come in that condition while it&#x27;s listed as \\&quot;New.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY FROM \\&quot;SUPER</li>
            <li>Likely to order 1 more time because of price in hopes of better results this time</li>
            <li>I bought from Super Deals</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel super clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I use that and the mask once a week and my acne reduces tremendously and so does the redness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product,  though it is very pricy , it is worth every dime.</li>
            <li>Once u rinse your face it feels super clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I try lots of beauty products and rarely am impressed enough to purchase a second jar of anything.  </li>
            <li>super shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews for Glam Glow Super Mud all over the web, including Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had something work so effectively, so QUICKLY on my skin.</li>
            <li>It has reduced my scarring and helped my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li>It truly works and clears your skin quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice and tight and really clean looking once I&#x27;m done washing my face!!</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended for ANYONE to use to get a healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong and strange kind of aroma to it</li>
            <li>It has lactic acid and 3 other very effective acids in it.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin beautiful and super tight (like radiant baby skin) but is it worth it?</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the purchase, the future will continue to buy</li>
            <li>overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>On the very first use I noticed change in my face</li>
            <li>After the very first use I noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products but this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this in the mail, and more pleased when i actually used the product the first time.</li>
            <li>Makes my face so smooth and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I have normal, healthy skin</li>
            <li>I have only used it three times, but so far, so good!  </li>
            <li>Works super fast and brings blackheads to the surface!!</li>
            <li>i used it it dry on my face quickly and i dont feel good</li>
            <li>this is a great price compared to other stores!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how great my skin looked and other members of my family were begging me to let them use it too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and am happy to report that she&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li>Better price than Sephora and brand new.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product, I read the amazing reviews and it just seemed too good to be true, but let me tell you, its true!</li>
            <li>Works great for black heads.</li>
            <li>Got a great price on this product (half what I saw it else where)</li>
            <li>more than that it really zaps pimples fast!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and definitely after using it, you will notice your skin is soft and clean feeling however</li>
            <li>When I got it, the seal was leaking a bit, but it seemed more like this is just a small company without a good packaging process yet.  </li>
            <li>I freaking love this product, after one use all of my blackheads were pretty much</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t see much difference with my nose pores !!</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not lookin&#x27; too hot!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I first saw this product on pinterest and was excited to try.  </li>
            <li>However after my first application I decided I was still excited.</li>
            <li>So I was extremely excited to try this for the first time and when I washed it off my face....</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this mask, and the fact that amazon has it at such a discounted price is incredible, but I have to say it&#x27;s really not worth the price for</li>
            <li>and I did not get the first order!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to try this product!!!</li>
            <li>I needed a miracle and glamglow consistently comes through!</li>
            <li>I listened to all the reviews I had read- the first time you use this product you will be grossed out!</li>
            <li>It makes my face super soft, which i love.</li>
            <li>I found that the less I used the more effective it seemed to be.</li>
            <li>love it made my skin super soft</li>
            <li>GlamGlow is a little too proud of themselves.</li>
            <li>This cost so much in the stores and it seems odd to me that this seller can get such a great deal on this to be able to sell it to so many people.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling so clean, fresh and really helps with acne and acne scars!</li>
            <li>It is fascinating to watch the oil seep through and turn the mask dark, and it does wash off clean.</li>
            <li>additionally I didn&#x27;t notice any significant positive results.</li>
            <li>it makes my face super soft, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Works great, even pulled blackheads and stubborn white heads out with a few applications, also makes skin feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>I had heard from friends that this mask was amazing and it definitely exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see anything all that fantastic happen.</li>
            <li>After getting a sample from Sephora (That I got three uses out of, for free) I was ready to purchase.</li>
            <li>Glamglow itself is an amazing product, but this one was very obviously tampered with.</li>
            <li>You can SEE what it gets out of your pores, and its gross but also amazing.</li>
            <li>such a shame that although it was an amazing price it was an expired product BYE FELICIA</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews on this amazing product before I finally purchased a jar.</li>
            <li>In fact, I used it as a spot treatment on someone else to unclog a really clogged pore and it worked fabulously.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $60 price tag.</li>
            <li>my skin looks fresh</li>
            <li>It felt nice enough</li>
            <li>Worth its weight in GOLD.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny-</li>
            <li>The product itself is pricey but TOTALLY WORTH</li>
            <li>Overall I liked it but don&#x27;t know if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming or unbearable and I am particularly sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li>Im thrilled that someone I found on the internet actually did what it said it was supposed to!  </li>
            <li>You can see the oil being absorbed out of your pores.</li>
            <li>I have clear skin for the most part</li>
            <li>NOTTTTT worth it.  </li>
            <li>I always feel fresh and glowing after I use this mask</li>
            <li>When I take the mask off, my skin looks fresh and glowy for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>Product was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>My skin is more clear with a mud mask from Walmart .</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of make up and rarely go without anything on my face.</li>
            <li>and it will give me a nice refreshed skin the next day.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked this mud mask.</li>
            <li>id say it cleared my pores about 60% which is still pretty good and makes a pretty big difference.</li>
            <li>The instructions do say that it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li>I have to say, that this product is WORTH it.</li>
            <li>But the smell is worth the results.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but idk if it is worth them money.</li>
            <li>I noticed that there were distinct holes where my pores are</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>So far we&#x27;ve been pleased with he results.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I used it as soon as I got out of the shower when my pores were nice and open, immediately after I washed my face with the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cash</li>
            <li>but overall its a really great product to help clear your skin, and make your face tighter.</li>
            <li>The only bummer is that my face is so smooth afterward, I just want to keep touching it</li>
            <li>I think this stuff, while pricey, is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>So far, I experienced any dryness, but again, I only have used on my problem areas.</li>
            <li>Everything came sealed and was fresh.</li>
            <li>I liked this item well enough to order more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>FOR  THE $$; YOU CAN HOLD THIS JAR IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND AND WASN&#x27;T WORTH THE $50!!!&lt;br /&gt;BAD</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh after I wash it off.</li>
            <li>Honestly it wash about the same as any mud mask except it smelt like licorice.</li>
            <li>so I could use it more frequently.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Im verrrrry oily and so far your able to see all the oils and dirt being sucked out of your pores.</li>
            <li>BUT, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the hype</li>
            <li>Fun for a mud mask party with friends.</li>
            <li>It is pricey but totallllly worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to see that it&#x27;s actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost all of this stuff already, and it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>However, it is fun to use and it feels like its working.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I already think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T LAUGH.</li>
            <li>I was so hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints, definitely worth the $$</li>
            <li>I know this is on the pricier side, but trust me, it is worth.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Rarely do I post reviews, but this product needed one.</li>
            <li>I have naturally nice skin (I never break out), but I have a big problem with clogged pores and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>but if I&#x27;m honest, the results are short lived.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross to watch the impurities get pulled out of your pores.  </li>
            <li>Also, looks pretty cool when you have the specs all over your face.</li>
            <li>product is definitely worth the money - I probably get about 10 treatments per jar.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin supet soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>What I love about this:  when you rinse it off, your skin is SO soft.  </li>
            <li>and I was so so happy to find it here for HALF of that!</li>
            <li>I wanted it to live up to the hype of being the best facial product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that is just too much pressure to live up to.</li>
            <li>I have super super oily skin with large pores</li>
            <li>Ive used other maska before and never seem such awesome results!</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin feeling nice and smooth (like any other mud mask would do), but it doesn&#x27;t pull anything from your pores.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after the first use I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but 24 hours later there was a visible difference, and after a second use a couple days later my skin looked even better.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Glamglow Super Mud is a real treat!</li>
            <li>But it dries pretty quick</li>
            <li>While I liked the product just fine, I do not think this is a cure-all for large pores, though, and I will likely not be splurging again, as many masks can give you similar results.</li>
            <li>Other than that a good product.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to see significantly diminished blackheads around my nose and truthfully, I can&#x27;t really see that there is any difference in that respect at all.</li>
            <li>There is truly no comparing this to other masks, it&#x27;s that good. ...</li>
            <li>I wanted to be excited about it, I really did.</li>
            <li>I think I was just too excited to try it out to really notice or think anything fishy of it.</li>
            <li>It does everything it says it will, left my pores noticeably smaller, my face super smooth and bright.  </li>
            <li>, tried for about a month now, i have to say, this is the best mud mask i have ever try, I have a lot of stubborn black and white heads, and glamglow help me clear most of those out after 4-5 times use.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and glowing and super soft after every use!</li>
            <li>so I use it more often and use the GlamGlow when going to special events and such.</li>
            <li>I thought this was some miracle product that would suck the ick right out of my pores...</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>My skin felt softer right after I used it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like I can feel it working right away.</li>
            <li>I was my brush right after the mask is applied</li>
            <li>Turns out, the critics were right.</li>
            <li>I had to go to the doctor right away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To see how well this mask drew impurities to the surface, I used a pore strip right after.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you right now this mask is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is right and the product works.</li>
            <li>I like how it feels right after I use it.  </li>
            <li>It literally pulls the JUNK out from your pores and shrinks your pores right up.</li>
            <li>It works well though and brings all impurities right to your skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li>right in the store.</li>
            <li>I had to take it off right away because the smell was so horrid, and I washed my face three times afterwards until I couldn&#x27;t smell the foul odor anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more effective than the products I have bought at walmart, because those had no effect what so ever, but this had a very little to no effect as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really helped minimize my pores so my skin looks smoothe and clean.</li>
            <li>on normal skin, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>People have commented on the smell, and I am a person who is very sensitive to smells, I get headaches if cosmetics or fragrances are too strong.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitiant at first because of the price, but I am so glad I decided to buy this stuff!!</li>
            <li>to watch it dry and see all of the oil being pulled out of your pores - it&#x27;s satisfying to see it working!</li>
            <li>I got trouble and combination skin type, I feel good after using it, it helps clean pretty well.</li>
            <li>in my opinion this is nothing of special it didn&#x27;t really solve any problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does do what it says, nice glow and super soft skin, but I think I would only use this product for special occasions.</li>
            <li>mud mask does an amazing job of pull out your black heads, impurities and just making your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, before I&#x27;ve finished applying it to my entire face in most cases.</li>
            <li>I do this mask as a weekly ritual and a more mild mask mid week.</li>
            <li>so I ordered a full size straight away.</li>
            <li>My skin continues to look better and better: skin tone is evening out, pores are much smaller, overall my face looks significantly \\&quot;healthier.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I do not use it very often, it is pretty strong, but when I need it, it really does the job.</li>
            <li>I just wish the container was a little bit better with more product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, it&#x27;s amazing for blackheads and generally clearing up your face.</li>
            <li>Mine weren&#x27;t as prevalent as I thought I guess because I already take such good care of my face, but when I washed it off I could immediately tell that it did indeed get a good deep down clean inside my pores.</li>
            <li>I have large pores, well, not anymore!</li>
            <li>Works amazing, doesn&#x27;t dry my face out at all</li>
            <li>I am hoping, over time, it will be more lasting but even if it isn&#x27;t it is well worth the effort and the cost.</li>
            <li>The whole point is to clear that stuff out, not add more.</li>
            <li>i apply the mask after cleansing my face with warm water and patting dry.</li>
            <li>It absolutely cleared out and tightened my pores and left my skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After washing off the mask, my skin was super clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I paid $20 less and arrived in good condition through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It a nice mask, but does not live up to any of the claims made about it on the internet.</li>
            <li>It has done absolutely nothing for my enlarged pores, which was my main reason for buying this product!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gross how much oil you can literally see it sucking out of your face, but amazing how much it will reduce the size of your pores once they become unclogged!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve never had skin so smooth and clear!</li>
            <li>I like how it makes your face feel tight and makes it feel good</li>
            <li>You do not have to use very much.  </li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, I expected this to be a great product!</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference after the first use and now my skin looks so clear!</li>
            <li>being said, a new, unopened jar of Glam Glow is my new favorite skin care item.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;SO, You really should try the sample first!</li>
            <li>but as I have gotten older I have developed a lot more dirt in my pores because of wearing make-up so often.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super cool and super gross all in one.</li>
            <li>As far as my breakouts, my skin looks better than it did in high school.</li>
            <li>Before I opened the box, I noticed that it was resealed with a new sticker on top of the original seal and when I opened the jar there was product already on the outside of the seal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the aztec healing clay mask, which a lot of people claim to be better, but I feel like they are both essential to my routine.</li>
            <li>Along with the after photos of how clear and smooth my skin had become.  </li>
            <li>and I really wished it lived up to it!</li>
            <li>I love it and only plan on using it once a week or so.</li>
            <li>Love it - definitely that coolest mask I have ever done.</li>
            <li>mask has remained consistent at thoroughly cleaning out my pores and reducing my blackheads.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re skeptical, this is a great price for this product, just try it!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try it and bought it when the price dropped, but I&#x27;d say even then it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>your skin so soft and smooth, minimizes pores, really brings the oils out!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>It works so well and leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>If they would properly grind the powder it would be easier to apply and it would probably release more of the beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was to purchase this again, it would be from a reputable retailer such as Sephora.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any allergies that I&#x27;m aware of either.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>Help clear up and smooth your face.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>First time for using it.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says its going to do.</li>
            <li>I first bought it at Sephora but found it cheaper here</li>
            <li>I may try twice a week at first</li>
            <li>It can feel like burning at first  </li>
            <li>I got a sample from Sephora first and it lasted me 3 uses</li>
            <li>but this product shows how oily it really is!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered the smaller one to try it out first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product twice (at an interval of three days apart), but I already am in love.</li>
            <li>First, it is pricey.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it too often, mostly once a month as a facial.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands and types of masks and this one makes such a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have problematic skin tbh, but I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement anyways!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to wonder if the product sold by this seller is even authentic.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li>Overall I am extremely pleased, I have been trying this out on all of my siblings and friends.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It cleans my face and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>When I first rated this mask, I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend this unless you plan on using the whole jar in a month!</li>
            <li>First time i tried it i thought, &amp;#34;MEH</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know Amazon was selling it for much cheaper so score!</li>
            <li>I purchased this through Neiman Marcus the first time and now will be purchasing online.</li>
            <li>Thanks GlamGlow !</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>The product was delievered fast!</li>
            <li>This mask is phenomenal, I have cystic acne which flares especially during my menstrual cycle after applying this mask it alleviates the redness and also pulls the bacteria from beneath my skin!!</li>
            <li>This has helped so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times, but I love how the product works.  </li>
            <li>so I made sure to put sunscreen on afterwards since I was headed outside.  </li>
            <li>So, this facial mask is ok.</li>
            <li>Besides that it shows your pores being cleaned out (Not a reason why I bought it, but it is horrying/cool), it really does work!</li>
            <li>Skin is noticeably clearer after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, I get the EXACT same results using my Indian Healing Clay (Bentonite Clay also sold on Amazon) with a greater return.</li>
            <li>Although the mask appears to work when you first put it on, i did not notice a decrease in blackheads or an increase in clearer pores.  </li>
            <li>However, I think I had higher hopes that it would pull the blackheads out and it does not.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I do think that it still works but just not as well as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had breakouts on and off most of my life and now I use this mask once per week, use a clarisonic brush twice per week with Cerave soap and get a facial once per month</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure how I would like this product, since I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand until recently.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I use this 2x a week and it has really helped with my acne!</li>
            <li>As for the product, it made me break out at first</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy again.</li>
            <li>Well, it absolutely does!</li>
            <li>I love face masks and have tried a bunch of different kinds.</li>
            <li>Tried a sample at Sephora for first time.</li>
            <li>This mask is giving her consistent results.  </li>
            <li>and I first bought it from Sephora.</li>
            <li>This product really cleans out your pores!</li>
            <li>First time no issues with product this time around product had been opened</li>
            <li>The product I was sent, however, was most definitely not it.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and consistency/texture of the product all seemed to be the same, but the product itself is nowhere near as good as the real glamglow mask.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper than in the store and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>When I run out, I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>and strange!&lt;br /&gt;It almost looked like tar when I opened the jar for the first time.</li>
            <li>First use for 20min</li>
            <li>Sadly it&#x27;s not the miracle mask we were all hoping for.  </li>
            <li>shipping was also really fast and affordable to Australia!</li>
            <li>I have been threw many products, this one I actually like.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face nice and soft, my pores appear smaller and it gives me a fresh face feeling.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I want to give it more time to see how the clearing effects work with my skin.</li>
            <li>I am Irish-Italian and have pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It looked exactly like it did when I put it on there.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m willing to hope against hope that maybe it&#x27;ll take some time to get those pores cleared out.</li>
            <li>When I got the product in the mail, my first reaction was that the packaging is WAY oversized for the amount of product you receive...CARBON FOOTPRINT.</li>
            <li>Some of the spots continue to get bigger as more oil is sucked out from your skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels baby soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>The seal is for sure different.</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>It smells like liquorice which I don&#x27;t like so much but the benefits of the mask is totally worth the smell.</li>
            <li>definitely don&#x27;t spend more than $30-something to try this.</li>
            <li>since trying this, I finally got in with my dermatologist again and am on a legit prescription regimen that is working better.</li>
            <li>When this product goes on it feels fresh on your skin, maybe from the minty smell, and when it hardens it really shows all your pores.</li>
            <li>or if I just want my skin to look extra healthy for an event or something.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted for cheaper then department store prices.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this, my pores looks bigger and got some more acne. :</li>
            <li>The second day I used it and then used a nose strip and got a LOT more stuff out than using the nose strip alone.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to buy it at first because of the price.</li>
            <li>have only used it once and already see and feel a notable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>After using the mask exactly as directed, all of those characteristics amplified.</li>
            <li>My skin was slicker, more red, as though I was constantly blushing, and I had more spots than before.</li>
            <li>Not to be gross, but I get lots of satisfaction out of being able to see the product working (aka the gunk getting sucked out of my pores).</li>
            <li>and the next morning her skin already looked clearer and had a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Kinda gross, but better out than in ;)</li>
            <li>It works exactly how it says it should.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does exactly what it says (for me anyways)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry if you break out the first 2 times you use it...</li>
            <li>pretty goods,i will buy it again</li>
            <li>I would buy again if I wasn&#x27;t broke ;)</li>
            <li>pretty good;therefore</li>
            <li>I took the risk of getting something tampered or fake for the price, but it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>First off it has never done the &amp;#34;pulling out&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Definitely, I look energetic after i use it.</li>
            <li>I rarely give 5 Stars, but GlamGlow Super-Mud absolutely earned all 5 of them.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>The first time i used it</li>
            <li>when you first out it on</li>
            <li>Pretty sure that this is not legit as the foil seal is definitely different than the official package that I got from Sephora.</li>
            <li>So you will look like some creature from the blue lagoon wannabe when using this - but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>It smells like exactly what it is - mud rubbed on your face.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried everything like me to get rid of blackheads, this mask will most likely not work for you!  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I would not purchase again simply because this is a high price when I feel like there are many equally effective products available for so much less.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and clear after each use!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very glad I could find it on Amazon for half the price especially not being totally in love with it.</li>
            <li>Today it finally arrived, I am very excited to try it out for the first time.</li>
            <li>good for black heads !</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and breakout for any thing, this product has help me so much!!!</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!</li>
            <li>My skin gets oily and very dry-- both very easily.  </li>
            <li>okay, it did reduce some size of pimples and seemed to open up my pores, but it certainly didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34; out blackheads.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice cooling feeling while you have it on, maybe due to the eucalyptus in it?</li>
            <li>I was super excited and I was telling all my friends about it and when it finally came in the mail I wanted to try it immediately</li>
            <li>The third time, when I removed the product my skin was bright red</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling soft, hydrated and amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am happy, and just ordered another one as my last one is almost empty.</li>
            <li>The only amazing thing about this product is how soft your skin gets when you wash it off.</li>
            <li>It gave my face a clean feeling after use, but it didn&#x27;t clear all the blackheads.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel so soft and so clean</li>
            <li>this product makes my face feel so soft &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>helps keep my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I complained to the seller about the product burning my face and the best they can do is give me &amp;#34;up to&amp;#34; 50% of my money back, as per their policy, and I have to pay for the return shipping.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my pores are definitely a ton smaller after using this a couple of times per week, and my skin looks really good.</li>
            <li>but I could feel my skin fresh after removing with the warm water once dried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and buy from a reputable place where I know I am getting the real deal.</li>
            <li>also use this on my back (followed by a sand scrub) for the beach season or before wearing a low-back dress because it really makes the skin look clean/bright with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>The chin acne that I&#x27;ve never been able to fully clear up as an adult is clearing.</li>
            <li>GlamGlow has helped clear them out &amp; give me soft and smooth skin!  </li>
            <li>i love this mask, even though it smells not very good, but i love the result, it really help to refresh my skin</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and pretty large pores, and this mask works for me.</li>
            <li>skin definitely feels clean after use!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, dries quickly and my skin felt smooth and not dried out as other clay masks tend to make it feel.  </li>
            <li>This product is probably fantastic and you would be better off spending the extra money and buying it directly from Sephora to ensure that the product is indeed new.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>This product is pretty cool, you can see the stuff it vacuums out of your pores but it doesn&#x27;t really pull the crud out completely.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>First use of this product will have you embarrassed at how much dirt lies within your pores.</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it, i could see how much clearer my skin was.</li>
            <li>The first day it got here (and shipping was fast)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the visual results, but have to be care when applying due to the harden chuncks.</li>
            <li>The product arrived, I opened the container, and there was about an inch long SLIT in the tamper resistant top.</li>
            <li>I had heard about it on pinterest.com and was so interested in whether or not it really worked.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this for the first time because when I was browsing at Sephora another customer absolutely raved about using this as a spot treatment for breakouts.  </li>
            <li>and I love it to much thank you so much I will buy it again in the future</li>
            <li>Nice size jar, but not worth the money.</li>
            <li>and after I do notice my skin is softer, but honestly this product is really not worth it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t work for Biore--this is seriously the best method if you want to get rid off gross dug in blackheads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in this particular product for a while, but never took the plunge to buy it because it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very dry and sensitive skin, with some stubborn areas that I break out in, but this mask felt very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Amazon definitely had it cheaper than most other outlets (reputable outlets</li>
            <li>This is such a cool mask!</li>
            <li>It made it feel fresh and new.</li>
            <li>Does dry out skin though so it cant be used more than once or twice a week depending on how sensative your skin is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping adding this to my skin are regimen will completely change my now apparent aging skin for the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping adding this to my skin are regimen will completely change my now apparent aging skin for the better.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this, I had very realistic expectations.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by it being dry, keep it on, that&#x27;s when the magic happens.</li>
            <li>Makes skin super soft</li>
            <li>super clear and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;our</li>
            <li>My own opinion is save yourself some bucks and stick with the products that cost less.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling super soft and looking radiant.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I&#x27;m very upset for paying so much for a product that did nothing the first 2 times of using it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy more since it isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>The inner jar and product still looked full and fresh.</li>
            <li>Not dramatic.</li>
            <li>I figured it was just another mask that wouldn&#x27;t do anything special since she didn&#x27;t hype it up too much, only said it was a hit right now.</li>
            <li>I read a LOT of the reviews, and couldn&#x27;t wait to see the oil being pulled from my large pores.</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>so I just use it on certain spots that pop up and leave it overnight.  </li>
            <li>Because it changes color in certain places when it dries, I can tell that it works.</li>
            <li>The large pores on my nose are shrinking.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores.</li>
            <li>but I have large pores.  </li>
            <li>and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and they seem.</li>
            <li>I was very eager to try this product from all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product but as usual am always skeptical when it comes to anything that sounds this great...</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about purchasing this product because it sounded almost too good to be true, but it lived up to the hype!</li>
            <li>I love facial masks, and trying new products that I hear about, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super sad that I can&#x27;t use this as I&#x27;ve read some really great reviews out there.</li>
            <li>favorite part of the product is how my skin gets so much softer after a single use.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it once, it left my skin feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li>but everything seems to be fine although i suspected the jar had been open because of the residue on the lid.</li>
            <li>She has tried other face masks in the past, but believes that this is the best one!</li>
            <li>Also pretty decent at removing blackheads.</li>
            <li>sure, it smells a bit strong (not sure why they had to add perfume), but it works!</li>
            <li>I know the price can seem high, but compared to prescription products which are also pricy, or cycling through cheaper products that don&#x27;t work, this seems pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strictly going to purchase this at Sephora and open it for the very first time by ME!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be any more effective than any number of other masks/treatments that I&#x27;ve purchased for much less money.</li>
            <li>This product really targets pores and leaves skin feeling soft and looking fresh.</li>
            <li>Inside the huge hexagonal box is a tiny jar.</li>
            <li>It removes easily and rinses away cleanly without too much harsh scrubbing.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try it after reading a few amazing reviews.  </li>
            <li>These product was more than expected &amp; I would highly recommend to others (and I do)!</li>
            <li>It has made such a huge difference in quality of skin.</li>
            <li>The box is huge, but the product buried inside is tiny.  </li>
            <li>The box the product comes in, is huge compared to the actual product itself.</li>
            <li>REALLY DRAWS OUT</li>
            <li>and this really helps balance everything out.</li>
            <li>I have a sister, so I didn&#x27;t really care if someone else tested it out.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>my daughter loves it and much cheaper than getting it at Sephora</li>
            <li>/&gt;i do not have severe acne or really oily skin</li>
            <li>I bought this really hoping it would get rid of my blackheads.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping ,I like this mask</li>
            <li>I still have gotten acne from this and expected better result.</li>
            <li>very good,my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>It smells very herbal and licorice-like.</li>
            <li>Wish I have been using this my whole life.  </li>
            <li>Ive used it twice for whole face masks</li>
            <li>and I would say its very comparable to this GlamGlow.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference, but my friend who recommend the product did see a difference in my skin .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if this mask worked at all</li>
            <li>Really makes the skin glow.</li>
            <li>but this gets much deeper.  </li>
            <li>This really reduces the oil production.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant about this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally very oily, so of course I&#x27;m a pessimist in thinking anything could get rid of the oil AND blackheads all in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I thought for some reason that it would expel whiteheads from your pores, but it doesn&#x27;t do that, haha.</li>
            <li>It really just soaks all of the oils out of your pores.</li>
            <li>Even great for spot treatment for broken out areas, zits.  </li>
            <li>It really works just like</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying from Sephora.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I am really allergic to something in this mask.</li>
            <li>that* fast.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t taken much care of your skin</li>
            <li>Thought I cleansed my face very well</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m left with skin that feels just as smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Personally, I really like it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s twice as much</li>
            <li>Thank you so so so much.</li>
            <li>Please, go to Sephora and get the real product and save your money/heartache.</li>
            <li>Really does the job.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I can really see and feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I read rave reviews on this and for the price i expected much more.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment too,</li>
            <li>nothing I&#x27;ve tried before has really made a difference.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li>This is a must for anyone that really likes to monitor and keep up with their skin care.</li>
            <li>I really thought this was my answer</li>
            <li>really like the smell of the mask.</li>
            <li>for the &amp;#34;shrinks pores&amp;#34; statement on this it really isn&#x27;t going to cause your pores to shrink.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask because</li>
            <li>its really cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>husband has really oily skin</li>
            <li>It will not get rid of acne and fix your skin that much</li>
            <li>The box says that these are the spots where the mask is absorbing dirt and oils from your pores.</li>
            <li>I apply the product with a spare foundation brush which really helps limit the amount of product you use.</li>
            <li>I want to know if I should be concern with the authenticity of this product, or is it pretty normal to receive the product with an unattached removable plastic lid.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed it off my pores were noticeably smaller and my skin felt silky smooth.</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>so much cheaper from this vendor,</li>
            <li>I hope that I continue to see such fantastic results</li>
            <li>I suffer from very oiling and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It really a gets all the dirt and oil out and after two uses I&#x27;ve noticed fewer blemishes as well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>I received mine, it really does look like it had been tampered with.</li>
            <li>I expected so much more from this mask.</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>It made a very noticeable difference on my nose which had a lot of blackheads that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li>(healing clay results are the same: absorbs oil, does make your skin smooth, help with loosening up debris clogging your pores, and with continued usage does help with balancing your skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the label is right--you really don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>and you can see the results working straight away.</li>
            <li>The hype over this product is a bit much.</li>
            <li>Really helps with breakouts.</li>
            <li>Although it has cleaned out my pores some, it doesn&#x27;t really shrink them as advertised.  </li>
            <li>You can really see it cleaning out your pores.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week &amp; have had much nicer skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li>It really works..</li>
            <li>Also, the tea tree oil really burns my skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It did well, but for the price I expected it to do much better.</li>
            <li>I went online and did a bunch of research as to what all this product was about and was beyond ready to try it.</li>
            <li>honestly I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper buying it here</li>
            <li>I saw this mask on Pintrest and really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on it.</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>It has an actual muddy consistency but went on fairly smooth.</li>
            <li>so you must be fast in applying.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I tend to be very acne prone</li>
            <li>and I often have a  lot of blackheads, nothing I&#x27;ve tried has ever really helped.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY recommend this.</li>
            <li>You really dont.</li>
            <li>I rub that in gently.</li>
            <li>my whole life and this has smoothed my skin and skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearing ... not a whole lot more than others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Going to sephora for the real deal.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this product.</li>
            <li>This product really helps with my acne.</li>
            <li>, the product is absolutely USED, the seal tape was opened before I did so.</li>
            <li>I really like....</li>
            <li>It has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>It is very drying</li>
            <li>this really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>or if I don&#x27;t have as much time</li>
            <li>Ok, not really</li>
            <li>The thought of something absorbing the [insert grossness here]</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much improvement when I put it on breakouts though.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>Absolutely a product I don&#x27;t want to go without</li>
            <li>but it has REALLY cleared up my face in just three uses..</li>
            <li>It is neat the way your skin looks with the mask on, but I think the price is too high!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll admit her face looks much smoother, tone...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much for pimples.</li>
            <li>so the fast shipping is a plus.</li>
            <li>I really looooved this product,,</li>
            <li>I came onto amazon and saw it for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I really could not wait to try this product after seeing it online</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I did not see much of a difference using this product.</li>
            <li>I do not see that it did much for my skin though.  </li>
            <li>I found this works very well.</li>
            <li>the strip didn&#x27;t really get anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will order again.  </li>
            <li>but it didnt really make too much of a difference with the blackheads.</li>
            <li>Paid way too much for results like that.</li>
            <li>results are very rapid.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice a difference after I use it</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin very well.</li>
            <li>This product is given so much hype but despite this for me the mask did not deliver what it has promised.</li>
            <li>$70 is too much</li>
            <li>Really does wonders for the face</li>
            <li>My skin does feel much smoother.</li>
            <li>It smells...interesting, and has a very lumpy texture.</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE THE WAY</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper on amazon, so that helped my decision.</li>
            <li>and then I could really tell it was working.</li>
            <li>My one caveat is that I got this in person at a store, not from the vendor here, so I can&#x27;t vouch for whether what is sent out here is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>but it really isn&#x27;t infected or about to be but squeezing it</li>
            <li>You really see the oil being sucked up when the mask dries.</li>
            <li>It took a couple times for me to really see any difference.</li>
            <li>It is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel smooth and pores smaller</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to ramble too much</li>
            <li>it really does what it claims.</li>
            <li>This product really does make my skin feel healthier and glowing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying.  </li>
            <li>Been using it twice a week for last few weeks clears breakouts (i have very  mild ones to begin with) and makes my skin feel so clean yet smooth.</li>
            <li>I kept checking to see if I could see the dirt being pulled out and really all you see is where the mask turns a darker color over your pores but nothing comes out.</li>
            <li>Expected MUCH more for the cost.</li>
            <li>It helps so much with clearing up my acne.</li>
            <li>when you wash it off your skin does look fresh, soft and shiny - and your makeup</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about over this stuff.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it I can see what it is pulling out of my pores and after my skin feels smooth and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li>It arrived from this company with the silver foil intact and the product very moist as it should be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It went straight to the garbage</li>
            <li>It draws the gunk from my pores out and leaves me with fresh clear skin.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to save your money and buy the real deal.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and this really helps me to manage it.</li>
            <li>works by absorbing oil over your pores.</li>
            <li>So all the reviews on here are very misleading.  </li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>At first, based on the reviews I had read, I thought it was normal</li>
            <li>I really like using this mask.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I was really bummed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just say this product isn&#x27;t for people who really have acne or blackheads.</li>
            <li>It is fairly gentle.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the results during and after use.</li>
            <li>but I do not see this product doing anything of real value for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised I hadn&#x27;t heard of it earlier :)</li>
            <li>I use a basic sensitive skin face wash and have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>Semi liked the mask, however I didn&#x27;t use it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many acne treatments and this is probably the only one that has helped me clear the acne (pimples, zits, and pores).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look the greatest (like a dark grey with a hint of blue) but you can feel it working as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel nice and firm once its washed off.</li>
            <li>BUT it seemed to tighten them up and give an overall nice facial feeling temporarily.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and soft and clear.</li>
            <li>is Origins Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask, but since I&#x27;m kind of a beauty product junkie I decided to try out this mask based on all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And man, it is so gross how much dirt comes out of your pores!!!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product BURNS!!!</li>
            <li>I have this awesome zit stick from Costco though that takes care of zits in less than 24hrs usually though, so</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well on my face, probably would work better on someone with a less oily face.</li>
            <li>The result was quite drastic the first time I used it, and now the results are less striking, and instead the mask maintains the improvements to my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the mask about every third day for a few weeks and my skin does look very nice.</li>
            <li>I always break out right before aunt Flo visits, and this product has helped reduce my pore size and  clear up acne.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this stuff after reading all the other reviews and articles online, but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>but it really works and it works better than any other mud pore refining product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that many acne products have one or the other, but I really like how this mask utilizes both.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s on the other hand were very noticeable, mostly where he shaves and gets razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Only used the mud a couple of times but it works exactly as described and is certainly well worth the price.</li>
            <li>little jar has lasted me a year of weekly to bi-weekly use, which is pretty darn good and further justifies the cost IMO.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth it, especially with oily skin people- such a clean feeling!</li>
            <li>My skin did not feel soft, clean, or look clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem with large pores and blackheads, I used the mud as a full face mask, left on for 20 minutes, washed off and</li>
            <li>UPDATE 07/30/14***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to do a product update on this mask because when I wrote my original review I had only used this mask once</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more of a liquidy consistency than other clay masks I have.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done a hundred times better than any of the other products on the market that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Works great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant lightening of the blackheads afterward which solved my above problem.</li>
            <li>I got the same mask from somewhere that I know sells original</li>
            <li>Much better price then other retailers.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, it doesn&#x27;t last long, but it is totally worth the cost to keep getting it.</li>
            <li>I find this is better at cleaning out my pores than any other mask I&#x27;ve tried, including skinceuticals clay masque.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to read such rave reviews!  </li>
            <li>Since I was so excited for the mask I disregarded the latter.</li>
            <li>This product did not have the original plastic cover when you open it.</li>
            <li>It clears out pores better than any other product I have tried, and you can see the proof on your face before you was it off</li>
            <li>The white box the mask comes in was sealed and included all the original product information.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to those with large pores.</li>
            <li>Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on certain skin types, or people just have really high standards.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth and soft, but most of all clear from black heads.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel super soft after using but didn&#x27;t really seem to clear much of my acne.</li>
            <li>I do not typically spend a lot of money on skin care and makeup usually just purchasing drugstore available products, so this really was a splurge for me (although the price on amazon was much better than anywhere else).  </li>
            <li>However, I have also found other 100% natural mud masks that I believe deliver the same great results for less money and more product.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels extra clean after using it, along with making it look and feel toner.</li>
            <li>and i did see my pores open making it easier to clean them out.</li>
            <li>This product seems to really deep clean my skin.</li>
            <li>It is fun for the first time use only.</li>
            <li>I have larger pores and it takes a lot of work to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>After the first use my skin felt extra clean and super soft, with the pores on my nose and chin barely visible.  </li>
            <li>My pores are clean and smaller than before use.  </li>
            <li>The first few times was okay</li>
            <li>What you will see is that, when used regularly, you will get beyond the triggered breakouts and enter a state where your skin is healthier and clean and you can use the mask without breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest it if you really want to get DEEEEP into those pores.</li>
            <li>Especially before any special event.  </li>
            <li>Really makes skin glow and look soft!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked that my face felt soft and less oily after the use even if the results weren&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and soft, yet not dry or over cleaned.</li>
            <li>Recommend this to everyone, even sensitive skin (as i have super duper highly sensitive reactive skin).</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>I used this mask for the first time yesterday and I can see a huge difference in the size of my pores, more-so than with other masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This mask works great on both my teenage daughter and my middle aged skin.  </li>
            <li>When I first got this I was so excited, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li>far as my skin, I felt like it was SO much softer!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive try it in a test area first like your cheek our chin.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li>By about the 4th or 5th day, my entire face was full of bumps and I had hives on my neck and chest.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted, a natural mud mask for spot treatments.  </li>
            <li>The package states the product will last for 17 uses as a full face mask, or 1000 uses as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Applying makeup after using the mask, it went on much smoother than normal - as if I had already used a primer.</li>
            <li>Its 17 full masks or 1000 spot treatments and after the improvement I saw, I will definitely be using it on my nose weekly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult with oily skin &amp; acne living in a hot , humid area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not terrible but not worth the price</li>
            <li>The seller said if I sent it back to them I would get a full refund</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice you don&#x27;t have to slather on the product to get its benefits, considering the small amount of product in the container.</li>
            <li>I actually came to Amazon to buy a full size container.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was nice ,but it is a small jar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice as a full facial mask.  </li>
            <li>Wish the entire box was full of this stuff.</li>
            <li>After reading the hype surrounding this product, I really thought it was going to be a little jar of magic that would literally fix any imperfection in my skin.</li>
            <li>Brand new sealed and everything!</li>
            <li>However, waking the 2nd day after using the mask, my skin is back to normal and not as bright (or noticeably different) as the morning after the treatment.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time the other night and not only did it leave my skin extremely soft and glowing, it cleared most of the blackheads from my nose and chin!</li>
            <li>It was very flaky and did not look like the new one that I had purchased before.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product, but the price is a little high.</li>
            <li>I have taken to putting it on and around my nose, and then I use the excess and a little bit more to spread around the rest of my face and other problem spots, so it&#x27;s applied elsewhere as a light film--saves product and still rejuvenates the whole face that way!</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is not my favorite- reminds me of black licorice.</li>
            <li>I use less product this way and am able to put it on within a minute or so.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine uses it more often, she has slightly oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A friend of mine uses it more often, she has slightly oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Less is more for my oily skin, wish i learned this 17 years</li>
            <li>Less is more for my oily skin, wish i learned this 17 years ago.</li>
            <li>I saw instant results with a fifteen minute treatment, plus my skin was super smooth and soft with pores appearing smaller.</li>
            <li>just 3 times and more than half of the jar is gone&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel afterwards but it does not pull the black heads out like it says.</li>
            <li>the more I used it the less &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; came out of my pores.</li>
            <li>Typically when I use pore strips, I always feel like they could have done more.</li>
            <li>After one use I notices the blackheads were less noticeable and my skin looked and felt better.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product that I purchased from this seller as the product came in a half sealed box (when you buy from Sephora it has two seals on the box)&amp; the jar had product around the top</li>
            <li>I get better results with department-store brand (Borghese) at half the price.  </li>
            <li>It started to dry almost immediately and turned a light green/teal color.  </li>
            <li>It has a more watery consistency then the one I had previously bought at sephora.</li>
            <li>I went to Sephora, which is completely sold out, and available only online for $60.</li>
            <li>I used it only on my T-zone and after I washed it off my face felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came in a cute, tiny jar as a pre- mixed clay.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pleased with the results and while a pricier mask I thought that it worked well enough to justify the price of the $40 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>And one must also take into consideration that different things work better for different people.</li>
            <li>I bought a $6 mud mask from Ulta that gave me decent results.</li>
            <li>Glamglow works well on my older skin.  </li>
            <li>Others may find it helpful to steam the face after cleansing to open up pores even more prior to mask application.</li>
            <li>But then a week later my skin felt like it needed that super oil/dirt suction power that the mask delivers</li>
            <li>but I was looking for something to clear out my pores and smooth out my skin overall.</li>
            <li>you can stand it, though, it does a decent job of clearing up the face.</li>
            <li>I read reviews before purchasing and one of them said that the product was super tiny.</li>
            <li>Super mud cleared my skin after only a couple applications.</li>
            <li>The mask was nice; I think it did tighten up some pores for a few hours directly after the treatment</li>
            <li>My skin showed instant results ( softer smaller pores more even complexion redness reduced ).</li>
            <li>Anyway, it cleared up my nose better than my last facial!</li>
            <li>of the main reasons I bought this was because it was supposed to have a brightening effect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>As it dries you start to see little brackish Brown oily spots start to appear mine were pretty tiny, so I had to look kind of close.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I was very surprised to like this as much as I did.</li>
            <li>After drying my skin did feel a bit tight, however it felt baby soft and my skin was super smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that breaks out all the time!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It contains fragrance, which is probably what irritated my skin, as well as toxic propylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben, and methylisothiazolinone, which are ranked as highly toxic by EWG.org.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mask for anyone with problematic skin.</li>
            <li>so maybe my expectations were just too high.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a clearer complexion</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes of this after reading the &amp;#34;glam-glowing&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My friend told me about this product because she works at a high end spa and this is the product they use on their clients.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After reading raving reviews of this product, I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone with oily to oily-combination skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend not buying this from amazon and saving you&#x27;re money to get it from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this for anyone that has even considered it.</li>
            <li>I think I had too high of expectations because of the glowing (har, har) reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product  for a brighter appearance and youthful look.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and the price was much better than other vendors</li>
            <li>It cost twice as less of Sephora and absolutely the same thing - packed in original packaging, numbers on the box are all original.</li>
            <li>I think I see a little difference, too. :-)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know anything about this product however the description of what this mask does seemed exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for since I&#x27;ve been having major breakouts and blackheads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>We both find it satisfying to see little dots all over your face when this begins to dry--which I hope and assume are impurities being drawn out of my pores.</li>
            <li>It was completely gone!!</li>
            <li>so I tend to use it around the time of the month I start to get a little more oily and have break out issues.</li>
            <li>Happy to pay less than half.</li>
            <li>it dries nice and hard</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the white glamglow and the black one, and honestly, I like the black one better.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the mask was gentle which</li>
            <li>It does take a couple of weeks to really notice but you will be surprised.</li>
            <li>It surprised me at how much it really did make our skin glow without a oily-shinyness to it.  </li>
            <li>It washes off so much more easily than my previous mask (the Boscia black mask)</li>
            <li>I used it as a mask once or twice a week and really helped clear my face up</li>
            <li>It really extracts all the gunk and you can see it clearly as the mask dries and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li>but i think it was just because this mud does dry on the container if you don&#x27;t clean</li>
            <li>After a couple of months of using both, my skin is clearer, brighter, super soft, and no more fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of months of using both, my skin is clearer, brighter, super soft, and no more fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>The product I received from Sephora was much fresher and the treatment mud was not dried out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled as an adult with acne on my chin and forehead and this has been a real life changer.</li>
            <li>It really help keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>I battle adult acne, and this really helps.  </li>
            <li>This mask is geared twords helping to clear breakouts which really does work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that with a few more uses, this mask would&#x27;ve removed what my pore strips did but why waste the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took two treatments so far to really penetrate the blackheads I had on my nose.</li>
            <li>I am very upset to see my glam glow arrived opened, used and old.</li>
            <li>As an aging young lady I don&#x27;t mind paying some cash for a product that works, but I really wish I had returned this in time to get a refund.</li>
            <li>, my skin is so much softer, and the redness is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I love the mask, but the seller didn&#x27;t do a good job as the mask was open and the lid was dirty, the box was ripped!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I guess that is normal.</li>
            <li>you might feel some tingling and burning sensation but its normal</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have any problems with masks, peels, or toners.</li>
            <li>But as the dirt is cleaned out your pores begin to return to their normal size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But as the dirt is cleaned out your pores begin to return to their normal size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was all set to find some truly miraculous or at least effective skin masque.</li>
            <li>The only product i have used on my face that has actually helped clear it and look more radiant.</li>
            <li>Overall I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t get rid of every blackhead on my face, but still a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Is this normal for Glam Glow?</li>
            <li>I think all success only in advertizing.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and actually works!  </li>
            <li>My face was brighter, softer and more youthful looking after a few uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra bucks!</li>
            <li>I should be paid for wasting my time and now having to waste more time and gas driving to UPS to return this.</li>
            <li>I love how it leave your face glowing even after a few days</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this everyday and it wont irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always fun to get rid of gross stuff on your face.</li>
            <li>(Note: that is my normal face product for my bedtime</li>
            <li>So I washed my face with my normal routine of Cetaphil in the shower, then when I got out I used a $1 foundation brush from elf to apply the mask all over my face.</li>
            <li>I left it on for the full 20 minutes, but could still clearly see blackheads everywhere.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money I think because it cleared my breakup in only two days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Use it prior to a night out or to freshen your skin for an all day fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>but with Glam Glow, I place a dab of it on the pimple, and I can feel the tingle as it goes to work on attacking the problem, the next day, the outbreak is pretty much history.</li>
            <li>I use a clarisonic on my face regularly, which definitely helps to keep my skin nice and dry, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help to unclog pores as much as I hoped.</li>
            <li>more than half of my blackheads are gone!</li>
            <li>There is product around the cap and inside, more than half of the product is gone from the container!</li>
            <li>Works well to get rid of black heads to make your face look more clear.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I found the consistency of the mask super dry and kind of hard to spread.</li>
            <li>your left with clear soft radiant skin, I&#x27;m so excited about how my skin is looking.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin this may not work for you, as the natural ingredients provide a cooling sensation and intense exfoliation process.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying some right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(gross, right?)</li>
            <li>I moisturized right away because my skin was screaming for it, but when I went outside my face stung a bit.</li>
            <li>I have only used this mask once, right when it came in the mail</li>
            <li>I had a white head for about a month that would not go away, and after I used the mask once it took it right out.</li>
            <li>You only get a little bit for a lot of money, but for a special occasion, this was fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose and inner cheeks and this mask really helps to suck out the oil.</li>
            <li>I just used the mask a second time (about 5 days after the first round) and the results are even better.</li>
            <li>My face felt smooth to the touch but didn&#x27;t have any tightness I&#x27;ve had with other products.</li>
            <li>The first time I only had it stay on until it dried with not too many results.</li>
            <li>Live and learn</li>
            <li>I live in Wisconsin</li>
            <li>it arrived in a factory sealed package, obviously new.</li>
            <li>it was supposed to be new..</li>
            <li>I also have a picture of my (brand new from Sephora) jar, showing what the seal should look like.  </li>
            <li>and I live in the humid south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who does this and why would this be resent out as a new item???</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is brand new after using this.</li>
            <li>Item is new and sealed.</li>
            <li>i am new to this product but will be buying it again.  </li>
            <li>Well, I don&#x27;t think it is brand new...</li>
            <li>The jar containing the product featured a foil seal ensuring the product was new and completed sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And, like everyone else says, this stuff goes a really long way and less is definitely better!</li>
            <li>so i try to keep masks and exfoliation to a minimum, but seriously this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am huge on actually seeing results working instantly and it WORKS!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work that well except for making my skin smooth, but it also dried it out...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really clear current breakouts don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s strong enough and changing the acne prone skin</li>
            <li>The box it came in itself was sealed with a clear round sticker as you would probably find on most boxes.</li>
            <li>There were some dry chunks within the super mud.</li>
            <li>The inner packaging (the paper holding the jar in place) was torn so the jar just kind of rattled around in there, and there are two instructional brochure things that were supposed to be there that were missing.  </li>
            <li>would have rated this 3 stars because it does leave your skin feeling nice, but it&#x27;s so ridiculously overpriced I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel pretty soft and it feels nice but really doesn&#x27;t even compare with the other GLAMGLOW mask (the one in the black container), at least the price on Amazon is much better than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>The next morning I woke and my skin was no where nearly as oily as it normally is!!!</li>
            <li>I used to always be buying new cremes and washes trying to clear up my acne, but now, I just use GlamGlow!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get a new face or a new layer of skin, like some people seem to expect from products, but this one sure makes a difference (however small) to me.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin it can cause breakouts as well.</li>
            <li>Very soft and clears my complexion.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and acne prone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and clay treatments like this can dry your skin a little because they remove EVERYTHING, and sometimes they can encourage extra oil production by your skin, so it&#x27;s important to use a good moisturizer so that your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out or over produce oil.  </li>
            <li>My face did feel quite clean even after just the first use, but my skin also felt very tight and</li>
            <li>it is the same, but you pay for this powder is much cheaper for more volume than this little jar of expensive&gt;</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work for regular acne either, too bad I was really hoping this would be a great mask!</li>
            <li>My blackheads were as clear as they&#x27;ve been in ages!</li>
            <li>My nose is completely clear after once use!</li>
            <li>even his nose looks clear!</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was a pre-teen!</li>
            <li>We both have T-zone oiliness and this product removes black or white heads so easily while leaving your skin shining!</li>
            <li>Helps clear pimples and makes skin radiant!</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I came off birth control over a year ago!</li>
            <li>My nose was completely clear!</li>
            <li>This stuff fixed my skin!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>But it was all ok not sure why that happened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty big beauty product fan</li>
            <li>but in the past year I&#x27;ve either had more stress or hormones</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t show your pores it would be exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 months (still have the original jar with several applications left).</li>
            <li>I was not sure it would work since I have had this problem for so many years.</li>
            <li>first time i used this someone actually said that my skin was glowing (without any knowledge of me using this product</li>
            <li>Unlike other masks that I&#x27;ve tried previously, mostly found at the local pharmacy, it doesn&#x27;t feel caked on.</li>
            <li>and I still breakout pretty moderately on my chin.</li>
            <li>Even if I use it regularly, which is what I did when I first got it</li>
            <li>The next red flag should have been when I opened the pot, the foil was already off (it was just laying on top) and it was obvious that this was tampered with as well.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I gave it the benefit of the doubt in the beginning because I read reviews that said it might make your skin break out in the beginning because it&#x27;s purging your skin of all of those impurities, but that should only happen the first time or two.  </li>
            <li>took a hot shower streamed up my bathroom to help open my pores and then put this mask on!</li>
            <li>I used to buy all different creams, trying to find one that would work consistently well.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy all different creams, trying to find one that would work consistently well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first time, I stopped putting the mask all over my face, and I only use it over my nose and chin where I have the problems.</li>
            <li>Only downfall is that it might make you break out a day or two after using it the first time but that is just bringing everything to the surface.</li>
            <li>I been trying to upload pictures of the actual container what it looked like when first opened.</li>
            <li>I was worried about this product at first, because there were several reviews that mentioned that their product seemed used.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>The outer box, you can see the round factory seal sticker (it&#x27;s clear) with a piece of clear scotch tape on top.  </li>
            <li>That should have been my first red flag.  </li>
            <li>I did contact GlamGlow, but they won&#x27;t stand by their product unless you buy directly from them!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It came package in a regular glam glow box, I would recommend to anyone who is interested in buying this product.</li>
            <li>The first time I got it, I used it all over my face, but I realized it wasn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li>But I was still unsure if I wanted to pay such a hefty price for a product, so I bought the samples from the Glam Glow website to try it out first.  </li>
            <li>Glamglow surprised me!</li>
            <li>I first saw it on Pinterest and decided to give it a whirl, especially with the price deal on amazon.</li>
            <li>Two of us have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause us any problems!</li>
            <li>After my first use, I could see my pores looked cleaner and tighter, and overall, my face was a lot softer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I used up my first jar, I got a second one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Works great and last a long time for a small bottle.</li>
            <li>Sure initially your pores may look smaller but the next day there they are again and look now you have blemishes too!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost completely gotten rid of my blackheads after just 2 uses!</li>
            <li>Just bought my first bottle and am planning to continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li>Same exact product/size/packaging, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I purchased this item I applied it daily for 2 weeks for 20-30 min.</li>
            <li>After just a week my skin looked and felt a million times better, my pores were so small</li>
            <li>I am not usually into beauty products</li>
            <li>I generally leave it on for 20 minutes or longer, cover the whole face or just the problem areas if I am in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would absolutely never pay full price for it though.  </li>
            <li>It clears up my acne quickly, but does not do much for previous scars.</li>
            <li>This Super-Mud left my skin squeaky clean and my pores visibly smaller.  </li>
            <li>Next time I WILL be purchasing it from Sephora because this poduct was clearly OPENED and USED some of the product was gone!!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but just as good as any other less expensive clay mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>liked the consistency of the product, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>the next day I did the same thing and was able to get the zit out and clear and it only took 2 times using the mask to get it out!</li>
            <li>If you really don&#x27;t want to spend the money on this product I would highly suggest purchasing a cheaper mask and using it regularly on your face to see if it works for you.use your pores to shrink.</li>
            <li>If you really don&#x27;t want to spend the money on this product I would highly suggest purchasing a cheaper mask and using it regularly on your face to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t really make my skin appear any different.</li>
            <li>i only put it on problem spots not all over my face unless i have a special event the next night</li>
            <li>the description of the product was clearly stated that the product was new.</li>
            <li>For visualization: the packaging is huge but the product has less substance then a travel size vasoline container, hope that helps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is a spoiled product because it came through a 3rd party vendor (although it wasn&#x27;t opened), or if I&#x27;m just not getting the &#x27;amazing smell&#x27; that everyone has been claiming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it dries, it turns a solid light grey color.</li>
            <li>My nose is clear of the tiny blackheads for the first time since puberty.</li>
            <li>So not only does the product dry out super fast, they&#x27;re customer service</li>
            <li>After only one use, and letting it dry for a good 10-15 minutes, the black dots started showing up all over my face.</li>
            <li>It dries without being too harsh and crinkling your skin and washes off easily in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It does leave your skin feeling pretty soft, but this is definitely not going to pull gunk out of your pores like a Biore strip</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s a good mask but not good enough for me to purchase again.</li>
            <li>The real trick of making your tiny expensive jar of glamglow go far is that after you leave the mask on for 20-30 minutes, rinse off with very warm water, and then follow with BIORE PORE STRIPS.</li>
            <li>Used it all over the first 3 nights and noticed that I broke out a little more (which is expected)...</li>
            <li>I will probably try a cheaper product the next time to see if this really is that much better than other similar products.</li>
            <li>I instantly started researching it and found all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice smaller pores or a whole new face</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to the upcoming mask to clear out my skin, however, by the time I opened it, it&#x27;s only half of the container</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have both the white and black one.</li>
            <li>I like white mud better than black.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well, I noticed significantly less breakouts after using it a few times.</li>
            <li>This product did make my skin soft, but saying that it does anything other than that wasn&#x27;t true for me.</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose and using this mask is making them appear smaller.</li>
            <li>Which I&#x27;ll take over the large clusters of pimples that last for a week then scar up my face</li>
            <li>I have large pores especially on and around my nose.</li>
            <li>If you have blackheads or large pores around the nose or in the t-zone like I do this is a must for helping to unclog &amp; for smaller pores.  </li>
            <li>GLAMGLOW Mud has certainly made a difference, especially in clearing out the pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li>Even though its worth every single penny!</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it made my face feel nice and tight, like I had gotten a tiny, tiny face lift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather be able to save a little money and just buy it in a tube or basic rectangular box.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s anymore effective than Merle Norman&#x27;s Miracol or some of the other products out there that are half the price.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my pores better than other productsI&#x27;ve tried and didn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Clearly it was already used and tampered with.</li>
            <li>My face feels and looks so clear that I want to go up to people and say &amp;</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping that after a couple of uses it will clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>At this rate, my skin will be mostly clear for my wedding which is 4 weeks away.</li>
            <li>I thought it would magically clear my face</li>
            <li>I had to take a steroid to finally clear up the reaction.  </li>
            <li>While it seemed to clear my nose up a bit it didn&#x27;t really remove the larger blackheads.</li>
            <li>It helps to clear skin imperfections, smooths as well as revitalizes and freshens the skin.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my face clear and minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;pore shrinking&amp;#34; but I did notice my pores were crystal clear after using this.</li>
            <li>those purchasing the GlamGlow, it&#x27;s not a treatment that will give you perfectly clear skin overnight.</li>
            <li>But she loves it and it is working to clear up her face.  </li>
            <li>I use about once every two weeks after a lavender steam, and it keeps my skin glowing and clear.</li>
            <li>All the areas I had put it on were wonderfully clear of gunk.</li>
            <li>No, it didn&#x27;t make my pores just disappear, but it did clear them out and reduce the size of them.</li>
            <li>The product is helping clear out my blackheads</li>
            <li>It makes your skin clear, and brighter to, as in even skin tone.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also say she complained about her skin being sensitive to most products and since using GlamGlow, zero complaints.</li>
            <li>It helped clear up my breakouts</li>
            <li>I have great,smooth, clear skin immediately after using this.</li>
            <li>This time though, the outer box wasn&#x27;t wrapped in plastic and when I opened it up the box, it was clear that the jar had already been opened; there was product caked around the lid.  </li>
            <li>It does help to clear out skin</li>
            <li>I just turned 30 and started getting breakouts when i used to always have clear skin.</li>
            <li>yes 2 days my face was completely clear, 100%</li>
            <li>Does clear up my skin a day after using.</li>
            <li>It also says on the packaging you can leave on 5-20 minutes and let me be clear</li>
            <li>so I am waiting for those to clear up</li>
            <li>This product came to me opened, clearly it was used.</li>
            <li>I like how this mask make the skin soft after using it.</li>
            <li>really wish I hadn&#x27;t lost it, and if it wasn&#x27;t such a pricey product, I would have already replaced it!</li>
            <li>are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I at least tried it</li>
            <li>Used a promo code at the direct brand site and got $20.00 off the price.</li>
            <li>you looks and feeling young.  </li>
            <li>Who knew you could hit puberty at damn near 30.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne and blackheads since I was 11 years old.</li>
            <li>, I read that some costumers got it old &amp; used</li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive dry-normal skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it was old.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything but make my face really soft.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t solve all of my skin issues, but it made considerable progress toward doing so.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really get a chance to look at my face until the next morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far for my acne prone skin</li>
            <li>So far this is working well for me.</li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin and have had no issues with this product.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, and I find the day AFTER I use it is when the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; really comes out the next time I wash my face.</li>
            <li>My face is really soft after I use it,</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter and I both use Glam Glow and are amazed at the power of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old</li>
            <li>After hearing YouTube beauty gurus and their opinions about the SuperMud mask and how much it&#x27;s changed their skin, I finally bit the bullet and bought it.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is just too sensitive for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I always look for all natural, or organic, or vegan beauty care.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a day, it leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li>You can save on the cost on Amazon, but the treatment mud I received was old and had a crust around it.</li>
            <li>You could probably find a natural DIY formula that would work just as well.</li>
            <li>Removed all my blackheads in one use and made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything to help my current break outs</li>
            <li>When I used it it still gave me the same tingly feeling but not as much as before.</li>
            <li>As a person in my 30 &#x27; s without much acne just occasional breakout it does wonders.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no problem with this product.</li>
            <li>and it did my face felt incredibly soft</li>
            <li>My skin always feels so soft when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>This stuff does pull all the oil to the surface and after washing it off, my skin feels baby soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It showed you where the balckheads were but did absolutely nothing to pull them out, if anything my pores looked twice as big with blackheads still in them.</li>
            <li>how soft it made his skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>I will never waste my money again on stuff that you can buy at Target or even at the Department Stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it twice a week since I bought it in early August.</li>
            <li>Make my skin soft though.</li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t really notice a physical difference after using it.</li>
            <li>You can see as it works and pulls all the sebum and oils from your pores and really makes your pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely won me</li>
            <li>This does wonders on your skin and is completely natural.</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and used it in my t zone .</li>
            <li>it reveals an even toned and soft complexion.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this for every woman to have in their skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Maybe product was old?</li>
            <li>Would not waste money on this.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for something natural</li>
            <li>but it DOESN&#x27;T completely remove them at all.</li>
            <li>It really helps to draw out blackheads and dries and shrinks any current blemishes.</li>
            <li>It does have a tingle similar to what you feel with products that have mint in them, but it was not irritating.</li>
            <li>It makes skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Package looks like it&#x27;s old or been used, it wasn&#x27;t wrapped in any plastic.</li>
            <li>I am very oily so this does help the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I sometimes have problems with products because my skin is some what sensitive, but glamglow hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every method of removing said bump for 11 years to no avail.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and Glamglow Super-Mud Clearing Treatment</li>
            <li>I smelled it and compared it to the last jar, and it seems like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get overnight results but overall it has really helped my skin - texture, smoothness, tone, pores, breakouts-</li>
            <li>I use it at 40 and have my 14 year old son uses it to keep breakouts under control.  </li>
            <li>My 19 year old daughter got me started using it</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>She swears it is the only thing that really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>and it really gives your face an instant lift.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li>Not giving it 5 stars only because it hasn&#x27;t really helped with my acne on my chin.</li>
            <li>and so does my nearly 15 year old child who has some acne going on.  </li>
            <li>your skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>At least give this product a try more than once in a two week period.</li>
            <li>(I bought it at the recommendation of professional make-up artist Tiffany Lee Bymaster, aka \\&quot;Coach</li>
            <li>Glam Glow gets rid of zits FAST and has definitely made a noticeable difference for me.</li>
            <li>Not only does this have the cutest packaging but it did absolute wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it two days in a row and got my skin become sensitive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like my skin is any different,</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m please</li>
            <li>I had a lot of blackhead that were very deep and no matter how much i cleaned my face, tried to remove them or used the biore strips, they never went away.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely cleared, which says a lot since I have cystic acne/pimples .</li>
            <li>I am still playing around with this product, but so far it seems to work quite well with my skin.</li>
            <li>- Use warm water and rinse for AT LEAST a minute to ensure you get all the mask off or any that&#x27;s left over will get into your pores and cause blackheads/breakouts.</li>
            <li>Feels nice, its a dark grey color and doesn&#x27;t stain your skin (obviously) or your clothes (got some on my shirt and came out with the wash).</li>
            <li>I am only using it on problem areas on my face, so I should be able to get quite a few uses out of the container.  </li>
            <li>Expensive but good.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly it lasts a long time for such a small jar.</li>
            <li>this white jar, i think is better than the black jar!</li>
            <li>One was fine, the other had a completely different safety seal, and was used.</li>
            <li>But the smells fades away once it&#x27;s dry which happens very fast.</li>
            <li>I break out fairly easily so a new product is always a little unnerving, but this helped clear my skin really quickly.</li>
            <li>If you plan it right you can definitely beat a big breakout before hand.</li>
            <li>I would save up and purchase a larger container so that all my skin would have more time to react, as well as to maintain the clean, soft and clear face that was left behind.</li>
            <li>my pores are actually clear for the first time in a very long time.</li>
            <li>My GlamGlow super mud mask jar isnt lasting me as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel so tight and clean</li>
            <li>After using it, my face always feels clean and my skin feels tight.</li>
            <li>It should simply rinse off and down the drain easily.  </li>
            <li>(Which made the product look dry when first opened ).</li>
            <li>and i still have half of it still full.</li>
            <li>, it has helped tremendously with my acne and dark marks.</li>
            <li>To me it looked half full and idk</li>
            <li>I do feel my skin is clearer and less full of gunk with this product.</li>
            <li>get super tingly when left on to long!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice, so I&#x27;m willing to give it a few more tries.</li>
            <li>I spread it pretty thin, and I was still only able to get about 8 uses out of it, the jar says you can get 17 uses out of it.</li>
            <li>A week after I stopped, the black heads on my nose were darker and more numerous, and I had only used the mask three or four times before that.</li>
            <li>I put it on, leave it for 20-30 minutes, check myself out in the mirror a few times and then rinse clean.</li>
            <li>price was decent, and it does last longer than you would think when you receive it..</li>
            <li>The texture of this particular Glamglow Super-Mud was not of the same textue as the Glamglow</li>
            <li>My pimples have subsided for the most part, the occasional extremely small one.</li>
            <li>where I like to treat myself, but I personally can&#x27;t see this as a steady repurchase based on the price.</li>
            <li>At first I was wary because of the price, but this is 100% authentic Glamglow.</li>
            <li>I recommend trying a small free sample from Sephora before purchasing, as I hear it can be too severe for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tried my sample and HOLY COW is it worth the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I&#x27;m a skeptical consumer generally, but still delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>Other reviews are right.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend the product to anyone but you should find a different seller if you are planning on purchasing it online.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it had such high reviews.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, got it before I was expected to.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product as I kept seeing it recommended in magazines and it received such high ratings on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this mask, I just wish they would sell it in a larger container, but I guess the cost prevents them from doing so.  </li>
            <li>I am a total cynic and didn&#x27;t hold high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the high price.</li>
            <li>It does feel tight but not any more so than other masks, it was actually rather gentle in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is the real thing, as I had purchased this previously at a beauty department store.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use it everyday or it will dry your face out :)</li>
            <li>This mask does nothing special or different than any other cheap-o clay/mud mask out there.</li>
            <li>The first time was fine; the second time I noticed my skin was a little pink after use but shrugged it off.</li>
            <li>Wash your face after using it, mud and clay treatments can leave a very slight residue on your skin, so you want your skin clean before you put on makeup or creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i got over it fast when i released how long its lasted me.</li>
            <li>Really cleared my face up and it didn&#x27;t take too long either.</li>
            <li>I applied my normal moisturizer and inspected my skin further.</li>
            <li>My skin is back to normal</li>
            <li>When dirt becomes trapped it causes the pores to open more, making them appear larger.</li>
            <li>When dirt becomes trapped it causes the pores to open more, making them appear larger.</li>
            <li>First, it is thinner than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I suffer with moderate acne and it did help with normal break outs.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t Write reviews but this stuff totally made me break out.</li>
            <li>Especially if I use a pore strip right after I take the mask off-It worked almost as well as having an esthetician do extractions, which is much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I expected it to work a little better for the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty and it leaves skin very dry so moisturize after using!</li>
            <li>I had high expectations after reading all the great reviews and was truly disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive the product, however, it had no plastic wrap on top, no seal on the jar, half of the product was missing &amp; there were black fingerprints on the bottle.</li>
            <li>3 days later I have yet to have any new breakouts and the two zits I had before using this mask</li>
            <li>This is the only new product I used on my face and haven&#x27;t put anything else on it.</li>
            <li>When I received this product, it did not arrive new and was obviously used.</li>
            <li>These were very large, very noticeable blackheads that would not dissolve or otherwise be removed by pore strips, extraction tools, daily use of expensive acne wash and spot treatment lotion, or the special pore cleansing brush head of the Clarisonic device.  </li>
            <li>At half the price of what you would pay at Sephora, I thought this was worth a try.</li>
            <li>It left it soft and clear, minimizing pores drastically.</li>
            <li>A quick look in the mirror showed nothing but dried clay like material.</li>
            <li>As a sufferer of adult acne, most products make my skin look worse.</li>
            <li>I was far more broken out after using the mask.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling very soft but there are lots of projects that can do that.</li>
            <li>This mask truly deep cleans your pores and leaves your skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using it as the package directs, but so far, nothing other than a cool show from watching it dry.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the vacuum like technology to clear out the pores.</li>
            <li>have yet to purchase any of the other GLAMGLOW products, but now that I&#x27;ve been using this one for a year I&#x27;m willing to branch out and try one of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>I left it on for 20 minutes and after one use I can already notice a difference in the size of my pores and my skin feels so soft!  </li>
            <li>In fact, it took hours before my skin had enough natural oil for me to apply powder!  </li>
            <li>originally received a small sample from Sephora and knew after one use I had to purchase this.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, Amazon gives a great price as always, and if you&#x27;re looking for a new mask to try, don&#x27;t be afraid to give this one a go!</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian with pretty dry skin, hyperpigmentation, and some acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have all that gunk drawn out though then left to its own devices to become a massive zit that is 10x worse and takes longer to clear</li>
            <li>the clay is a bit difficult to rinse off and stains the fingers and the towels, but all easily avoidable if care is taken and absolutely worth the extra effort for these results.</li>
            <li>Although price is still not low but definately worth it!I will recommend to other friends</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but its really worth it.</li>
            <li>Smells a little funky but so worth it.</li>
            <li>may think it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li>All the packaging was there and appeared to be new, but when I opened the jar to inspect the contents, it was clear that it was not a new jar.</li>
            <li>Glam glow seems to be a decent product, next time I will be purchasing it from Sephora only!</li>
            <li>Their are so many different masks out there to try, this one really did not do anything other than make my skin feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li>All you need to know is that I have REALLY sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m right in the middle of that young adult acne stage, and it was getting really bad the last few weeks, so I decided to try this out, when it came in the mail I used it as a full mask (i love it btw)</li>
            <li>This product certainly holds up and does far above what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high cost for such a tiny bottle</li>
            <li>Also, a little goes a long way, I used a lot the first time and didn&#x27;t see any results really.</li>
            <li>it does take a few uses to get out some of the really hard black heads but other than that its great .it has a minty sent ,and leaves your face feeling fresh</li>
            <li>I saved the last of the product for a special occasion, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have because the product dried out a bit.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny I spent!!!</li>
            <li>Note that if you have blocked pores from oil or excess sebum, you may see a tiny breakout until you get the areas clear.</li>
            <li>Box and packaging was excessive, should have spent more on the jar the product came in.</li>
            <li>This facial mask did not give me immediate results of clear, unclogged pores and skin.</li>
            <li>The item had already clearly been opened, and possibly used.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenage daughter, who is always trying to find things to help keep her skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, the rest of my face is completely clear and my pores are visibly smaller.</li>
            <li>The mask definitely dries out your face but as far as extracting anything...</li>
            <li>It seems old not the same as sephoras.</li>
            <li>although I did take it off maybe five minutes early the third time.</li>
            <li>but I barely use it now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so far</li>
            <li>I have struggled with blackheads on my nose since my early teenage years and</li>
            <li>I no longer have to pat the oil off my skin and can barely see the pores on my t-zone anymore.</li>
            <li>It deep cleans and refreshes you skin without stripping you of all your natural oils.</li>
            <li>I even had a t-zone pore party with 6 of my friends, and there&#x27;s barely any gone.</li>
            <li>There is a tingle when using it, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>The mud is wet; depending on how much you lather on the mud dries within 7-15min.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and if you do I recommend only using it once a week.</li>
            <li>Okay I was skeptical about this product, especially since it is so much cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li>I gave this treatment several chances to wow me</li>
            <li>Some people are apparently just trying it one time and expecting a miracle.</li>
            <li>and I barely had any breakouts or pimples.</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on the overall effectiveness of this product, because I didn&#x27;t make it that far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin and doing mask treatment would only irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It tightened as it dried, and it was totally fun to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switched to a bentonite clay (Aztec secret) and have had much better</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s even more broken out.</li>
            <li>Safe to say I&#x27;m not a happy customer.</li>
            <li>I get pimples rarely but have a few blackheads on my nose and brow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually spend this kind of money on these sorts of things, but with my wedding coming up in a few months</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s just too expensive to use everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Needless to say, he has his own jar now.</li>
            <li>One of the few products that is really worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can.&lt;br /&gt;Aztec secret - Healing Clay is way better than this.</li>
            <li>You have to endure a few treatments followed by breakouts to see results, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>I think that I like the one that comes in the black pot just a little better.  </li>
            <li>Smells like black licorice, which is not unpleasant for me who really hates black licorice.  </li>
            <li>Jar doesn&#x27;t last very long if you are doing your whole face.</li>
            <li>I get really bad hormonal-induced cystic acne and upon using this mask my breakouts tend to disappear more quickly than with BP or even retain-a.  </li>
            <li>Even though the amount seems tiny (1.2 oz) it lasts a reasonable amount of time and doesn&#x27;t dry out in the jar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it works FANTASTIC for blackheads, but not really for other kinds of acne.</li>
            <li>But it is pretty cool because when it starts to dry, all your black heads turn dark through the mask so you can see where all the dirt is.</li>
            <li>FOR ONCE, I found a product that does exactly what it claims it will do.&lt;br /&gt;After using this mask twice per week for three weeks, my skin is brighter, clearer, and my t-zone is noticeably less oily throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I repeat: Oh.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin, so</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin, so</li>
            <li>Smells a lot like black licorice but does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>I have relatively normal skin not to oily and not to dry.</li>
            <li>I have tried other masks in past that I felt were better</li>
            <li>i have an unbelievable SUPER oily t-zone and i&#x27;ve tried mud masks from Origins, Lancome, Boscia, etc.</li>
            <li>This was super expensive, and the jar is super tiny.</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t use much so make a little go a long way.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s becoming less and less each time.  </li>
            <li>Dies out pretty fast is my only complaint (</li>
            <li>But with a $50 price tag and such a small quantity I expected more.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is ready to use, some other products you have to mix with water or vinegar.  </li>
            <li>But with the other spots on my face, I didn&#x27;t notice that much difference after washing it off.</li>
            <li>U can really see that it is working with all the dots that appear on your face due to pore matrix technology.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make this last a long time, I only use it on my problem areas and not as a whole face</li>
            <li>Top of box is loosely closed and properly sealed, jar is dirty and has dried out pieces around the top edges!  </li>
            <li>over.&lt;br /&gt;So much cheaper than sephora or other beauty retailers</li>
            <li>For me, I noticed that I never experienced the same success from the mud as I did the first time.</li>
            <li>like so far, small portion, but lasts pretty long, makes my face feel very soft, dont know if its a placebo effect</li>
            <li>The jar itself is small, however you really don&#x27;t need very much of the product and you don&#x27;t need to do the mask every single night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing a lot of brightening but the other results are positive enough that I would keep buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a very oily T - zone and a sensitive (read-easily dried out)</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap and comes in a small jar, however, it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>As a 21 year old you don&#x27;t expect acne to be a big problem in your life anymore, i&#x27;ve been on 6 different acne prescriptions.</li>
            <li>It did NOT dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>It did not dry my face.</li>
            <li>However, it did not completely eliminate all the blackheads or reduce the pores as much as I would have liked, but it did better then the dozen or so other masks I have tried over the past years from inexpensive to very expensive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey for what you get but works very well!</li>
            <li>Maybe slightly smaller pores but nothing major.</li>
            <li>Only used it twice, so havent noticed any major changes...</li>
            <li>Anyway, that might be my only major gripe about this product.</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure when i first got it, not just because of the price, also the type of product this is, a mud mask</li>
            <li>Made my skin super dry and tight.</li>
            <li>In fact, there was only about half as much product in the jar as there was supposed to be!</li>
            <li>Have spent more $$ at other stores previous to finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It really does help to clear them out, as I have seen over the last few months.</li>
            <li>Unless I start to see a larger change in the general state of my skin, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bummed I spent so much $ on a product that actually had the opposite of the desired effect.</li>
            <li>Unbelieveable that a product that promotes the healing of dark marks actually exacerbated the same exact problem.</li>
            <li>and it dries to a blue color with holes where apparently your pores were cleaned out.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in my life that I got all that trapped dirt out of my nose out.  </li>
            <li>The first time I purchased glamglow it came all dried up.</li>
            <li>$45 is still a lot to spend on this, not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I wasted a butt load of money on a product that isn&#x27;t even the real deal!</li>
            <li>really not sure if this mask is worth the money.</li>
            <li>really not sure if this mask is worth the money.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>and I was not sure it would be worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Container is a tad small but well worth buying.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>it feels really good on, but it is very expensive for what you get</li>
            <li>It burns a little when applied to face, but very interesting to see the black dots on your face after its dried.</li>
            <li>After the first use my face looked brighter, pores looked tighter, and the pimples I did have were smaller and less red.</li>
            <li>I did break out a little after the first use and each time I use it the break outs are smaller.</li>
            <li>The new version (from Sephora) is packaged so tightly you have to rip the paper to get to the jar, but that part has clearly already been done for me.  </li>
            <li>I am now spending half as much money on skin care with results I NEVER had before.  </li>
            <li>I am now spending half as much money on skin care with results I NEVER had before.  </li>
            <li>It always leaves my skin feeling so much cleaner and less oily than before.</li>
            <li>My skin was smoother and refreshed after the application but the black heads have not decreased after 3 uses.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fading my old acne scars and it doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely have sensitive skin, though, so I was not surprised that it make me break out.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after countless sightings on social media...</li>
            <li>you are in a rush, it dries very quickly if you put a thin layer</li>
            <li>little GLAMGLOW comes in a big white box with packaging to keep this thing pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to use it only 2 times a week though because the times i had used it frequently, it kind of made my face feel a little dry (not dramatically though, just a little dry feeling).</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this product on several areas of my face that had some superficial markings left due to acne breakouts, I was left with a very noticible darkened areas on my face.</li>
            <li>only real issue I had was when I first started using the product, when I put thin layer on my nose.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product does work to help clear up acne and dry up oil.</li>
            <li>I gave the mud and cream to a friend who has very oily skin, and she found that the combination actually helped her skin be less oily.  </li>
            <li>The skin is soft and firmer than before but it doesn&#x27;t really do much to clear imperfections or black heads.</li>
            <li>So definitely do not use it before something big like a wedding, prom, social event, etc.</li>
            <li>I was super skeptical about ordering this from Amazon seeing as it is MUCH lower than the retail price ($69 plus tax at Sephora)</li>
            <li>As soon as I rinsed the mask off my face, my pores were clean, tight, and definitely less visible.  </li>
            <li>For context, I have sensitive acne prone skin that is also very dry.  </li>
            <li>A little bit really does go a loooong way.</li>
            <li>The white dries out my face just a little too much.</li>
            <li>It does sort of make my skin a little softer, but not enough to pay this much for this mask.  </li>
            <li>A little creepy when it lights up your pores, but hey, that means it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>First I have a shower, and right when I get out, when my pores are still open, apply a VERY thin layer of the glamglow.</li>
            <li>My pores on my nose are definitely smaller (due to unclogging), my skin feels smoother, I haven&#x27;t had new breaks outs</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for all the different skin problems it claims to address ( such as pimples, large pores, uneven skin tone ect.)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, but I think the regular ol&#x27; masks I&#x27;ve bought for years at the drug store for 5 bucks do just as good a job.</li>
            <li>Cant really say about it helping to  lighten up the dark spots because I have not been using the mask long enough to make that determination.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the best combo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> Best mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I ended up just buying this from Sephora, and was very happy with my results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve always been on the lookout for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; clay and mud masks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome at cleaning out pores, you can see where it has pulled out the oil when the mask dries!  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is a great product!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to have my friends and family try it out and see how awesome it is.</li>

            <li> product has been the best I&#x27;ve come across in years and</li>
            <li> This is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve come along in my career of cosmetology.&lt;br /&gt;After using it every 3 days or so for a month</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I use it both as a mask and as a spot treatment (it is especially effective when I get pesky breakouts during that time of the month).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an awesome mask.</li>
            <li> but it works great!</li>
            <li> this is the best mud I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin treatment.  </li>
            <li> and it came in perfect quality.</li>

            <li> This mask works awesome!</li>
            <li> I will say however that I was not overly impressed with the shipping and packaging of the item.  </li>

            <li> This mask is wonderful and makes my skin look and feel 10 times better.  </li>
            <li> Nice product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face mask if just the best!</li>
            <li> I need to stop buying this kind of nonsense and just go to a dermatologist!</li>
            <li> While I was glad with the results, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.  </li>
            <li> I also like the luminizing mask from REN to use after this one just to give my skin a more plump awesome look!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good in that it makes the skin feel great after use.</li>
            <li> Nice!  </li>
            <li> My makeup looks more flawless, when I put it on after using the mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many reviews on here and youtube saying this is the best stuff for blackheads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this would work on more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin, but then again, I don&#x27;t think perfectly complected people are spending an arm and a leg on products for skin issues.  </li>
            <li> Over all, I would say it&#x27;s a good luxury product if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, and it would also make a great gift.</li>
            <li> But I can say when you get an authentic version of this it&#x27;s absolutely awesome</li>
            <li> This mud treatment is spectacular!</li>
            <li> Basically every woman should own this stuff!</li>
            <li> Nice quality product, beautiful packaging, and</li>
            <li> She says it feels wonderful after use and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Great seller, better price here than at Sephora!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to rinse off, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or sting while it&#x27;s on, and when you rinse it off you&#x27;ll find gorgeous, supple, glowy and perfect skin.</li>
            <li> good good great love it!</li>
            <li> Very good mask, I love it, and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Good mask after I uses</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of it.</li>
            <li> it is a good product thought.</li>
            <li> Good product, but felt that the package and jar had been opened.</li>
            <li> consistency and color was surprising.</li>
            <li> I struggled a bit getting it evenly distributed before it started drying, which is does fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product, but not for the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife expecting that products &amp;#34;Fulfilled By Amazon&amp;#34; were good quality.</li>
            <li> It is a good product in a good price.</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel good and helped somewhat.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the product, I bought it on Amazon because it was a lot cheaper than Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> good .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read nothing but good things about this product</li>
            <li> Good remedy if u have greasy skin it absorbs everything i will order again once i run out..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what a good job it was doing until I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Always follow up with a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good at purifying the skin and clearing pores.  </li>
            <li> Its a good product</li>
            <li> but I works good.</li>
            <li> Read a lot of good reviews for this</li>
            <li> All my friends loved it, so I decided to splurge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about once a week for two months now (mostly just on my nose and cheeks, since those are my problem areas), and I&#x27;m incredibly underwhelmed.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me break out which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> good stuff.</li>
            <li> It really is a good product, but buy it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t good for my skin.</li>
            <li> All In all a good product.</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this product but family members had used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a product that needs to be used a lot to keep good results, keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> It feels good and is relaxing</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Loved how this product worked.  </li>
            <li> It is good for clearing, but doesn&#x27;t work for acne treatment.</li>
            <li> and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Always a quality product with no issues and a good Seller.</li>
            <li> and he loved the results and</li>
            <li> I did not want to pay the price of retail and good ol amazon</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolitely loved it</li>
            <li> Good spot treatment too</li>
            <li> Feels good and makes you look good.</li>
            <li> great product, effective for my acne.</li>
            <li> Tried a knockoff and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good.</li>
            <li> A friend shared with me and I loved it....</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Higly</li>
            <li> I saw both good reviews on Amazon as well as Sephora but this product was cheaper on Amazon (about $10 cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It is a good mask.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff-</li>
            <li> Your face feels so smooth afterwards, and it&#x27;s just an awesome mask to watch work.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from Sephora before and loved it.</li>
            <li> it looks good.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job at removing excess oils in my T-zones.</li>
            <li> Warm water rinse in the am and some moisturizer, and your make up goes on great....</li>
            <li> I have already use this mask for 5 or 6 times but I do not see any good changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> they loved it.  </li>
            <li> It looks and feels so good within minutes of application.</li>
            <li> The product is good, it did bring a bit up out of my pores.  </li>
            <li> so i knew I loved</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40, so it&#x27;s good for all ages that need a pore-cleaner-outer.</li>
            <li> Loved how my skin felt after , and it smelled really good.</li>
            <li> I guess it feels good when it dries because you can feel you face tightened.</li>
            <li> However, this works surprisingly well to help my acne heal after it&#x27;s popped up.  </li>
            <li> though I already knew from Jen that it was good stuff</li>
            <li> Clears up skin and leaves it feeling smooth and gorgeous!!</li>
            <li> (and if you&#x27;ve had acne, you know that&#x27;s a good feeling).</li>
            <li> and it did feel good on my face and smelled like mint meets licorice.</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> Its a good mask but not for clearing up skin as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of removing oil and dirt, as well as minimizing pores.  </li>
            <li> all which are very nice, effective, and pricey themselves compared to Queen Helene.</li>
            <li> After just one use my skin looks so clean and feels great!</li>
            <li> This seemed to be the best price I could find, so Im pretty happy about that.</li>
            <li> The product itself was amazing,  and it was easily the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and take off!!</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in this stuff - it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin so anything that literally pulls the crud out of my pores is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received it in about four days, I was very pleased with the shipping speed.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with its results.</li>
            <li> Great you can see it working on your face too not like most masks</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and so happy I got a deal and saved like $30 when I got it on here rather than Sephora.</li>
            <li> I thought I would splurge and try it since it had so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Was psyched to try this product after reading the many great reviews...</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product itself is great .</li>
            <li> She was very pleased with the results, used it one evening</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for taking the dirt out of your pores on the top layer</li>
            <li> Im very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Works great as a mask but even better as a spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it -</li>
            <li> Nice product with good value.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product after having read all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I ordered this product, with all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Best way to deal with it is to get our hormones tested and find the right skin care regimen and stick to it for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li> then I use a biore strip right after and it works great!</li>
            <li> Love love this mask!!</li>

            <li> That is why it is so amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> Plus the rest of my skin looks amazing just after one use.</li>
            <li> Really liked the way my face looked after using</li>
            <li> A nice exfoliator has been just as effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially magical after camping or traveling when you don&#x27;t have the time to give your skin as much attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ingredients can&#x27;t stay stable and effective in jar packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought one from Sephora before, and the product was really nice.</li>
            <li> Very tingling and makes your face feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this stuff</li>
            <li> This treatment really makes my skin look great!  </li>
            <li> Beware this snake oil, it do more harm then good.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s best to apply and then jump into the shower when you&#x27;re ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> What kind of company is this?</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the purchase and would recommend it to friends going forward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of gross/awesome to see it pulling out all the dirt/oil/sebum from your pores.</li>
            <li> It kind of smells like a mixture of peppermint and licorice.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin feel really nice when I washed it off.</li>
            <li> Nice scrubbing beads/stones.</li>
            <li> My Daughter and I are loving this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading many many great reviews on it online and after a lot of deliberation over whether I wanted to spend almost $50 on a face mask.</li>
            <li> It works nice</li>
            <li> I also liked how this could be used as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Loved it and had to buy more.</li>
            <li> I liked how it felt afterwards and how it worked on whiteheads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice mask</li>
            <li> So nice to buy something that lives up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> It rinses nicely</li>
            <li> This product did make my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this was going to be a waist of money.</li>
            <li> Nice for oily people I think since its a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I felt that my skin really glowing and all problems solved :D</li>
            <li> I was hearing so many good things about this stuff</li>
            <li> Im really loving this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I had a sample of another mask by this brand that I really liked.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s always good :)</li>
            <li> My skin was in good condition beforehand, but I did notice a smoother, more porcelain-like texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using, and if my results continue to be good, I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> just cuz it&#x27;s a nice mask when I want to relax.</li>
            <li> It removed everything from my pores, made my skin feel nice and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and it really does work great!</li>
            <li> The one from Sephora was incredible, it cleared my face right up.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this out because of all the great reviews it had gotten.  </li>
            <li> I still feel like it&#x27;s worth using for the pore diminishing effects alone!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> smells great and is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used in a long time</li>
            <li> This one comes off very easily with warm water and</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly once applied and skin looked and felt great immediately afterward.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and a great product.</li>
            <li> Its super great</li>
            <li> It goes on well, dries quickly, smells great, and does what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Theres&#x27; something really satisfying about being able to see the oil it extracts from my pores!  </li>
            <li> I have not used this type of mud mask before, so I made sure to look at reviews with step-by-step photos etc, but I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have this mask as it is totally amazing for combination skin!</li>
            <li> This mask was pretty good!</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the better your skin will be!</li>
            <li> Gets the gunk right out!!!</li>
            <li> My new favorite product!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best masked I have tried.</li>
            <li> The most effective I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s the most amazing mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The best of all clay mask out there really do what is should do , best for acne as well , definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the value and works great.</li>
            <li> So I guess it was well worth the money if it works and makes her happy.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they gave more for the price.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and pores almost invisible, but cleans them out good.</li>
            <li> Nice mask that is really refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Even though I haven&#x27;t seen wonderful results, I love the smell and process of using this product so much that I&#x27;ll probably try more glamglow products</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s lots of acidic type of natural ingredients that are so awesome for treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy and surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This product is so great I can see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use too!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!  </li>
            <li> worth the $70 price tag at sephora, but soooo very nice to get on here for $35.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, great price, and a great product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing, wonderful, and gross.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.....makes my skin amazing :)</li>
            <li> Also it is great that Amazon has such a great price for it.</li>
            <li> I apply it where patches are, and after waiting 10-20 minutes and removal, i am good for 4 to 5 days in the winter (1.5 to 2 weeks in the summer) without doing anything special to my face besides preventative care.</li>
            <li> Great product and its so much cheaper here on Amazon than at Sephora!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and when comparing prices you really can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
            <li> Amazing how this product has gotten rid of my blackheads love love love it.</li>
            <li> Great product for some but unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having magic mud in a bottle, I saw results very quickly with this product!</li>
            <li> mask is very smooth</li>
            <li> I washed my face and it was very smooth afterwards  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny and has made my skin pretty flawless!</li>
            <li> To be fair, I don&#x27;t have problem skin, so it might just be that I&#x27;m lucky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use I like it very much and gonna be my best product</li>
            <li> Good quality, shipping very fast!</li>
            <li> and I was super excited to get GlamGlow since I had heard so many great things.</li>
            <li> so she must love it.</li>
            <li> It really clears up chin bumps and turns into a great scrub when you wash it off with water and your hands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask and I will continue to repurchase it.</li>
            <li> The aztec mask has to be used at night because the pulsing makes your skin red for hours, this one makes your skin look perfect as soon as you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Love it can&#x27;t wait to buy more</li>
            <li> This is the best facial item you can try.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel after.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I had better masks for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and makes my pores tiny!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Love this item, you can feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> just need to use it more often</li>
            <li> but I appreciate it :-)  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The mask itself came in SUPERB condition, and it arrived earlier than stated/expected.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, I tried GlamGlow and have gotten SO MANY COMPLIMENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, the foil that was supposed to seal the jar was already peeled off and was just set on top.</li>
            <li> The indian clay mask works better than this</li>
            <li> Ahhhh I love this stuff 😍</li>
            <li> but it costs 10 times more.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I tried adding more water to reconstitute it, but I just got a chunky watery mixture.</li>
            <li> wish the smell was better</li>
            <li> Safe to say I will not be buying this ever again or buying anything from cosabeauty.&lt;br /&gt;Update: The seller refunded 50%.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> and I love the way it feels when it is applied.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels when I take it off, but it hasn&#x27;t improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again. :)</li>
            <li> I think I like this one better.</li>
            <li> love it love it love.</li>
            <li> You can see you skin is way much better than before.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> Love it it worked so well</li>
            <li> It shrinks pores and makes your skin smooth and glow!</li>
            <li> Love this product  Your skin will love it too.  </li>
            <li> Worked okay on blackhead.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li> i just love glam glow</li>
            <li> its ok, doesn&#x27;t pull anything out of my pores like advertised.</li>
            <li> the more I used it the better my skin got.  </li>
            <li> top of it all, I didn&#x27;t see any sort of improvement to my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer and smoother than it had in many years.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it helps my skin look so much better when I think to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I put the mask on after a shower when my skin would be most receptive to the mask and all of its ingredients.</li>
            <li> Even after a night out with cream and makeup, my face looks a million times better.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> You cannot tell from the picture how awesome is the white box that packages this product.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the spa feeling.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cleansing products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously magic mud.</li>
            <li> The best reviews I found were on You-Tube, especially because there are tutorials.</li>
            <li> It was purchased as a gift for my mom, she says she loves it and that has helped a lot with your skin problems, I have not used myself, but looks good, has clear instructions, good presentation and arrived at scheduled time</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mask.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe I need more than one application to see the results that others did</li>
            <li> If you have the money to spare and want to try this out for yourself then ok, otherwise I suggest looking for something else.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure their is another product out there</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s just OK and overpriced.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and after just two treatments my face looked so much better.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d buy it more often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic, but temporary magic.</li>
            <li> the more</li>
            <li> I will for sure be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Love it love it</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Love the way skin feel afterwards</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> The smell is not horrible, I love the feel of it on my face</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I thought the product was OK.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easiest to apply with a makeup brush so the oil from your fingers don&#x27;t interfere with what the mask is designed to do! :)</li>
            <li> I hope you have a better result</li>
            <li> It made my skin more oily and caused me to have more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I also love that I can see the mask pulling all the dirt out of my skin, and I also leave it as a spot treatment overnight.</li>
            <li> Wanted to love it, but won&#x27;t be subjecting myself to that again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolutely phenomenal product and has become a staple to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I even think my pores a getting more dirtier.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, there was mud around the edge and on the underside of the top.</li>
            <li> was looking some what better</li>
            <li> I will be buying more and more of this</li>
            <li> The product is okay.</li>
            <li> Does EVERYTHING it says it will and more.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than the mud treatment I had at a spa (birthday gift).  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s vegan</li>
            <li> Using the two products together, I have never had better skin in my life.  </li>
            <li> The Glamglow clears everything from my skin, reduces pores, exfoliates, and then the Bel Essence hydrates my skin better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> tried.mglow clears everything from my skin, reduces pores, exfoliates, and then the Bel Essence hydrates my skin better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> but it will make your skin breathe and feel better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin felt after I rinsed the mask off.  </li>
            <li> As the mask was drying, I felt like it was pulling the oil out of more pores.</li>
            <li> It works much better than I thought.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can honestly see the mask pulling buildup from your pores as it dries, and when you wash it off your skin feels soooo smooth.</li>
            <li> Hopefully when I run out, I won&#x27;t need to order more, but if I have to, I</li>
            <li> Buy it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I like the product, however I didn&#x27;t get the results that many others did.</li>
            <li> and I consider it more of a splurge.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> Fastest shipping ever &amp; free!</li>
            <li> and I put this mask on and it takes most of it out.</li>
            <li> this face pack is just okay</li>
            <li> and surely overpriced!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do any miracles</li>
            <li> so I imagine I&#x27;ll be able to use it for a while.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a clay mask, I&#x27;m sure you can find something alot cheaper (this product retails for $69.00 in the stores) that will work just as well.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m sure you could do it more often, but my skin seems to react to everything</li>
            <li> Why do so many people like this product?</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, most of those people get a lot of items for free and don&#x27;t always give honest reviews.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have been hearing all the hype about this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but it&#x27;s freaky to watch the stuff come out of your pores.</li>
            <li> And not so magic to lighten my complexion.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best facial masks I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love how it pulls oils out of the pores.</li>
            <li> I was anticipating a product that cleared out pores more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using this because I am hoping that there will be a cumulative effect and the more I use it the better my pores will be.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> It is 100% authentic-</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite masks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I just received my Glamglow today and I am already in love.</li>
            <li> I have many friends who own this product, and I am so happy to finally have my own.</li>
            <li> I love that this mask shows you where your face is dirtiest.</li>
            <li> I love the product..</li>
            <li> skin comes into contact with so many toxins throughout the day:</li>
            <li> But it turns out I love it.</li>
            <li> It works OK</li>
            <li> I Love Amazon</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s my all time favorite one stop shopping</li>
            <li> In one treatment, my skin is getting better.</li>
            <li> That said, I love this mask.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because of the price, not performance-if money is not a factor for you, then you will probably love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I am not 100% sure if it is their product or just how Glam Glow packages their product..</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying love love love....</li>
            <li> it leaves your face feeling smooth, glowing, and amazing...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> always finds a better deal.</li>
            <li> I saw glam glow on Pinterest and it looked interesting.</li>
            <li> I love my glamglow mask.</li>
            <li> so will see how it does after more uses.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this face mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just a pricey product to not be in love</li>
            <li> But more gunk on the strip compared to using it alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I got it</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> And I love it.</li>

            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> and i think it had more twigs in there than needed.</li>
            <li> \&lt;br /&gt;You will love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I would say the product is okay.</li>
            <li> A LOT which causes more oil production...</li>
            <li> It is simply fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love Glam Glow.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>

            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now.</li>
            <li> With more use I&#x27;ll determine if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>

            <li> TO PROMOTE SUCH EXTRAVAGANT RESULTS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE.&lt;br</li>

            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love looking at my pores after I&#x27;ve had it on for awhile.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did leave my face nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Of course I would love to see a price reduction, who wouldn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> Speaking of chemicals, I&#x27;ve read elsewhere that the ingredients in this really aren&#x27;t great for your skin.</li>
            <li> After you use it you can literally see the immediate difference and your face feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> but I always follow with a toner to be sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> this is the same stuff i get from online sephora and its great!</li>
            <li> I had some of the &amp;#34;oil spots&amp;#34; in places on my cheeks and forehead that I did not expect, and I almost feel as if those pores are MORE visible than before, though that may be just because the mask brought their existence to my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And when it dries on top of the pores it makes them stand out...</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> I use this mask weekly and love the results I&#x27;m seeing because of it.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask.</li>
            <li> Also I love when you have it on you can see it working.</li>
            <li> This mask was fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Many people have been telling me my face  has been glowing.</li>
            <li> I wish it sucked out more gunk than it does.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to all my friends who use masks too &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> be using often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> The mask felt really great on, but it didn&#x27;t pull much out of my pores and I felt like I broke out more after using it.</li>
            <li> Product had leaked out of the slit and was smeared all over the top as well.</li>
            <li> everything looks better</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on so much better the two days after.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use a foundation brush to apply...much better than finger</li>
            <li> I would recommend kerstin florian mud, which I had much better results.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> is very refreshing and cool.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Love this product, it can be bought in some make-up stores</li>
            <li> but you will pay more.</li>
            <li> Even the guys who would never admit they&#x27;ve used it love it.</li>
            <li> I need more.</li>
            <li> Clogged pores look more bumpy</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this on here before Sephora picked it up as a line staple.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love the price even better.</li>
            <li> am I glad she did.</li>
            <li> I have been an esthetician for 10 years and this mask is even better than the pharmaceutical grade masks I have used at work.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy more for my stubborn skin.</li>
            <li> It heals and calms my cystic acne and blemishes and makes my skin feel amazingly smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> tend to get a rash from many products but this one has given me no reaction at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an AWESOME facial mask!</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I just love the results, I was looking for an all in one mask that would treat all my skin problems.</li>
            <li> I could never justify the price, but my curiosity finally got the best of me.</li>
            <li> There are things you can purchase at Walgreens that work better than this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin in a lot more smoother.</li>
            <li> and I think my pores and texture of my skin are looking much better.</li>
            <li> Great product, but very pricey for what you get.  </li>
            <li> It just keeps getting better with each use.</li>
            <li> I took pictures but wasn&#x27;t able to upload them to this review.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I&#x27;ve had a couple of tours of Accutane that made it much, much better.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, most of what I&#x27;ve tried works better for preventing acne, but not so well after it&#x27;s popped up.  </li>
            <li> It was indeed interesting to see.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the results.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this before I run out:)</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> However, I used it anyway and for the results I have seen in my skin&#x27;s texture and the $20 I am saving, I&#x27;m okay with</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love the mask.</li>
            <li> Love the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It cleaned most of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> When I wash it off my skin feels so much better and cleaner, and so many blackheads were gone.</li>
            <li> Even better is that here on Amazon this product is a lot cheaper than I&#x27;ve seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li> my favorite face mask on the market.</li>
            <li> Overall, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the product</li>
            <li> , the better it works...would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Also...when I received mine, the top layer was already semi-dried out.</li>
            <li> This mask is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love how you can literally watch the dirt being removed from your face even after washing it.  </li>
            <li> I love love love how my face feels.</li>
            <li> Pores were noticeable smaller and complexion looked wonderful</li>
            <li> more case of hope springs eternal.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the results .</li>
            <li> my texture looked immediately better.</li>
            <li> i brought one in hk store , which contained more leaves than the one from here .</li>
            <li> And this is more watery</li>
            <li> Love this mask</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from amazon because the price was better than sephora.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was recommended to me by a friend a my nail salon, and I am so glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> This product is EXCELLENT in getting rid on pimples, and especially at the onset of a breakout.</li>
            <li> I love and need to buy more soon.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this mask?</li>
            <li> but nothin my favorite moisturizer could not fix.</li>
            <li> This product is okay...</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> face mask is nice, it makes your skin smooth and gets very clean.</li>
            <li> , my face felt so clean and soft after using, this was the best price i could find</li>
            <li> I also own a Clarisonic which has been helping to keep those pores clean.</li>
            <li> main thing I like is that it&#x27;s great for spot treatments</li>
            <li> But in reality - nothing has been pulled out of your pores - you just have some nice clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> It been two weeks of using it every couple days and its turning my skin back to its original bright and beautiful self.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this treatment after seeing it all over the internet and having heard great things.  </li>
            <li> definitely nice to have though I use it when I have any special occasion or pictures taken</li>
            <li> and I can see her skin clearing up, which is great for a 14 year old!!</li>
            <li> is all it says it is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been putting on a full face mask once a week since receiving this product &amp; my skin feels amazing &amp; is clearer.&lt;br /&gt;Fewer</li>
            <li> like most people are saying :) its basically a nice mask that leaves you with a fresh face feeling but isnt a miracle working solution.</li>
            <li> First the mask worked like all the good reviews and hype said it would.</li>
            <li> I feel like I could find things that work just as well for cheaper, but with the discounted price it is a pretty good purchase.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> Purchasing it from Amazon was also a good idea because if you get it at Sephora it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> This mask is very soothing and has a cooling tingle, and smells nice!</li>
            <li> First off, i loved it.</li>
            <li> the results are instant and amazing !!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered GLAMGLOW from amazon, and it is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep on for a full 20 minutes (even after it dries) and you will be amazed!</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This is Definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the splurge!!</li>
            <li> It is a bit spendy, BUT worth EVERY penny!!</li>
            <li> Its amazing really deep cleans your face and its great for spot treatments also .</li>
            <li> Clears up most breakouts very quickly.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product and does a good job cleaning your skin on a deep level.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> New favorite beauty product!!</li>
            <li> You can see immediate results and see the blackheads and pores being sucked clean!</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using this treatment!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is also good at shrinking large or noticeable pores.  </li>
            <li> Very true to its hype.</li>
            <li> Glamglow is on the top of my list, and I love that you can SEE the dirt coming right out of your pores!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask it leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it primarily just on my nose and forehead, which are my problem-areas, and that seems to be working well. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it four times so far and each time I&#x27;m just as happy as the time before.</li>
            <li> but i love how it makes your skin feels smooth and blowy afterwards</li>
            <li> I have used this glamglow mask several times from Sephora samples and from friends, and it has been incredible for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Yes, my pores are diminished, but more importantly, my breakouts are gone.</li>
            <li> More importantly, I think it just isn&#x27;t the product for my skin type.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it has reduced my acne almost completely.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been pretty impressed  </li>
            <li> Really happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> It is worth the cost of the treatment just to obtain the star spangled box - if you like that kind of thing.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much</li>
            <li> I liked this product as first glance, it smells nice and feels cool when put on your face.</li>
            <li> But they are both good products and buying them off of Amazon is much cheaper than Sephora.</li>
            <li> but it was good to try, but did not heal any of my existing pimples or really do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> Took the stubborn blackheads right off my face...worth the price!!  </li>
            <li> The mask didn&#x27;t dry my face out which was surprising in a good way.</li>
            <li> Amazing product right here</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and it keeps my skin looking beautiful!</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, you can see the difference on your face, I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I bought the full size from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Really cool when it dries!</li>
            <li> but t significantly makes your skin look better.</li>
            <li> It is a more pricy mask but believe me it is seriously worth it!</li>
            <li> Other than that, i was very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> &quot; SO TRUE!</li>
            <li> out of my pores was so cool!  </li>
            <li> As of recently i&#x27;ve been using it as a spot treatment, and good lord almighty does it work!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really cool to see it working!</li>
            <li> I love how clean my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite scent, but masks aren&#x27;t really there to smell amazing.</li>
            <li> It is easy to spread on and to wash off.  </li>
            <li> Whereas I just like to keep my face clean and blemish free, not to mention youthful!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> Easy rince off with water.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This product is pretty great, I noticed a difference within the first use.</li>
            <li> wow I really was impressed with this mask.</li>
            <li> And I love seeing my pores clean themselves out.</li>
            <li> but when I compared this product to one that I had bought at sephora, it did not smell as strong, or have a seal.</li>
            <li> It has a strong eucalyptus smell that reminds me of the coast of Northern California.</li>
            <li> loved it when I first used it &amp; thought it was so cool that you could see the places where it was working</li>
            <li> Very cool to see the stuff that comes out of your pores float to the surface - leaves skin smooth immediately after,</li>
            <li> Well this stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it my skin had an amazing glow....</li>
            <li> Amazing resutls from the first use</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full retail price for this.</li>
            <li> I liked this product from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it on Amazon instead of paying full price for it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it i saw a noticeable difference in the size of my pores and i really liked the tingling sensation it gives.</li>
            <li> We leave it on for the full 20 minutes and you will see the stuff that comes out of your pores pooling on top of the mud.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried this on its own -</li>
            <li> I really liked the product at first</li>
            <li> This makes it the perfect mask to do right before an important event, such as a wedding or a presentation.</li>
            <li> It is so amazing my skin is more clear and softer after one time!!</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as fine as I would like</li>
            <li> In reality, when I started applying it, the product was light and easily spreadable.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed fine until I opened it and tried to use it</li>
            <li> My husband is always like... \\&quot;wow that&#x27;s cool, but I don&#x27;t understand how it works\\&quot;, lol.</li>
            <li> it was fine.</li>
            <li> My skin looks like fine porcelain.  </li>
            <li> I love Glam Glow Super Mud Clearing Treatmeat.</li>
            <li> so it might work people with more mild acne?</li>
            <li> For reference i&#x27;m a teenager with mild acne, mostly whiteheads along my cheeks and chin and neck...</li>
            <li> My skin is bright and clear!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing has a slight minty smell and just feels so great on your skin.</li>
            <li> Works great and clears up my skin and makes it super soft in just a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> Read many reviews about how amazing this product was, and decided to try it, while silently praying it truly worked because it is very pricey..let me tell you it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> My skin is still so smooth and bright, and it feels very soft.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, I wish they made large portions that don&#x27;t cost a million dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been blessed with nice skin, and have always had issues with large pores and a little redness, even despite my best efforts.</li>
            <li> After the very first use I could see (and feel!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little better than a grocery store clay mask, but not so much better as to warrant the greatly elevated price.</li>
            <li> Everywhere I put this &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34;, huge spots of acne emerged.</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge difference in the apparence of my blackheads after 1 use.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re all huge fans.</li>

            <li> I use it about once a week &amp; have not noticed a huge difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through menopause &amp; my face has been having breakout issues, but this has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and I can already see a huge difference in the amount of blackheads I have.</li>

            <li> Fantastic for spot treatment on sore pimples.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, nor do I care, why this seller got this to me so cheap</li>
            <li> mask itself is refreshing, leaves me skin feeling freshly scrubbed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> liked this product, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonable cleansing mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Label warns against increased light sensitivity so wear some SPF (we should be doing that anyways).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Package came on time, which was great, but the product had obviously been opened and used before.</li>
            <li> Skin is silky smooth and pores are unclogged after one use.</li>
            <li> This muck made my face feel so smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Recipe available online.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did experience some light break outs around my chin after using the product yesterday, but I applied some of the mask as a spot treatment and the cleared up over night.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost, better price than purchasing it a Sephora.</li>
            <li> Does absorb oil, does make your skin smooth, and does help with loosening up debris clogging your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>

            <li> This is a fantastic product that I will repurchase again and again.</li>
            <li> They simply have  great skin</li>
            <li> Overall great product, I&#x27;m seeing improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t require much to render amazing results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using the product.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a spot treatment primarily now, in an effort to conserve the mud/cream.</li>
            <li> I read about this product for months on various blogs and heard nothing but great things.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great product just wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li> works well leaving my face smooth and refreshed with</li>
            <li> It does make your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the size of the product would be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I hoped for the best but anticipated a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Overall a great mask to incorporate into my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin does glow with a fresh flush after using.  </li>
            <li> Once you wash it off, your skin feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Really fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Pores are minimized and face looks so smooth.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH AND HAVE NOTICED ANY BLACKHEADS HAVE DIMINISHED.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing about this product that is worth more than $10.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> and you get 2 packets of each type of glamglow, also the shipping was free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried the supermud, and it makes your skin feel great, but not a miracle treatment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this has gotten such great reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap, so I didn&#x27;t want to pay the Sephora prices, but I was a bit hesitant to buy this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is such a great mask..</li>
            <li> It smells great, like I was getting a facial at a spa.  </li>
            <li> After each use my face feels refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes the $$ more worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s important to know that a clearing mask WILL cause you to break out in a day or two.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works nicely and you can really see it pulling the gunk out of your pores.</li>
            <li> Probably better off just buying the real thing at Sephora for $10 dollars more.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had really good results with this product so far.  </li>
            <li> My face feels super clean, smooth and tighter!</li>
            <li> I have always had larger pores on my nose and blackheads and after reading so many good reviews on this product and a friend&#x27;s recommendation, I decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it one star is because it smells good and feels refreshing when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> My face feels super clean after applying and rinsing, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Worth the price, face became very smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li> It gets a lot of the gunk out right away and, after continued use, my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> the gunk out of your pores&amp;#34; and being able to see the stuff coming out right before your eyes.</li>
            <li> overall a great well worth buy!</li>
            <li> If you use the full face application as opposed to the spot treatment option it runs out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Super-Mud has a pleasant fragrance, which is barely noticeable -</li>
            <li> Overall I am in LOVE with GLAMGLOW!!</li>
            <li> It is very useful.</li>
            <li> Its great to see all the circles of cleaned out pores on your face and the way it leaves your skin after, super soft and vibrant -- AMAZINGGGGG!!!</li>
            <li> Seller sent product quickly and it arrived in perfect condition for less then what I would have paid if I had gone to the store to purchase it.</li>
            <li> The only kind of acne it doesn&#x27;t seem to drastically help is cystic acne, but otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many high end products including philosophy microderm and kinerase, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It starts to make my skin feel very tight while I&#x27;m using it, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference after the first time like many people had said.</li>
            <li> and it would always leave my face feeling clean and so so smooth.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly at minimizing your pores (which is the main reason I wanted to try it)</li>
            <li> Used about 12 times makes your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Ordering &amp; delivery quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s like a magic wand, and kinda gross how much oil it absorbs but really good for skin.</li>
            <li> I loved it, but they need to find a better container to put this in so it doesn&#x27;t dry out and get all crusty.</li>
            <li> Overall though, flippin&#x27; amazing!</li>
            <li> It is a good product and it makes my skin smooth and clear, but is it worth spending almost $50 dollars for it?</li>
            <li> when i received mine it was water downed and not like the original one you buy at Sephora</li>
            <li> What I will tell you is that I am VERY pleased and surprised at the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An examination with a 10x mirror showed no whiteheads and significantly shrunken pores.</li>
            <li> Benonite is significantly cheaper and has works wonders.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this after reading all the glowing reviews</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> but I was too excited to care</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I have pretty healthy skin</li>
            <li> I love this mask so much!</li>
            <li> I notice when I do my pours look smaller, my skin feels better, and I look much better too!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this clearing treatment; however, it has done nothing for my skin any time I have used it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has the original GLAMGLOW mask (the tingling &amp; exfoliating one)</li>
            <li> My face looks like a post-apocalyptic hellscape every time I use this stuff, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried the product yet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s already used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just use the suggested amount and it will make your money worth it!</li>
            <li> Admittedly, the first time you use this you will see the most results.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> It took about two weeks of use (one use a week) for me to notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly and would say its worth the tag!</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> She loved it and apparently her husband does too.</li>
            <li> I figured it was truly more hype than anything, but this really works well!</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> This is worth the price!</li>
            <li> WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> My husband used a Biore blackhead strip, saw so much more of a result from the strip that this treatment (and much cheaper too!).  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this when I read about it online.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product</li>
            <li> Not like the original.</li>
            <li> I am sure we are paying for the packaging that comes with the mask, because the info card is so pretty.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my glam glow</li>
            <li> I have samples of the original product from Sephora and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> When I got it I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my blackheads have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this mask, my blackheads weren&#x27;t all cleared up, but most of them were to the surface</li>
            <li> This stuff is on the pricy side, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I was really excited after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with many, many products in my many years, and I have never seen one that made my pores visibly smaller!  </li>
            <li> Makes your face feel great, does not clear blackheads.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Worth having!</li>
            <li> Worth all the hype!</li>
            <li> The other mask by glam glow smells better, but I honestly think this one might be better for my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, this mask is great and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or cause it to break out after use.</li>
            <li> Yes it will clean my skin well</li>
            <li> kind of late lol</li>
            <li> but it did make my skin super smooth after washing it off</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help to clean my pores like it says and make my skin &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; after using it.</li>
            <li> the clean feel it leaves, but for the price I&#x27;m not blown away.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed, my skin hadn&#x27;t looked that clean in years.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean after.</li>
            <li> and it eventually dawned on me that I should use toner after the mask to help clean out any mask residue in my pores.</li>
            <li> it gets the skin really clean</li>
            <li> i would not use more than 2-3 times a week (just because it may cause the skin to be more sensitive and increasing the chance of clogging up your pores.</li>
            <li> calcium bentonite clay available on amazon is far much effective than this and cost just 7 dollars and some cents for a pound.&lt;br /&gt;Further</li>
            <li> I ordered Glam Glow on a recommendation from a friend, as I was looking for a beauty product that would help clean out and shrink my pores as well as address the &amp;#34;orange</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, plus it smells natural and great!</li>
            <li> wanted this to clean out the pores on my T.zone and close them up.</li>
            <li> Gives your face a really clean feeling in just 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really clean out my pores as well as Biore.  </li>
            <li> They also make a matching cleanser that literally makes your skin feel so clean once you use it.  </li>
            <li> It just makes your skin feel so clean and toned and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> There should be a foil safety seal, sealing your product and keeping it clean and moist.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product, it is soft and light yet effective.</li>
            <li> I used a clean foundation brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> It put my pores clean up.</li>
            <li> lets just say my face was not as clean as I thought it was..</li>
            <li> but after I wiped it clean</li>
            <li> Not to mention my skin felt incredibly clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> The shipping was excellent,  even though it was standard, it still came early.</li>
            <li> I apply this mask to my clean face, let it sit for 15-20 mins, and rinse.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would clean out and shrink my pores like it claimed, but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all.</li>
            <li> My skin did not looked like my pores where all sucked clean.</li>
            <li> after using it it leaves my face smooth, and it does give me a nice glow but as far as clearing up acne and blackheads this product just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2. smells very natural with a nice fragrant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mask, pretty straight forward but the best thing about these tutorials is that these girls wear makeup regularly.</li>
            <li> Lush sells a chocolate mask for way cheaper and works better!</li>
            <li> and my skin is clear and smooth!!</li>
            <li> My skin was very smooth after using the mask, but I didn&#x27;t really see the oils being &amp;#34;sucked&amp;#34; out of my skin as I&#x27;ve seen this product advertised.</li>
            <li> Having paid full price elsewhere the first time, I was very happy to find it for less on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it doesnt seem too special too me.</li>
            <li> As it is, the ingredients list doesn&#x27;t have anything really special.</li>
            <li> Not anything special.</li>
            <li> but what makes this one special is the tightness that it gives your face along with a glow</li>
            <li> My problem is large pores and blackheads that I have never been able to get rid of no matter what I try.</li>
            <li> Biore sells special &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; strips for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I purchased it right away, I think I found my miracle!</li>
            <li> so i moisturize right away!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soo smooth after the first use!</li>
            <li> It seems to dry the acne out and while it doesn&#x27;t go away quickly, it seems to greatly diminish its appearance over night.  </li>
            <li> , you can see it working, and your skin will feel smooth, clean, and fresh after.  </li>
            <li> At first when it arrived, although in great time, I suspect it had been opened before and quite possibly used.  </li>
            <li> When I was washing it off my face began burning and turned bright red.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin SO soft and it has an amazing texture.</li>
            <li> Works pretty darn good, makes your skin soft and clears out your pores.</li>
            <li> You know, the product wasn&#x27;t as a great as I expected.</li>
            <li> product is what expected and did everything that I wanted to do and no problems with shipping and just great with product</li>
            <li> To buy friends, she said after the use super good, show me the photo works, the black head on nose less, she is very happy, when discounted buy price is cheap</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I have had no issues with sensitivity and my face is always calm and smooth after a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> My advice: buy clay for health and beauty from a natural pharmacy and make your own mask.</li>
            <li> hey if its good enough for Hollywood, its good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I use this as a full mask once a week and do spot treatments during the week.</li>
            <li> I will buy from this seller again when I need more, thank you soooo much.</li>
            <li> and you could absolutely tell where I had put on the product for many hours after its use.</li>
            <li> I thought, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not going to be this magical cure-all mud that makes your problem skin vanish overnight.&amp;#34; And it wasn&#x27;t, but it does its job very well.</li>
            <li> This formula definitely stirs things up under your skin but in a good way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got lucky or if they decided to stop opening the containers but mine came sealed and clean and in the cutest packaging.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that the hype is all true.</li>
            <li> My favorite mask in the whole world</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool because you can SEE it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product goes on cool and tingly.</li>
            <li> This stuff really seems to work better than any product I have used.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product because it really cleans out your pores.</li>
            <li> more if you really want to use charcoal for face pack one can buy charcoal capsules and make a facepack out of that.</li>
            <li> this was a good product and you definitely feel it working</li>
            <li> I purchased GlamGlow after hearing rave reviews but did not want to pay full price.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit off and does not work like the true glam glow mask.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> It looks cool when it dries but why pay just for that.</li>
            <li> my face is softer and super clean</li>
            <li> This mask works best if you use it at least 3 days a week.  </li>
            <li> You can see all the oil in your pores being extracted from your skin, and it&#x27;s kinda cool and gross.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite products, highly recommend !</li>
            <li> When I got it,, it almost full out</li>
            <li> I have done two full masks two or three days apart, and twice I have used it as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> When I tried it I absolutely loved it, my face felt smoother, pores were instantly smaller</li>
            <li> My skin is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel super clean.</li>
            <li> After receiving a pre-opened, pre-used product, I drove my butt to Sephora and bought one at full price.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous face mask, worth every</li>
            <li> My face always feel super clean after I use it, but</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it, but after the second and third time I was even more impressed.</li>
            <li> I have used as a spot treatment and full mask.</li>
            <li> and they are all true.</li>
            <li> It has helped clear up my skin and give it a nice radiant glow.  </li>
            <li> and it really seemed to improve the vibrance of my skin and make my (recently more noticeable) pores appear</li>
            <li> It also goes a good job at clearing up my pores and making them appear smaller.</li>
            <li> Either way, I won&#x27;t buy from Amazon again and will just pay full price at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and cant really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> - I suppose it&#x27;s an ok mask, but don&#x27;t expect to be really wowed.</li>
            <li> I will order from Sephora where it is for sure the real thing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to do a full mask</li>
            <li> (yes it comes in the cool box)</li>
            <li> Product probably works really well for most people.  </li>
            <li> gone!!!!I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should spend so much on a product if I didn&#x27;t know how it work because on the website it was about $70 and when I saw it on here I had to get it.</li>
            <li> Even though it was kind of gross to see how much oil was being drawn from my skin, I liked to see that it was working so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Have it to two other friends as a birthday gift and they were super happy with it and felt it was original.</li>
            <li> Works great on black heads,  leaves the skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Washing the mask off was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It is strong when you first put it on</li>
            <li> Compared to borghese&#x60;s fango, this one is more gentle, and as fresh and clean as&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews the scent is very appealing and the mask does</li>
            <li> Lets just say all the hype is true but then again it may not be all that great to other people.</li>
            <li> For the price, I make sure to save it for only the most special occasions.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews where people experienced break outs after use.</li>
            <li> My skin felt amazing after the first use and I&#x27;ve used it a couple more times since then over the last week.</li>
            <li> i rather pay a little more at sephora to receive good quality.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet tried using it as a preventative measure since the cost is pretty high, but am LOVING it as a spot treatment after my skin has flared up.  </li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve figured what I&#x27;d get for the price but the real product is worth it!!</li>
            <li> Glam glow leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Your skin feel clean and fresh after .</li>
            <li> It looks fresh squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The feeling afterwards is CLEAN &amp; FRESH.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly through the mail and provider who sent it so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> and I quickly forgot about it as it got lost in my sample abyss.</li>
            <li> I WILL GET MY MORE BACK :)</li>
            <li> you can actually see it pulling the oil and gunk out of your pores, which is simultaneously gross and awesome.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and was hoping that GlamGlow would rid that</li>
            <li> but it should&#x27;ve come in that condition while it&#x27;s listed as \\&quot;New.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY FROM \\&quot;SUPER</li>
            <li> Likely to order 1 more time because of price in hopes of better results this time</li>
            <li> I bought from Super Deals</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel super clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I use that and the mask once a week and my acne reduces tremendously and so does the redness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product,  though it is very pricy , it is worth every dime.</li>
            <li> Once u rinse your face it feels super clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I try lots of beauty products and rarely am impressed enough to purchase a second jar of anything.  </li>
            <li> super shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for Glam Glow Super Mud all over the web, including Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had something work so effectively, so QUICKLY on my skin.</li>
            <li> It has reduced my scarring and helped my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li> It truly works and clears your skin quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice and tight and really clean looking once I&#x27;m done washing my face!!</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended for ANYONE to use to get a healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong and strange kind of aroma to it</li>
            <li> It has lactic acid and 3 other very effective acids in it.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin beautiful and super tight (like radiant baby skin) but is it worth it?</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the purchase, the future will continue to buy</li>
            <li> overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> On the very first use I noticed change in my face</li>
            <li> After the very first use I noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but this one is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail, and more pleased when i actually used the product the first time.</li>
            <li> Makes my face so smooth and pretty.  </li>
            <li> I have normal, healthy skin</li>
            <li> I have only used it three times, but so far, so good!  </li>
            <li> Works super fast and brings blackheads to the surface!!</li>
            <li> i used it it dry on my face quickly and i dont feel good</li>
            <li> this is a great price compared to other stores!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how great my skin looked and other members of my family were begging me to let them use it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and am happy to report that she&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li> Better price than Sephora and brand new.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, I read the amazing reviews and it just seemed too good to be true, but let me tell you, its true!</li>
            <li> Works great for black heads.</li>
            <li> Got a great price on this product (half what I saw it else where)</li>
            <li> more than that it really zaps pimples fast!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and definitely after using it, you will notice your skin is soft and clean feeling however</li>
            <li> When I got it, the seal was leaking a bit, but it seemed more like this is just a small company without a good packaging process yet.  </li>
            <li> I freaking love this product, after one use all of my blackheads were pretty much</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t see much difference with my nose pores !!</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not lookin&#x27; too hot!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on pinterest and was excited to try.  </li>
            <li> However after my first application I decided I was still excited.</li>
            <li> So I was extremely excited to try this for the first time and when I washed it off my face....</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this mask, and the fact that amazon has it at such a discounted price is incredible, but I have to say it&#x27;s really not worth the price for</li>
            <li> and I did not get the first order!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to try this product!!!</li>
            <li> I needed a miracle and glamglow consistently comes through!</li>
            <li> I listened to all the reviews I had read- the first time you use this product you will be grossed out!</li>
            <li> It makes my face super soft, which i love.</li>
            <li> I found that the less I used the more effective it seemed to be.</li>
            <li> love it made my skin super soft</li>
            <li> GlamGlow is a little too proud of themselves.</li>
            <li> This cost so much in the stores and it seems odd to me that this seller can get such a great deal on this to be able to sell it to so many people.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so clean, fresh and really helps with acne and acne scars!</li>
            <li> It is fascinating to watch the oil seep through and turn the mask dark, and it does wash off clean.</li>
            <li> additionally I didn&#x27;t notice any significant positive results.</li>
            <li> it makes my face super soft, clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great, even pulled blackheads and stubborn white heads out with a few applications, also makes skin feel amazing.  </li>
            <li> I had heard from friends that this mask was amazing and it definitely exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see anything all that fantastic happen.</li>
            <li> After getting a sample from Sephora (That I got three uses out of, for free) I was ready to purchase.</li>
            <li> Glamglow itself is an amazing product, but this one was very obviously tampered with.</li>
            <li> You can SEE what it gets out of your pores, and its gross but also amazing.</li>
            <li> such a shame that although it was an amazing price it was an expired product BYE FELICIA</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews on this amazing product before I finally purchased a jar.</li>
            <li> In fact, I used it as a spot treatment on someone else to unclog a really clogged pore and it worked fabulously.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $60 price tag.</li>
            <li> my skin looks fresh</li>
            <li> It felt nice enough</li>
            <li> Worth its weight in GOLD.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny-</li>
            <li> The product itself is pricey but TOTALLY WORTH</li>
            <li> Overall I liked it but don&#x27;t know if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming or unbearable and I am particularly sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li> Im thrilled that someone I found on the internet actually did what it said it was supposed to!  </li>
            <li> You can see the oil being absorbed out of your pores.</li>
            <li> I have clear skin for the most part</li>
            <li> NOTTTTT worth it.  </li>
            <li> I always feel fresh and glowing after I use this mask</li>
            <li> When I take the mask off, my skin looks fresh and glowy for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> Product was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> My skin is more clear with a mud mask from Walmart .</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of make up and rarely go without anything on my face.</li>
            <li> and it will give me a nice refreshed skin the next day.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked this mud mask.</li>
            <li> id say it cleared my pores about 60% which is still pretty good and makes a pretty big difference.</li>
            <li> The instructions do say that it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li> I have to say, that this product is WORTH it.</li>
            <li> But the smell is worth the results.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but idk if it is worth them money.</li>
            <li> I noticed that there were distinct holes where my pores are</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> So far we&#x27;ve been pleased with he results.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I used it as soon as I got out of the shower when my pores were nice and open, immediately after I washed my face with the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the cash</li>
            <li> but overall its a really great product to help clear your skin, and make your face tighter.</li>
            <li> The only bummer is that my face is so smooth afterward, I just want to keep touching it</li>
            <li> I think this stuff, while pricey, is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> So far, I experienced any dryness, but again, I only have used on my problem areas.</li>
            <li> Everything came sealed and was fresh.</li>
            <li> I liked this item well enough to order more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> FOR  THE $$; YOU CAN HOLD THIS JAR IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND AND WASN&#x27;T WORTH THE $50!!!&lt;br /&gt;BAD</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Honestly it wash about the same as any mud mask except it smelt like licorice.</li>
            <li> so I could use it more frequently.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Im verrrrry oily and so far your able to see all the oils and dirt being sucked out of your pores.</li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the hype</li>
            <li> Fun for a mud mask party with friends.</li>
            <li> It is pricey but totallllly worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to see that it&#x27;s actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost all of this stuff already, and it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> However, it is fun to use and it feels like its working.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I already think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T LAUGH.</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, definitely worth the $$</li>
            <li> I know this is on the pricier side, but trust me, it is worth.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Rarely do I post reviews, but this product needed one.</li>
            <li> I have naturally nice skin (I never break out), but I have a big problem with clogged pores and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m honest, the results are short lived.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of gross to watch the impurities get pulled out of your pores.  </li>
            <li> Also, looks pretty cool when you have the specs all over your face.</li>
            <li> product is definitely worth the money - I probably get about 10 treatments per jar.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin supet soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> What I love about this:  when you rinse it off, your skin is SO soft.  </li>
            <li> and I was so so happy to find it here for HALF of that!</li>
            <li> I wanted it to live up to the hype of being the best facial product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that is just too much pressure to live up to.</li>
            <li> I have super super oily skin with large pores</li>
            <li> Ive used other maska before and never seem such awesome results!</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin feeling nice and smooth (like any other mud mask would do), but it doesn&#x27;t pull anything from your pores.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after the first use I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but 24 hours later there was a visible difference, and after a second use a couple days later my skin looked even better.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Glamglow Super Mud is a real treat!</li>
            <li> But it dries pretty quick</li>
            <li> While I liked the product just fine, I do not think this is a cure-all for large pores, though, and I will likely not be splurging again, as many masks can give you similar results.</li>
            <li> Other than that a good product.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to see significantly diminished blackheads around my nose and truthfully, I can&#x27;t really see that there is any difference in that respect at all.</li>
            <li> There is truly no comparing this to other masks, it&#x27;s that good. ...</li>
            <li> I wanted to be excited about it, I really did.</li>
            <li> I think I was just too excited to try it out to really notice or think anything fishy of it.</li>
            <li> It does everything it says it will, left my pores noticeably smaller, my face super smooth and bright.  </li>
            <li> , tried for about a month now, i have to say, this is the best mud mask i have ever try, I have a lot of stubborn black and white heads, and glamglow help me clear most of those out after 4-5 times use.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and glowing and super soft after every use!</li>
            <li> so I use it more often and use the GlamGlow when going to special events and such.</li>
            <li> I thought this was some miracle product that would suck the ick right out of my pores...</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer right after I used it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like I can feel it working right away.</li>
            <li> I was my brush right after the mask is applied</li>
            <li> Turns out, the critics were right.</li>
            <li> I had to go to the doctor right away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To see how well this mask drew impurities to the surface, I used a pore strip right after.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you right now this mask is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is right and the product works.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels right after I use it.  </li>
            <li> It literally pulls the JUNK out from your pores and shrinks your pores right up.</li>
            <li> It works well though and brings all impurities right to your skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li> right in the store.</li>
            <li> I had to take it off right away because the smell was so horrid, and I washed my face three times afterwards until I couldn&#x27;t smell the foul odor anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more effective than the products I have bought at walmart, because those had no effect what so ever, but this had a very little to no effect as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really helped minimize my pores so my skin looks smoothe and clean.</li>
            <li> on normal skin, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> People have commented on the smell, and I am a person who is very sensitive to smells, I get headaches if cosmetics or fragrances are too strong.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitiant at first because of the price, but I am so glad I decided to buy this stuff!!</li>
            <li> to watch it dry and see all of the oil being pulled out of your pores - it&#x27;s satisfying to see it working!</li>
            <li> I got trouble and combination skin type, I feel good after using it, it helps clean pretty well.</li>
            <li> in my opinion this is nothing of special it didn&#x27;t really solve any problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does do what it says, nice glow and super soft skin, but I think I would only use this product for special occasions.</li>
            <li> mud mask does an amazing job of pull out your black heads, impurities and just making your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, before I&#x27;ve finished applying it to my entire face in most cases.</li>
            <li> I do this mask as a weekly ritual and a more mild mask mid week.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a full size straight away.</li>
            <li> My skin continues to look better and better: skin tone is evening out, pores are much smaller, overall my face looks significantly \\&quot;healthier.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I do not use it very often, it is pretty strong, but when I need it, it really does the job.</li>
            <li> I just wish the container was a little bit better with more product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, it&#x27;s amazing for blackheads and generally clearing up your face.</li>
            <li> Mine weren&#x27;t as prevalent as I thought I guess because I already take such good care of my face, but when I washed it off I could immediately tell that it did indeed get a good deep down clean inside my pores.</li>
            <li> I have large pores, well, not anymore!</li>
            <li> Works amazing, doesn&#x27;t dry my face out at all</li>
            <li> I am hoping, over time, it will be more lasting but even if it isn&#x27;t it is well worth the effort and the cost.</li>
            <li> The whole point is to clear that stuff out, not add more.</li>
            <li> i apply the mask after cleansing my face with warm water and patting dry.</li>
            <li> It absolutely cleared out and tightened my pores and left my skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing off the mask, my skin was super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I paid $20 less and arrived in good condition through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It a nice mask, but does not live up to any of the claims made about it on the internet.</li>
            <li> It has done absolutely nothing for my enlarged pores, which was my main reason for buying this product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gross how much oil you can literally see it sucking out of your face, but amazing how much it will reduce the size of your pores once they become unclogged!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never had skin so smooth and clear!</li>
            <li> I like how it makes your face feel tight and makes it feel good</li>
            <li> You do not have to use very much.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I expected this to be a great product!</li>
            <li> I saw a huge difference after the first use and now my skin looks so clear!</li>
            <li> being said, a new, unopened jar of Glam Glow is my new favorite skin care item.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;SO, You really should try the sample first!</li>
            <li> but as I have gotten older I have developed a lot more dirt in my pores because of wearing make-up so often.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super cool and super gross all in one.</li>
            <li> As far as my breakouts, my skin looks better than it did in high school.</li>
            <li> Before I opened the box, I noticed that it was resealed with a new sticker on top of the original seal and when I opened the jar there was product already on the outside of the seal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the aztec healing clay mask, which a lot of people claim to be better, but I feel like they are both essential to my routine.</li>
            <li> Along with the after photos of how clear and smooth my skin had become.  </li>
            <li> and I really wished it lived up to it!</li>
            <li> I love it and only plan on using it once a week or so.</li>
            <li> Love it - definitely that coolest mask I have ever done.</li>
            <li> mask has remained consistent at thoroughly cleaning out my pores and reducing my blackheads.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical, this is a great price for this product, just try it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try it and bought it when the price dropped, but I&#x27;d say even then it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> your skin so soft and smooth, minimizes pores, really brings the oils out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> It works so well and leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> If they would properly grind the powder it would be easier to apply and it would probably release more of the beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was to purchase this again, it would be from a reputable retailer such as Sephora.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any allergies that I&#x27;m aware of either.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Help clear up and smooth your face.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> First time for using it.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says its going to do.</li>
            <li> I first bought it at Sephora but found it cheaper here</li>
            <li> I may try twice a week at first</li>
            <li> It can feel like burning at first  </li>
            <li> I got a sample from Sephora first and it lasted me 3 uses</li>
            <li> but this product shows how oily it really is!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered the smaller one to try it out first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice (at an interval of three days apart), but I already am in love.</li>
            <li> First, it is pricey.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it too often, mostly once a month as a facial.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands and types of masks and this one makes such a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have problematic skin tbh, but I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement anyways!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to wonder if the product sold by this seller is even authentic.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li> Overall I am extremely pleased, I have been trying this out on all of my siblings and friends.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> It cleans my face and leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> When I first rated this mask, I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this unless you plan on using the whole jar in a month!</li>
            <li> First time i tried it i thought, &amp;#34;MEH</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know Amazon was selling it for much cheaper so score!</li>
            <li> I purchased this through Neiman Marcus the first time and now will be purchasing online.</li>
            <li> Thanks GlamGlow !</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> The product was delievered fast!</li>
            <li> This mask is phenomenal, I have cystic acne which flares especially during my menstrual cycle after applying this mask it alleviates the redness and also pulls the bacteria from beneath my skin!!</li>
            <li> This has helped so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times, but I love how the product works.  </li>
            <li> so I made sure to put sunscreen on afterwards since I was headed outside.  </li>
            <li> So, this facial mask is ok.</li>
            <li> Besides that it shows your pores being cleaned out (Not a reason why I bought it, but it is horrying/cool), it really does work!</li>
            <li> Skin is noticeably clearer after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I get the EXACT same results using my Indian Healing Clay (Bentonite Clay also sold on Amazon) with a greater return.</li>
            <li> Although the mask appears to work when you first put it on, i did not notice a decrease in blackheads or an increase in clearer pores.  </li>
            <li> However, I think I had higher hopes that it would pull the blackheads out and it does not.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I do think that it still works but just not as well as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had breakouts on and off most of my life and now I use this mask once per week, use a clarisonic brush twice per week with Cerave soap and get a facial once per month</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how I would like this product, since I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand until recently.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I use this 2x a week and it has really helped with my acne!</li>
            <li> As for the product, it made me break out at first</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy again.</li>
            <li> Well, it absolutely does!</li>
            <li> I love face masks and have tried a bunch of different kinds.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample at Sephora for first time.</li>
            <li> This mask is giving her consistent results.  </li>
            <li> and I first bought it from Sephora.</li>
            <li> This product really cleans out your pores!</li>
            <li> First time no issues with product this time around product had been opened</li>
            <li> The product I was sent, however, was most definitely not it.  </li>
            <li> The packaging and consistency/texture of the product all seemed to be the same, but the product itself is nowhere near as good as the real glamglow mask.  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper than in the store and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> When I run out, I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> and strange!&lt;br /&gt;It almost looked like tar when I opened the jar for the first time.</li>
            <li> First use for 20min</li>
            <li> Sadly it&#x27;s not the miracle mask we were all hoping for.  </li>
            <li> shipping was also really fast and affordable to Australia!</li>
            <li> I have been threw many products, this one I actually like.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face nice and soft, my pores appear smaller and it gives me a fresh face feeling.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I want to give it more time to see how the clearing effects work with my skin.</li>
            <li> I am Irish-Italian and have pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It looked exactly like it did when I put it on there.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m willing to hope against hope that maybe it&#x27;ll take some time to get those pores cleared out.</li>
            <li> When I got the product in the mail, my first reaction was that the packaging is WAY oversized for the amount of product you receive...CARBON FOOTPRINT.</li>
            <li> Some of the spots continue to get bigger as more oil is sucked out from your skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels baby soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> The seal is for sure different.</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> It smells like liquorice which I don&#x27;t like so much but the benefits of the mask is totally worth the smell.</li>
            <li> definitely don&#x27;t spend more than $30-something to try this.</li>
            <li> since trying this, I finally got in with my dermatologist again and am on a legit prescription regimen that is working better.</li>
            <li> When this product goes on it feels fresh on your skin, maybe from the minty smell, and when it hardens it really shows all your pores.</li>
            <li> or if I just want my skin to look extra healthy for an event or something.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted for cheaper then department store prices.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this, my pores looks bigger and got some more acne. :</li>
            <li> The second day I used it and then used a nose strip and got a LOT more stuff out than using the nose strip alone.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy it at first because of the price.</li>
            <li> have only used it once and already see and feel a notable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> After using the mask exactly as directed, all of those characteristics amplified.</li>
            <li> My skin was slicker, more red, as though I was constantly blushing, and I had more spots than before.</li>
            <li> Not to be gross, but I get lots of satisfaction out of being able to see the product working (aka the gunk getting sucked out of my pores).</li>
            <li> and the next morning her skin already looked clearer and had a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> Kinda gross, but better out than in ;)</li>
            <li> It works exactly how it says it should.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what it says (for me anyways)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry if you break out the first 2 times you use it...</li>
            <li> pretty goods,i will buy it again</li>
            <li> I would buy again if I wasn&#x27;t broke ;)</li>
            <li> pretty good;therefore</li>
            <li> I took the risk of getting something tampered or fake for the price, but it was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> First off it has never done the &amp;#34;pulling out&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Definitely, I look energetic after i use it.</li>
            <li> I rarely give 5 Stars, but GlamGlow Super-Mud absolutely earned all 5 of them.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li> The first time i used it</li>
            <li> when you first out it on</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that this is not legit as the foil seal is definitely different than the official package that I got from Sephora.</li>
            <li> So you will look like some creature from the blue lagoon wannabe when using this - but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> It smells like exactly what it is - mud rubbed on your face.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried everything like me to get rid of blackheads, this mask will most likely not work for you!  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I would not purchase again simply because this is a high price when I feel like there are many equally effective products available for so much less.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and clear after each use!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very glad I could find it on Amazon for half the price especially not being totally in love with it.</li>
            <li> Today it finally arrived, I am very excited to try it out for the first time.</li>
            <li> good for black heads !</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and breakout for any thing, this product has help me so much!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin gets oily and very dry-- both very easily.  </li>
            <li> okay, it did reduce some size of pimples and seemed to open up my pores, but it certainly didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34; out blackheads.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice cooling feeling while you have it on, maybe due to the eucalyptus in it?</li>
            <li> I was super excited and I was telling all my friends about it and when it finally came in the mail I wanted to try it immediately</li>
            <li> The third time, when I removed the product my skin was bright red</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling soft, hydrated and amazing.  </li>
            <li> I am happy, and just ordered another one as my last one is almost empty.</li>
            <li> The only amazing thing about this product is how soft your skin gets when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> It gave my face a clean feeling after use, but it didn&#x27;t clear all the blackheads.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel so soft and so clean</li>
            <li> this product makes my face feel so soft &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> helps keep my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I complained to the seller about the product burning my face and the best they can do is give me &amp;#34;up to&amp;#34; 50% of my money back, as per their policy, and I have to pay for the return shipping.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my pores are definitely a ton smaller after using this a couple of times per week, and my skin looks really good.</li>
            <li> but I could feel my skin fresh after removing with the warm water once dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and buy from a reputable place where I know I am getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> also use this on my back (followed by a sand scrub) for the beach season or before wearing a low-back dress because it really makes the skin look clean/bright with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> The chin acne that I&#x27;ve never been able to fully clear up as an adult is clearing.</li>
            <li> GlamGlow has helped clear them out &amp; give me soft and smooth skin!  </li>
            <li> i love this mask, even though it smells not very good, but i love the result, it really help to refresh my skin</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and pretty large pores, and this mask works for me.</li>
            <li> skin definitely feels clean after use!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, dries quickly and my skin felt smooth and not dried out as other clay masks tend to make it feel.  </li>
            <li> This product is probably fantastic and you would be better off spending the extra money and buying it directly from Sephora to ensure that the product is indeed new.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cool, you can see the stuff it vacuums out of your pores but it doesn&#x27;t really pull the crud out completely.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> First use of this product will have you embarrassed at how much dirt lies within your pores.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it, i could see how much clearer my skin was.</li>
            <li> The first day it got here (and shipping was fast)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the visual results, but have to be care when applying due to the harden chuncks.</li>
            <li> The product arrived, I opened the container, and there was about an inch long SLIT in the tamper resistant top.</li>
            <li> I had heard about it on pinterest.com and was so interested in whether or not it really worked.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this for the first time because when I was browsing at Sephora another customer absolutely raved about using this as a spot treatment for breakouts.  </li>
            <li> and I love it to much thank you so much I will buy it again in the future</li>
            <li> Nice size jar, but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and after I do notice my skin is softer, but honestly this product is really not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t work for Biore--this is seriously the best method if you want to get rid off gross dug in blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in this particular product for a while, but never took the plunge to buy it because it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very dry and sensitive skin, with some stubborn areas that I break out in, but this mask felt very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Amazon definitely had it cheaper than most other outlets (reputable outlets</li>
            <li> This is such a cool mask!</li>
            <li> It made it feel fresh and new.</li>
            <li> Does dry out skin though so it cant be used more than once or twice a week depending on how sensative your skin is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping adding this to my skin are regimen will completely change my now apparent aging skin for the better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping adding this to my skin are regimen will completely change my now apparent aging skin for the better.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this, I had very realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by it being dry, keep it on, that&#x27;s when the magic happens.</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft</li>
            <li> super clear and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;our</li>
            <li> My own opinion is save yourself some bucks and stick with the products that cost less.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling super soft and looking radiant.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I&#x27;m very upset for paying so much for a product that did nothing the first 2 times of using it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy more since it isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> The inner jar and product still looked full and fresh.</li>
            <li> Not dramatic.</li>
            <li> I figured it was just another mask that wouldn&#x27;t do anything special since she didn&#x27;t hype it up too much, only said it was a hit right now.</li>
            <li> I read a LOT of the reviews, and couldn&#x27;t wait to see the oil being pulled from my large pores.</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> so I just use it on certain spots that pop up and leave it overnight.  </li>
            <li> Because it changes color in certain places when it dries, I can tell that it works.</li>
            <li> The large pores on my nose are shrinking.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores.</li>
            <li> but I have large pores.  </li>
            <li> and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and they seem.</li>
            <li> I was very eager to try this product from all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product but as usual am always skeptical when it comes to anything that sounds this great...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this product because it sounded almost too good to be true, but it lived up to the hype!</li>
            <li> I love facial masks, and trying new products that I hear about, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sad that I can&#x27;t use this as I&#x27;ve read some really great reviews out there.</li>
            <li> favorite part of the product is how my skin gets so much softer after a single use.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it once, it left my skin feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> but everything seems to be fine although i suspected the jar had been open because of the residue on the lid.</li>
            <li> She has tried other face masks in the past, but believes that this is the best one!</li>
            <li> Also pretty decent at removing blackheads.</li>
            <li> sure, it smells a bit strong (not sure why they had to add perfume), but it works!</li>
            <li> I know the price can seem high, but compared to prescription products which are also pricy, or cycling through cheaper products that don&#x27;t work, this seems pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strictly going to purchase this at Sephora and open it for the very first time by ME!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be any more effective than any number of other masks/treatments that I&#x27;ve purchased for much less money.</li>
            <li> This product really targets pores and leaves skin feeling soft and looking fresh.</li>
            <li> Inside the huge hexagonal box is a tiny jar.</li>
            <li> It removes easily and rinses away cleanly without too much harsh scrubbing.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it after reading a few amazing reviews.  </li>
            <li> These product was more than expected &amp; I would highly recommend to others (and I do)!</li>
            <li> It has made such a huge difference in quality of skin.</li>
            <li> The box is huge, but the product buried inside is tiny.  </li>
            <li> The box the product comes in, is huge compared to the actual product itself.</li>
            <li> REALLY DRAWS OUT</li>
            <li> and this really helps balance everything out.</li>
            <li> I have a sister, so I didn&#x27;t really care if someone else tested it out.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it and much cheaper than getting it at Sephora</li>
            <li> /&gt;i do not have severe acne or really oily skin</li>
            <li> I bought this really hoping it would get rid of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ,I like this mask</li>
            <li> I still have gotten acne from this and expected better result.</li>
            <li> very good,my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> It smells very herbal and licorice-like.</li>
            <li> Wish I have been using this my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Ive used it twice for whole face masks</li>
            <li> and I would say its very comparable to this GlamGlow.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference, but my friend who recommend the product did see a difference in my skin .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> haha...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this mask worked at all</li>
            <li> Really makes the skin glow.</li>
            <li> but this gets much deeper.  </li>
            <li> This really reduces the oil production.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally very oily, so of course I&#x27;m a pessimist in thinking anything could get rid of the oil AND blackheads all in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I thought for some reason that it would expel whiteheads from your pores, but it doesn&#x27;t do that, haha.</li>
            <li> It really just soaks all of the oils out of your pores.</li>
            <li> Even great for spot treatment for broken out areas, zits.  </li>
            <li> It really works just like</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying from Sephora.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I am really allergic to something in this mask.</li>
            <li> that* fast.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t taken much care of your skin</li>
            <li> Thought I cleansed my face very well</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with skin that feels just as smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Personally, I really like it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s twice as much</li>
            <li> Thank you so so so much.</li>
            <li> Please, go to Sephora and get the real product and save your money/heartache.</li>
            <li> Really does the job.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I can really see and feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I read rave reviews on this and for the price i expected much more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment too,</li>
            <li> nothing I&#x27;ve tried before has really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> This is a must for anyone that really likes to monitor and keep up with their skin care.</li>
            <li> I really thought this was my answer</li>
            <li> really like the smell of the mask.</li>
            <li> for the &amp;#34;shrinks pores&amp;#34; statement on this it really isn&#x27;t going to cause your pores to shrink.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask because</li>
            <li> its really cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> husband has really oily skin</li>
            <li> It will not get rid of acne and fix your skin that much</li>
            <li> The box says that these are the spots where the mask is absorbing dirt and oils from your pores.</li>
            <li> I apply the product with a spare foundation brush which really helps limit the amount of product you use.</li>
            <li> I want to know if I should be concern with the authenticity of this product, or is it pretty normal to receive the product with an unattached removable plastic lid.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed it off my pores were noticeably smaller and my skin felt silky smooth.</li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> so much cheaper from this vendor,</li>
            <li> I hope that I continue to see such fantastic results</li>
            <li> I suffer from very oiling and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It really a gets all the dirt and oil out and after two uses I&#x27;ve noticed fewer blemishes as well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> I received mine, it really does look like it had been tampered with.</li>
            <li> I expected so much more from this mask.</li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> It made a very noticeable difference on my nose which had a lot of blackheads that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> (healing clay results are the same: absorbs oil, does make your skin smooth, help with loosening up debris clogging your pores, and with continued usage does help with balancing your skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the label is right--you really don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> and you can see the results working straight away.</li>
            <li> The hype over this product is a bit much.</li>
            <li> Really helps with breakouts.</li>
            <li> Although it has cleaned out my pores some, it doesn&#x27;t really shrink them as advertised.  </li>
            <li> You can really see it cleaning out your pores.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week &amp; have had much nicer skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> It really works..</li>
            <li> Also, the tea tree oil really burns my skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It did well, but for the price I expected it to do much better.</li>
            <li> I went online and did a bunch of research as to what all this product was about and was beyond ready to try it.</li>
            <li> honestly I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper buying it here</li>
            <li> I saw this mask on Pintrest and really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on it.</li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> It has an actual muddy consistency but went on fairly smooth.</li>
            <li> so you must be fast in applying.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I tend to be very acne prone</li>
            <li> and I often have a  lot of blackheads, nothing I&#x27;ve tried has ever really helped.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY recommend this.</li>
            <li> You really dont.</li>
            <li> I rub that in gently.</li>
            <li> my whole life and this has smoothed my skin and skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearing ... not a whole lot more than others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Going to sephora for the real deal.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this product.</li>
            <li> This product really helps with my acne.</li>
            <li> , the product is absolutely USED, the seal tape was opened before I did so.</li>
            <li> I really like....</li>
            <li> It has worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> It is very drying</li>
            <li> this really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> or if I don&#x27;t have as much time</li>
            <li> Ok, not really</li>
            <li> The thought of something absorbing the [insert grossness here]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much improvement when I put it on breakouts though.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> Absolutely a product I don&#x27;t want to go without</li>
            <li> but it has REALLY cleared up my face in just three uses..</li>
            <li> It is neat the way your skin looks with the mask on, but I think the price is too high!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll admit her face looks much smoother, tone...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much for pimples.</li>
            <li> so the fast shipping is a plus.</li>
            <li> I really looooved this product,,</li>
            <li> I came onto amazon and saw it for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really could not wait to try this product after seeing it online</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I did not see much of a difference using this product.</li>
            <li> I do not see that it did much for my skin though.  </li>
            <li> I found this works very well.</li>
            <li> the strip didn&#x27;t really get anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is very acne prone</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will order again.  </li>
            <li> but it didnt really make too much of a difference with the blackheads.</li>
            <li> Paid way too much for results like that.</li>
            <li> results are very rapid.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice a difference after I use it</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin very well.</li>
            <li> This product is given so much hype but despite this for me the mask did not deliver what it has promised.</li>
            <li> $70 is too much</li>
            <li> Really does wonders for the face</li>
            <li> My skin does feel much smoother.</li>
            <li> It smells...interesting, and has a very lumpy texture.</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THE WAY</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper on amazon, so that helped my decision.</li>
            <li> and then I could really tell it was working.</li>
            <li> My one caveat is that I got this in person at a store, not from the vendor here, so I can&#x27;t vouch for whether what is sent out here is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> but it really isn&#x27;t infected or about to be but squeezing it</li>
            <li> You really see the oil being sucked up when the mask dries.</li>
            <li> It took a couple times for me to really see any difference.</li>
            <li> It is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel smooth and pores smaller</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to ramble too much</li>
            <li> it really does what it claims.</li>
            <li> This product really does make my skin feel healthier and glowing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying.  </li>
            <li> Been using it twice a week for last few weeks clears breakouts (i have very  mild ones to begin with) and makes my skin feel so clean yet smooth.</li>
            <li> I kept checking to see if I could see the dirt being pulled out and really all you see is where the mask turns a darker color over your pores but nothing comes out.</li>
            <li> Expected MUCH more for the cost.</li>
            <li> It helps so much with clearing up my acne.</li>
            <li> when you wash it off your skin does look fresh, soft and shiny - and your makeup</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about over this stuff.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it I can see what it is pulling out of my pores and after my skin feels smooth and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> It arrived from this company with the silver foil intact and the product very moist as it should be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It went straight to the garbage</li>
            <li> It draws the gunk from my pores out and leaves me with fresh clear skin.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to save your money and buy the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> and this really helps me to manage it.</li>
            <li> works by absorbing oil over your pores.</li>
            <li> So all the reviews on here are very misleading.  </li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> At first, based on the reviews I had read, I thought it was normal</li>
            <li> I really like using this mask.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I was really bummed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just say this product isn&#x27;t for people who really have acne or blackheads.</li>
            <li> It is fairly gentle.  </li>
            <li> but I really like the results during and after use.</li>
            <li> but I do not see this product doing anything of real value for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised I hadn&#x27;t heard of it earlier :)</li>
            <li> I use a basic sensitive skin face wash and have tried so many products.</li>
            <li> Semi liked the mask, however I didn&#x27;t use it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many acne treatments and this is probably the only one that has helped me clear the acne (pimples, zits, and pores).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look the greatest (like a dark grey with a hint of blue) but you can feel it working as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel nice and firm once its washed off.</li>
            <li> BUT it seemed to tighten them up and give an overall nice facial feeling temporarily.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and soft and clear.</li>
            <li> is Origins Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask, but since I&#x27;m kind of a beauty product junkie I decided to try out this mask based on all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And man, it is so gross how much dirt comes out of your pores!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product BURNS!!!</li>
            <li> I have this awesome zit stick from Costco though that takes care of zits in less than 24hrs usually though, so</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well on my face, probably would work better on someone with a less oily face.</li>
            <li> The result was quite drastic the first time I used it, and now the results are less striking, and instead the mask maintains the improvements to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mask about every third day for a few weeks and my skin does look very nice.</li>
            <li> I always break out right before aunt Flo visits, and this product has helped reduce my pore size and  clear up acne.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff after reading all the other reviews and articles online, but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> but it really works and it works better than any other mud pore refining product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that many acne products have one or the other, but I really like how this mask utilizes both.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s on the other hand were very noticeable, mostly where he shaves and gets razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Only used the mud a couple of times but it works exactly as described and is certainly well worth the price.</li>
            <li> little jar has lasted me a year of weekly to bi-weekly use, which is pretty darn good and further justifies the cost IMO.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth it, especially with oily skin people- such a clean feeling!</li>
            <li> My skin did not feel soft, clean, or look clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem with large pores and blackheads, I used the mud as a full face mask, left on for 20 minutes, washed off and</li>
            <li> UPDATE 07/30/14***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to do a product update on this mask because when I wrote my original review I had only used this mask once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more of a liquidy consistency than other clay masks I have.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done a hundred times better than any of the other products on the market that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Works great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant lightening of the blackheads afterward which solved my above problem.</li>
            <li> I got the same mask from somewhere that I know sells original</li>
            <li> Much better price then other retailers.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, it doesn&#x27;t last long, but it is totally worth the cost to keep getting it.</li>
            <li> I find this is better at cleaning out my pores than any other mask I&#x27;ve tried, including skinceuticals clay masque.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to read such rave reviews!  </li>
            <li> Since I was so excited for the mask I disregarded the latter.</li>
            <li> This product did not have the original plastic cover when you open it.</li>
            <li> It clears out pores better than any other product I have tried, and you can see the proof on your face before you was it off</li>
            <li> The white box the mask comes in was sealed and included all the original product information.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to those with large pores.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on certain skin types, or people just have really high standards.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth and soft, but most of all clear from black heads.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel super soft after using but didn&#x27;t really seem to clear much of my acne.</li>
            <li> I do not typically spend a lot of money on skin care and makeup usually just purchasing drugstore available products, so this really was a splurge for me (although the price on amazon was much better than anywhere else).  </li>
            <li> However, I have also found other 100% natural mud masks that I believe deliver the same great results for less money and more product.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels extra clean after using it, along with making it look and feel toner.</li>
            <li> and i did see my pores open making it easier to clean them out.</li>
            <li> This product seems to really deep clean my skin.</li>
            <li> It is fun for the first time use only.</li>
            <li> I have larger pores and it takes a lot of work to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> After the first use my skin felt extra clean and super soft, with the pores on my nose and chin barely visible.  </li>
            <li> My pores are clean and smaller than before use.  </li>
            <li> The first few times was okay</li>
            <li> What you will see is that, when used regularly, you will get beyond the triggered breakouts and enter a state where your skin is healthier and clean and you can use the mask without breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest it if you really want to get DEEEEP into those pores.</li>
            <li> Especially before any special event.  </li>
            <li> Really makes skin glow and look soft!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked that my face felt soft and less oily after the use even if the results weren&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and soft, yet not dry or over cleaned.</li>
            <li> Recommend this to everyone, even sensitive skin (as i have super duper highly sensitive reactive skin).</li>
            <li> It certainly didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I used this mask for the first time yesterday and I can see a huge difference in the size of my pores, more-so than with other masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This mask works great on both my teenage daughter and my middle aged skin.  </li>
            <li> When I first got this I was so excited, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> far as my skin, I felt like it was SO much softer!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive try it in a test area first like your cheek our chin.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it.</li>
            <li> By about the 4th or 5th day, my entire face was full of bumps and I had hives on my neck and chest.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted, a natural mud mask for spot treatments.  </li>
            <li> The package states the product will last for 17 uses as a full face mask, or 1000 uses as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Applying makeup after using the mask, it went on much smoother than normal - as if I had already used a primer.</li>
            <li> Its 17 full masks or 1000 spot treatments and after the improvement I saw, I will definitely be using it on my nose weekly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with oily skin &amp; acne living in a hot , humid area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not worth the price</li>
            <li> The seller said if I sent it back to them I would get a full refund</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice you don&#x27;t have to slather on the product to get its benefits, considering the small amount of product in the container.</li>
            <li> I actually came to Amazon to buy a full size container.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was nice ,but it is a small jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice as a full facial mask.  </li>
            <li> Wish the entire box was full of this stuff.</li>
            <li> After reading the hype surrounding this product, I really thought it was going to be a little jar of magic that would literally fix any imperfection in my skin.</li>
            <li> Brand new sealed and everything!</li>
            <li> However, waking the 2nd day after using the mask, my skin is back to normal and not as bright (or noticeably different) as the morning after the treatment.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time the other night and not only did it leave my skin extremely soft and glowing, it cleared most of the blackheads from my nose and chin!</li>
            <li> It was very flaky and did not look like the new one that I had purchased before.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, but the price is a little high.</li>
            <li> I have taken to putting it on and around my nose, and then I use the excess and a little bit more to spread around the rest of my face and other problem spots, so it&#x27;s applied elsewhere as a light film--saves product and still rejuvenates the whole face that way!</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is not my favorite- reminds me of black licorice.</li>
            <li> I use less product this way and am able to put it on within a minute or so.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine uses it more often, she has slightly oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A friend of mine uses it more often, she has slightly oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less is more for my oily skin, wish i learned this 17 years</li>
            <li> Less is more for my oily skin, wish i learned this 17 years ago.</li>
            <li> I saw instant results with a fifteen minute treatment, plus my skin was super smooth and soft with pores appearing smaller.</li>
            <li> just 3 times and more than half of the jar is gone&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel afterwards but it does not pull the black heads out like it says.</li>
            <li> the more I used it the less &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; came out of my pores.</li>
            <li> Typically when I use pore strips, I always feel like they could have done more.</li>
            <li> After one use I notices the blackheads were less noticeable and my skin looked and felt better.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product that I purchased from this seller as the product came in a half sealed box (when you buy from Sephora it has two seals on the box)&amp; the jar had product around the top</li>
            <li> I get better results with department-store brand (Borghese) at half the price.  </li>
            <li> It started to dry almost immediately and turned a light green/teal color.  </li>
            <li> It has a more watery consistency then the one I had previously bought at sephora.</li>
            <li> I went to Sephora, which is completely sold out, and available only online for $60.</li>
            <li> I used it only on my T-zone and after I washed it off my face felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a cute, tiny jar as a pre- mixed clay.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pleased with the results and while a pricier mask I thought that it worked well enough to justify the price of the $40 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> And one must also take into consideration that different things work better for different people.</li>
            <li> I bought a $6 mud mask from Ulta that gave me decent results.</li>
            <li> Glamglow works well on my older skin.  </li>
            <li> Others may find it helpful to steam the face after cleansing to open up pores even more prior to mask application.</li>
            <li> But then a week later my skin felt like it needed that super oil/dirt suction power that the mask delivers</li>
            <li> but I was looking for something to clear out my pores and smooth out my skin overall.</li>
            <li> you can stand it, though, it does a decent job of clearing up the face.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before purchasing and one of them said that the product was super tiny.</li>
            <li> Super mud cleared my skin after only a couple applications.</li>
            <li> The mask was nice; I think it did tighten up some pores for a few hours directly after the treatment</li>
            <li> My skin showed instant results ( softer smaller pores more even complexion redness reduced ).</li>
            <li> Anyway, it cleared up my nose better than my last facial!</li>
            <li> of the main reasons I bought this was because it was supposed to have a brightening effect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> As it dries you start to see little brackish Brown oily spots start to appear mine were pretty tiny, so I had to look kind of close.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was very surprised to like this as much as I did.</li>
            <li> After drying my skin did feel a bit tight, however it felt baby soft and my skin was super smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out all the time!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It contains fragrance, which is probably what irritated my skin, as well as toxic propylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben, and methylisothiazolinone, which are ranked as highly toxic by EWG.org.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mask for anyone with problematic skin.</li>
            <li> so maybe my expectations were just too high.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a clearer complexion</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of this after reading the &amp;#34;glam-glowing&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this product because she works at a high end spa and this is the product they use on their clients.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After reading raving reviews of this product, I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone with oily to oily-combination skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend not buying this from amazon and saving you&#x27;re money to get it from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this for anyone that has even considered it.</li>
            <li> I think I had too high of expectations because of the glowing (har, har) reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product  for a brighter appearance and youthful look.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and the price was much better than other vendors</li>
            <li> It cost twice as less of Sephora and absolutely the same thing - packed in original packaging, numbers on the box are all original.</li>
            <li> I think I see a little difference, too. :-)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything about this product however the description of what this mask does seemed exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for since I&#x27;ve been having major breakouts and blackheads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> We both find it satisfying to see little dots all over your face when this begins to dry--which I hope and assume are impurities being drawn out of my pores.</li>
            <li> It was completely gone!!</li>
            <li> so I tend to use it around the time of the month I start to get a little more oily and have break out issues.</li>
            <li> Happy to pay less than half.</li>
            <li> it dries nice and hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the white glamglow and the black one, and honestly, I like the black one better.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the mask was gentle which</li>
            <li> It does take a couple of weeks to really notice but you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> It surprised me at how much it really did make our skin glow without a oily-shinyness to it.  </li>
            <li> It washes off so much more easily than my previous mask (the Boscia black mask)</li>
            <li> I used it as a mask once or twice a week and really helped clear my face up</li>
            <li> It really extracts all the gunk and you can see it clearly as the mask dries and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> but i think it was just because this mud does dry on the container if you don&#x27;t clean</li>
            <li> After a couple of months of using both, my skin is clearer, brighter, super soft, and no more fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months of using both, my skin is clearer, brighter, super soft, and no more fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> The product I received from Sephora was much fresher and the treatment mud was not dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled as an adult with acne on my chin and forehead and this has been a real life changer.</li>
            <li> It really help keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> I battle adult acne, and this really helps.  </li>
            <li> This mask is geared twords helping to clear breakouts which really does work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that with a few more uses, this mask would&#x27;ve removed what my pore strips did but why waste the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took two treatments so far to really penetrate the blackheads I had on my nose.</li>
            <li> I am very upset to see my glam glow arrived opened, used and old.</li>
            <li> As an aging young lady I don&#x27;t mind paying some cash for a product that works, but I really wish I had returned this in time to get a refund.</li>
            <li> , my skin is so much softer, and the redness is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I love the mask, but the seller didn&#x27;t do a good job as the mask was open and the lid was dirty, the box was ripped!&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I guess that is normal.</li>
            <li> you might feel some tingling and burning sensation but its normal</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t have any problems with masks, peels, or toners.</li>
            <li> But as the dirt is cleaned out your pores begin to return to their normal size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But as the dirt is cleaned out your pores begin to return to their normal size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was all set to find some truly miraculous or at least effective skin masque.</li>
            <li> The only product i have used on my face that has actually helped clear it and look more radiant.</li>
            <li> Overall I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t get rid of every blackhead on my face, but still a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Is this normal for Glam Glow?</li>
            <li> I think all success only in advertizing.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money and actually works!  </li>
            <li> My face was brighter, softer and more youthful looking after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra bucks!</li>
            <li> I should be paid for wasting my time and now having to waste more time and gas driving to UPS to return this.</li>
            <li> I love how it leave your face glowing even after a few days</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this everyday and it wont irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always fun to get rid of gross stuff on your face.</li>
            <li> (Note: that is my normal face product for my bedtime</li>
            <li> So I washed my face with my normal routine of Cetaphil in the shower, then when I got out I used a $1 foundation brush from elf to apply the mask all over my face.</li>
            <li> I left it on for the full 20 minutes, but could still clearly see blackheads everywhere.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money I think because it cleared my breakup in only two days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Use it prior to a night out or to freshen your skin for an all day fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> but with Glam Glow, I place a dab of it on the pimple, and I can feel the tingle as it goes to work on attacking the problem, the next day, the outbreak is pretty much history.</li>
            <li> I use a clarisonic on my face regularly, which definitely helps to keep my skin nice and dry, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help to unclog pores as much as I hoped.</li>
            <li> more than half of my blackheads are gone!</li>
            <li> There is product around the cap and inside, more than half of the product is gone from the container!</li>
            <li> Works well to get rid of black heads to make your face look more clear.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I found the consistency of the mask super dry and kind of hard to spread.</li>
            <li> your left with clear soft radiant skin, I&#x27;m so excited about how my skin is looking.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin this may not work for you, as the natural ingredients provide a cooling sensation and intense exfoliation process.</li>
            <li> Definitely buying some right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (gross, right?)</li>
            <li> I moisturized right away because my skin was screaming for it, but when I went outside my face stung a bit.</li>
            <li> I have only used this mask once, right when it came in the mail</li>
            <li> I had a white head for about a month that would not go away, and after I used the mask once it took it right out.</li>
            <li> You only get a little bit for a lot of money, but for a special occasion, this was fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose and inner cheeks and this mask really helps to suck out the oil.</li>
            <li> I just used the mask a second time (about 5 days after the first round) and the results are even better.</li>
            <li> My face felt smooth to the touch but didn&#x27;t have any tightness I&#x27;ve had with other products.</li>
            <li> The first time I only had it stay on until it dried with not too many results.</li>
            <li> Live and learn</li>
            <li> I live in Wisconsin</li>
            <li> it arrived in a factory sealed package, obviously new.</li>
            <li> it was supposed to be new..</li>
            <li> I also have a picture of my (brand new from Sephora) jar, showing what the seal should look like.  </li>
            <li> and I live in the humid south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who does this and why would this be resent out as a new item???</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is brand new after using this.</li>
            <li> Item is new and sealed.</li>
            <li> i am new to this product but will be buying it again.  </li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t think it is brand new...</li>
            <li> The jar containing the product featured a foil seal ensuring the product was new and completed sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And, like everyone else says, this stuff goes a really long way and less is definitely better!</li>
            <li> so i try to keep masks and exfoliation to a minimum, but seriously this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am huge on actually seeing results working instantly and it WORKS!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work that well except for making my skin smooth, but it also dried it out...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really clear current breakouts don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s strong enough and changing the acne prone skin</li>
            <li> The box it came in itself was sealed with a clear round sticker as you would probably find on most boxes.</li>
            <li> There were some dry chunks within the super mud.</li>
            <li> The inner packaging (the paper holding the jar in place) was torn so the jar just kind of rattled around in there, and there are two instructional brochure things that were supposed to be there that were missing.  </li>
            <li> would have rated this 3 stars because it does leave your skin feeling nice, but it&#x27;s so ridiculously overpriced I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel pretty soft and it feels nice but really doesn&#x27;t even compare with the other GLAMGLOW mask (the one in the black container), at least the price on Amazon is much better than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The next morning I woke and my skin was no where nearly as oily as it normally is!!!</li>
            <li> I used to always be buying new cremes and washes trying to clear up my acne, but now, I just use GlamGlow!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get a new face or a new layer of skin, like some people seem to expect from products, but this one sure makes a difference (however small) to me.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin it can cause breakouts as well.</li>
            <li> Very soft and clears my complexion.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and acne prone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and clay treatments like this can dry your skin a little because they remove EVERYTHING, and sometimes they can encourage extra oil production by your skin, so it&#x27;s important to use a good moisturizer so that your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out or over produce oil.  </li>
            <li> My face did feel quite clean even after just the first use, but my skin also felt very tight and</li>
            <li> it is the same, but you pay for this powder is much cheaper for more volume than this little jar of expensive&gt;</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for regular acne either, too bad I was really hoping this would be a great mask!</li>
            <li> My blackheads were as clear as they&#x27;ve been in ages!</li>
            <li> My nose is completely clear after once use!</li>
            <li> even his nose looks clear!</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was a pre-teen!</li>
            <li> We both have T-zone oiliness and this product removes black or white heads so easily while leaving your skin shining!</li>
            <li> Helps clear pimples and makes skin radiant!</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I came off birth control over a year ago!</li>
            <li> My nose was completely clear!</li>
            <li> This stuff fixed my skin!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> But it was all ok not sure why that happened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty big beauty product fan</li>
            <li> but in the past year I&#x27;ve either had more stress or hormones</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t show your pores it would be exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months (still have the original jar with several applications left).</li>
            <li> I was not sure it would work since I have had this problem for so many years.</li>
            <li> first time i used this someone actually said that my skin was glowing (without any knowledge of me using this product</li>
            <li> Unlike other masks that I&#x27;ve tried previously, mostly found at the local pharmacy, it doesn&#x27;t feel caked on.</li>
            <li> and I still breakout pretty moderately on my chin.</li>
            <li> Even if I use it regularly, which is what I did when I first got it</li>
            <li> The next red flag should have been when I opened the pot, the foil was already off (it was just laying on top) and it was obvious that this was tampered with as well.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I gave it the benefit of the doubt in the beginning because I read reviews that said it might make your skin break out in the beginning because it&#x27;s purging your skin of all of those impurities, but that should only happen the first time or two.  </li>
            <li> took a hot shower streamed up my bathroom to help open my pores and then put this mask on!</li>
            <li> I used to buy all different creams, trying to find one that would work consistently well.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy all different creams, trying to find one that would work consistently well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first time, I stopped putting the mask all over my face, and I only use it over my nose and chin where I have the problems.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is that it might make you break out a day or two after using it the first time but that is just bringing everything to the surface.</li>
            <li> I been trying to upload pictures of the actual container what it looked like when first opened.</li>
            <li> I was worried about this product at first, because there were several reviews that mentioned that their product seemed used.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> The outer box, you can see the round factory seal sticker (it&#x27;s clear) with a piece of clear scotch tape on top.  </li>
            <li> That should have been my first red flag.  </li>
            <li> I did contact GlamGlow, but they won&#x27;t stand by their product unless you buy directly from them!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> It came package in a regular glam glow box, I would recommend to anyone who is interested in buying this product.</li>
            <li> The first time I got it, I used it all over my face, but I realized it wasn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> But I was still unsure if I wanted to pay such a hefty price for a product, so I bought the samples from the Glam Glow website to try it out first.  </li>
            <li> Glamglow surprised me!</li>
            <li> I first saw it on Pinterest and decided to give it a whirl, especially with the price deal on amazon.</li>
            <li> Two of us have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause us any problems!</li>
            <li> After my first use, I could see my pores looked cleaner and tighter, and overall, my face was a lot softer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I used up my first jar, I got a second one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Works great and last a long time for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Sure initially your pores may look smaller but the next day there they are again and look now you have blemishes too!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost completely gotten rid of my blackheads after just 2 uses!</li>
            <li> Just bought my first bottle and am planning to continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li> Same exact product/size/packaging, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I purchased this item I applied it daily for 2 weeks for 20-30 min.</li>
            <li> After just a week my skin looked and felt a million times better, my pores were so small</li>
            <li> I am not usually into beauty products</li>
            <li> I generally leave it on for 20 minutes or longer, cover the whole face or just the problem areas if I am in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would absolutely never pay full price for it though.  </li>
            <li> It clears up my acne quickly, but does not do much for previous scars.</li>
            <li> This Super-Mud left my skin squeaky clean and my pores visibly smaller.  </li>
            <li> Next time I WILL be purchasing it from Sephora because this poduct was clearly OPENED and USED some of the product was gone!!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but just as good as any other less expensive clay mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> liked the consistency of the product, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> the next day I did the same thing and was able to get the zit out and clear and it only took 2 times using the mask to get it out!</li>
            <li> If you really don&#x27;t want to spend the money on this product I would highly suggest purchasing a cheaper mask and using it regularly on your face to see if it works for you.use your pores to shrink.</li>
            <li> If you really don&#x27;t want to spend the money on this product I would highly suggest purchasing a cheaper mask and using it regularly on your face to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t really make my skin appear any different.</li>
            <li> i only put it on problem spots not all over my face unless i have a special event the next night</li>
            <li> the description of the product was clearly stated that the product was new.</li>
            <li> For visualization: the packaging is huge but the product has less substance then a travel size vasoline container, hope that helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a spoiled product because it came through a 3rd party vendor (although it wasn&#x27;t opened), or if I&#x27;m just not getting the &#x27;amazing smell&#x27; that everyone has been claiming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it dries, it turns a solid light grey color.</li>
            <li> My nose is clear of the tiny blackheads for the first time since puberty.</li>
            <li> So not only does the product dry out super fast, they&#x27;re customer service</li>
            <li> After only one use, and letting it dry for a good 10-15 minutes, the black dots started showing up all over my face.</li>
            <li> It dries without being too harsh and crinkling your skin and washes off easily in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It does leave your skin feeling pretty soft, but this is definitely not going to pull gunk out of your pores like a Biore strip</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a good mask but not good enough for me to purchase again.</li>
            <li> The real trick of making your tiny expensive jar of glamglow go far is that after you leave the mask on for 20-30 minutes, rinse off with very warm water, and then follow with BIORE PORE STRIPS.</li>
            <li> Used it all over the first 3 nights and noticed that I broke out a little more (which is expected)...</li>
            <li> I will probably try a cheaper product the next time to see if this really is that much better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> I instantly started researching it and found all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice smaller pores or a whole new face</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to the upcoming mask to clear out my skin, however, by the time I opened it, it&#x27;s only half of the container</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have both the white and black one.</li>
            <li> I like white mud better than black.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well, I noticed significantly less breakouts after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> This product did make my skin soft, but saying that it does anything other than that wasn&#x27;t true for me.</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose and using this mask is making them appear smaller.</li>
            <li> Which I&#x27;ll take over the large clusters of pimples that last for a week then scar up my face</li>
            <li> I have large pores especially on and around my nose.</li>
            <li> If you have blackheads or large pores around the nose or in the t-zone like I do this is a must for helping to unclog &amp; for smaller pores.  </li>
            <li> GLAMGLOW Mud has certainly made a difference, especially in clearing out the pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li> Even though its worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it made my face feel nice and tight, like I had gotten a tiny, tiny face lift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather be able to save a little money and just buy it in a tube or basic rectangular box.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s anymore effective than Merle Norman&#x27;s Miracol or some of the other products out there that are half the price.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my pores better than other productsI&#x27;ve tried and didn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Clearly it was already used and tampered with.</li>
            <li> My face feels and looks so clear that I want to go up to people and say &amp;</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping that after a couple of uses it will clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> At this rate, my skin will be mostly clear for my wedding which is 4 weeks away.</li>
            <li> I thought it would magically clear my face</li>
            <li> I had to take a steroid to finally clear up the reaction.  </li>
            <li> While it seemed to clear my nose up a bit it didn&#x27;t really remove the larger blackheads.</li>
            <li> It helps to clear skin imperfections, smooths as well as revitalizes and freshens the skin.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my face clear and minimizes my pores.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;pore shrinking&amp;#34; but I did notice my pores were crystal clear after using this.</li>
            <li> those purchasing the GlamGlow, it&#x27;s not a treatment that will give you perfectly clear skin overnight.</li>
            <li> But she loves it and it is working to clear up her face.  </li>
            <li> I use about once every two weeks after a lavender steam, and it keeps my skin glowing and clear.</li>
            <li> All the areas I had put it on were wonderfully clear of gunk.</li>
            <li> No, it didn&#x27;t make my pores just disappear, but it did clear them out and reduce the size of them.</li>
            <li> The product is helping clear out my blackheads</li>
            <li> It makes your skin clear, and brighter to, as in even skin tone.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also say she complained about her skin being sensitive to most products and since using GlamGlow, zero complaints.</li>
            <li> It helped clear up my breakouts</li>
            <li> I have great,smooth, clear skin immediately after using this.</li>
            <li> This time though, the outer box wasn&#x27;t wrapped in plastic and when I opened it up the box, it was clear that the jar had already been opened; there was product caked around the lid.  </li>
            <li> It does help to clear out skin</li>
            <li> I just turned 30 and started getting breakouts when i used to always have clear skin.</li>
            <li> yes 2 days my face was completely clear, 100%</li>
            <li> Does clear up my skin a day after using.</li>
            <li> It also says on the packaging you can leave on 5-20 minutes and let me be clear</li>
            <li> so I am waiting for those to clear up</li>
            <li> This product came to me opened, clearly it was used.</li>
            <li> I like how this mask make the skin soft after using it.</li>
            <li> really wish I hadn&#x27;t lost it, and if it wasn&#x27;t such a pricey product, I would have already replaced it!</li>
            <li> are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I at least tried it</li>
            <li> Used a promo code at the direct brand site and got $20.00 off the price.</li>
            <li> you looks and feeling young.  </li>
            <li> Who knew you could hit puberty at damn near 30.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne and blackheads since I was 11 years old.</li>
            <li> , I read that some costumers got it old &amp; used</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive dry-normal skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it was old.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything but make my face really soft.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t solve all of my skin issues, but it made considerable progress toward doing so.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really get a chance to look at my face until the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far for my acne prone skin</li>
            <li> So far this is working well for me.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin and have had no issues with this product.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, and I find the day AFTER I use it is when the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; really comes out the next time I wash my face.</li>
            <li> My face is really soft after I use it,</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter and I both use Glam Glow and are amazed at the power of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old</li>
            <li> After hearing YouTube beauty gurus and their opinions about the SuperMud mask and how much it&#x27;s changed their skin, I finally bit the bullet and bought it.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just too sensitive for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I always look for all natural, or organic, or vegan beauty care.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a day, it leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li> You can save on the cost on Amazon, but the treatment mud I received was old and had a crust around it.</li>
            <li> You could probably find a natural DIY formula that would work just as well.</li>
            <li> Removed all my blackheads in one use and made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything to help my current break outs</li>
            <li> When I used it it still gave me the same tingly feeling but not as much as before.</li>
            <li> As a person in my 30 &#x27; s without much acne just occasional breakout it does wonders.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had no problem with this product.</li>
            <li> and it did my face felt incredibly soft</li>
            <li> My skin always feels so soft when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> This stuff does pull all the oil to the surface and after washing it off, my skin feels baby soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It showed you where the balckheads were but did absolutely nothing to pull them out, if anything my pores looked twice as big with blackheads still in them.</li>
            <li> how soft it made his skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I will never waste my money again on stuff that you can buy at Target or even at the Department Stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it twice a week since I bought it in early August.</li>
            <li> Make my skin soft though.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t really notice a physical difference after using it.</li>
            <li> You can see as it works and pulls all the sebum and oils from your pores and really makes your pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely won me</li>
            <li> This does wonders on your skin and is completely natural.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and used it in my t zone .</li>
            <li> it reveals an even toned and soft complexion.</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this for every woman to have in their skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Maybe product was old?</li>
            <li> Would not waste money on this.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for something natural</li>
            <li> but it DOESN&#x27;T completely remove them at all.</li>
            <li> It really helps to draw out blackheads and dries and shrinks any current blemishes.</li>
            <li> It does have a tingle similar to what you feel with products that have mint in them, but it was not irritating.</li>
            <li> It makes skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Package looks like it&#x27;s old or been used, it wasn&#x27;t wrapped in any plastic.</li>
            <li> I am very oily so this does help the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have problems with products because my skin is some what sensitive, but glamglow hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every method of removing said bump for 11 years to no avail.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and Glamglow Super-Mud Clearing Treatment</li>
            <li> I smelled it and compared it to the last jar, and it seems like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get overnight results but overall it has really helped my skin - texture, smoothness, tone, pores, breakouts-</li>
            <li> I use it at 40 and have my 14 year old son uses it to keep breakouts under control.  </li>
            <li> My 19 year old daughter got me started using it</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> She swears it is the only thing that really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> and it really gives your face an instant lift.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> Not giving it 5 stars only because it hasn&#x27;t really helped with my acne on my chin.</li>
            <li> and so does my nearly 15 year old child who has some acne going on.  </li>
            <li> your skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> At least give this product a try more than once in a two week period.</li>
            <li> (I bought it at the recommendation of professional make-up artist Tiffany Lee Bymaster, aka \\&quot;Coach</li>
            <li> Glam Glow gets rid of zits FAST and has definitely made a noticeable difference for me.</li>
            <li> Not only does this have the cutest packaging but it did absolute wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it two days in a row and got my skin become sensitive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like my skin is any different,</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m please</li>
            <li> I had a lot of blackhead that were very deep and no matter how much i cleaned my face, tried to remove them or used the biore strips, they never went away.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely cleared, which says a lot since I have cystic acne/pimples .</li>
            <li> I am still playing around with this product, but so far it seems to work quite well with my skin.</li>
            <li> - Use warm water and rinse for AT LEAST a minute to ensure you get all the mask off or any that&#x27;s left over will get into your pores and cause blackheads/breakouts.</li>
            <li> Feels nice, its a dark grey color and doesn&#x27;t stain your skin (obviously) or your clothes (got some on my shirt and came out with the wash).</li>
            <li> I am only using it on problem areas on my face, so I should be able to get quite a few uses out of the container.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but good.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly it lasts a long time for such a small jar.</li>
            <li> this white jar, i think is better than the black jar!</li>
            <li> One was fine, the other had a completely different safety seal, and was used.</li>
            <li> But the smells fades away once it&#x27;s dry which happens very fast.</li>
            <li> I break out fairly easily so a new product is always a little unnerving, but this helped clear my skin really quickly.</li>
            <li> If you plan it right you can definitely beat a big breakout before hand.</li>
            <li> I would save up and purchase a larger container so that all my skin would have more time to react, as well as to maintain the clean, soft and clear face that was left behind.</li>
            <li> my pores are actually clear for the first time in a very long time.</li>
            <li> My GlamGlow super mud mask jar isnt lasting me as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so tight and clean</li>
            <li> After using it, my face always feels clean and my skin feels tight.</li>
            <li> It should simply rinse off and down the drain easily.  </li>
            <li> (Which made the product look dry when first opened ).</li>
            <li> and i still have half of it still full.</li>
            <li> , it has helped tremendously with my acne and dark marks.</li>
            <li> To me it looked half full and idk</li>
            <li> I do feel my skin is clearer and less full of gunk with this product.</li>
            <li> get super tingly when left on to long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, so I&#x27;m willing to give it a few more tries.</li>
            <li> I spread it pretty thin, and I was still only able to get about 8 uses out of it, the jar says you can get 17 uses out of it.</li>
            <li> A week after I stopped, the black heads on my nose were darker and more numerous, and I had only used the mask three or four times before that.</li>
            <li> I put it on, leave it for 20-30 minutes, check myself out in the mirror a few times and then rinse clean.</li>
            <li> price was decent, and it does last longer than you would think when you receive it..</li>
            <li> The texture of this particular Glamglow Super-Mud was not of the same textue as the Glamglow</li>
            <li> My pimples have subsided for the most part, the occasional extremely small one.</li>
            <li> where I like to treat myself, but I personally can&#x27;t see this as a steady repurchase based on the price.</li>
            <li> At first I was wary because of the price, but this is 100% authentic Glamglow.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying a small free sample from Sephora before purchasing, as I hear it can be too severe for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried my sample and HOLY COW is it worth the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m a skeptical consumer generally, but still delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> Other reviews are right.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend the product to anyone but you should find a different seller if you are planning on purchasing it online.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it had such high reviews.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, got it before I was expected to.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product as I kept seeing it recommended in magazines and it received such high ratings on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this mask, I just wish they would sell it in a larger container, but I guess the cost prevents them from doing so.  </li>
            <li> I am a total cynic and didn&#x27;t hold high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the high price.</li>
            <li> It does feel tight but not any more so than other masks, it was actually rather gentle in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is the real thing, as I had purchased this previously at a beauty department store.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it everyday or it will dry your face out :)</li>
            <li> This mask does nothing special or different than any other cheap-o clay/mud mask out there.</li>
            <li> The first time was fine; the second time I noticed my skin was a little pink after use but shrugged it off.</li>
            <li> Wash your face after using it, mud and clay treatments can leave a very slight residue on your skin, so you want your skin clean before you put on makeup or creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i got over it fast when i released how long its lasted me.</li>
            <li> Really cleared my face up and it didn&#x27;t take too long either.</li>
            <li> I applied my normal moisturizer and inspected my skin further.</li>
            <li> My skin is back to normal</li>
            <li> When dirt becomes trapped it causes the pores to open more, making them appear larger.</li>
            <li> When dirt becomes trapped it causes the pores to open more, making them appear larger.</li>
            <li> First, it is thinner than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I suffer with moderate acne and it did help with normal break outs.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t Write reviews but this stuff totally made me break out.</li>
            <li> Especially if I use a pore strip right after I take the mask off-It worked almost as well as having an esthetician do extractions, which is much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I expected it to work a little better for the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty and it leaves skin very dry so moisturize after using!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations after reading all the great reviews and was truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive the product, however, it had no plastic wrap on top, no seal on the jar, half of the product was missing &amp; there were black fingerprints on the bottle.</li>
            <li> 3 days later I have yet to have any new breakouts and the two zits I had before using this mask</li>
            <li> This is the only new product I used on my face and haven&#x27;t put anything else on it.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it did not arrive new and was obviously used.</li>
            <li> These were very large, very noticeable blackheads that would not dissolve or otherwise be removed by pore strips, extraction tools, daily use of expensive acne wash and spot treatment lotion, or the special pore cleansing brush head of the Clarisonic device.  </li>
            <li> At half the price of what you would pay at Sephora, I thought this was worth a try.</li>
            <li> It left it soft and clear, minimizing pores drastically.</li>
            <li> A quick look in the mirror showed nothing but dried clay like material.</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of adult acne, most products make my skin look worse.</li>
            <li> I was far more broken out after using the mask.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling very soft but there are lots of projects that can do that.</li>
            <li> This mask truly deep cleans your pores and leaves your skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using it as the package directs, but so far, nothing other than a cool show from watching it dry.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the vacuum like technology to clear out the pores.</li>
            <li> have yet to purchase any of the other GLAMGLOW products, but now that I&#x27;ve been using this one for a year I&#x27;m willing to branch out and try one of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I left it on for 20 minutes and after one use I can already notice a difference in the size of my pores and my skin feels so soft!  </li>
            <li> In fact, it took hours before my skin had enough natural oil for me to apply powder!  </li>
            <li> originally received a small sample from Sephora and knew after one use I had to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, Amazon gives a great price as always, and if you&#x27;re looking for a new mask to try, don&#x27;t be afraid to give this one a go!</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian with pretty dry skin, hyperpigmentation, and some acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have all that gunk drawn out though then left to its own devices to become a massive zit that is 10x worse and takes longer to clear</li>
            <li> the clay is a bit difficult to rinse off and stains the fingers and the towels, but all easily avoidable if care is taken and absolutely worth the extra effort for these results.</li>
            <li> Although price is still not low but definately worth it!I will recommend to other friends</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but its really worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells a little funky but so worth it.</li>
            <li> may think it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> All the packaging was there and appeared to be new, but when I opened the jar to inspect the contents, it was clear that it was not a new jar.</li>
            <li> Glam glow seems to be a decent product, next time I will be purchasing it from Sephora only!</li>
            <li> Their are so many different masks out there to try, this one really did not do anything other than make my skin feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li> All you need to know is that I have REALLY sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m right in the middle of that young adult acne stage, and it was getting really bad the last few weeks, so I decided to try this out, when it came in the mail I used it as a full mask (i love it btw)</li>
            <li> This product certainly holds up and does far above what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high cost for such a tiny bottle</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way, I used a lot the first time and didn&#x27;t see any results really.</li>
            <li> it does take a few uses to get out some of the really hard black heads but other than that its great .it has a minty sent ,and leaves your face feeling fresh</li>
            <li> I saved the last of the product for a special occasion, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have because the product dried out a bit.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny I spent!!!</li>
            <li> Note that if you have blocked pores from oil or excess sebum, you may see a tiny breakout until you get the areas clear.</li>
            <li> Box and packaging was excessive, should have spent more on the jar the product came in.</li>
            <li> This facial mask did not give me immediate results of clear, unclogged pores and skin.</li>
            <li> The item had already clearly been opened, and possibly used.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, who is always trying to find things to help keep her skin clear.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, the rest of my face is completely clear and my pores are visibly smaller.</li>
            <li> The mask definitely dries out your face but as far as extracting anything...</li>
            <li> It seems old not the same as sephoras.</li>
            <li> although I did take it off maybe five minutes early the third time.</li>
            <li> but I barely use it now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so far</li>
            <li> I have struggled with blackheads on my nose since my early teenage years and</li>
            <li> I no longer have to pat the oil off my skin and can barely see the pores on my t-zone anymore.</li>
            <li> It deep cleans and refreshes you skin without stripping you of all your natural oils.</li>
            <li> I even had a t-zone pore party with 6 of my friends, and there&#x27;s barely any gone.</li>
            <li> There is a tingle when using it, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> The mud is wet; depending on how much you lather on the mud dries within 7-15min.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and if you do I recommend only using it once a week.</li>
            <li> Okay I was skeptical about this product, especially since it is so much cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> I gave this treatment several chances to wow me</li>
            <li> Some people are apparently just trying it one time and expecting a miracle.</li>
            <li> and I barely had any breakouts or pimples.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on the overall effectiveness of this product, because I didn&#x27;t make it that far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and doing mask treatment would only irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It tightened as it dried, and it was totally fun to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched to a bentonite clay (Aztec secret) and have had much better</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s even more broken out.</li>
            <li> Safe to say I&#x27;m not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I get pimples rarely but have a few blackheads on my nose and brow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually spend this kind of money on these sorts of things, but with my wedding coming up in a few months</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s just too expensive to use everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, he has his own jar now.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that is really worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can.&lt;br /&gt;Aztec secret - Healing Clay is way better than this.</li>
            <li> You have to endure a few treatments followed by breakouts to see results, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I think that I like the one that comes in the black pot just a little better.  </li>
            <li> Smells like black licorice, which is not unpleasant for me who really hates black licorice.  </li>
            <li> Jar doesn&#x27;t last very long if you are doing your whole face.</li>
            <li> I get really bad hormonal-induced cystic acne and upon using this mask my breakouts tend to disappear more quickly than with BP or even retain-a.  </li>
            <li> Even though the amount seems tiny (1.2 oz) it lasts a reasonable amount of time and doesn&#x27;t dry out in the jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it works FANTASTIC for blackheads, but not really for other kinds of acne.</li>
            <li> But it is pretty cool because when it starts to dry, all your black heads turn dark through the mask so you can see where all the dirt is.</li>
            <li> FOR ONCE, I found a product that does exactly what it claims it will do.&lt;br /&gt;After using this mask twice per week for three weeks, my skin is brighter, clearer, and my t-zone is noticeably less oily throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I repeat: Oh.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin, so</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin, so</li>
            <li> Smells a lot like black licorice but does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively normal skin not to oily and not to dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried other masks in past that I felt were better</li>
            <li> i have an unbelievable SUPER oily t-zone and i&#x27;ve tried mud masks from Origins, Lancome, Boscia, etc.</li>
            <li> This was super expensive, and the jar is super tiny.</li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t use much so make a little go a long way.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s becoming less and less each time.  </li>
            <li> Dies out pretty fast is my only complaint (</li>
            <li> But with a $50 price tag and such a small quantity I expected more.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is ready to use, some other products you have to mix with water or vinegar.  </li>
            <li> But with the other spots on my face, I didn&#x27;t notice that much difference after washing it off.</li>
            <li> U can really see that it is working with all the dots that appear on your face due to pore matrix technology.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make this last a long time, I only use it on my problem areas and not as a whole face</li>
            <li> Top of box is loosely closed and properly sealed, jar is dirty and has dried out pieces around the top edges!  </li>
            <li> over.&lt;br /&gt;So much cheaper than sephora or other beauty retailers</li>
            <li> For me, I noticed that I never experienced the same success from the mud as I did the first time.</li>
            <li> like so far, small portion, but lasts pretty long, makes my face feel very soft, dont know if its a placebo effect</li>
            <li> The jar itself is small, however you really don&#x27;t need very much of the product and you don&#x27;t need to do the mask every single night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing a lot of brightening but the other results are positive enough that I would keep buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very oily T - zone and a sensitive (read-easily dried out)</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t cheap and comes in a small jar, however, it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> As a 21 year old you don&#x27;t expect acne to be a big problem in your life anymore, i&#x27;ve been on 6 different acne prescriptions.</li>
            <li> It did NOT dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> It did not dry my face.</li>
            <li> However, it did not completely eliminate all the blackheads or reduce the pores as much as I would have liked, but it did better then the dozen or so other masks I have tried over the past years from inexpensive to very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for what you get but works very well!</li>
            <li> Maybe slightly smaller pores but nothing major.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice, so havent noticed any major changes...</li>
            <li> Anyway, that might be my only major gripe about this product.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure when i first got it, not just because of the price, also the type of product this is, a mud mask</li>
            <li> Made my skin super dry and tight.</li>
            <li> In fact, there was only about half as much product in the jar as there was supposed to be!</li>
            <li> Have spent more $$ at other stores previous to finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It really does help to clear them out, as I have seen over the last few months.</li>
            <li> Unless I start to see a larger change in the general state of my skin, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bummed I spent so much $ on a product that actually had the opposite of the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Unbelieveable that a product that promotes the healing of dark marks actually exacerbated the same exact problem.</li>
            <li> and it dries to a blue color with holes where apparently your pores were cleaned out.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life that I got all that trapped dirt out of my nose out.  </li>
            <li> The first time I purchased glamglow it came all dried up.</li>
            <li> $45 is still a lot to spend on this, not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I wasted a butt load of money on a product that isn&#x27;t even the real deal!</li>
            <li> really not sure if this mask is worth the money.</li>
            <li> really not sure if this mask is worth the money.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> and I was not sure it would be worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Container is a tad small but well worth buying.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> it feels really good on, but it is very expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> It burns a little when applied to face, but very interesting to see the black dots on your face after its dried.</li>
            <li> After the first use my face looked brighter, pores looked tighter, and the pimples I did have were smaller and less red.</li>
            <li> I did break out a little after the first use and each time I use it the break outs are smaller.</li>
            <li> The new version (from Sephora) is packaged so tightly you have to rip the paper to get to the jar, but that part has clearly already been done for me.  </li>
            <li> I am now spending half as much money on skin care with results I NEVER had before.  </li>
            <li> I am now spending half as much money on skin care with results I NEVER had before.  </li>
            <li> It always leaves my skin feeling so much cleaner and less oily than before.</li>
            <li> My skin was smoother and refreshed after the application but the black heads have not decreased after 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fading my old acne scars and it doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely have sensitive skin, though, so I was not surprised that it make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after countless sightings on social media...</li>
            <li> you are in a rush, it dries very quickly if you put a thin layer</li>
            <li> little GLAMGLOW comes in a big white box with packaging to keep this thing pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to use it only 2 times a week though because the times i had used it frequently, it kind of made my face feel a little dry (not dramatically though, just a little dry feeling).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product on several areas of my face that had some superficial markings left due to acne breakouts, I was left with a very noticible darkened areas on my face.</li>
            <li> only real issue I had was when I first started using the product, when I put thin layer on my nose.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product does work to help clear up acne and dry up oil.</li>
            <li> I gave the mud and cream to a friend who has very oily skin, and she found that the combination actually helped her skin be less oily.  </li>
            <li> The skin is soft and firmer than before but it doesn&#x27;t really do much to clear imperfections or black heads.</li>
            <li> So definitely do not use it before something big like a wedding, prom, social event, etc.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about ordering this from Amazon seeing as it is MUCH lower than the retail price ($69 plus tax at Sephora)</li>
            <li> As soon as I rinsed the mask off my face, my pores were clean, tight, and definitely less visible.  </li>
            <li> For context, I have sensitive acne prone skin that is also very dry.  </li>
            <li> A little bit really does go a loooong way.</li>
            <li> The white dries out my face just a little too much.</li>
            <li> It does sort of make my skin a little softer, but not enough to pay this much for this mask.  </li>
            <li> A little creepy when it lights up your pores, but hey, that means it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> First I have a shower, and right when I get out, when my pores are still open, apply a VERY thin layer of the glamglow.</li>
            <li> My pores on my nose are definitely smaller (due to unclogging), my skin feels smoother, I haven&#x27;t had new breaks outs</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for all the different skin problems it claims to address ( such as pimples, large pores, uneven skin tone ect.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, but I think the regular ol&#x27; masks I&#x27;ve bought for years at the drug store for 5 bucks do just as good a job.</li>
            <li> Cant really say about it helping to  lighten up the dark spots because I have not been using the mask long enough to make that determination.</li>
            <li> I had read a few good reviews but remained skeptical.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for black heads.</li>
            <li> As it dried, my pores were obvious, and it looked like they were super dark compared to the rest of the mask.</li>
            <li> If any of you are fascinated by things like pore strips (because of all the icky stuff you can see), then this mask is right up your alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it says on the packaging \\&quot;Pore-Matrix will reveal dots of vacuum extractions, absorption &amp; encapsulation of sebum oils, bacteria &amp; toxins.\\</li>
            <li> However, when you leave it on for the full 20 minutes, little dark grey dots start appearing on the mask.</li>
            <li> With a thin coat on my T- zone it started to dry very quickly</li>
            <li> Love the product, but when it got down to a few uses left in the jar it dried out.</li>
            <li> Obviously any average human doesn&#x27;t want to hear that your skin still has yet to even remotely clear up for another 3 months.</li>
            <li> The actual container is quite small, but I only really needed it on my nose and chin, I&#x27;ll probably use it once a week as needed.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the mask dries to a matte dark finish, showing you ALL of your pores, and when you wash it off, your face feels soft and your pores definitely do look smaller.</li>
            <li> So far the results seem to be on par with every other face mask I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a big bonus as it will now last much longer than I thought considering the small size of the tub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from severe blackheads/enlarged pores around my nose and on my nose, and I agree with the other commenters: this mask completely cleared out the pores on my nose and the area around my nose.</li>
            <li> ME), it&#x27;s fun to see the little dark spots that are your pores as the mask is drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mixed results with blackheads, sometimes it only takes one use, sometimes it can take 2 or 3 before the black heads disappear completely, I guess it depends on your skin.  </li>
            <li> And even though the actual bottle is small, it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I completely stand behind my first review and this mask has become one of my</li>
            <li> Results are showing after 1 try: pores are less noticeable, skin is brighter and smoother, healthier looking, very soft.</li>
            <li> Sure it did clear my face up in just a few days, but needless to say I&#x27;ll be ordering from the actual website.</li>
            <li> The down side is it is fairly pricey, although not as expensive as on other sites.  </li>
            <li> The next day I put on my makeup as usual and was thrilled that the dramatic difference in my pore size remained.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen little difference so far my big problem is big pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I liked that I got it for a less expensive amount then for what it&#x27;s being sold for in department stores.</li>
            <li> I am simply too busy to spend half a day in the spa.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product regularly my cystic acne is FAR less.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product I have found that works and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> It does bring out oils (you can see dark spots on your problem areas), but it didn&#x27;t bring up any black heads for me which is why i wanted the product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the only one with this problem, but I would definitely recommend to use the whole thing within two months or else it will dry up on you.</li>
            <li> :Too small size, run out fast.</li>
            <li> Small amount but do not have to use that much</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last too too long.</li>
            <li> It does go a long way, so I would probably purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> To make it last as long as I can (as it is a bit pricey)</li>
            <li> but if you use sparingly it&#x27;ll last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but it is very expensive</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed and so upset because I used to have fairly good skin</li>
            <li> original, while expensive, is AMAZING, and hey, its less expensive than a facial considering that you will get several uses out of it.  </li>
            <li> I deducted another star because I didn&#x27;t see any significant or dramatic results after using it.</li>
            <li> However my 12 yr old daughter who has pretty bad teen acne coming on it doesn&#x27;t do much for her.</li>
            <li> Was so excited about this purchase but when it came the seal in the jar was broken and some of the product was dry on the side.</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive and very dry skin and isn&#x27;t really comfortable while I&#x27;m using it, but it isn&#x27;t too irritating if I use it once a week or less.  </li>
            <li> Only saw very minor results.</li>
            <li> (I have cystic pimples that leave scars and last a very long time.)</li>
            <li> Once you open the container, the product will start to dry out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and glamglow also has a foaming cleanser that you can use daily.</li>
            <li> and I could easily tell it was fake</li>
            <li> Just in case anybody is wondering based on previous reviews, the product sold by Salon N Body Warehouse is completely legit.</li>
            <li> there is a weird smell but easy to ignore</li>
            <li> First off, I have a strange complex, I&#x27;m optimistic/skeptical all in one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all uncomfortable and rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine at Sephora last week - definitely check it out if you&#x27;re reading this during the holiday season, as they have a gift set with this full-size mask plus the black Glamglow in a miniature size for the same price as the full-size of the clearing treatment alone.</li>
            <li> I still had some of the last jar left in my medicine cabinet, so it&#x27;s my fault for not opening it or noticing the lack of outer packaging until the return window had already closed.  </li>
            <li> Upon rinsing off the mask I am left with soft, firm, and clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like anything to smell like food unless it is good and especially on my face blech.</li>
            <li> and it was just disappointing and so expensive to not be wonderful.  </li>
            <li> however costco has it (for limited time) for the same price as amazon!</li>
            <li> This mask really does have some sort of \\&quot;vacuum action\\&quot; that sucks all the gunk and grime out of my pores.</li>
            <li> As an adult, I can see my larger pores have became somewhat smaller over the past two months.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but you only need a little at a time, and if you do spot treatment instead of your whole face, I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Use a thin layer to begin and add a little more as a second layer, not much is needed.</li>
            <li> Honestly, is it that difficult to grind it up a little bit when everything is dry?</li>
            <li> The best part- it doesn&#x27;t small bad!</li>
            <li> Pretty ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It was unfortunate, I was so excited at it&#x27;s potential.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if what I received was an older bottle.</li>
            <li> just little clear circle tabs on the bottom holding lid on and even that like it could have been opened.  </li>
            <li> It was a little &amp;#34;mediciney.&amp;#34; Texture is what surprised me.</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so high for a small jar</li>
            <li> The price is on the high side  at $70 for a small container.</li>
            <li> is so much easier than applying it with your fingers and makes applying an even layer (with the least amount of product needed) a breeze.</li>
            <li> G.G. mask feels like it gets under my pores &amp; really fights off any of that icky build up.</li>
            <li> Make sure to splash your face with cold water after to close up your pores or they&#x27;ll leak pore juice all day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it did much to clear my clogged pores, or if it just dried out my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them on my nose and chin for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> As long as I can find it for a lower price I will continue to use it; however, it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m rushing to restock.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me for Christmas to fulfill my strange need to get everything I can out of my pores.</li>
            <li> is not very convenient Later will not come again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second it came on time, which was a short amount, wrapped in plastic, taped closed, and unopened.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Truly give your skin a glow all day long.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> This is not unexpected however as unclogging the pores give bacteria that is already on your skin the opportunity to flourish.  </li>
            <li> , it is beneficial in the long run.</li>
            <li> I scooped through the remaining product and.. a long hair was inside.</li>
            <li> since using this my skin has come a long way.</li>
            <li> I know I haven&#x27;t used it for long</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I know my face has been plagued with these for a long time</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used Biore nose strips religiously for years with minimal results.</li>
            <li> Mud is a bit grittier than i would have expected, but it&#x27;s not a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I have fewer blackheads so long as I keep using the mask.  </li>
            <li> In the span of me using it ( which hasn&#x27;t been that long) it has balanced my skin and it brightens it as well.</li>
            <li> AND you get the perverse pleasure of seeing the oil from your face seep up to the surface of the mask - a must for all weirdos who take strange pleasure in seeing things like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work by getting rid of acne, but does not clear blackheads.</li>
            <li> But the worse part is I paid for so a jar of this stuff and didn&#x27;t even get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I will say that when after reading the other reviews I was very hesitant to purchase due to the fact lots of previous customers said the seals have been broken.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I gave it to a friend with clear, pale skin, and she adores it.</li>
            <li> I did find that there was still some black stuff left in larger pores, even after I exfoliated!</li>
            <li> I will say that I do believe my skin was less oily midway thru the day for a day or two after using the mask, but I see the same results with the lesser priced clay/mud masks, too.</li>
            <li> you only get 1.2 ounces, however I have had mine for a year and still have half  left.</li>
            <li> There are definitely cheaper products that will give you similar effects for much less money.</li>
            <li> I applied my usual moisturizer and usually my face becomes super shiny after an hour but after using this product, my face was not</li>
            <li> I dont know if this is normal, but my product was watery and had little hard lumps in it.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly old or stored improperly?</li>
            <li> Besides, I would think the extra water with the shower would make it a lot less likely to dry there than the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice however that if you leave it on too long it can dry your skin out but leave it on for the time noted on the packaging</li>
            <li> As long as you rinse your brush immediately after using, it won&#x27;t dry, harden or gunk up the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is a little weird at first, but I didn&#x27;t notice it as much when it was on my face.</li>
            <li> In that time, I have no more blackheads on my nose ( which I&#x27;ve had since my teens) and i was suffering from a terrible breakout on my chin that would just not go away, but after 3 uses, it&#x27;s pretty much cleared up :) and my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> The mask definitely looked on myself how it did for other people</li>
            <li> Love this Product and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet !</li>
            <li> However it does the same thing as any other mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> (let me tell you if you consider that all those little dots are oil, it is a bit gross to see), and then simply rinsed it off, no scrubbing involved.</li>
            <li> I do not think this product is the same product that is sold in Sephora or other legit retailers.</li>
            <li> Kept the product anyway due to cost savings compared to regular retail.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than I would have like</li>
            <li> It might seem expensive but it is well worth the $$!</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell when I haven&#x27;t used it regularly though because my skin will go back to how it usually is.</li>
            <li> I think other mud masks do the same thing for cheaper, but I do like this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a basic mud mask that may help w/ pore congestion...like any other mask.</li>
            <li> The product is neat, rocky, very different that any other mask I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> I know it is slightly expensive but completely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but if you use it sparingly then it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I only use a little amount every once in a while for it to last longer.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t see it actually pulling stuff out like other users have said, I can tell a difference after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I&#x27;ve used this same jar 4x already and still have 1/2 a jar left.</li>
            <li> When I applied the mask to my face, I instantly became nauseous due to the wretched smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Certainly is different from other masks I have tried</li>
            <li> This product has a tendency to dry out if you are not careful in keeping the lid tight and just over time.</li>
            <li> Having bad skin and breakouts at 30 is embarrassing and I wish I would have taken better care of my skin earlier</li>
            <li> Having bad skin and breakouts at 30 is embarrassing and I wish I would have taken better care of my skin earlier</li>
            <li> The beauty is when it starts to dry.</li>
            <li> Within 20 mins my nose, chin, and forehead were covered in these spots and the mask had been fully dry for about 10 mins.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a tendency to dry skin</li>
            <li> I do not recommend leaving it on while you shower, because it will not fully dry.</li>
            <li> My skin also gets dry patches and this removes a lot of that scaliness  </li>
            <li> I let dry and washed it off and then took care of my blackheads and noticed the under the skin zit</li>
            <li> even though I don&#x27;t have a problem with serious breakouts, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t break out as much</li>
            <li> and i have fairly dry skin</li>
            <li> somewhat dry when I received it</li>
            <li> The too dry.</li>
            <li> but...it does dry out my face</li>
            <li> I have severe dry patches under my nose &amp; between my eyebrows, and I have cystic acne on my chin.</li>
            <li> There was dry and crusty product around the edges.</li>
            <li> Clears blackheads in 15 minutes and doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry or flaky.</li>
            <li> it does what it says it will do... including dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> I applied it and let it dry and</li>
            <li> It started to dry on my skin</li>
            <li> then, if you&#x27;re like me, you end up ripping your skin up and now you have a great big nasty wound?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it dry and then wipe it off</li>
            <li> My skin in naturally dry</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> It does dry out your problem areas</li>
            <li> and my skin was flaming red for the next few days.</li>
            <li> Inside the tiny jar is some dark grey goop.</li>
            <li> The package was open and dried mud was on the outside of the jar.  </li>
            <li> After 5 minutes I could already see it change from a dark grey color to a white- toothpaste color.</li>
            <li> Is it not a new one!!when</li>
            <li> It has been used , not new one.</li>
            <li> The product is not a new item.</li>
            <li> the product not new....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty watery, not as thick as I thought, but it doesn&#x27;t run down your face by any means.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and thought it would have a medium effectiveness at least.</li>
            <li> With that being said, it&#x27;s not practical to use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I also put some on a big open pore of my husband&#x27;s where we can usually squeeze out a big blackhead about every other day.</li>
            <li> had dullness and this definitely improved appearance of dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about beauty product reviews, but I saw so many raves about this I thought I would give it a try</li>
            <li> Big let down for my skin type.</li>
            <li> It brought out some pimples that must have been deep down</li>
            <li> It goes on dark grey and when it is all dry it is a lighter grey.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not sure if I would pay that much again for how little of an amount it gives though.</li>
            <li> , it is a very tiny bottle but rest assured - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This dinky little plastic disc is NOT a factory seal, and the new products don&#x27;t even come with that little disc.  </li>
            <li> I use makeup sponges to apply the mud, they allow you to quickly put a thin layer on with a minimum of mess.  </li>
            <li> Not hard to rinse off but still a little messy.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s working wonders on my combination skin that tends to break out a bit during &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; without making it flakey and overly dry!</li>
            <li> you can remove all black heads and have tiny pores.</li>
            <li> This mask is muddy and gritty and has a slight smell (although not unplessant).</li>
            <li> Maybe will try the black bottle version next.</li>
            <li> Previously my mask of choice has just been benonite clay mixed with water.</li>
            <li> For the people that say it doesn&#x27;t last long, you don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> you can the same result from for less.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of taking wet mud and applying it to your face, complete with small stones.  </li>
            <li> Paid less than I would have for same weighted product at Sephora.</li>
            <li> My skin type is oily/combination, not particularly breakout prone</li>
            <li> Black heads on my nose is a constant battle of mine...</li>
            <li> I kept the previously purchased mask container from sephora and it is not the same as what I received in my order</li>
            <li> The product itself looks as though it may have been previously used, possibly as a SAMPLE</li>
            <li> My mud is slightly clumpy which is my only hesitation for a 5 star (maybe that&#x27;s how it is suppose to be?).</li>
            <li> The mud only showed up all the black &amp; whiteheads when it dries up</li>
            <li> the jar had mask on the outside from someone previously using it?</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother and less red.</li>
            <li> The Supermud [white jar] , and the youthmud [black jar], my product also arrived the day after it was shipped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does not make them smaller or less yucky as you would imagine.  </li>
            <li> It is also the only treatment I have found that gets rid of black heads as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day three and the pores are still less noticeable, but I can tell that eventually they will go back to how they were before.  </li>
            <li> I like it well enough it didn&#x27;t suck black heads out of pores like video</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re using the mask and letting it dry, you can see the obvious work it does from the little dots all over your face.</li>
            <li> Item is NOT new!  </li>
            <li> Very dry, i cannot use it.</li>
            <li> The product i received was very dry</li>
            <li> This product did not clear or reduce my pores as I was hoping for and as I had read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> My local spa sells a similar mask for a little less but the bottle is triple the size.</li>
            <li> I received the jar and it looked almost used, with mud on the outside and half empty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic results the first time but</li>
            <li> This comes in a large intricate box that&#x27;s completely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I also had little red bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> I see my pores are a little smaller and</li>
            <li> I just pop a little spot treatment on the next day and they are GONE!</li>
            <li> I tried to move my face as little as possible.  </li>
            <li> Whatever blackheads were left would either wipe off or just needed a little pressure to get rid of.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look much younger, especially in the winter months when my skin seems very dry Nd dull</li>
            <li> other face creams/masks tend to dry my skin out and this one didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about ordering this online, I was worried that it would come dried out or it would be old.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase another jar within the next couple of months, just because I hate to run out of things that I really like.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of other products on the market that do the same thing for half the money.</li>
            <li> ever get one of this big, hard and swollen knots that you know won&#x27;t resolve itself for several days</li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little cheaper because I&#x27;d certainly buy it again immediately, and the jar is very small.</li>
            <li> I figured ok maybe I just happen to get a bad one because everyone I know swears by these.</li>
            <li> From a distance, you can&#x27;t tell I have pores around my nose at all, and the ones on my nose aren&#x27;t as bad (the blackheads on my nose are more stubborn).</li>
            <li> I hate hearing the term &amp;#34;Holy grail product&amp;#34;, but that was before using a product this amazing.</li>
            <li> It was pretty disappointing that it worked just barely as well as the benonite.</li>
            <li> I was irritated, but still curious.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy and use this once a week to help remove all the sneaky gunk that tries to hide in my pores.  </li>
            <li> My pores appear to be smaller, and it dried up some of my acne.</li>
            <li> but it was harder to spread on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a sample of this product with a Sephora order a few months back</li>
            <li> I received my item yesterday and the actual jar had a crust of the product dried on the edge of the opening.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely NO ISSUES ordering this.  </li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> saw this product on Pinterest, read a few of the reviews and decided I would give this product &amp; my skin problems one last shot.</li>
            <li> closed appeared to be tampered with</li>
            <li> So I read a few reviews saying that the product was open (tampered with)</li>
            <li> It only dried it out.</li>
            <li> All in all, though the product is expensive, I feel it is totally worth it for the texture and appearance it leaves your skin with afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was reading few reviews about the container looking gross and with no seal.</li>
            <li> After washing off the mask I could see that the debris in my pores had come out to the surface and my skin felt tighter, and the rough texture around my nose was minimized.  </li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews of glam glow before purchasing it and hoped that it would be worth it since it is TERRIBLY expensive.</li>
            <li> but the texture is &amp;#34;chunkier&amp;#34; than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads that seem to never really go away no matter what products I use.</li>
            <li> After both masks, my skin was noticeably softer and my trouble spots - around my nose and middle chin - were clearer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not MUCH cheaper than Sephora</li>
            <li> Some would work for a few weeks but it always came back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but it definitely works.  </li>
            <li> Came in on time and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Although i have only had it for a couple hours I have tried this for a few months now.</li>
            <li> be careful when ordering this online.  </li>
            <li> The last few times i used it</li>
            <li> and I think that it actually helps for a few days after using reduce the oil on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out with a few acne bumps prior use.</li>
            <li> The price from this seller is 50% lower than Sephora but don&#x27;t want to risk putting it on my face not really knowing what it is, I have requested a refund/return......</li>
            <li> After a few uses my skin was tighter, pores were smaller and my blemishes were gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say, it wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal cycstic acne, so not a whole lot helps, but all the reviews claimed this was a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Im in my mid 20&#x27;s and for the last few years I&#x27;ve had some type of breakout everyday.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that it&#x27;s partially my fault.</li>
            <li> I only used the product a few times, and I can already feel my face being cleansed from all the damage/dirt.</li>
            <li> it gives you an instant glow and repairs you uneven toned skin.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time but when I opened it, about 1/4 of the container was empty.</li>
            <li> Being deployed on an aircraft carrier is really rough on your skin.</li>
            <li> Shipping as expected arrived on time.</li>
            <li> and I see absolutely no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had to use it the past 2 days, just some bare minerals and blush).</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s not doing what I expected.</li>
            <li> The smell is really not offensive at all.  </li>
            <li> didnt come dried up or open..</li>
            <li> Same formula and half the cost of Sephora!</li>
            <li> Obviously has previously been used or tested!  </li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews FIRST: this product was previously OPENED, with interior seal BROKEN.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because after reading the reviews I really believed it would clear my blackheads, silly me!  </li>
            <li> and I used the black head strips all the time but never really fixed my problem.</li>
            <li> This product goes on a blackish grey, and dries a greenish color leaving black dots where your pores are.</li>
            <li> I have enlarged pores due to oily skin,  occasional  breakouts and a few post acne marks.</li>
            <li> Did not really clear up my black heads as it said it would do.</li>
            <li> After 6 uses I still don&#x27;t see smaller pores or less black heads.</li>
            <li> However, the directions clearly state to use a very small amount on your face.</li>
            <li> I did notice smoother, clearer skin, but it was not as miraculous as some other reviews had touted (much as I expected.)</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying out the other items GlamGlow has, and I&#x27;ll continue to be a lifelong fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far-the first time I put a thick layer all over my face - second time a used a thin layer.</li>
            <li> and then as a spot treatment over night, I didn&#x27;t wake up with completely clear skin, but there was a serious difference in just 2 times of using it</li>
            <li> I have acne scars/red marks on my face that I have spent thousands on trying to remove without some type of medical procedure over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t justify using such an expensive mask as my normal face mask.</li>
            <li> When we washed it of our pores were noticeably smaller, skin smother and tighter, and you have a little bit of a glow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The little jar can really go a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way as well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way when using this mask.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way also, so I feel like I got my bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> A bit pricy, however, a little goes a long way and what a difference it makes immediately.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but they say a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way  though.</li>
            <li> ordered 2 times only to get one that was dried out and the other one looked like it was used!</li>
            <li> thata the only problem it comes with very little product...</li>
            <li> What was disappointing was the fact that the jar isnt even half way filled...</li>
            <li> Makes my nose, shin &amp; forehead REALLY tight &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Washing it off on the other hand?</li>
            <li> No more trips to the Spa for facial treatments!  </li>
            <li> My left ear has a small infection.</li>
            <li> The product also contains ethylparaben, methylparaben, and a number of other substances that cause organ toxicity, reproductive toxicity, disrupt hormones, cause cancer, etc.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of this product or other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I checked the reviews on Sephora as well as any other reviews online.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> i read other reviews of people saying they got used products</li>
            <li> Would like to try the other ones as well n</li>
            <li> Two days after I used the product my face started to get small red bumps on it and then began to itch.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel softer than usual for about a day, but that&#x27;s the only benefit I&#x27;ve noticed.  </li>
            <li> So, careful there!</li>
            <li> Other charcoal products do not even compare.</li>
            <li> It is also such a small quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> You could see it working on the skin, but I never felt that overly drying sensation I have felt with other clay masks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month every other day or so</li>
            <li> It came off about as easily as other mud masks.</li>
            <li> Other masks remove some, but this took it ALL out.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars except its pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> Have others that bought from other places had this issue?</li>
            <li> Just like any other skin treatment, it&#x27;s not going to work a miracle overnight.</li>
            <li> and it dried out already for who knows how long.</li>
            <li> I use it about once every other week.</li>
            <li> Small jar for a big box, but does seem to work.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I did not notice a ginormous difference in my skins discoloring, size of my pores, etc.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination- EXTREME.</li>
            <li> I feel that I broke out more after using it. :(.</li>
            <li> after is common apparently.</li>
            <li> (every other day)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my pores or breakouts due to using the product.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product, along with other GlamGlow products again and again.</li>
            <li> This worked for me like any other mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a relatively small jar for a relatively steep price, though I did appreciate the ego boost (the packaging greeted me with &amp;</li>
            <li> Not sure we noticed a difference in pores but definitely noticed smoother skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size of the package (its too small).</li>
            <li> there were a few minor changes to the wording on packaging.</li>
            <li> every other product does.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Once the mask is on, it feels like any other clay mask (i.e. you can&#x27;t move your face).</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t see any permanent changes in my skin which is partially why I say this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> One on your nose (a nose strip) and one in any other problem areas (e.g. t-zone).</li>
            <li> (With the exception of cortisone injections for acne, which I use infrequently due to their cost.)  </li>
            <li> and i have minimal make lines there now!</li>
            <li> It sort of burns while it&#x27;s drying, and it&#x27;s definitely uncomfortable, but I was willing to put up with it if the mask did what it claimed.  </li>
            <li> I am going to continue to use this mask every other day and leave it on for about an hour and update with my results.</li>
            <li> I know the bottle is small, but you only need a little bit and it will go a long way!</li>
            <li> Other users have whined about the smell but come on people - you&#x27;re rubbing mud that has antioxidants in it on your face.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day and havent seen a change in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> said but as a clay mask it worked well and its small enough to travel with and make it through airport security so I can travel with it</li>
            <li> It claims not to make skin dry, but i do notice a little after use</li>
            <li> The product was a little bit dry.</li>
            <li> though i was burning my face off, until it began to dry and could see the little spots of gunk that were pulled from my pores, i was horrified.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin and this product has helped clear my skin more than other things I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only putting on a thin layer, enough to cover the skin in the gray color.</li>
            <li> so you put it one and after a few minutes you see it has started to dry, but you also see the areas where &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; oil/dirt/makeup/whatever has been pulled out of your skin.</li>
            <li> I feel much cleaner when I use it, but you are afraid to use it because you will only get a handful of uses out of the amount that they give you.</li>
            <li> The smell gets me sometimes, but that is because I am not a real fan of black licorice.</li>
            <li> black heads seem to have a harder time coming out</li>
            <li> I thought either that&#x27;s the way it came (like a bag of chips being half empty) or it was used.</li>
            <li> This makes the mask unusual from other masks I&#x27;ve tried, and I was skeptical that such a small amount of product would make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is expensive (and even more expensive in Sephora) and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it makes my skin feel tight while its on</li>
            <li> the vacuum on the pores is so effective it&#x27;s almost too disgusting to repeat...</li>
            <li> I recommend the Aztec Healing Clay on amazon which is less expensive and gives you results from the first use.</li>
            <li> I would probably rate this higher if it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews that recommended not washing it off in the shower, so I was using a washcloth in the sink, and it was all down my elbows.</li>
            <li> it was $20, I would use this as my main mask, but because the price is so high, I probably won&#x27;t be reordering... :-(</li>
            <li> This certainly tightens your pores but not in an uncomfortable way.  </li>
            <li> A thin layer works very well, and if you don&#x27;t use it often and the product in the jar gets a little thick/dry, just add a little water and mix.  </li>
            <li> but so are other products that cost much less.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every other day for less than a week</li>
            <li> When purchasing this product i was a little skeptical at first but after using it i have seen noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Tiny blackheads on my nose that were hard to remove were gone and my pores were cleaner and tighter.  </li>
            <li> However, a day or 2 later my skin broke out, which hardly ever happens.</li>
            <li> Personally it drys my skin out a little, so i usually put some lotion on afterwards.</li>
            <li> This however did very little long term.  </li>
            <li> The mask dried fairly hard and left my skin a little dry</li>
            <li> Really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this means it dries out if you don&#x27;t use it for a couple months and there isn&#x27;t much to use.</li>
            <li> It even reduces the appearance of some dark spots I have, making makeup application</li>
            <li> Not worth the risk considering</li>
            <li> Not worth the $$.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in my blackheads, specifically on my nose.</li>
            <li> I wish they would make a lighter colored version as the dark color gets everywhere</li>
            <li> Cleared up those icky red lurkers for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth this price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I emailed Glam Glow and complained and never heard back.</li>
            <li> The product is also extremely small and you may only get a few uses out of it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $</li>
            <li> the bottle is small but it still goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As it tightens you see dark spots were</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the hype</li>
            <li> Not really worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that it faded my dark marks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the mask is on, you see dark spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glamglow removed the dark color from the surface of the sebum</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the $50 I paid for it on amazon.</li>
            <li> (dark spots are residue sucked from pores).</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Small, expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark gray and dries to a lighter gray.  </li>
            <li> but it was clumpy,like it had been an old or poorly made product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it a few tries and it still hasn&#x27;t amazed me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other face masks, you use very little product so a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I got to use almost half of this, while the other half was just unusable.</li>
            <li> It was also watered down.</li>
            <li> Just to clarify, the Glam Glow mask itself, hands down 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> But when it comes down to it, GlamGlow is just an overpriced mud mask.  </li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> Shut yourself in your room, sit down, read a book, watch TV, etc.</li>
            <li> I laid down and accidentally fell asleep for four hours.</li>
            <li> I was a little cautious because some other reviews said that theirs seemed tampered with, or that there wasn&#x27;t a seal.</li>
            <li> I mean that initially after I washed the mask off it did yield results as promised however after about 4 hours</li>
            <li> Works as well as other reviews said it would!</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s what you get for only paying half the retail price, but I was still sorely disappointed to see no result from a product I&#x27;ve previously had so much success with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the one I got is brand new, because it only have half of the product, and the lid seems dirty.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve applied the small amount of product to your face, it immediately begins to dry</li>
            <li> This product is not for me, it makes my skin itchy, dry, and I got lots small bumps on my forehead since I used it.</li>
            <li> i was very skeptical about this mask but was lucky to receive samples at Sephora.</li>
            <li> and there are some large, hard pieces which you notice when you spread the thin layer over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t draw out black heads or anything...</li>
            <li> Half the price of Sephora.</li>
            <li> While it is expensive to use regularly, you MUST use it regularly to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually seems to look as if it pulls out the dirt because there are tiny black marks in troubled areas.</li>
            <li> smell reminds me of black licorice and mint.</li>
            <li> All I noticed were black spots on the mask from the oils in my pores.</li>
            <li> said it made black heads vanish.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s supposed to bring out  ...the um, hidden problems under your skin?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fun (in that disgusting way haha)</li>
            <li> My black heads are even going away.</li>
            <li> They were concentrated around my nose and chin, where I typically have problems with zits or blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have lot less black heads.  </li>
            <li> my pores were literally half the size they were before</li>
            <li> I would say it is slightly over priced for what you get.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s half price</li>
            <li> almost half the price of sephora</li>
            <li> The box is misleading on how big the bottle actually is so at first I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It erased any black heads I had.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t irritating at all, not much redness at all after washing it off, and I leave it on for way longer than is actually recommended (probably shouldn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> Pore size is reduced, bumps and acne are less noticeable in just a week, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for my extra-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I removed the seal half the jar was gone and it had finger indents where the product had been removed.</li>
            <li> I could tell that a lot of the gunk was gone and my pores were already less prevalent.</li>
            <li> The breakout is SIGNIFICANTLY less.  </li>
            <li> It smells slightly minty.</li>
            <li> All those black heads around my nose?</li>
            <li> My daughter has a slight problems being a teenager</li>
            <li> but does help with black heads.</li>
            <li> However, it has delivered improved skin texture and slight improvement in pore size as it claims.</li>
            <li> FOR A  LOT LESS THAN THIS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just some sort of chemical reaction that makes the black dots form.  </li>
            <li> So you begin to use it less and less</li>
            <li> but when it came the lid has product caked all over it as if it had been previously opened.</li>
            <li> however after 4 days my face appears clearer and honestly, less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up 2 jars and noticed my black &amp; whiteheads are still there on my face.</li>
            <li> I always end up pop/squeeze out my black &amp; whiteheads myself to get them out.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot in order to find a product that would get rid of my black heads.</li>
            <li> Anyway off subject now....</li>
            <li> After a week and 3 uses, my skin is less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I typically use the product 3 or 4 times a week that regiment works for me.</li>
            <li> The product was used and half gone and</li>
            <li> I wish I could give less than one star.</li>
            <li> This costs MUCH less on Amazon than at Sephora, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> After one use there was less blackheads on my husbands nose, he has been using it once to two times a week &amp; his blackheads are almost all gone.</li>
            <li> Its not super, theres no miracle, it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> As an FYI, for those that saw this on Pintrest with the black spots you thought were oil coming to the surface.. no, there are bits and pieces of black (charcoal?)</li>
            <li> It virtually erased my pores, and it shows black spots on the pimples that it is removing.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day for spot treatments and my pores have diminished by half!</li>
            <li> Arrived in less than 2 days.</li>
            <li> I would not order this again because of the cost, but it works and I use it sparingly-it does smell slightly odd.</li>
            <li> I previously had blackheads around my nose and on my chin before using this product, but when I washes the product off, they were gone.</li>
            <li> Black heads are still there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I still have about half of the bottle remaining.  </li>
            <li> You might notice a tingle or slight sting if you have a pimple you&#x27;ve been picking at</li>
            <li> Less mess on my fingers..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased product ffrom Sephora previously-- seel tight and unbroken.</li>
            <li> I have never really had issues with my skin (face) in the past</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty cold, so perhaps keep temperature sensitivity in mind when you use it.</li>
            <li> I saw no change after using this product, and for the price it was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> This not only reduces shine, but it clears up painful blemishes (cystic and regular white heads)</li>
            <li> The mud is dark gray and dries mint green on your face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal sad self</li>
            <li> I do have a few dark spots that I see diminishing from the use of this mask.</li>
            <li> I did have some dark spots on my nose and chin once the mask dried that resembled oil.</li>
            <li> This product has little pieces of hard granules inside the mud so when you see it in pictures in it&#x27;s dried state it makes it look like it&#x27;s actually distracting and cleaning pores when in fact it&#x27;s the dried granules.</li>
            <li> When I put it on you can see all the little black heads coming out in the treatment.  </li>
            <li> Any who, the product was black and goopy and spread a little on m checks and chin.</li>
            <li> You know how a lot of masks make your face feel tight for about 30 minutes after</li>
            <li> When this mask dries, it pulls tight so don&#x27;t leave it on longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> Watch the &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; of oil come through as the product begins to dry into a hard mask.</li>
            <li> I use it to put on bumps to dry them up at night and in the morning they are hardly formed or noticeable.</li>
            <li> For as much as this stuff costs, I was pretty appalled at how much it doesn&#x27;t deliver. :(</li>
            <li> This clay had little strips of what was probably seaweed in it which made quite a mess as the seaweed doesn&#x27;t stick well to your face.</li>
            <li> I had researched it a ton before buying it, but was still skeptical that it would live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> or it is a fake because it does not look like new and the packaging has been opened.</li>
            <li> However, after less than 3 months the mask dried out and I had to toss it.</li>
            <li> I did see all the black spots on my face after it dried but nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product (GlamGlow) was older and showing it&#x27;s shelf life, or it was out in the cold winter weather too long before I got home to take it inside, or maybe this is how the product was ment to be--</li>
            <li> This cream does NOT clean out your pours.</li>
            <li> Overall, while this product is expensive, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I could see small dots starting to form as the mask worked its magic at sucking out the nasty stuff from my pores.</li>
            <li> I bought the little packets to see if I would like it</li>
            <li> I was a little alarmed at the chunkiness of this mask treatment.</li>
            <li> and my acne has shrunk a little</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> This mask is a little treat.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin break out a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Be a little bit cautious after you use it though.</li>
            <li> it is a little jar.  </li>
            <li> Wish the product was a little cheaper but will buy again.  </li>
            <li> so this little bottle has lasted 5 months.</li>
            <li> BUT, it is not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I think the packaging is a little cumbersome</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 9, and this little mask pulls out all the gunk in your skin.</li>
            <li> I had read about this stuff on pintrest but was a little unsure.</li>
            <li> Some products have helped but  there were always some little blackheads still there.</li>
            <li> Since all the gunk in my pores were pulled to the surface by this mask, that little pore strip removed it all, and yeah,</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY not worth the price!</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone and gets rid of the little zits I get on my chin.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic because of the price of the product</li>
            <li> A little spendy for the amount that you get though.</li>
            <li> Save your money, it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> it also worked wonders on the little of blackheads that i do get around my nose.</li>
            <li> It seems to help a little bit but isn&#x27;t the miracle I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Usually about once every other week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not buy this product on the amazon&#x27;s website because I was a little worried I would get an expired product</li>
            <li> I was a little put off by the price</li>
            <li> - even helped a little with acne scarring and pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Looked it up and did a little home work.</li>
            <li> The down side, yes this product was expensive (but compared to the $70 it normally costs, it&#x27;s a bargain), and the container is small.</li>
            <li> And it still feels tight even after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I thought the jar was very small when I opened the box, but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It also has little chips in it, almost like dried flakes.</li>
            <li> I believe my pores also shrunk a little after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy and pricey, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> I have problem skin and one pimple that I have been battling for days, a little bit of this stuff and it killed that pimple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the little black bottle!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting there to be huge clumps in the face mud, and when I opened the actual jar, it looked disgusting, there was dried face mud all around the lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that is something normal, or if I got a weird batch.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid I didn&#x27;t really see that.</li>
            <li> do think this is a gimmicky product</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money and i am about to go to buy one for the $70 because this mask does work.</li>
            <li> He applies a thin layer and leaves it on for 30 minutes or (occasionally) overnight.  </li>
            <li> thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that after a few months it started drying up...</li>
            <li> , it draws it to the surface creating a few blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been out of it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> 5 days after using product I found red bumps behind my ears and some on my eyes.</li>
            <li> If anything I think it dried my skin out</li>
            <li> The product (fulfilled by Amazon) arrived with the seal broken, the actual face mask was 50% used, and there was mold all around the container lid.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> , you can see the bits of green tea leaves in it as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this didn&#x27;t seem to have any noticeable difference until I stopped using it because the face wash I was using at the time dried out my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but is a must try, and this price beats all B&amp;M stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy</li>
            <li> but you only need a thin layer.</li>
            <li> it was so dried up you couldn&#x27;t even spread it on your face.</li>
            <li> Completely dried up like it&#x27;s been sitting in the sun for days.</li>
            <li> Not to mention I&#x27;ve wasted tons of money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Product was dried up and was already opened.</li>
            <li> Just be warned that for a few days after use you will break out because it brings out all the junk.  </li>
            <li> I feel like a wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I tried this few times and could not believe how well this works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> It looked like it had been opened and was maybe missing some in the jar.</li>
            <li> but I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> When that layer dried it didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; like the rest of my face but an oily brown.</li>
            <li> After this happened a few times I figured that the tip of my nose must have excess oil on the surface which was why the mask didn&#x27;t seem to be working.</li>
            <li> although I use the cream everyday, I use the mud once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> although I use the cream everyday, I use the mud once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> If the jar dries out, add a few drops of purified water and stir.</li>
            <li> Green tea extract &#x3D; studies shown it can protect against skin inflammation/acne and cancer.</li>
            <li> and it took a few weeks for me to see the improvements</li>
            <li> The seal was missing and there were dried clumps on the lid.</li>
            <li> and then everything cleared up after a few days.</li>
            <li> under my eyes, and a few dots on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews that they thought their jar had been tampered with and the seal was broken, I took extra close look at mine when it came in the mail and everything was sealed and intact.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews that some seemed jars seemed used.  </li>
            <li> You do have to use it a few times a week to maintain the results.</li>
            <li> This product was NOT sealed and it was dried out.  </li>
            <li> It helps pull all the gunk out of the pores from a week of make-up and everyday stuff.</li>
            <li> It is some kind of disgusting, for you never know what happened before you have this in your hand.</li>
            <li> I used it twice and it dried out</li>
            <li> I try to use it about once a week on my trouble spots (chin &amp; nose).</li>
            <li> I did see it \\&quot;working\\&quot; as in I could see spots on the dried mask</li>
            <li> But as far as removing blackheads, a lousy investment.  </li>
            <li> There was residue around the rim of the jar and the product was not filled to the brim.</li>
            <li> would have given it 5 stars had it not come opened, used and partially dried out.</li>
            <li> ( I think it&#x27;s the green tea )</li>
            <li> Pimple are brought to the surface within a few hours.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on something thats already been tampered with.</li>
            <li> I put this product in my cart and thought about it for a few days.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll soon start noticing small dark spots around any oily areas.</li>
            <li> My skin feels firm and taunt, and I immediately moisturize it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin and the product dried up inside of the container after a few months.</li>
            <li> If you have any type of severe acne, please don&#x27;t waste your time here.</li>
            <li> It got worse actually.</li>
            <li> Seem to breakout with a few pimples after use</li>
            <li> waste of money.  </li>
            <li> As it dried my it tightened on my face</li>
            <li> In conclusion if you can grab a hold of a sample size version you should def try it out.. but don&#x27;t spend $40-$60 on this gimmicky face mask.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout, I know a few people had that happen after using the product.</li>
            <li> It started to tingle around the tops of my cheeks immediately, and dried within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> not sure if i&#x27;m down for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mud goes on black/green then dries pale green except where the oil is preventing it from drying (spots).</li>
            <li> It looked like someone had used half of it before I even got it!</li>
            <li> But buying it on amazon means I can get it for HALF the price as in the store!.</li>
            <li> AND I noticed less blackheads!</li>
            <li> Reduces the noticibility of black heads and pores!</li>
            <li> Then I found it on Amazon for almost half the price!</li>
            <li> it keeps my pores looking small and keeps the black heads away.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little raw.  </li>
            <li> When you rip that strip off, all of the junk stuck to the strip is disgusting, but at the same time, you can&#x27;t stop thinking about how cool it is that the little strip got it out of your nose.</li>
            <li> At least for my skin I need to use it every other week.</li>
            <li> Not amazing like other reviews said.</li>
            <li> Hate it, go with the original one</li>
            <li> The jar is small, but it only requires a thin layer of product to see results.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to follow up with a Biore nose strip to get what is left behind.</li>
            <li> It is a small jar, but you only need a thin layer to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> a little bit small</li>
            <li> The size is on the small side but a little goes</li>
            <li> I have been debating for almost a year on whether to spend the money on GlamGlow products because my thoughts were, &amp;#34;how could this mud mask be that much different than something that&#x27;s a lot less expensive?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if any was missing</li>
            <li> Thiscis too expensive and not worth the hype or the price for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have small pimples on my &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; but nothing drastic- no huge zits that will leave scars for a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> As I washed it off I could already tell my skin looked less dull.</li>
            <li> It does pull some stuff out of your skin but when I would use it as a spot treatment it did have a hard time getting a stubborn black head out.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t rub your skin raw when washing off.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and not worth the hassle, might as well buy the real thing for the extra money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put it on too thick, it just wastes it and you&#x27;ll have wrinkles on your face like you just slept on a wrinkled pillow for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Not enough sleep, poor diet, (and in my case being a mechanic) causes my face serious damage.</li>
            <li> The only down side I&#x27;ve seen is the price but in reality with all the other pricey face stuff it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way but still expensive</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot yellow bad odor liquid inside the lid and the mask has strange smell too.</li>
            <li> Monday I have a small pimple on my chin.</li>
            <li> That was messy as heck!</li>
            <li> Still have small blackheads on my nose even after the masks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small container</li>
            <li> I tested a small spot before using it all over my face.</li>
            <li> I toned and moisturized as usual and went to bed.</li>
            <li> not sure how often I will use it, they suggest once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> and it is a heck of a lot of money for a small container of &#x27;mud&#x27;.</li>
            <li> You get a really small jar for the price.  </li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;d like something that didn&#x27;t look like it was past sell-by and fished out of a dumpster.</li>
            <li> When I went to use it again and it was dried out!</li>
            <li> I tried out this product as soon as I got the package yesterday as I was anxious to see if it worked.  </li>
            <li> I suppose but I&#x27;m not sure that would/should make the product leak through the foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like a small amount, but it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Just pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would usually use it twice a week or sometimes 4 times a week</li>
            <li> so I place the small treatment in my bathroom&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with glamglow, a friend mentioned it in passing and the next day I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> It is too small.</li>
            <li> The jar is small</li>
            <li> I have done 4 treatments and I am probably have used 1/3 of the small bottle.</li>
            <li> I will usually use it Asa spot treatment on a blemish which also stops me from picking at it.</li>
            <li> Also the jar is so small for the price.</li>
            <li> After that, I apply a small amount of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> this product was not authentic</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was opened before?</li>
            <li> I didnt give it 5 stars because it is pricey and it is small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what makes it work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive and the jar is tiny, but they allege you can get 1,000 uses out of it.  </li>
            <li> They probably do the same thing.&amp;#34; Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I received a small sample at Sephora, but then I saw the price, $69 bucks.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try it again to see if it works just as well.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that there are weird chunks of grassy/leafy-like stuff in the mud</li>
            <li> usually leave it on for about 10-15 minutes, then rinse off.</li>
            <li> I read mixed reviews and tried it because it wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive on amazon, but have heard of people spending upwards of $60 for this.  </li>
            <li> I usually have one or two pimples on my chin</li>
            <li> Im not sure if i didnt take all the product off</li>
            <li> Now I usually use this before I go on date night</li>
            <li> (i.e. you moved your face excessively during the pore strip portion of the process).</li>
            <li> I had purchased two of these on Amazon in the past and had no problem.</li>
            <li> and I do admit the packaging has looked shady every time.</li>
            <li> i dont know what the deal is :/</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of masks in the past, and I have to say</li>
            <li> But it is wwwwaaaayyyy too expensive, for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> ( I usually slather my face in liquid makeup in the morning</li>
            <li> What a waste of hard-earned money!</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this product again and again, and I recommend this for anybody that is insecure about their skin.</li>
            <li> Most awful purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Its a small bottle</li>
            <li> Like one application and zap no more blackheads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;m supposed to use it</li>
            <li> Spilling half bottle Yellow looks dirty inside</li>
            <li> You only use a very thin layer.</li>
            <li> it is a very small jar i am almost out and to get the desired results you would probablu have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Other than that I think my skin looks worse after I use it.</li>
            <li> : it smells alright (not great) and feels weird (although not a bad weird) as it dries.</li>
            <li> WOW, was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> As a result,  I am not sure if I have the real product or not :(</li>
            <li> I hate the gross giant pore I have on my nose</li>
            <li> If you have seriously problematic skin this is defiantly something to try, give it a few times as it may break you out if u have acne that has not surfaced yet, it will draw everything out of your skin but after that is over (give it a week)</li>
            <li> and my skin only seems to be getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Product seal was broken (open) and dirty was NOT new as advertised.</li>
            <li> but i have small pores and when they build up its hard to treat them.</li>
            <li> it is normal since it is taking out all the bad stuff from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pretty much worthless</li>
            <li> like the black product stays behind in my pores.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less expensive</li>
            <li> Just makes your face feel hard and doesn&#x27;t get rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li> skin type is oily, and all you oily people out there know how hard it can be to maintain it.</li>
            <li> clay masks are hard to wash off and take some scrubbing.</li>
            <li> and now I hardly notice them.</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever break out now.</li>
            <li> Just looking at it I thought it would be very thick and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is a little container, so I figured I would use this on the bad stuff only.</li>
            <li> It pulls and sucks all the oil and dirt out of your pores.  </li>
            <li> it sucks.</li>
            <li> At least i didn&#x27;t pay 70.</li>
            <li> At least while it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it sucks everything to the surface.</li>
            <li> I have used this product at least three times a week</li>
            <li> This seller had a lot of negative feedback regarding opened product, but mine was sealed.</li>
            <li> I try and use this product at least once a week.</li>
            <li> also found that this mask needs to be used at least once a week (for me) in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> also found that this mask needs to be used at least once a week (for me) in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> Inside the shipping carton was a ripped up, dented product box containing a gross and dirty jar.</li>
            <li> but it was too late.</li>
            <li> In the product it contains activated charcoal that sucks all the oils out of your pores.  </li>
            <li> Sucks the grime out of ur pores</li>
            <li> We both use it alt least twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I am a sucker for all things beauty and this was no exception.</li>
            <li> But after using it at least twice a week, I haven&#x27;t seen any results on the size/appearance of blackheads.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the negative reviews before buying this.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just a sucker for the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems it was tampered with.. not nice.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 3 times a week and leave it on for about 20 min.</li>
            <li> I hate paying so much money for it</li>
            <li> It was too thick.</li>
            <li> After about a month now I&#x27;m noticing that the blackheads are slowly going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need a thick layer on your skin, you are just wasting the product.  </li>
            <li> Hey mud is thick...</li>
            <li> so I forced myself to come here and buy it</li>
            <li> now I think and my scars are slowly fading away</li>
            <li> It seems to be the only thing that keeps my skin from breaking out, however my product came slightly damaged and opened. :(</li>
            <li> the box is sooooooo small!</li>
            <li> Difficult to determine if any product had been removed or the space was due to settling.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE BUMP!</li>
            <li> I hate paying the high price for it</li>
            <li> I washed my face just like any other person would do, and applied a very thin layer.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid because the bottle was not clean when I took the cap off.</li>
            <li> The container is very small was caked on the edges when i opened it.</li>
            <li> Although the size is very small compared to the shipping box its almost a tease</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the container is very small.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I understand the hype behind this product.</li>
            <li> and I wish it were less expensive, but it truly works.</li>
            <li> I figured if all else fails at least I didn&#x27;t waste $60.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work just as well as any clay face mask that you can buy from the drugstore, but the price tag is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Needless to say the first time I tried it I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for all the internet hype about something, but this seriously works.</li>
            <li> but it did seriously help my skin.</li>
            <li> This rocks, seriously, I have family and friends try all the time.</li>
            <li> May try and find a less expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> Is it just me or did this product cause a serious break out?</li>
            <li> I have really deep sole lines that fill with makeup and look terrible.</li>
            <li> You can seriously see the gunk getting pulled out of your pores, just like on the video on their website.</li>
            <li> After all, you aren&#x27;t loading half the jar onto your face: a thin layer will do the trick!  </li>
            <li> A completely ridiculous description of what this does.</li>
            <li> and that is just a little mask not full!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to buying and saw a lot of comments on receiving the product opened or used and for some reason I thought hey maybe they just had bad luck....</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about the product, the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is bc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I got a bad batch, but I don&#x27;t plan on shelling out another $69 to find out.</li>
            <li> I used this as a spot treatment and wherever I placed the mask, I got deep painful pimples.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive I would use it everyday</li>
            <li> I see a pimple forming and my immediate thought is ATTACK, not good because the debris tends to spread, thus furthering the problem.</li>
            <li> There are tiny pieces of something that get everywhere, not sure what, and these are a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> I very strongly do not recommend!</li>
            <li> The image is quite deceiving, the bottle is actually very small and the cream stinks like cow poop.</li>
            <li> The negative to this product is that its costly, and very small amounts, but it WORKS!</li>
            <li> Expensive dry mud, difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 36 years old &amp; despite believing that I shouldn&#x27;t be experiencing bad break outs at this age, unfortunately that is not the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terribly disappointed with this purchase especially for the price attached.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what to expect and purchase something that isn&#x27;t legit, you probably won&#x27;t get the same results and be disappointed.</li>
            <li> that I get off work and my face isn&#x27;t greasy, oily, and pretty much disgusting.</li>
            <li> What I got was a container of gloopy, dark, mud like substance with lots of annoying uneven particles in it.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked, considering I spent $50 on it.</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer of this on my nose and chin and let it sit for twenty minutes.</li>
            <li> but then if I put it really thin, it doesn&#x27;t pull out any gunk.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to make it worse.</li>
            <li> However, I was tired of pimples, so I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> It clears my pores and breakouts have significantly decreased.  </li>
            <li> My friend&#x27;s husband caught us wearing the GlamGlow mask and tried it in secret one night.</li>
            <li> This product is my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> It has poor ratings on Beautypedia.com, and can cause skin irritation over time.</li>
            <li> After a day working in a warehouse, it really helps extract all the dirt and grim.</li>
            <li> I have persistent acne on my face that I make worse by picking at.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my skin and made me break out worse.</li>
            <li> The mask cover sheet was broken</li>
            <li> The seal was broken.</li>
            <li> Brightens and cleans poors without irritating skin.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> My pores haven&#x27;t decreased in size and it hasn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t anything for my blackheads.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever because you need a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I Used GlamGlow:&lt;br /&gt;I smeared a thin layer all over my face and let it set.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating and I&#x27;ve tried it all.</li>
            <li> When I put this mask on, I can visually see all of that crap being literally sucked out of my pores.</li>
            <li> Addicted to this mask .</li>
            <li> - you spread a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> is it opened!I &#x27;m a little angry!</li>
            <li> On another note I didn&#x27;t find the smell bad as other people had mentioned.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a bad smell like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why someone would pay some ridiculous amount for this product elsewhere!  </li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works!</li>
            <li> Seriously !</li>
            <li> This stuff is serious miracle mud!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I am far from disappointed!</li>
            <li> I used a little and nothing crazy happened, so hopefully there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> i do not have any bad black heads</li>
            <li> I had really bad black heads on my nose and under my bottom lip</li>
            <li> Dramatic results sometimes call for dramatic prices.</li>
            <li> However, I have very sensitive skin and after using it three times, I had the worst breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Totally went bad!</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror 5 minutes later and was shocked with what I saw surfacing!</li>
            <li> it is a little painful when you use it</li>
            <li> I was a little sticker shocked with the price</li>
            <li> From all that acne came scaring and really bad uneven skin.</li>
            <li> A LOT worse, did not help with blackheads or troubled skin.</li>
            <li> This product was clearly tampered with and I was disgusted.</li>
            <li> boyfriend was shocked at the amount of oil and black heads that it pulled out that I caught him using it one time too!</li>
            <li> but I get black heads on my T- zone that drive me crazy!  </li>
            <li> Although, I was disappointed that the product appeared to have been previously opened.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed because it didn&#x27;t just pull out the debris or black heads on my nose.  </li>
            <li> I think mine had been opened Previously too. :(  </li>
            <li> Its TOO bad waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> I think I may have gotten a bad batch, as there were hard pieces distributed throughout the product that I had never seen before this order.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for expensive, name brand products.</li>
            <li> I tried the homemade remedies of lemon juice/baking soda/honey, which were useless as well.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon, it&#x27;s still $50...so expensive.</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of clogged/enlarged pores that lead to random breakouts.  </li>
            <li> but it was so uncomfortable and it ended up doing nothing for my skin except make it irritated.  </li>
            <li> It tingled moderately, but nothing that felt horrible.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product I was skeptical, but I figured...</li>
            <li> I hope I am wrong...</li>
            <li> I have awful pore that constantly are giving my problems..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> Its not that difficult to replicate packaging.</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about getting this product because of how expensive it was, but believe me</li>
            <li> blackheads &amp; blind pimples.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that is so sad</li>
            <li> too expensive tho-</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> If you are disappointed in your results after one use, keep using it as needed, I usually do mine twice a week.</li>
            <li> but sadly it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am seriously obsessed with this mask and the thirsty mud.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not impressed.</li>
            <li> For me, this is quite expensive</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this purchase</li>
            <li> This seal was opened inside the bottle and it looked as if the product had been used, how distasteful.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises--my skin is definitely clearer and softer after use--but it smells AWFUL.</li>
            <li> So, needless to say, he loves it too.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on this unnecessarily pricey item!</li>
            <li> way too expensive for the amount in there</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I missed the return deadline by one day.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though</li>
            <li> I have been searching for YEARS what could possibly help my horrible skin?!!!!</li>
            <li> But, unfortunately it did nothing for my blackheads.</li>
            <li> expensive mud that just dries out combination skin like</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not amazed by the results, you did it wrong</li>
            <li> Anyway, I read the reviews both here and on Sophora and as I mentioned before hand, I was skeptical as I pushed the purchase button.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to move my face without cracking the mask, so</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I like it although it&#x27;s not excellent as people says.</li>
            <li> The entire package, which is the worst thing about this product, official or otherwise, as it is way over-zealous and wasteful, was ever superfluous but lacking the plastic</li>
            <li> I was skeptical -</li>
            <li> It was so bad I would hate to go out in public and put pounds of makeup on my face to hide it.</li>
            <li> I am so disgusted by this, I will purchase at Sephora&#x27;s next time.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but thought why not, purchased this</li>
            <li> Must admit, I was skeptical when applying since you use a VERY thin layer.</li>
            <li> It goes on in a very thin layer.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating and wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your money.</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I applied a very thin layer to my face and let it sit for about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> This was very expensive for little to no result :(</li>
            <li> I have terrible oily skin and when I put the mask on you can see it working immediately after it begins to dry on the pores.  </li>
            <li> It sucks out all the crap from your pores &amp; blackheads.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product because of all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I have so unhappy</li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> its crazy the difference in quality there are between skincare products.</li>
            <li> The box was opened and it was dirty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how well</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m afraid to use it now-_-</li>
            <li> This product is used and its not authenticity，it&#x27;s been opened and the inside is dirty</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try this mask, but it was so expensive in Canada($69)!</li>
            <li> I promise you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with glamglow!</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t buy it again, sorry!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just unpleasant?  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> ALL THAT BAD STUFF</li>
            <li> they won&#x27;t spread, i don&#x27;t know if the jar i got went bad, or it&#x27;s just what this mask is supposed to be?</li>
            <li> Smelled bad.  </li>
            <li> Packaging seemed like it had been opened or was shook bad shipping.</li>
            <li> Bad mask.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have had a bad couple months with acne.</li>
            <li> So it suckks sooo bad</li>
            <li> I do not understand where any of the bad reviews come from...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how bad this treatment is.</li>
            <li> Gave me a BAD breakout.</li>
            <li> Either my skin was as not in as bad of shape as I thought</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne.</li>
            <li> Not so bad for my money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A lot of people will be upset when a mask does this and insist that it&#x27;s a bad product or not doing it&#x27;s job, but that is why these masks work so well.  </li>
            <li> : I used this mask on a couple of painful pimples I had gotten on my chin</li>
            <li> It does appear to be pulling some oil from my blackheads, and I do get some sort of sick satisfaction out of seeing that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, like I said, I get a sick enjoyment out of seeing what it does appear to be pulling out of my skin, so I will continue using it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive &amp; a waste of money &amp; time using it when they just DON&#x27;T WORK AT ALL!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I will probably not buy it from this seller again :(</li>
            <li> and hopefully I won&#x27;t be disappointed and cheated</li>
            <li> After using this fake mask one time, I had the worst cystic acne of my life (the type of acne</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son because people said it worked for blackheads and was disappointed, it didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> :(.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> With this mask, you can see it working and where all your problem areas are! I always wanted to try this mask, but it was so expensive in Canada($69)! Even on amazon.can it was $75+. So I looked on amazon.com, and bought it from a different seller who ships to Canada!.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT. REALLY DRAWS OUT ALL THAT BAD STUFF</li>
            <li> Yes, this mask is great and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or cause it to break out after use. Plus the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> My wife buys this in bulk so she must love it.</li>
            <li> Good mask after I uses</li>
            <li> This stuff fixed my skin! I&#x27;ve been using it on and off since May and I can tell the difference when I use it regularly. I have a very oily T - zone and a sensitive (read-easily dried out) everywhere else and this really helps balance everything out. It really clears up chin bumps and turns into a great scrub when you wash it off with water and your hands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask and I will continue to repurchase it. I&#x27;ve used the aztec healing clay mask, which a lot of people claim to be better, but I feel like they are both essential to my routine. The aztec mask has to be used at night because the pulsing makes your skin red for hours, this one makes your skin look perfect as soon as you rinse it off. Sometimes I don&#x27;t know the night before that my skin is going to be terrible, so that&#x27;s where this comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this is a gimmicky product and I wish it were less expensive, but it truly works. It&#x27;s easy to rinse off, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or sting while it&#x27;s on, and when you rinse it off you&#x27;ll find gorgeous, supple, glowy and perfect skin. I hate paying so much money for it but once I discovered it I was hooked and can no longer be without it.</li>
            <li> Is it not a new one!!when I received the mud is it opened!I &#x27;m a little angry! and that is just a little mask not full!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and she uses it twice a week.  She says it brightens and clears her face.  I think I see a little difference, too. :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product is wonderful you can feel it working the minute you put it on smells great and is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used in a long time</li>
            <li> Works great for black heads. Does dry out skin though so it cant be used more than once or twice a week depending on how sensative your skin is.</li>
            <li> Dies out pretty fast is my only complaint (</li>
            <li> I heard about this product while browsing Pinterest.  I went to Sephora, which is completely sold out, and available only online for $60. I bought this product on Amazon for $39.  I figured if all else fails at least I didn&#x27;t waste $60.  At first when it arrived, although in great time, I suspect it had been opened before and quite possibly used.  It did not come wrapped in plastic, just little clear circle tabs on the bottom holding lid on and even that like it could have been opened.  The inner jar and product still looked full and fresh. I have a sister, so I didn&#x27;t really care if someone else tested it out. I was irritated, but still curious.  I tried it and it works like a charm!!  It pulls and sucks all the oil and dirt out of your pores.  I was so amazed I took the disgusting photos and sent them to my mom, sister and friends!! Along with the after photos of how clear and smooth my skin had become.  I AM A LIFER.  I will continue to buy and use this once a week to help remove all the sneaky gunk that tries to hide in my pores.  I saw an immediate reduction in the number and size of blackheads after 1 (ONE) use.</li>
            <li> Love! I saw reviews over this product on YouTube but actually using it... Its AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Way too overhyped. Doesn&#x27;t draw out black heads or anything... Yes it will clean my skin well but that&#x27;s about it. Same with my sister.</li>
            <li> One treatment and my face showed improvement. I have sensitive skin and the mask was gentle which other face creams/masks tend to dry my skin out and this one didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My pores appear to be smaller, and it dried up some of my acne. Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I&#x27;m happy with it! Half the price of Sephora.</li>
            <li> When purchasing this product i was a little skeptical at first but after using it i have seen noticeable results. My pores feel smaller and my skin softer. But with a $50 price tag and such a small quantity I expected more.</li>
            <li> when i received mine it was water downed and not like the original one you buy at Sephora it was a waste of money and i am about to go to buy one for the $70 because this mask does work. just not the one you buy on amazon</li>
            <li> I like how this mask make the skin soft after using it. However, I didn&#x27;t see much difference with my nose pores !! I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love it can&#x27;t wait to buy more</li>
            <li> Incredible product!! Been recommending it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the purchase, the future will continue to buy</li>
            <li> This is the best facial item you can try. It really does make a difference. My pores became smaller and over time combined with a facial scrubber or biore strips you can remove all black heads and have tiny pores. My husband even uses it because it makes his pores smaller and he no longer has those blackheads on his nose or forehead.</li>
            <li> Loooove this mask. Was initially recommended in Sephora and always return purchase on Amazon for convienience. This mask is muddy and gritty and has a slight smell (although not unplessant). The beauty is when it starts to dry. I can see the largest of my pores tighten up and immediatly after my skin is the best it is all week!</li>
            <li> I love the mask, but the seller didn&#x27;t do a good job as the mask was open and the lid was dirty, the box was ripped!&lt;br /&gt;In the description of the product was clearly stated that the product was new. I will probably not buy it from this seller again :(</li>
            <li> Really liked the way my face looked after using</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it and much cheaper than getting it at Sephora</li>
            <li> The mask definitely looked on myself how it did for other people I saw online when I researched it. The product came quickly through the mail and provider who sent it so that was a plus. I liked that I got it for a less expensive amount then for what it&#x27;s being sold for in department stores. My pores didn&#x27;t seem smaller after rinsing off especially in my nose. If anything they appeared larger. The mask also burned each time I used it. Also, a little goes a long way, I used a lot the first time and didn&#x27;t see any results really.</li>
            <li> This clearing treatment has a lot of hype and I really wished it lived up to it! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the $60 price tag. I do feel like after one use that I can tell a difference in my skin the next morning. However, waking the 2nd day after using the mask, my skin is back to normal and not as bright (or noticeably different) as the morning after the treatment. With that being said, it&#x27;s not practical to use it every single day. A nice exfoliator has been just as effective.</li>
            <li> I looked online for this and saved a lot as compared to Sephora. I love the way it makes my skin feel after. And man, it is so gross how much dirt comes out of your pores!!! Works just like it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for expensive, name brand products. I buy my makeup at the drug store, not the department store. I don&#x27;t even buy hair care products at my salon. Whatever possessed me to buy this I don&#x27;t know what it was. What I will tell you is that I am VERY pleased and surprised at the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I&#x27;ve only used it once. I have problems with white heads in the creases of my nose and chin. I spend time every day removing the gunk only to have it show back up the next day. I put a thin layer of this on my nose and chin and let it sit for twenty minutes. A quick look in the mirror showed nothing but dried clay like material. I thought, &amp;#34;Oh well, you just pi$$ed away $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shock came when I got out of the shower. An examination with a 10x mirror showed no whiteheads and significantly shrunken pores. WOW! I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, this is a great buy! It&#x27;s like having magic mud in a bottle, I saw results very quickly with this product! Would and will purchase again and again!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen who has had clogged pores on his nose for months.  These were very large, very noticeable blackheads that would not dissolve or otherwise be removed by pore strips, extraction tools, daily use of expensive acne wash and spot treatment lotion, or the special pore cleansing brush head of the Clarisonic device.  I tried the homemade remedies of lemon juice/baking soda/honey, which were useless as well.  I stumbled upon Glamglow and thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  Within 3 days or so of daily use of the mask, I could see that the pores were clearing.  He applies a thin layer and leaves it on for 30 minutes or (occasionally) overnight.  All but one of those stubborn blackheads are gone after 2 weeks of use.  The jar is small, but it only requires a thin layer of product to see results.  So, despite daily use, he still has plenty of product.  This was a very wise purchase and I will keep this product on hand.</li>
            <li> I opened this up as soon as it was dropped off at my door. I loved the smell of it. When I opened it up I was a little afraid because the bottle was not clean when I took the cap off. But it was all ok not sure why that happened. I used it only on my T-zone and after I washed it off my face felt smooth and soft. My pores on my nose looked cleaner. I got my shipment on Saturday and today Monday I have a small pimple on my chin. I guess that is normal. The bottle was bigger then I thought it was going to be. I love it and only plan on using it once a week or so. The price was way cheaper than at Sephora. Love it. Maybe will try the black bottle version next.</li>
            <li> This product really targets pores and leaves skin feeling soft and looking fresh. A little expensive, but totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> i have tasted a lot of mask..in my opinion this is nothing of special it didn&#x27;t really solve any problem.&lt;br /&gt;i do not have severe acne or really oily skin but this mask did not improve my skin at all for sure.&lt;br /&gt;i will not reorder it again in future.&lt;br /&gt;in addition the box is sooooooo small!</li>
            <li> I bought this really hoping it would get rid of my blackheads. I&#x27;ve had them on my nose and chin for as long as I can remember. This was very expensive for little to no result :( Super disappointed. I went to Proactive instead and it has worked great!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much! perfect!</li>
            <li> Theres&#x27; something really satisfying about being able to see the oil it extracts from my pores!  Works great!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.</li>
            <li> JUST AS AMAZING AS EVERYONE SAYS!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had some burning, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle. As it dried, my pores were obvious, and it looked like they were super dark compared to the rest of the mask. It tightened as it dried, and it was totally fun to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing it off on the other hand? That was messy as heck! I had read other reviews that recommended not washing it off in the shower, so I was using a washcloth in the sink, and it was all down my elbows. I think I would use the shower and just take my chances. Besides, I would think the extra water with the shower would make it a lot less likely to dry there than the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my skin, I felt like it was SO much softer! My pores were definitely smaller, and I had the feeling after like I had put some sort of mint, so there was that cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I hadn&#x27;t lost it, and if it wasn&#x27;t such a pricey product, I would have already replaced it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the one I got is brand new, because it only have half of the product, and the lid seems dirty. it is a good product thought.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received it in about four days, I was very pleased with the shipping speed. But when I got the package and took out the Glamglow, I noticed it was already opened, dented, and crusty. I&#x27;m not sure if any was missing but when I compared this product to one that I had bought at sephora, it did not smell as strong, or have a seal.</li>
            <li> when I got the package it was already opened and about half-empty</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best masked I have tried. If you have very sensitive skin this may not work for you, as the natural ingredients provide a cooling sensation and intense exfoliation process. But after every is said and done my skin looks flawless, and lasts for days.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li> Its the best .. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Feels great. I haven&#x27;t seen as amazing results as others but I do like the cleansing it does. I continue to purchase this product and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ,I like this mask too.make my skin looks fresh</li>
            <li> Great product when on your face but haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference in my skin since using it. Really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> pro:Worked on my skin, helped to reduce breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Con:Too small size, run out fast.</li>
            <li> Love it - definitely that coolest mask I have ever done. You can literally watch your oils being pulled from your pores. I did notice however that if you leave it on too long it can dry your skin out but leave it on for the time noted on the packaging and you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was that after a few months it started drying up... I still used it but it was harder to spread on the skin. I stored it as directed but still had the issue. Definitely not something that would keep my from buying it again but something to remember.</li>
            <li> Good product, but felt that the package and jar had been opened.</li>
            <li> I still have gotten acne from this and expected better result. It felt nice enough but I had better masks for a cheaper price. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> very good,my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Product was already opened, buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE 07/30/14***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to do a product update on this mask because when I wrote my original review I had only used this mask once and I hadn&#x27;t received my jar yet. I admit, I jumped the gun a bit...HOWEVER, I completely stand behind my first review and this mask has become one of my must have products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this jar since I bought it a year ago, and I have just used the last of it and I am purchasing another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask has remained consistent at thoroughly cleaning out my pores and reducing my blackheads. It&#x27;s especially magical after camping or traveling when you don&#x27;t have the time to give your skin as much attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I will say that is different from my last review is that sometimes it DOES bring breakouts to the surface. It doesn&#x27;t happen every time, but depending on my hormones or the length of time between uses, when my skin is uber clogged by oil, sebum, dirt, makeup etc, it draws it to the surface creating a few blemishes. When this happens I will use the mask the following day as a spot treatment on the blemishes to further draw out the impurities. If I do that they go away after a day or two max. I&#x27;d rather have all that gunk drawn out though then left to its own devices to become a massive zit that is 10x worse and takes longer to clear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that applying it with a foundation brush (I bought an E.L.F $1.00 one at Target just for this mask) is so much easier than applying it with your fingers and makes applying an even layer (with the least amount of product needed) a breeze. As long as you rinse your brush immediately after using, it won&#x27;t dry, harden or gunk up the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little jar has lasted me a year of weekly to bi-weekly use, which is pretty darn good and further justifies the cost IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to purchase any of the other GLAMGLOW products, but now that I&#x27;ve been using this one for a year I&#x27;m willing to branch out and try one of the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product with a Sephora order a few months back and I quickly forgot about it as it got lost in my sample abyss. While going through said abyss I pulled this one out to try. I didn&#x27;t know anything about this product however the description of what this mask does seemed exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for since I&#x27;ve been having major breakouts and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency and color was surprising. It&#x27;s much more of a liquidy consistency than other clay masks I have. It smells very herbal and licorice-like. Not my favorite scent, but masks aren&#x27;t really there to smell amazing. It goes on in a very thin layer. I struggled a bit getting it evenly distributed before it started drying, which is does fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 5 minutes I could see small dots starting to form as the mask worked its magic at sucking out the nasty stuff from my pores. Within 20 mins my nose, chin, and forehead were covered in these spots and the mask had been fully dry for about 10 mins. It does feel tight but not any more so than other masks, it was actually rather gentle in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing the mask off was pretty easy. I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed a paint scraper to remove it. As I washed it off I could already tell my skin looked less dull. After drying my skin did feel a bit tight, however it felt baby soft and my skin was super smooth. I applied my normal moisturizer and inspected my skin further. My blackheads were as clear as they&#x27;ve been in ages! My skin looked radiant and glowy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using clay masks I always brace myself for some breakouts, however, 3 days later I have yet to have any new breakouts and the two zits I had before using this mask are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprisingly impressed with this product so I ordered a full size straight away. This seemed to be the best price I could find, so Im pretty happy about that. I have no second thoughts about investing in this product. I&#x27;m hoping adding this to my skin are regimen will completely change my now apparent aging skin for the better. Having bad skin and breakouts at 30 is embarrassing and I wish I would have taken better care of my skin earlier on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use it again! I literally waiting by the door for FedEx to get here!hts about investing in this product.

            <li> Good product, but not for the price. Didnt have miracle results. My local spa sells a similar mask for a little less but the bottle is triple the size.</li>
            <li> Expensive dry mud, difficult to apply.  Pretty much worthless</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product, I read the amazing reviews and it just seemed too good to be true, but let me tell you, its true! This is the first time in my life that I got all that trapped dirt out of my nose out.  I&#x27;ve tried the pore strips, another similar product from walmart that brings the oil to the surface, but this one blows everything else out of the water! My nose is completely clear after once use! I even used it on my fiance&#x27;s nose, he has horrible blackheads all over his nose that I never thought I&#x27;d get rid of and even his nose looks clear! The actual container is quite small, but I only really needed it on my nose and chin, I&#x27;ll probably use it once a week as needed. If you&#x27;re skeptical, this is a great price for this product, just try it! I promise you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> I love Glam Glow Super Mud Clearing Treatmeat. I use it every other day and it keeps my skin looking beautiful!</li>
            <li> Amazing product right here</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin feeling pretty soft, but this is definitely not going to pull gunk out of your pores like a Biore strip would. I really wanted to try it and bought it when the price dropped, but I&#x27;d say even then it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. You will likely have similar results from a drugstore mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty big beauty product fan and I was super excited to get GlamGlow since I had heard so many great things. Previously my mask of choice has just been benonite clay mixed with water. It works wonderfully and makes my pores tiny! So, when I got the GlamGlow I was expecting something truly amazing. It was pretty disappointing that it worked just barely as well as the benonite. Benonite is significantly cheaper and has works wonders. I recommend it over GlamGlow any day simply because it does the same thing for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> best mud mask ever!  Really great when used once a week</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
            <li> I received my item yesterday and the actual jar had a crust of the product dried on the edge of the opening. It looked like someone already used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware!</li>
            <li> Cheapest place to buy glamglow masks. I like this product but I&#x27;ve dry skin so I can&#x27;t use it all the time. However, my boyfriend has oily skin and he LOVES this mask. Even though it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon, it&#x27;s still $50...so expensive.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does.  No more trips to the Spa for facial treatments!  Will repurchase again and again.</li>
            <li> The mask definitely dries out your face but as far as extracting anything...ehhh it&#x27;s just ok. Glad I at least tried it</li>
            <li> Love this item, you can feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin so soft and smooth, minimizes pores, really brings the oils out! Fantastic for spot treatment on sore pimples. Use it on my daughter who is just starting puberty and her face breaks out, they disappear with the mud mask! I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this product, I will order again!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Just wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it from here. Used a promo code at the direct brand site and got $20.00 off the price.</li>
            <li> Smell weird, and there are so many granules in the mask-- they won&#x27;t spread, i don&#x27;t know if the jar i got went bad, or it&#x27;s just what this mask is supposed to be? Did not work to improve my appearance either.</li>
            <li> I am a guy, it is incredible, one use and you can see the &#x27;stuff&#x27; pulled out from your face. Keeps you looks and feeling young.  Wish I have been using this my whole life.  I do not use it very often, it is pretty strong, but when I need it, it really does the job. Worth its weight in GOLD.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! You can see immediate results and see the blackheads and pores being sucked clean! Worth every penny- this is a great price compared to other stores!</li>
            <li> My GlamGlow super mud mask jar isnt lasting me as long as I had hoped. Ive used it twice for whole face masks and I&#x27;m like 1/2 way through the jar. I&#x27;m only putting on a thin layer, enough to cover the skin in the gray color. Was hoping it would spread thinner or something but then if I put it really thin, it doesn&#x27;t pull out any gunk. I like the fact you can actually see the oil it pulls out. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh. Otherwise, it doesnt seem too special too me. Still have small blackheads on my nose even after the masks. Don&#x27;t think I will repurchase. I&#x27;ve been recommended to try Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque which is like $3.99 at the drugstore for this big tube-bottle and I would say its very comparable to this GlamGlow. Queen Helene&#x27;s also has a mud mask and an oatmeal mask and probably others. I&#x27;m sticking to Queen Helene&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this Product and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet ! It seems to be the only thing that keeps my skin from breaking out, however my product came slightly damaged and opened. :(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference, but my friend who recommend the product did see a difference in my skin .&lt;br /&gt;I just need to use it more often</li>
            <li> It seems old not the same as sephoras. Its TOO bad waste of my money! Would not buy again !</li>
            <li> Same formula and half the cost of Sephora!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why someone would pay some ridiculous amount for this product elsewhere!  I don&#x27;t know how, nor do I care, why this seller got this to me so cheap but I appreciate it :-)  I had absolutely NO ISSUES ordering this.  I&#x27;ve already placed my second order for this product with this seller and I&#x27;m totally satisfied.  The mask itself came in SUPERB condition, and it arrived earlier than stated/expected.  The product itself is pricey but TOTALLY WORTH IT!  I&#x27;m in my mid 20&#x27;s. I have never really had issues with my skin (face) in the past but in the past year I&#x27;ve either had more stress or hormones hit me kind of late lol so I&#x27;ve had problematic skin.  Lot&#x27;s of clogged/enlarged pores that lead to random breakouts.  Who knew you could hit puberty at damn near 30.  At any rate, I tried GlamGlow and have gotten SO MANY COMPLIMENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it has done for me: reduced my pores, helped with redness, calms skin, prevented breakouts, shrunk spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a tendency to dry skin but if you&#x27;re using a moisturizer (which you should be using anyway) , you should be A-Okay!!  I would die without this product. I&#x27;ve been out of it for a few weeks and I&#x27;m not lookin&#x27; too hot! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GlamGlow? YES PLEASE!!!</li>
            <li> I love facial masks, and trying new products that I hear about, so when I heard about this, I had to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is impressive, I even kept the octagon box it came in, haha...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself is refreshing, leaves me skin feeling freshly scrubbed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonable cleansing mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was decent, and it does last longer than you would think when you receive it.. A little bit really does go a loooong way.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel very nice. My husband and I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Was purchased as a gift. Looked Used.</li>
            <li> An amazing mask.  My youngest niece, that I used to help w/ HER make-up, turned me on to this.  A mandatory place in my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> When I received the product I thought it was &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; like it said it was. When I opened the jar, the foil that was supposed to seal the jar was already peeled off and was just set on top. The mud was also seeping out around the rim. Clearly it was already used and tampered with. I will never order from this seller again. I would recommend to just go to Sephora and buy it there. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do next time. But the product itself is amazing tho!!! It&#x27;s literally the best face mask I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> The indian clay mask works better than this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this mask worked at all but it did make my skin super smooth after washing it off</li>
            <li> The ingredients can&#x27;t stay stable and effective in jar packaging. Once air hits it your money goes out the window. Overpriced to begin with.</li>
            <li> Ahhhh I love this stuff 😍</li>
            <li> I liked the product but it is very expensive and I don&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s anymore effective than Merle Norman&#x27;s Miracol or some of the other products out there that are half the price.</li>
            <li> Only saw very minor results. I use it almost everyday it makes my face super soft, clean and smooth. Overall I liked it but don&#x27;t know if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This mask has so many beneficial ingredients and feels great! Really makes the skin glow. Retail, this sells for $69, so Amazon has a steal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using this product. I read great reviews about it. I have suffered from acne and blackheads since I was 11 years old. I am 21 now and I am sick of it! I have tried proactive and clearasil and dermatologist prescribed medications and nothing worked. I was surprised at the vacuum like technology to clear out the pores. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works!&lt;br /&gt;This arrived from the seller on time! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel super soft after using but didn&#x27;t really seem to clear much of my acne.</li>
            <li> I bought one from Sephora before, and the product was really nice. But the package for this one is a disaster, it seems it is opened before, and the foil is already peeled off.</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels after using this. It feels smooth and soft, yet not dry or over cleaned. You can definitely see it working, which I like.</li>
            <li> The most effective I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is just like a clay mask but it costs 10 times more. My advice: buy clay for health and beauty from a natural pharmacy and make your own mask. You just add some water and it is done. Same effect! Really!</li>
            <li> This is great for my T-zone.  I used  to do Biore Pore Nose strips but this gets much deeper.  I like to put this on my T-zone for 20-30 minutes and then do another layer on my nose afterward.</li>
            <li> I bought the little packets to see if I would like it and I LOVE IT. So I&#x27;m ordering this and hopefully I won&#x27;t be disappointed and cheated, I read that some costumers got it old &amp; used and if it happens to me  I WILL GET MY MORE BACK :) For the people that say it doesn&#x27;t last long, you don&#x27;t use it everyday. Use maybe 2 times a week and if you want to save even more then only put it on your troubled areas. Three packets lasted two months for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It does what it says and leaves the skin feeling great. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mud mask! It works so well and leaves your skin soft and smooth. The best part- it doesn&#x27;t small bad!</li>
            <li> great mask at great price</li>
            <li> The product came unsealed inside, but I didn&#x27;t have time to complain so this is the only way to do so. Other reviews are right.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week I am very satisfied with its results. After four months It keeps my skin free of acne. I truly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin which results in breakouts and blackheads. This really reduces the oil production. The feeling I have is that it&#x27;s sucking the oil out of my skin. It&#x27;s a small container so it doesn&#x27;t last too too long. But I am very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> It was too thick. This clay had little strips of what was probably seaweed in it which made quite a mess as the seaweed doesn&#x27;t stick well to your face. Honestly, is it that difficult to grind it up a little bit when everything is dry? If they would properly grind the powder it would be easier to apply and it would probably release more of the beneficial ingredients. As it is, the ingredients list doesn&#x27;t have anything really special. It wasn&#x27;t as absorbent as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a cute, tiny jar as a pre- mixed clay. Unfortunately this means it dries out if you don&#x27;t use it for a couple months and there isn&#x27;t much to use. I tried adding more water to reconstitute it, but I just got a chunky watery mixture. I switched to a bentonite clay (Aztec secret) and have had much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment arrived on time and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> 5 days after using product I found red bumps behind my ears and some on my eyes. Through out the day and three days it has spread even after using hydrocortisone cream. My left ear has a small infection. This is the only new product I used on my face and haven&#x27;t put anything else on it. Beware if you have sensitive dry-normal skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking hey if its good enough for Hollywood, its good enough for me. However it does the same thing as any other mask I&#x27;ve used. If it didn&#x27;t show your pores it would be exactly the same. If anything I think it dried my skin out and now it&#x27;s even more broken out. I will probably not use this product anymore. Save your money and buy a simple mask at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help to clean my pores like it says and make my skin &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; after using it. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about this product. Did a lot of research, read A LOT of blogs, finally pulled the trigger when I found it here on Amazon for 49% of the retail cost. Let me tell you, I am far from disappointed! My skin is naturally very oily, so of course I&#x27;m a pessimist in thinking anything could get rid of the oil AND blackheads all in 20 minutes. Well it did. My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I was a pre-teen! Definitely worth the investment. I have told everyone at work, and allllll my friends. This will be a popular gift I give to my friends come Christmas!! Love, love-LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This mask is wonderful and makes my skin look and feel 10 times better.  It even reduces the appearance of some dark spots I have, making makeup application easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the smell was better, I don&#x27;t like the smell of licorice.  The other mask by glam glow smells better, but I honestly think this one might be better for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this after reading all the glowing reviews but when I put it on my face it burned and I had to wash it off. I tried leaving it on my nose area for a while but it was so uncomfortable and it ended up doing nothing for my skin except make it irritated.  I looked the product up in the EWG.org Skin Deep database and it it rated an 8 on the scale from 0-10, so a &amp;#34;high hazard&amp;#34;.  On the green-yellow-red scale this product is a red.  It contains fragrance, which is probably what irritated my skin, as well as toxic propylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben, and methylisothiazolinone, which are ranked as highly toxic by EWG.org.  The product also contains ethylparaben, methylparaben, and a number of other substances that cause organ toxicity, reproductive toxicity, disrupt hormones, cause cancer, etc.  I complained to the seller about the product burning my face and the best they can do is give me &amp;#34;up to&amp;#34; 50% of my money back, as per their policy, and I have to pay for the return shipping. Safe to say I will not be buying this ever again or buying anything from cosabeauty.&lt;br /&gt;Update: The seller refunded 50%. So my one-tme use cost me $21.14 and a burned face. Safe to say I&#x27;m not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Looks has been opened before.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, face became very smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li> oh, thank you god that i ordered this... i love it</li>
            <li> Product did not have the proper seal. Had to return to sender. Not worth the risk considering the product is for your face.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to those with large pores. It really does help to clear them out, as I have seen over the last few months. While it is expensive to use regularly, you MUST use it regularly to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all those weirdos out there (ME. ME. ME), it&#x27;s fun to see the little dark spots that are your pores as the mask is drying.</li>
            <li> It has been used , not new one. Very dry, i cannot use it. This is the worst thing i have never met.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it claimed to decrease pore sizes and pull all the dirt out. I have larger pores and oily/combination skin and I love the way it feels when it is applied. It actually seems to look as if it pulls out the dirt because there are tiny black marks in troubled areas. I love the way my skin feels when I take it off, but it hasn&#x27;t improved my skin. I continue to use it because I do like the clean feel it leaves, but for the price I&#x27;m not blown away. As long as I can find it for a lower price I will continue to use it; however, it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m rushing to restock.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me for Christmas to fulfill my strange need to get everything I can out of my pores. I thought for some reason that it would expel whiteheads from your pores, but it doesn&#x27;t do that, haha. It really just soaks all of the oils out of your pores. Anyway, my pores are definitely a ton smaller after using this a couple of times per week, and my skin looks really good. I&#x27;d buy it again. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask it leaves my skin so smooth. I had intended on using this on my husband for his blackheads but keep using it myself. I also have the youth-mud I think I like this one better.</li>
            <li> Works great, even pulled blackheads and stubborn white heads out with a few applications, also makes skin feel amazing.  Im a person on a budget, so its a bit pricey for me for the amount you get, thats why the four stars, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I have not used this type of mud mask before, so I made sure to look at reviews with step-by-step photos etc, but I absolutely love this! My face feels and looks so clear that I want to go up to people and say &amp;#34;Feel my face!&amp;#34; and my brother says it feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing has a slight minty smell and just feels so great on your skin. This is one of my favourite products as you can see the oil been drawn out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife expecting that products &amp;#34;Fulfilled By Amazon&amp;#34; were good quality. The product (fulfilled by Amazon) arrived with the seal broken, the actual face mask was 50% used, and there was mold all around the container lid. #NeverAgain</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cool, you can see the stuff it vacuums out of your pores but it doesn&#x27;t really pull the crud out completely. I usually have to follow up with a Biore nose strip to get what is left behind. It makes my face feel pretty soft and it feels nice but really doesn&#x27;t even compare with the other GLAMGLOW mask (the one in the black container), at least the price on Amazon is much better than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> love it love it love. You can see you skin is way much better than before. It is a good product in a good price.</li>
            <li> I had read about this on several sites and it had rave reviews.  I tried it and noticed not changes what so ever. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Very tingling and makes your face feel wonderful.  I am simply too busy to spend half a day in the spa.  This works well for me.</li>
            <li> Love it it worked so well my husband made me put it on him lol.could not be happier thank you</li>
            <li> This works so well. It&#x27;s a little pricey for what you get but works very well!</li>
            <li> Spilling half bottle Yellow looks dirty inside I return in China is not very convenient Later will not come again!</li>
            <li> This was delivered to me the same day I ordered it, and it wasn&#x27;t supposed to arrive for two days so that was awesome. So far I&#x27;ve used it once, it left my skin feeling super smooth. I haven&#x27;t seen any blemish changes so I&#x27;m hoping that after a couple of uses it will clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars/red marks on my face that I have spent thousands on trying to remove without some type of medical procedure over the past 10 years. I have been using this for about 2 months (still have the original jar with several applications left). My red marks are fading and others have started to notice. Even got a compliment on my complexion which I never thought would happen. I use this as a full mask once a week and do spot treatments during the week. It does take a couple of weeks to really notice but you will be surprised. At this rate, my skin will be mostly clear for my wedding which is 4 weeks away. It is worth the money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had heard from friends that this mask was amazing and it definitely exceeded my expectations.  It shrinks pores and makes your skin smooth and glow! Even great for spot treatment for broken out areas, zits.  Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> First the mask worked like all the good reviews and hype said it would. So there is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Second it came on time, which was a short amount, wrapped in plastic, taped closed, and unopened.&lt;br /&gt;The smell reminds me of black licorice and mint. And it works amazing!!!!!!!!! I will buy from this seller again when I need more, thank you soooo much.</li>
            <li> Love this product  Your skin will love it too.  Truly give your skin a glow all day long.  Try it</li>
            <li> Loved it! Also a great gift. Have it to two other friends as a birthday gift and they were super happy with it and felt it was original.</li>
            <li> So bummed. Used this once and my skin was flaming red for the next few days.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. It really works just like the reviews said it would.</li>
            <li> This mask works great on both my teenage daughter and my middle aged skin.  It surprised me at how much it really did make our skin glow without a oily-shinyness to it.  It did help reduce the size of pores and number of blackheads.  However, it did not completely eliminate all the blackheads or reduce the pores as much as I would have liked, but it did better then the dozen or so other masks I have tried over the past years from inexpensive to very expensive.  It is easy to spread on and to wash off.  It does have a strong and strange kind of aroma to it but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming or unbearable and I am particularly sensitive to smells.  Overall, I was pleased with the results and while a pricier mask I thought that it worked well enough to justify the price of the $40 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I heard about this stuff being $60+ and I was so so happy to find it here for HALF of that! Glam glow leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I also read reviews of the smell being awful, but for me this was not the case, I think it smells great!</li>
            <li> My daughters use this product and they both really love it!</li>
            <li> Worked okay on blackhead.</li>
            <li> I bought this treatment after seeing it on Pintrest - and I have to say it does what it says!  When I put it on you can see all the little black heads coming out in the treatment.  I left it on for about 15 min as the package says 5-20, you can see the bits of green tea leaves in it as well.  After I washed it off the pores on my nose definitely looked clearer, and they were smaller than before (I did before and after pics to send my friends but I won&#x27;t be putting them up here).  Overall Im thrilled that someone I found on the internet actually did what it said it was supposed to!  Sephora sells it online as well but it&#x27;s double the price of the seller on Amazon</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel good and helped somewhat.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine.  I think I may have gotten a bad batch, as there were hard pieces distributed throughout the product that I had never seen before this order.  I&#x27;m guessing it was old.  I&#x27;ll be buying it from Sephora from now on.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying from Sephora. Although price is still not low but definately worth it!I will recommend to other friends</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the product, I bought it on Amazon because it was a lot cheaper than Sephora.  Next time I WILL be purchasing it from Sephora because this poduct was clearly OPENED and USED some of the product was gone!!!!  I will never purchase from this seller again!!!!  I will highly recommend the product to anyone but you should find a different seller if you are planning on purchasing it online.</li>
            <li> I was a little alarmed at the chunkiness of this mask treatment. I&#x27;m not sure if that is something normal, or if I got a weird batch. It also made me question the legitimacy of this product. I didn&#x27;t find that it did much to clear my clogged pores, or if it just dried out my pores. All I noticed were black spots on the mask from the oils in my pores. Indifferent on my thoughts of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was to purchase this again, it would be from a reputable retailer such as Sephora.</li>
            <li> best mud mask ever! i just love glam glow the results are instant and amazing !! you might feel some tingling and burning sensation but its normal</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything but make my face really soft. Only gives you the illusion it&#x27;s taking the dirt out of your pores.</li>
            <li> its ok, doesn&#x27;t pull anything out of my pores like advertised. Not worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product but as usual am always skeptical when it comes to anything that sounds this great...but I&#x27;ve had it for a week and used it three times.  My pores on my nose are definitely smaller (due to unclogging), my skin feels smoother, I haven&#x27;t had new breaks outs and I tend to break out regularly.  I am truly impressed.  I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic results the first time but the more I used it the better my skin got.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much! I loved it. It cost twice as less of Sephora and absolutely the same thing - packed in original packaging, numbers on the box are all original.</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, you can see the difference on your face, I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 3 weeks now, once a week, and it&#x27;s been an awful experience. The first time was fine; the second time I noticed my skin was a little pink after use but shrugged it off. The third time, when I removed the product my skin was bright red and you could absolutely tell where I had put on the product for many hours after its use. It burned the hell out of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a problem with skin sensitivity before and I used to product to the letter- although I did take it off maybe five minutes early the third time. I don&#x27;t have any allergies that I&#x27;m aware of either.&lt;br /&gt;On top of it all, I didn&#x27;t see any sort of improvement to my skin. Awful product, wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and worth every penny. Help clear up and smooth your face. You face feel absolutely amazing. Will buy again and tell my friends about this product!</li>
            <li> Gift, no complaints heard.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this, I had very realistic expectations. I thought, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s not going to be this magical cure-all mud that makes your problem skin vanish overnight.&amp;#34; And it wasn&#x27;t, but it does its job very well. And one must also take into consideration that different things work better for different people. Overall, I love it. It&#x27;s done a hundred times better than any of the other products on the market that I&#x27;ve tried. It didn&#x27;t solve all of my skin issues, but it made considerable progress toward doing so. It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m surprised I hadn&#x27;t heard of it earlier :)</li>
            <li> I used it just on my nose and on either side where I have enlarged pores and blackheads. I was not sure it would work since I have had this problem for so many years. The result was visible. Tiny blackheads on my nose that were hard to remove were gone and my pores were cleaner and tighter.  My skin felt softer and smoother than it had in many years. It is not permanent-it lasted about a week-so I need to use it again. I am hoping, over time, it will be more lasting but even if it isn&#x27;t it is well worth the effort and the cost. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has enlarged pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li> in the fact I&#x27;m so happy to try it , I would recommend everyone try it&lt;br /&gt;good lack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regard</li>
            <li> My skin does not like this product at all!!  I do not have sensitive skin. I normally don&#x27;t have any problems with masks, peels, or toners. However, my face is still recovering from this mask 10 days later. I tested a small spot before using it all over my face. It tingled moderately, but nothing that felt horrible. I then put the mud all over my face and left it for 10 minutes. When I was washing it off my face began burning and turned bright red. I toned and moisturized as usual and went to bed. The next morning my face was still on fire. I also had little red bumps all over my face. Two days later my skin started itching and peeling as if I&#x27;d been sunburnt. I&#x27;m still using a hydrocortisone cream daily to deal with the itch and redness. Apparently, I am really allergic to something in this mask. I&#x27;m super sad that I can&#x27;t use this as I&#x27;ve read some really great reviews out there. Just be careful!</li>
            <li> I thought it would magically clear my face but it didn&#x27;t so yeah...it sucks. At least i didn&#x27;t pay 70.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews I read online promised that this was going to be a miracle for my pores.  After several uses, I still have blackheads on my nose.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, or maybe it&#x27;s the mud.  I don&#x27;t think I would pay for this again.</li>
            <li> I use it to try to remove my clogged pores. It has kinda worked but not as we&#x27;ll as I thought that it would</li>
            <li> First time for using it. good . It is a good mask! I like it, I will but it again.</li>
            <li> Have used the GlamGlow mask several times in the last 2 months and can tell a difference in the texture of my skin. I have large pores on my nose and using this mask is making them appear smaller. Works great and a little goes a long way. I have, and will continue to, recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> I was seduced....after using this product, my pores and blackheads are just as they were when I started.  I thought this was some miracle product that would suck the ick right out of my pores...WRONG!!!  I have gotten similar results from mud masks purchased for a fraction of the price at a drug store.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read nothing but good things about this product and I can finally say I agree! This mask is amazing! It does exactly what it says its going to do. It&#x27;s a little pricey but definitely worth it. The jar itself is small, however you really don&#x27;t need very much of the product and you don&#x27;t need to do the mask every single night. You put it on - It feels like its cooling (almost tingling - not burning) it dries nice and hard and you rinse it off. It makes your face feel so soft and so clean and it shrinks your pores. I would highly recommend this mask for anyone with problematic skin. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> heres some stats for you:&lt;br /&gt;- i recently got oily skin&lt;br /&gt;- female&lt;br /&gt;- age 27&lt;br /&gt;- my forehead has been breaking out because of the oily skin&lt;br /&gt;- i do not have any bad black heads&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;the first time i used this someone actually said that my skin was glowing (without any knowledge of me using this product&lt;br /&gt;helped a bit with shrinking some of the acne&lt;br /&gt;if you are in a rush, it dries very quickly if you put a thin layer&lt;br /&gt;smells good&lt;br /&gt;natural&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;leaves a lot of residue</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it helps my skin look so much better when I think to use it. Doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I was so excited, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I wasn&#x27;t expecting there to be huge clumps in the face mud, and when I opened the actual jar, it looked disgusting, there was dried face mud all around the lid. But the worse part is I paid for so a jar of this stuff and didn&#x27;t even get my money&#x27;s worth. It looked like someone had used half of it before I even got it! Sure it did clear my face up in just a few days, but needless to say I&#x27;ll be ordering from the actual website.</li>
            <li> I really liked this stuff but I just can&#x27;t justify the price.  I bought a $6 mud mask from Ulta that gave me decent results.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.  You can see the oil being absorbed out of your pores.</li>
            <li> Good remedy if u have greasy skin it absorbs everything i will order again once i run out.. thata the only problem it comes with very little product...</li>
            <li> Because I like the after affect that glamglow had on my skin. It made it feel fresh and new. Great.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just as well as any clay face mask that you can buy from the drugstore, but the price tag is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I first bought it at Sephora but found it cheaper here and it works wonders from my skin.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product I was skeptical, but I figured... I&#x27;d try it. I have tried everything from face clearing scrubs to pore strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! sure, it smells a bit strong (not sure why they had to add perfume), but it works! I put the mask on after a shower when my skin would be most receptive to the mask and all of its ingredients. I waited 20 minutes (let me tell you if you consider that all those little dots are oil, it is a bit gross to see), and then simply rinsed it off, no scrubbing involved. I was rushing to get dressed so I didn&#x27;t really get a chance to look at my face until the next morning. Even after a night out with cream and makeup, my face looks a million times better. All of my blackheads are GONE! plus my skin has never looked so smooth, even my pores look smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how often I will use it, they suggest once or twice a week. I may try twice a week at first (I can&#x27;t wait to try it again!!!), and adjust accordingly.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re using the mask and letting it dry, you can see the obvious work it does from the little dots all over your face. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this didn&#x27;t seem to have any noticeable difference until I stopped using it because the face wash I was using at the time dried out my skin and I didn&#x27;t want to make it worse. A week after I stopped, the black heads on my nose were darker and more numerous, and I had only used the mask three or four times before that. I didn&#x27;t realize what a good job it was doing until I had to stop using it. My skin is back to normal so thankfully, this mask has been put into rotation again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I used this mask on a couple of painful pimples I had gotten on my chin and they were immediately brought to head. I had never seen a mask work *that* fast.</li>
            <li> This treatment really makes my skin look great!  Everyone should try it.  If you haven&#x27;t taken much care of your skin this is the prefect product for you!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from a friend who works as Sephora. She&#x27;s always giving me things to try for my battle with blackheads. I get them constantly, which leads me to push on them and in turn make myself break out continuously. I figured it was just another mask that wouldn&#x27;t do anything special since she didn&#x27;t hype it up too much, only said it was a hit right now. I looked in the mirror 5 minutes later and was shocked with what I saw surfacing! WOW!! I instantly started researching it and found all the positive feedback. After I rinsed, my skin hadn&#x27;t looked that clean in years. Even after facials! My boyfriend even noticed. I purchased it right away, I think I found my miracle!</li>
            <li> I have clear skin for the most part but I get black heads on my T- zone that drive me crazy!  I saw this on the doctors and they said it was proven to shrink pores and the reviews on here said it made black heads vanish.  No such luck here, maybe mine are stubborn?  I guess it&#x27;s a good mask but not good enough for me to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I put it all over my face or just my T-zone. It goes on dark grey and when it is all dry it is a lighter grey. I do not recommend leaving it on while you shower, because it will not fully dry. It makes my face super soft, which i love. Always follow up with a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in my blackheads, specifically on my nose. But it is pretty cool because when it starts to dry, all your black heads turn dark through the mask so you can see where all the dirt is. EW!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totes recommend</li>
            <li> I wanted it to work!  However, I have very sensitive skin and after using it three times, I had the worst breakouts.  Maybe it&#x27;s supposed to bring out  ...the um, hidden problems under your skin?  However, I was tired of pimples, so I stopped using it.  I had no breakouts before the mask, and several pimples after the mask, so it had to go.  I definitely have sensitive skin, though, so I was not surprised that it make me break out.  Ah well, on to the next thing.</li>
            <li> You cannot tell from the picture how awesome is the white box that packages this product. It is worth the cost of the treatment just to obtain the star spangled box - if you like that kind of thing.</li>
            <li> NOTTTTT worth it.  I have used this multiple times to get rid of my acne, and it has not worked at all.  Didn&#x27;t see any improvement what so ever.</li>
            <li> works great! get super tingly when left on to long!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the spa feeling. It can feel like burning at first  but I could feel my skin fresh after removing with the warm water once dried.</li>
            <li> I do not think this product is the same product that is sold in Sephora or other legit retailers. The texture of this particular Glamglow Super-Mud was not of the same textue as the Glamglow I purchased from Sephora. I hope I am wrong...</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cleansing products I&#x27;ve ever used. Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean. A little creepy when it lights up your pores, but hey, that means it&#x27;s good, right?</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Hesitant buying glam glow from third party because product could be tampered with but everything seems to be fine although i suspected the jar had been open because of the residue on the lid. Great product though and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing mask.  It&#x27;s so good at purifying the skin and clearing pores.  The only downfall of the product is the price.  But buying it on amazon means I can get it for HALF the price as in the store!.</li>
            <li> I get pimples rarely but have a few blackheads on my nose and brow. I used the product and followed directions to the t and overnight my skin broke out. Everywhere I put this &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34;, huge spots of acne emerged. Beware this snake oil, it do more harm then good.</li>
            <li> This mask is AMAZING! It&#x27;s awesome to watch it work but more than that it really zaps pimples fast! It&#x27;s an awesome treat for yourself. I got a sample from Sephora first and it lasted me 3 uses and I loved it so much I bought the full size from Amazon! I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My skin feels so clean after. It&#x27;s not cheap but is a must try, and this price beats all B&amp;M stores</li>
            <li> Great product!  It clears my pores and breakouts have significantly decreased.  Thought I cleansed my face very well but this product shows how oily it really is!  Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mask. No miracles worked. Skin not particularly different. It&#x27;s a little better than a grocery store clay mask, but not so much better as to warrant the greatly elevated price.</li>
            <li> Omg I love this product!! I have awful pore that constantly are giving my problems.. I use this product twice a week and then I use my Clarisonic with deep pore face wash and my pores disappear!! My skin feels nice and tight and really clean looking once I&#x27;m done washing my face!! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I find that if I use this product every week or two my pores are significantly smaller! and if I use it every week the effect is cumulative until my pores are almost invisible.  It is the only thing I have used that has this effect. My skin also gets dry patches and this removes a lot of that scaliness  I have highly sensitive and very dry skin and isn&#x27;t really comfortable while I&#x27;m using it, but it isn&#x27;t too irritating if I use it once a week or less.  I have also found that it can cause breakouts afterwords, especially in areas that I am prone to clogged pores.  This is not unexpected however as unclogging the pores give bacteria that is already on your skin the opportunity to flourish.  I have this awesome zit stick from Costco though that takes care of zits in less than 24hrs usually though, so I still feel like it&#x27;s worth using for the pore diminishing effects alone!!! It&#x27;s a bit pricey though, and I do get zits sometimes so 4 stars</li>
            <li> LOVE using this ! I use this maybe once or twice a week and can see the difference it makes every time ! It&#x27;s amazing .</li>
            <li> I heard miraculous reviews about this stuff and I don&#x27;t get the hype. I&#x27;m glad I ordered the smaller one to try it out first. It&#x27; okay but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference after the first time like many people had said. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far for my acne prone skin and my acne has shrunk a little but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of this product or other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve been using. I&#x27;ll continue using it to give it time and see.</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  It&#x27;s messy so it&#x27;s best to apply and then jump into the shower when you&#x27;re ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice (at an interval of three days apart), but I already am in love. I&#x27;ve had blackheads along my nose and inner cheeks for years, and with just two uses they&#x27;re about 90% diminished. It washes off so much more easily than my previous mask (the Boscia black mask) and I&#x27;m left with skin that feels just as smooth. It&#x27;s also fun (in that disgusting way haha) to watch it dry and see all of the oil being pulled out of your pores - it&#x27;s satisfying to see it working! I actually bought mine at Sephora last week - definitely check it out if you&#x27;re reading this during the holiday season, as they have a gift set with this full-size mask plus the black Glamglow in a miniature size for the same price as the full-size of the clearing treatment alone. It&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> Oh. My. God. I balked at the price initially but read the reviews and decided to give this mask a shot. FOR ONCE, I found a product that does exactly what it claims it will do.&lt;br /&gt;After using this mask twice per week for three weeks, my skin is brighter, clearer, and my t-zone is noticeably less oily throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I repeat: Oh. My. God. This stuff is rad.</li>
            <li> This has done what it says it will do. Makes my skin glow and seems to make my pores look smaller. I will definitely buy again. Seller sent product quickly and it arrived in perfect condition for less then what I would have paid if I had gone to the store to purchase it.</li>
            <li> There has been a lot of hype on this product.  It isn&#x27;t cheap and comes in a small jar, however, it goes a long way.  Use a brush to apply it.  This does not come with the product.  It a nice mask, but does not live up to any of the claims made about it on the internet.</li>
            <li> So far this is working well for me. It&#x27;s a high cost for such a tiny bottle but you only need a thin layer. I wish they would make a lighter colored version as the dark color gets everywhere and you have to wash your basin after washing it off your face. It should simply rinse off and down the drain easily.  There are tiny pieces of something that get everywhere, not sure what, and these are a bit annoying. But since it&#x27;s not for daily use I put up with it. At least while it&#x27;s working. Note that if you have blocked pores from oil or excess sebum, you may see a tiny breakout until you get the areas clear. This formula definitely stirs things up under your skin but in a good way. I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin and have had no issues with this product. It is working to clarify my pores.  If you&#x27;re sensitive try it in a test area first like your cheek our chin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously magic mud. Cleared up those icky red lurkers for me. It can be a little drying so use sparingly. Not for an all over face application.</li>
            <li> Very good product, works just as described. It brings everything up to the surface to start cleaning out your pores. It will make you break out some if your pores are clogged but it is CLEANING them out, it is beneficial in the long run. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have very big pores on my nose, with Glamglow they&#x27;re minimized and my skin looks fresher. Happy with product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the results I read about in all the ratings...and it is a heck of a lot of money for a small container of &#x27;mud&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Before making this purchase, I did some research, for two reasons. First, it is pricey. Second, it&#x27;s going on my face!  I checked the reviews on Sephora as well as any other reviews online. The best reviews I found were on You-Tube, especially because there are tutorials. It&#x27;s a mask, pretty straight forward but the best thing about these tutorials is that these girls wear makeup regularly. Whereas I just like to keep my face clean and blemish free, not to mention youthful! Any lady would want the same. ;) Personally, I really like it. Unlike other masks that I&#x27;ve tried previously, mostly found at the local pharmacy, it doesn&#x27;t feel caked on. I found that the less I used the more effective it seemed to be. Once it dries, you can actually see the oil being pulled out of your skin, especially around your nose! GROSS! I don&#x27;t use it too often, mostly once a month as a facial. I have on occasion used it as a spot treatment. I will certainly purchase another jar within the next couple of months, just because I hate to run out of things that I really like.</li>
            <li> It was purchased as a gift for my mom, she says she loves it and that has helped a lot with your skin problems, I have not used myself, but looks good, has clear instructions, good presentation and arrived at scheduled time</li>
            <li> I love this face mask! I have tried many different brands and types of masks and this one makes such a huge difference! My skin feels so clean and clear after each use!</li>
            <li> I saw this in an article and it look AMAZING! It&#x27;s good, but just as good as any other less expensive clay mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I tried it at Sephora and it is the ONLY mask I have ever tried that actually removes gunk from my face. I use it once a week, and I find the day AFTER I use it is when the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; really comes out the next time I wash my face. It&#x27;s like it sucks everything to the surface. I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got lucky or if they decided to stop opening the containers but mine came sealed and clean and in the cutest packaging.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mask. It&#x27;s amazing... you can actually see it pulling the oil and gunk out of your pores, which is simultaneously gross and awesome. I don&#x27;t really have problematic skin tbh, but I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement anyways!</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased glamglow it came all dried up. I had to throw it away it was so dried up you couldn&#x27;t even spread it on your face. I figured ok maybe I just happen to get a bad one because everyone I know swears by these. So I purchased another one. SAME THING! Completely dried up like it&#x27;s been sitting in the sun for days. I then wrote them on Instagram and they blocked me. What kind of company is this? Will not buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I always feel fresh and glowing after I use this mask</li>
            <li> I have used it both as a mask and a spot treatment and I saw a noticeable change in my skin immediately after using it. I would definitely recommend this as a spot treatment for those zits that wont go away!</li>
            <li> No seal on jar.  Difficult to determine if any product had been removed or the space was due to settling.  Kept the product anyway due to cost savings compared to regular retail.</li>
            <li> Your skin does feel smooth after you use this but I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s the most amazing mask I&#x27;ve ever used. If you purchase this from Sephora it&#x27;s twice as much so I&#x27;m very glad I could find it on Amazon for half the price especially not being totally in love with it. $45 is still a lot to spend on this, not sure it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff after reading all the other reviews and articles online, but I didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s pretty pricey so maybe my expectations were just too high. My skin felt softer right after I used it but I didn&#x27;t notice any obvious signs of clearing or extracting. I did find that there was still some black stuff left in larger pores, even after I exfoliated! Not cool. The whole point is to clear that stuff out, not add more. I thought that maybe I need more than one application to see the results that others did so I even tried it again, a week later with the same results. I went back to my regular clay mask after that. If you have the money to spare and want to try this out for yourself then ok, otherwise I suggest looking for something else.</li>
            <li> You get a really small jar for the price.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times.  My face is really soft after I use it, But I&#x27;m sure their is another product out there you can the same result from for less.</li>
            <li> I read about this product on Pintrest and how great it worked so I thought I would try it. There is no doubt that the hype is all true. My 12 year old daughter and I both use Glam Glow and are amazed at the power of the product. We both have T-zone oiliness and this product removes black or white heads so easily while leaving your skin shining! 5 stars! Use a thin layer to begin and add a little more as a second layer, not much is needed. Watch the &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; of oil come through as the product begins to dry into a hard mask. Only use where necessary. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not amazing like other reviews said. I would say it&#x27;s just OK and overpriced. I&#x27;m not impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;m 25 years old and I still breakout pretty moderately on my chin. I use a basic sensitive skin face wash and have tried so many products. Not to mention I&#x27;ve wasted tons of money.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product on Pinterest, read a few of the reviews and decided I would give this product &amp; my skin problems one last shot. I use this once a week and after just two treatments my face looked so much better. My pimples have subsided for the most part, the occasional extremely small one. Which I&#x27;ll take over the large clusters of pimples that last for a week then scar up my face</li>
            <li> This product worked well, but not quite as well as it was hyped. I did notice smoother, clearer skin, but it was not as miraculous as some other reviews had touted (much as I expected.) Overall a good product, but the price is a little high. It does go a long way, so I would probably purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product! I used it as a mask once or twice a week and really helped clear my face up</li>
            <li> I love it! It really works! Will be a returning customer! Thank you so so so much. Its a life saver!</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge difference in the apparence of my blackheads after 1 use. Noticeably clearer.&lt;br /&gt;So happy I brought this product!</li>
            <li> My face feels wonderful. Leaves my face feeling smooth and glowing. Would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a clearer complexion</li>
            <li> I received this a while ago and just got around to rating it.  Came unsealed and appeard to be used. I&#x27;m starting to wonder if the product sold by this seller is even authentic. Its not that difficult to replicate packaging. This cost so much in the stores and it seems odd to me that this seller can get such a great deal on this to be able to sell it to so many people. I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and buy from a reputable place where I know I am getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> I literally just got this in the mail yesterday and tried it today. It&#x27;s amazing. My nose has always been a problem area for me and in 10 minutes I saw a noticeable difference in the size of my pores. The down side, yes this product was expensive (but compared to the $70 it normally costs, it&#x27;s a bargain), and the container is small. Also, the smell is not my favorite- reminds me of black licorice. I am thrilled with the purchase and would recommend it to friends going forward.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 uses I could tell a difference but I barely use it now. It is something I will not use on a regular basis, not for my skin I guess</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My skin is pretty sensitive and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it. I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d buy it more often.</li>
            <li> This mask is a little treat. A mini spa-facial in a jar. It has a strong eucalyptus smell that reminds me of the coast of Northern California. Dreamy. When I take the mask off, my skin looks fresh and glowy for the rest of the day.  This makes it the perfect mask to do right before an important event, such as a wedding or a presentation. It gives me a boost of calming relaxation and confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I subtracted two stars because this mask does not provide lasting results. Even if I use it regularly, which is what I did when I first got it, I don&#x27;t notice any cumulative effect. It&#x27;s magic, but temporary magic. For the price, I make sure to save it for only the most special occasions.</li>
            <li> I received the product and the seal that keeps the package closed appeared to be tampered with (that should have been a red flag) but I was too excited to care I guess! The next red flag should have been when I opened the pot, the foil was already off (it was just laying on top) and it was obvious that this was tampered with as well. I wasted a butt load of money on a product that isn&#x27;t even the real deal! After using this fake mask one time, I had the worst cystic acne of my life (the type of acne I never had in my life prior to the use of this) and now I have a deep scar on my cheek. I used this as a spot treatment and wherever I placed the mask, I got deep painful pimples. Please, go to Sephora and get the real product and save your money/heartache. Thank you! Thank you for taking away my self esteem and my money!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with glamglow! My skin feels so refreshed after using this product!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son because people said it worked for blackheads and was disappointed, it didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I used this mask for the first time yesterday and I can see a huge difference in the size of my pores, more-so than with other masks I&#x27;ve tried. It really extracts all the gunk and you can see it clearly as the mask dries and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so tight and clean and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this mask!! A must buy for any skincare junky and anyone whose looking for a deep pore cleaning. My pores look smaller and smaller the more I use it and my skin feels so soft and smooth after. I will for sure be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! After just one use it makes the poors way smaller and your face smoother! I was on the fence about getting this product because of how expensive it was, but believe me it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 36 years old &amp; despite believing that I shouldn&#x27;t be experiencing bad break outs at this age, unfortunately that is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;GLAMGLOW is all it says it is.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been putting on a full face mask once a week since receiving this product &amp; my skin feels amazing &amp; is clearer.&lt;br /&gt;Fewer blackheads &amp; blind pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Only used the mud a couple of times but it works exactly as described and is certainly well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Recieved product that looked expired. Product was dried up and was already opened. Very disappointed and not worth the hassle, might as well buy the real thing for the extra money.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Love the way skin feel afterwards and you can definitely see the stuff it pulls out of pores.</li>
            <li> The only mask you&#x27;ll ever need. I hope this stays in stock on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really does the job. Made a difference after just one use. It&#x27;s now a regular part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> i love this mask, even though it smells not very good, but i love the result, it really help to refresh my skin</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE WAY THIS FEELS. It starts to make my skin feel very tight while I&#x27;m using it, which is awesome. And it still feels tight even after a few hours. It&#x27;s kind of gross/awesome to see it pulling out all the dirt/oil/sebum from your pores. It really works. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it smells like licorice. I HATE the smell. I don&#x27;t like anything to smell like food unless it is good and especially on my face blech. But the smells fades away once it&#x27;s dry which happens very fast. Don&#x27;t be fooled by it being dry, keep it on, that&#x27;s when the magic happens.</li>
            <li> Hate it, go with the original one</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product. I had really bad black heads on my nose and under my bottom lip and I used the black head strips all the time but never really fixed my problem. After using this GLAMGLOW I can really see and feel a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m so comfortable not wearing make up too. The smell is not horrible, I love the feel of it on my face it&#x27;s like I can feel it working right away. Easy to apply and remove. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that I wish it was a bigger jar. I am definatly going to continue using GLAMGLOW and I would absolutely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Glamglow works well on my older skin.  I may not have acne but it does a wonderful job clearing blackheads and clarifying my skin.  A little more expensive than I would have like but you don&#x27;t have to use much.  I use this sparingly but it&#x27;s a treat to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the GLAMGLOW Super-MudTM Clearing Treatment because I wanted a product that cleaned and shrunk my pores. I bought this one because it had such high reviews. I have used this product at least three times a week and I don&#x27;t notice any difference. After I wash the product off my face, I feel there are darker pores than before I started washing, like the black product stays behind in my pores. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Its amazing really deep cleans your face and its great for spot treatments also . Great you can see it working on your face too not like most masks</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing this product because it sounded almost too good to be true, but it lived up to the hype! I have been using GlamGlow as a spot treatment daily or when needed, and as a mask  twice a week. My skin is looking glamorous. I always break out right before aunt Flo visits, and this product has helped reduce my pore size and  clear up acne. I think it smells great too. This seller had a lot of negative feedback regarding opened product, but mine was sealed. I even took a trip to Sephora before I received it and asked a sales rep to look at an unopened package. Overall I am extremely pleased, I have been trying this out on all of my siblings and friends. The results don&#x27;t lie, GlamGlow is amazing!</li>
            <li> It might seem expensive but it is well worth the $$! You only need a small amount at a time. It&#x27;s a miracle mask. Ive used other maska before and never seem such awesome results! You can literally see it pulling gunk out of your pores. It&#x27;s also really helped minimize my pores so my skin looks smoothe and clean. I&#x27;ll keep buying this!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Just be warned that for a few days after use you will break out because it brings out all the junk.  So definitely do not use it before something big like a wedding, prom, social event, etc.</li>
            <li> I dont understand all the hype about this product.  Glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full retail price for this. Its a good product but I don&#x27;t see any pore reduction. Shipping was very fast, got it before I was expected to.</li>
            <li> Totally went bad! There&#x27;s a lot yellow bad odor liquid inside the lid and the mask has strange smell too.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feel of it. Expensive, but works wonders :)</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! It does wonders for your skin. Helps clear pimples and makes skin radiant! I will continue to buy this product👍</li>
            <li> I thought the product was OK. Not the best face mask that I have tried. I wouldnt buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a mask that you can SEE work! I have a ton of blackheads on my nose area and you can literally see the oil being sucked out! It has a &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; feeling to your face. It kind of smells like a mixture of peppermint and licorice. I would buy again. PS: it&#x27;s easiest to apply with a makeup brush so the oil from your fingers don&#x27;t interfere with what the mask is designed to do! :)</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ll be buying another one soon. This product really works.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I was a little worried about ordering this online, I was worried that it would come dried out or it would be old. But it was perfect and worked great.  I&#x27;d recommend this to any of my friends. It&#x27;s a little pricey but its really worth it.</li>
            <li> I read rave reviews on this and for the price i expected much more. The container is very small was caked on the edges when i opened it. i read other reviews of people saying they got used products but i think it was just because this mud does dry on the container if you don&#x27;t clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on multiple occasions and i just could not tell a difference in my skin. I have pretty healthy skin but i have small pores and when they build up its hard to treat them. I also have lots of blackheads on my nose. When i used the product i did see it change color on the problem areas like the blackheads but i did not see any reductions of oil or clearing of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very upset i wasted to much money on this product. I hope you have a better result</li>
            <li> Great product, would definitely purchase again! Fast shipment too, overall a great well worth buy!</li>
            <li> It made my skin more oily and caused me to have more breakouts. I&#x27;ve only used it twice but I don&#x27;t think I can come to use it again. I feel like a wasted my money.</li>
            <li> my face turned red and itchy after using it..not for everyone I guess..</li>
            <li> Product was not as good as I expected. Made my skin super dry and tight. After 6 uses I still don&#x27;t see smaller pores or less black heads. Not worth this price. Lush sells a chocolate mask for way cheaper and works better!</li>
            <li> Its a bit pricey but I works good. I may buy it again. Would like to try the other ones as well n</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and so happy I got a deal and saved like $30 when I got it on here rather than Sephora. I got it very quickly, and makes my skin feel so clean. I also love that I can see the mask pulling all the dirt out of my skin, and I also leave it as a spot treatment overnight.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction both times I tried to use the mask.  Two days after I used the product my face started to get small red bumps on it and then began to itch.  By about the 4th or 5th day, my entire face was full of bumps and I had hives on my neck and chest.  I had to take a steroid to finally clear up the reaction.  Wanted to love it, but won&#x27;t be subjecting myself to that again.</li>
            <li> My favorite mask in the whole world</li>
            <li> Not anything special. Just makes your face feel hard and doesn&#x27;t get rid of blackheads. Very frustrating and wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting your money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected! I had seen some post on Pinterest about this product and had to try it! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this mask so much! I&#x27;ve been interested in this particular product for a while, but never took the plunge to buy it because it&#x27;s pretty pricey. After hearing YouTube beauty gurus and their opinions about the SuperMud mask and how much it&#x27;s changed their skin, I finally bit the bullet and bought it. I don&#x27;t regret it, either! It&#x27;s an absolutely phenomenal product and has become a staple to my skincare regimen. I look forward to trying out the other items GlamGlow has, and I&#x27;ll continue to be a lifelong fan.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It cleans my face and leaves it soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so far and I can tell it&#x27;s already working. I love it!</li>
            <li> Wow! I have struggled with blackheads on my nose since my early teenage years and nothing I&#x27;ve tried before has really made a difference. After the very first use I could see (and feel!) a difference in my skin and noticeably fewer blackheads and smaller pores. I just used the mask a second time (about 5 days after the first round) and the results are even better. I am truly astounded at how well this product works. To make it last as long as I can (as it is a bit pricey) I&#x27;m using it primarily just on my nose and forehead, which are my problem-areas, and that seems to be working well. :-)</li>
            <li> Read a lot of good reviews for this so I wanted to try it. Left my skin feeling soft, hydrated and amazing.  One of the best mask I have used.</li>
            <li> This mud treatment is incredible. Leaves your skin feeling so clean, fresh and really helps with acne and acne scars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks , it done nothing for me and I even think my pores a getting more dirtier. It&#x27;s not worth the money. My skin is more clear with a mud mask from Walmart .</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I hate this product but I cant! I have such oily skin and have suffered from acne for years.  I tried this few times and could not believe how well this works. The only downside I can see is the price.  It&#x27;s not cheap stuff. Because it is spendy I only use it around the nose area. My black heads are even going away. Never thought it was possible</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, there was mud around the edge and on the underside of the top. It looked like it had been opened and was maybe missing some in the jar. I had already thrown the packaging away or I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter and I both felt a difference after just one use. This product was recommended by a friend. I will now recommend it to others as well. It leaves your skin feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not the best, but not the worst either.</li>
            <li> the vacuum on the pores is so effective it&#x27;s almost too disgusting to repeat... but you gotta cuz that junk is in your pores! the clay is a bit difficult to rinse off and stains the fingers and the towels, but all easily avoidable if care is taken and absolutely worth the extra effort for these results. now on to find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t immediately clog everything back up. worth the $70 price tag at sephora, but soooo very nice to get on here for $35.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it does make my skin feel silky smooth and my pores looks smaller - although it doesn&#x27;t get all of the blackheads out.  I would absolutely never pay full price for it though.  I feel like I could find things that work just as well for cheaper, but with the discounted price it is a pretty good purchase.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product promptly after ordering it. All my friends loved it, so I decided to splurge. This product goes on a blackish grey, and dries a greenish color leaving black dots where your pores are. I have sensitive skin and this product BURNS!!! I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in my skin at all. It makes my skin look tighter for an hour or two, but then it&#x27;s like it didn&#x27;t do anything at all. I&#x27;ve had this product a month and I&#x27;m still using it as the package directs, but so far, nothing other than a cool show from watching it dry.</li>
            <li> I try and use this product at least once a week. I notice when I do my pours look smaller, my skin feels better, and I look much better too! This is a must for anyone that really likes to monitor and keep up with their skin care.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just too sensitive for this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it when I first used it &amp; thought it was so cool that you could see the places where it was working and it made my skin feel really nice when I washed it off. However, a day or 2 later my skin broke out, which hardly ever happens. For some reason a month later or so I tried glamglow again thinking maybe it was just a coincidence breaking out after using it last time but the same thing happened again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummed I spent so much $ on a product that actually had the opposite of the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Im am esthetician and get/give facials on a regular basis. This mask is better than a lot of my $300 treatments and that&#x27;s saying A LOT! I will be purchasing again and referring to my clients.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually spend this kind of money on these sorts of things, but with my wedding coming up in a few months I thought I would splurge and try it since it had so many great reviews.  I have a lot of blackheads, and I hoped it would help with that and with the appearance of my pores.  I&#x27;ve used it about once a week for two months now (mostly just on my nose and cheeks, since those are my problem areas), and I&#x27;m incredibly underwhelmed.  It makes my skin feel softer than usual for about a day, but that&#x27;s the only benefit I&#x27;ve noticed.  It also makes my skin break out a little bit.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt in the beginning because I read reviews that said it might make your skin break out in the beginning because it&#x27;s purging your skin of all of those impurities, but that should only happen the first time or two.  It still happens every time I use it, though.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  For as much as this stuff costs, I was pretty appalled at how much it doesn&#x27;t deliver. :(</li>
            <li> This face mask glow is a freaking miracle worker!!!!!! Not only does it help pull up my blackheads after wearing the mask but I had one of those under the skin zits that hurt and takes days to get to come to the surface. Well I got home from work took a hot shower streamed up my bathroom to help open my pores and then put this mask on! I let dry and washed it off and then took care of my blackheads and noticed the under the skin zit was looking some what better the next day I did the same thing and was able to get the zit out and clear and it only took 2 times using the mask to get it out! I will be buying more and more of this it&#x27;s truly amazing! My new favorite product!!!</li>
            <li> So I read a few reviews saying that the product was open (tampered with) but I gave it a try anyways. Mine was open. The inner seal was peeled back.  As a result,  I am not sure if I have the real product or not :( Probably better off just buying the real thing at Sephora for $10 dollars more.</li>
            <li> As always a great skin clearing product at a great price. Sephora sells for $60. Happy to pay less than half.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to say the least. I could tell as soon as I opened the box that the package had been tampered with. All the packaging was there and appeared to be new, but when I opened the jar to inspect the contents, it was clear that it was not a new jar. I have arranged to have it returned. I&#x27;m giving one star because the item did ship and arrive in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This is the best price for this product I have seen. I wanted to try it out after all of the rave reviews on it. The product is okay. It does pull some stuff out of your skin but when I would use it as a spot treatment it did have a hard time getting a stubborn black head out. It leaves your skin feeling soft and the price was much better than other vendors but I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted, a natural mud mask for spot treatments.  I have no complaints!  Really cool when it dries!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying it and decided to go for it.  I have terrible oily skin and when I put the mask on you can see it working immediately after it begins to dry on the pores.  My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since I came off birth control over a year ago!</li>
            <li> Was psyched to try this product after reading the many great reviews... Didn&#x27;t work for me :( I have mild acne and was hoping that GlamGlow would rid that but no such luck... However, I may be to blame for that. I wear a lot of make up and rarely go without anything on my face. I found the mask would definitely suction my clogged pores and bring the junk to my surface, but then I would turn around and slather foundation on my face and clog it back up again. Maybe if I were to go without the make up all week, I&#x27;d see a difference.</li>
            <li> Had terrible luck with this.  1st product arrived and was not sealed. The inside lid had brown mold like on it.  Really groSs.  Amazon exchanged it but the 2nd shipment was also unsealed and had leaked out.  :(.  Real disappointment</li>
            <li> Meh. I didn&#x27;t really see anything all that fantastic happen. Still have my blackheads. It didn&#x27;t make me break out which is a good thing. Guess I wouldn&#x27;t purchase anymore.</li>
            <li> This is second one I ordered and it is seems like be used , that is so sad cause I like glam grow !</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING product!  Does EVERYTHING it says it will and more.  I will always keep buying this product.  It is worth every penny I spent!!!</li>
            <li> I really thought this was my answer and it would work but I wasted my money.  Live and learn wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people have been commenting that it works for this skin type but not this one so here are my stats-&lt;br /&gt;20 yrs old&lt;br /&gt;Female&lt;br /&gt;VERY oily skin&lt;br /&gt;deep blackheads on nose and cheeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell-&lt;br /&gt;I really like the smell of the mask. It is strong when you first put it on but it reminds me of minty chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture-&lt;br /&gt;The mask is very smooth but I had run across some lumps in it along with an occasional fiber (not hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application-&lt;br /&gt;I use one of my makeup brushes to apply the mask. I use less product this way and am able to put it on within a minute or so. I was my brush right after the mask is applied and it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues-&lt;br /&gt;The only real issue I had was when I first started using the product, when I put thin layer on my nose. When that layer dried it didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; like the rest of my face but an oily brown. After this happened a few times I figured that the tip of my nose must have excess oil on the surface which was why the mask didn&#x27;t seem to be working. I compensated for this by adding an additional layer to the area while the mask was still wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results-&lt;br /&gt;As I stated above I have (had) deeply rooted blackheads. I read A LOT about this product before I was even going to try it and everyone said it helped remove them. Needless to say the first time I tried it I was disappointed. While it seemed to clear my nose up a bit it didn&#x27;t really remove the larger blackheads. I also noticed that the blackheads seemed to be darker after the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the mask for about two weeks and it eventually dawned on me that I should use toner after the mask to help clean out any mask residue in my pores. I noticed a significant lightening of the blackheads afterward which solved my above problem. After about a month now I&#x27;m noticing that the blackheads are slowly going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the &amp;#34;shrinks pores&amp;#34; statement on this it really isn&#x27;t going to cause your pores to shrink. When dirt becomes trapped it causes the pores to open more, making them appear larger. But as the dirt is cleaned out your pores begin to return to their normal size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that this mask needs to be used at least once a week (for me) in order for it to work. You cannot only apply it once or twice and expect instant results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money?-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really not sure if this mask is worth the money. It is the ONLY mask I have ever used on my face so I have no idea if another mask would work. If you really don&#x27;t want to spend the money on this product I would highly suggest purchasing a cheaper mask and using it regularly on your face to see if it works for you.use your pores to shrink.

            <li> Nice scrubbing beads/stones. Small amount but do not have to use that much so can get plenty of use out of the container</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have both the white and black one. Although the price, I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase anytime soon because of the price. It does do what it says, nice glow and super soft skin, but I think I would only use this product for special occasions. Like the night before I would use the mask and it will give me a nice refreshed skin the next day. Nice product!</li>
            <li> I started using this awhile ago and it is one of the best skin treatments out there.  I like it better than the mud treatment I had at a spa (birthday gift).  I love the fact that it&#x27;s vegan, I always look for all natural, or organic, or vegan beauty care.  I also like that it is ready to use, some other products you have to mix with water or vinegar.  Use it sparingly - you don&#x27;t need a thick layer on your skin, you are just wasting the product.  I use makeup sponges to apply the mud, they allow you to quickly put a thin layer on with a minimum of mess.  A thin layer works very well, and if you don&#x27;t use it often and the product in the jar gets a little thick/dry, just add a little water and mix.  I&#x27;ve had mixed results with blackheads, sometimes it only takes one use, sometimes it can take 2 or 3 before the black heads disappear completely, I guess it depends on your skin.  It does help with oily skin, so even though I don&#x27;t have a problem with serious breakouts, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t break out as much and it&#x27;s becoming less and less each time.  Wash your face after using it, mud and clay treatments can leave a very slight residue on your skin, so you want your skin clean before you put on makeup or creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mud and clay treatments like this can dry your skin a little because they remove EVERYTHING, and sometimes they can encourage extra oil production by your skin, so it&#x27;s important to use a good moisturizer so that your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out or over produce oil.  I use this with the mud[[ASIN:B00BD822BI Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - Intensive Anti Aging, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]].  This cream is excellent - it adds oil to your skin without causing breakouts, and is the best moisturizer I have found.  I gave the mud and cream to a friend who has very oily skin, and she found that the combination actually helped her skin be less oily.  Using the two products together, I have never had better skin in my life.  The Glamglow clears everything from my skin, reduces pores, exfoliates, and then the Bel Essence hydrates my skin better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  After a couple of months of using both, my skin is clearer, brighter, super soft, and no more fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead.  The combination is amazing.  One tip - I have normal to dry skin, so although I use the cream everyday, I use the mud once or twice a week.  A friend of mine uses it more often, she has slightly oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - my skin keeps getting better!  I cannot recommend the combination of mud and cream highly enough.  I used to buy all different creams, trying to find one that would work consistently well.  I am now spending half as much money on skin care with results I NEVER had before.  This is the best combo I&#x27;ve tried.mglow clears everything from my skin, reduces pores, exfoliates, and then the Bel Essence hydrates my skin better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.

            <li> I really like this mask because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. its really cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. it gets the skin really clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. it doesn&#x27;t dryout the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has really oily skin and i have fairly dry skin but it still works great for both of us. He uses it almost everynight, but I only use it once a week or whenever I feel like my pores are starting to get buildup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my back (followed by a sand scrub) for the beach season or before wearing a low-back dress because it really makes the skin look clean/bright with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> When I first rated this mask, I gave it 5 stars. I have large pores on my nose and inner cheeks and this mask really helps to suck out the oil. However, after less than 3 months the mask dried out and I had to toss it. The packaging says the product is good for 9 months! I emailed Glam Glow and complained and never heard back. So not only does the product dry out super fast, they&#x27;re customer service is also awful. Would not recommend this unless you plan on using the whole jar in a month!</li>
            <li> good stuff. helps some areas, breaks out others (even when applied multiple times a week). too expensive tho- found something cheaper on a vitamin website</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel great and glow. It will not get rid of acne and fix your skin that much but it will make your skin breathe and feel better.</li>
            <li> I try it and I love it to much thank you so much I will buy it again in the future</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face mask if just the best!</li>
            <li> Key Points - Use warm water and rinse for AT LEAST a minute to ensure you get all the mask off or any that&#x27;s left over will get into your pores and cause blackheads/breakouts. You may leave mask on for up to 20 minutes (which is what i did and i got fabulous). Label warns against increased light sensitivity so wear some SPF (we should be doing that anyways). If the jar dries out, add a few drops of purified water and stir. i apply the mask after cleansing my face with warm water and patting dry. Others may find it helpful to steam the face after cleansing to open up pores even more prior to mask application. Green tea extract &#x3D; studies shown it can protect against skin inflammation/acne and cancer. i would not use more than 2-3 times a week (just because it may cause the skin to be more sensitive and increasing the chance of clogging up your pores. Hey mud is thick...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While i do think the mask is overpriced at $70, GlamGlow has been the best mud mask i&#x27;ve ever tried. i have an unbelievable SUPER oily t-zone and i&#x27;ve tried mud masks from Origins, Lancome, Boscia, etc. all which are very nice, effective, and pricey themselves compared to Queen Helene. i was very skeptical about this mask but was lucky to receive samples at Sephora. First time i tried it i thought, &amp;#34;MEH it&#x27;s just different with its color change trick. It does make my skin beautiful and super tight (like radiant baby skin) but is it worth it? Nah...&amp;#34;. But then a week later my skin felt like it needed that super oil/dirt suction power that the mask delivers so i tried the rest of the sample and now i&#x27;m hooked. Didn&#x27;t know Amazon was selling it for much cheaper so score! Definitely buying some right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i heard of the Aztec clay mask that i would like to try but people keep telling me it will clog up your sink/drain... not sure if i&#x27;m down for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Tip: Finally learned to use a dime size amount of moisturizer to apply for face and neck. If i feel like it&#x27;s not spread out evenly, i use damp fingers to apply. Big difference in not breaking out anymore. Less is more for my oily skin, wish i learned this 17 years ago.not spread out evenly, i use damp fingers to apply. Big difference in not breaking out anymore.

            <li> I love, love, love this stuff! It&#x27;s perfect for zits, blackheads, etc. I use it once a day, it leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and very cool tightens the skin from the first use I like it very much and gonna be my best product</li>
            <li> I adore this mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever used a pore strip, you know the feeling that this brings. When you rip that strip off, all of the junk stuck to the strip is disgusting, but at the same time, you can&#x27;t stop thinking about how cool it is that the little strip got it out of your nose. It&#x27;s cool because you can SEE it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is the same way. As it dries, it turns a solid light grey color. However, when you leave it on for the full 20 minutes, little dark grey dots start appearing on the mask. The box says that these are the spots where the mask is absorbing dirt and oils from your pores. I didn&#x27;t know if I believed it, but when I tried the mask, the dots weren&#x27;t all over. They were concentrated around my nose and chin, where I typically have problems with zits or blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first time, I stopped putting the mask all over my face, and I only use it over my nose and chin where I have the problems. Honestly, it&#x27;s just too expensive to use everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people break out after using this mask. Don&#x27;t be discouraged. That&#x27;s just the mask doing its job. It&#x27;s pulling all of the impurities in your face to the surface. It didn&#x27;t do that to me, but supposedly it happens to people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works. Would I recommend it for an every day routine? No way! Not unless you&#x27;ve got money to spend. If you&#x27;re wanting to splurge on something that works? This is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, easy to wash off.  It dries fairly quickly once applied and skin looked and felt great immediately afterward.  Great value on Amazon instead of the store&#x27;s retail value of $69!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I love the way my skin felt after I rinsed the mask off.  As the mask was drying, I felt like it was pulling the oil out of more pores.</li>
            <li> I was all set to find some truly miraculous or at least effective skin masque. Ha!  What I got was a container of gloopy, dark, mud like substance with lots of annoying uneven particles in it.  It reminded me of taking wet mud and applying it to your face, complete with small stones.  Smelled bad.  I need to stop buying this kind of nonsense and just go to a dermatologist!</li>
            <li> somewhat dry when I received it</li>
            <li> My Daughter and I are loving this product.  It helps to clear skin imperfections, smooths as well as revitalizes and freshens the skin.  As an adult, I can see my larger pores have became somewhat smaller over the past two months.</li>
            <li> love it made my skin super soft it does take a few uses to get out some of the really hard black heads but other than that its great .it has a minty sent ,and leaves your face feeling fresh</li>
            <li> I have purchased this both on Amazon and on Sephora. The product I received from Sephora was much fresher and the treatment mud was not dried out. You can save on the cost on Amazon, but the treatment mud I received was old and had a crust around it. Overall, the product does work to help clear up acne and dry up oil. It really is a good product, but buy it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This mud is amazing . You can see it working once you put it on . Your skin feel clean and fresh after .</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this clearing treatment; however, it has done nothing for my skin any time I have used it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and a great product. I purchased this through Neiman Marcus the first time and now will be purchasing online. Smells great.</li>
            <li> It works much better than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;My face is totally cleaned every time after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on pinterest and was excited to try.  The best price is on Amazon but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.  You could probably find a natural DIY formula that would work just as well.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to buying and saw a lot of comments on receiving the product opened or used and for some reason I thought hey maybe they just had bad luck....yeeeeea no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package came on time, which was great, but the product had obviously been opened and used before. Spend the extra money and buy it somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This mask did not work on my skin. I did see all the black spots on my face after it dried but nothing happened. My skin did not feel soft, clean, or look clear. It only dried it out.</li>
            <li> I had read a few good reviews but remained skeptical. Turns out, the critics were right. This treatment is awesome. I struggle with blackheads and nothing has done a great job. I saw instant results with a fifteen minute treatment, plus my skin was super smooth and soft with pores appearing smaller. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Do not buy from here. Product seal was broken (open) and dirty was NOT new as advertised. Disgusting!&lt;br /&gt;Shame was looking forward to trying it ;(</li>
            <li> I love love love love this product!!!!! I have sensitive skin and breakout for any thing, this product has help me so much!!!</li>
            <li> Removed all my blackheads in one use and made my skin soft. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s like a magic wand, and kinda gross how much oil it absorbs but really good for skin. Expensive but if you use sparingly it&#x27;ll last for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you want smoother looking skin and smaller pores this product is for you. It didn&#x27;t really do anything to help my current break outs but it did definitely make my pores appear smaller. I got immediate results with this product. It was amazing!</li>
            <li> When I tried this mask on, my face broke out into a nasty rash.  I had to go to the doctor right away.  It wasn&#x27;t good for my skin.</li>
            <li> mask is amazing! Skin is silky smooth and pores are unclogged after one use. Paid less than I would have for same weighted product at Sephora.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really amazing. I hate paying the high price for it but I haven&#x27;t found another mask that works as well to remove whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but when it got down to a few uses left in the jar it dried out.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works well to get rid of black heads to make your face look more clear. Only downfall is that it might make you break out a day or two after using it the first time but that is just bringing everything to the surface. Great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading many many great reviews on it online and after a lot of deliberation over whether I wanted to spend almost $50 on a face mask. A friend of mine has the original GLAMGLOW mask (the tingling &amp; exfoliating one) so I was aware of the small package size. My skin type is oily/combination, not particularly breakout prone but I was looking for something to clear out my pores and smooth out my skin overall. The package states the product will last for 17 uses as a full face mask, or 1000 uses as a spot treatment. I apply the product with a spare foundation brush which really helps limit the amount of product you use. You can honestly see the mask pulling buildup from your pores as it dries, and when you wash it off your skin feels soooo smooth. Applying makeup after using the mask, it went on much smoother than normal - as if I had already used a primer. All in all, though the product is expensive, I feel it is totally worth it for the texture and appearance it leaves your skin with afterwards. I hope this review was helpful to some of you who are on the fence about purchasing!</li>
            <li> It is very useful. Your pore would get really different. And the package also arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works! The immidiate, noticeable difference in blackheads and pore-size is incredible. While I don&#x27;t know how well it treats acne, I do know it does a marvelous job of dramatically cleansing pores and improving the texture and look of skin.</li>
            <li> I like the way the mask tingles when you put it on (feels like something is working there!). But, I wouldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; to the immediate results some reviewers have spoken of. Once you open the container, the product will start to dry out. So, careful there! And, you have to keep up with the regimen to see the long-term results. So, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the long-term investment of a pricey product.</li>
            <li> I use this product three to four times per week and have noticed that my pores are definitely getting smaller and I have lot less black heads.  I have been using this product for over a month now and it took a few weeks for me to see the improvements so you need to be patient but it really works and it works better than any other mud pore refining product I have ever used.  It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST !!! Seriously ! I&#x27;ve tried so many product...! This is the most effective ! Thanks GlamGlow !</li>
            <li> At half the price of what you would pay at Sephora, I thought this was worth a try. I was a little cautious because some other reviews said that theirs seemed tampered with, or that there wasn&#x27;t a seal. But mine seemed to have been packaged properly and there was a protective seal. I&#x27;ve never used this mask before, so I don&#x27;t have any way to compare it. HOWEVER, the mask dries to a matte dark finish, showing you ALL of your pores, and when you wash it off, your face feels soft and your pores definitely do look smaller. While I liked the product just fine, I do not think this is a cure-all for large pores, though, and I will likely not be splurging again, as many masks can give you similar results.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the nastiness that came out of my face! It helps keep my face clear and minimizes my pores. I use it once a week now and love it! I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Best mask i ever used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if what I received was an older bottle. It was very flaky and did not look like the new one that I had purchased before. When I used it it still gave me the same tingly feeling but not as much as before. All In all a good product.</li>
            <li> Today it finally arrived, I am very excited to try it out for the first time. I was reading few reviews about the container looking gross and with no seal. All it had was a removable type of plastic lid.  I been trying to upload pictures of the actual container what it looked like when first opened. I want to know if I should be concern with the authenticity of this product, or is it pretty normal to receive the product with an unattached removable plastic lid. (Which made the product look dry when first opened ).</li>
            <li> I use it with my gal pals while drinking a glass of wine. We like to see what impurities are drawn out on eachothers&#x27; face (gross, right?) My friend&#x27;s husband caught us wearing the GlamGlow mask and tried it in secret one night. Needless to say, he has his own jar now. We&#x27;re all huge fans.</li>
            <li> I read a LOT of the reviews, and couldn&#x27;t wait to see the oil being pulled from my large pores. I guess everyone&#x27;s face is different, because all I saw was the granules that the product is made with, on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the consistency of the product, a little goes a long way and I do feel as though my pores look smaller. I was even complimented on my skin tonight by 2 different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was $20, I would use this as my main mask, but because the price is so high, I probably won&#x27;t be reordering... :-(</li>
            <li> My face looks like a post-apocalyptic hellscape every time I use this stuff, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that means it&#x27;s working! It sucked enough oil out of my face to power a prius for a week. After I rinsed it off my pores were noticeably smaller and my skin felt silky smooth. Be a little bit cautious after you use it though. I moisturized right away because my skin was screaming for it, but when I went outside my face stung a bit. I live in Wisconsin so it&#x27;s pretty cold, so perhaps keep temperature sensitivity in mind when you use it. Overall though, flippin&#x27; amazing!</li>
            <li> it is a little painful when you use it but it can be bore. But I do not know if this product has worked for me since I have not seen obvious changes on my T-zone.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, it&#x27;s miraculous! BUT DO NOT buy from here. The product i received was very dry and it looked used. disappointed. i rather pay a little more at sephora to receive good quality.</li>
            <li> This stuff greatly reduces the size or look of your pores. Other charcoal products do not even compare. It doesn&#x27;t make your face perfect but t significantly makes your skin look better. It is a smaller bottle but you really don&#x27;t need a lot. Totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> OH. MY. GOSH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product on pinterest, read some of its reviews and decided to give it a try. I was so impressed I haven&#x27;t stopped telling my friends to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem with large pores and blackheads, I used the mud as a full face mask, left on for 20 minutes, washed off and my pores were literally half the size they were before AND I noticed less blackheads! I also own a Clarisonic which has been helping to keep those pores clean. Its 17 full masks or 1000 spot treatments and after the improvement I saw, I will definitely be using it on my nose weekly! Hopefully when I run out, I won&#x27;t need to order more, but if I have to, I so will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on cool and tingly. Feels nice, its a dark grey color and doesn&#x27;t stain your skin (obviously) or your clothes (got some on my shirt and came out with the wash).</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  I could see the oils being pulled from my pores.  The packaging is deceiving though.....it is a little jar.  But a little bit goes a long way.  Wish the product was a little cheaper but will buy again.  Can&#x27;t wait for my teenage daughter to give it a try!</li>
            <li> This stuff really seems to work better than any product I have used.  I think it is actually cleaning out my pores and reducing the size of my pores.  I use like a spot treatment in the areas I have clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled as an adult with acne on my chin and forehead and this has been a real life changer. I use it to put on bumps to dry them up at night and in the morning they are hardly formed or noticeable.</li>
            <li> As a person in my 30 &#x27; s without much acne just occasional breakout it does wonders.  My face definitely looks radiant &amp; has a glow. It looks fresh squeaky clean. However my 12 yr old daughter who has pretty bad teen acne coming on it doesn&#x27;t do much for her. Maybe she should use it daily? definitely nice to have though I use it when I have any special occasion or pictures taken and it is awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I cant see the oils coming to the surface with this mask. I see an improvement of my blackheads and breakouts with this product. Works faster as a spot treatment than actual acne products. It claims not to make skin dry, but i do notice a little after use so i moisturize right away!</li>
            <li> This is amazing, I wish they made large portions that don&#x27;t cost a million dollars. this is the best mud mask ever and it works on practically everything (acne, scars, ingrown hairs, etc...). Buy it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> The only product i have used on my face that has actually helped clear it and look more radiant. I will continue to buy/use this product!! Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Skin feels amazing. It&#x27;s the best mask out there. Smells a little funky but so worth it.</li>
            <li> I like the product, however I didn&#x27;t get the results that many others did. by this I mean that initially after I washed the mask off it did yield results as promised however after about 4 hours my skin was oily, and my pores looked the same again. I would say it is slightly over priced for what you get.</li>
            <li> This muck made my face feel so smooth and hydrated. I can&#x27;t believe I just heard about it. Don&#x27;t tell your enemies just your friends.</li>
            <li> I saw no change after using this product, and for the price it was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked this mud mask. It feels great during and after. However, the reason I deducted one star is because it&#x27;s a bit pricey and I consider it more of a splurge. I deducted another star because I didn&#x27;t see any significant or dramatic results after using it. Overall, I liked that my face felt soft and less oily after the use even if the results weren&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried the product yet, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s already used.&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s half price but it should&#x27;ve come in that condition while it&#x27;s listed as \\&quot;New.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY FROM \\&quot;SUPER DUPER DEALS.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Inside the shipping carton was a ripped up, dented product box containing a gross and dirty jar. The cream works about as well as garden mud. For the price I&#x27;d like something that didn&#x27;t look like it was past sell-by and fished out of a dumpster.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It really help keep my face clear. I&#x27;m an adult with oily skin &amp; acne living in a hot , humid area.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so much cheaper from this vendor, almost half the price of sephora, so I bought 2.&lt;br /&gt;I got it about 3 days later. Fastest shipping ever &amp; free! Love it!!</li>
            <li> The best of all clay mask out there really do what is should do , best for acne as well , definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It seemed as if it had been opened before. Packaging seemed like it had been opened or was shook bad shipping. I kept t because I saved $30 off of store price. Likely to order 1 more time because of price in hopes of better results this time</li>
            <li> Problems with this product. Appears to be used already. It is also such a small quantity for the price. For visualization: the packaging is huge but the product has less substance then a travel size vasoline container, hope that helps.</li>
            <li> Great mask. Actually makes you glow afterwards.</li>
            <li> Semi liked the mask, however I didn&#x27;t use it for a few weeks. When I went to use it again and it was dried out! Such an expensive item should have better packaging that will keep the product from drying out. Box and packaging was excessive, should have spent more on the jar the product came in.</li>
            <li> The product was delievered fast! I really love this product because it really cleans out your pores. I get a lot of clogged pores on my cheeks and I put this mask on and it takes most of it out. I use it 1-2 a week, does a great job. I would higlhly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This product is worth the value and works great. Clears up most breakouts very quickly. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> it indeed worked for me!!!! will buy again!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this product but family members had used it and loved it. I have sensitive skin and had no problem with this product. Skin feels extra clean after using it, along with making it look and feel toner. No problems with reddniss after I use it. A little goes a long way. Def would order again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really clear current breakouts don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s strong enough and changing the acne prone skin I have so unhappy</li>
            <li> The reason I gave 3 starts coz this face pack is just okay and surely overpriced!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do any miracles and I have used it just 3 times and more than half of the jar is gone&lt;br /&gt;and didn&#x27;t make any difference. I still can see stuff in my pores and they are visible too.&lt;br /&gt;The calcium bentonite clay available on amazon is far much effective than this and cost just 7 dollars and some cents for a pound.&lt;br /&gt;Further more if you really want to use charcoal for face pack one can buy charcoal capsules and make a facepack out of that. Recipe available online.&lt;br /&gt;No I wont recommend  this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This was super expensive, and the jar is super tiny. I noticed NO results. You can buy masks for a fraction of the cost of this stuff. I have blackheads/pimples, and I saw no change. Save your $.</li>
            <li> The box is misleading on how big the bottle actually is so at first I was disappointed. However after my first application I decided I was still excited. It dries quickly, before I&#x27;ve finished applying it to my entire face in most cases. There&#x27;s no odor at all. I didn&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;pore shrinking&amp;#34; but I did notice my pores were crystal clear after using this. My face felt smooth to the touch but didn&#x27;t have any tightness I&#x27;ve had with other products. And even though the actual bottle is small, it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover your face so I imagine I&#x27;ll be able to use it for a while. I&#x27;ve used it four times so far and each time I&#x27;m just as happy as the time before.</li>
            <li> this was a good product and you definitely feel it working and it did my face felt incredibly soft and i did see my pores open making it easier to clean them out. id say it cleared my pores about 60% which is still pretty good and makes a pretty big difference. Although the size is very small compared to the shipping box its almost a tease but i got over it fast when i released how long its lasted me. I literally use this maybe once every two weeks and ive had it since july and i still have half of it still full. i only put it on problem spots not all over my face unless i have a special event the next night</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less expensive it is a very small jar i am almost out and to get the desired results you would probablu have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I ordered Glam Glow on a recommendation from a friend, as I was looking for a beauty product that would help clean out and shrink my pores as well as address the &amp;#34;orange peel texture&amp;#34; that I was experiencing on the skin under my eyes and around my nose.  I tried out this product as soon as I got the package yesterday as I was anxious to see if it worked.  After washing my face, I applied a very thin layer to my face and let it sit for about 15 minutes.  You could see it working on the skin, but I never felt that overly drying sensation I have felt with other clay masks.  After washing off the mask I could see that the debris in my pores had come out to the surface and my skin felt tighter, and the rough texture around my nose was minimized.  While I was glad with the results, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.  That is until this morning, after I woke up, my skin continued to look great, the best it has looked in years after getting out of bed.  My skin is still so smooth and bright, and it feels very soft. I did experience some light break outs around my chin after using the product yesterday, but I applied some of the mask as a spot treatment and the cleared up over night. I think this is just my skins reaction to getting all of that gunk out of it.  Overall, while this product is expensive, a little goes a long way and I think I will only use once a week.  I hope that I continue to see such fantastic results, I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This mask is phenomenal, I have cystic acne which flares especially during my menstrual cycle after applying this mask it alleviates the redness and also pulls the bacteria from beneath my skin!! I see results overnight!</li>
            <li> I suffer from very oiling and acne prone skin. This has helped so much! It&#x27;s like a miracle. You can literally see it sucking the oils from your face! I no longer have to pat the oil off my skin and can barely see the pores on my t-zone anymore. I definitely recommend this product, plus it smells natural and great!</li>
            <li> This product is my secret weapon. Like many other reviews the scent is very appealing and the mask does it&#x27;s job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that needs to be used a lot to keep good results, keep that in mind. If you are disappointed in your results after one use, keep using it as needed, I usually do mine twice a week.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is amazing. It absolutely cleared out and tightened my pores and left my skin feeling amazing. Will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes of this after reading the &amp;#34;glam-glowing&amp;#34; reviews. Inside the huge hexagonal box is a tiny jar. Inside the tiny jar is some dark grey goop. It&#x27;s not as fine as I would like and there are some large, hard pieces which you notice when you spread the thin layer over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this to clean out the pores on my T.zone and close them up. It did an O.K. job, but I think a cheaper mask would do about the same. Overall I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price tag and I won&#x27;t buy it again, sorry!</li>
            <li> It feels good and is relaxing but I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my complexion. Maybe slightly smaller pores but nothing major. Not terrible but not worth the price</li>
            <li> This product seems to really deep clean my skin. Although, I was disappointed that the product appeared to have been previously opened.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite skin are products I&#x27;ve ever used! It really a gets all the dirt and oil out and after two uses I&#x27;ve noticed fewer blemishes as well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times, but I love how the product works.  I have super oily skin so anything that literally pulls the crud out of my pores is wonderful.  The instructions do say that it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun so I made sure to put sunscreen on afterwards since I was headed outside.  Definitely worth the cost, better price than purchasing it a Sephora.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask! Reduces the noticibility of black heads and pores! you can see it working. I also like the luminizing mask from REN to use after this one just to give my skin a more plump awesome look!</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews of glam glow before purchasing it and hoped that it would be worth it since it is TERRIBLY expensive. I have to say, that this product is WORTH it. i am using mine all the time and my pores are tiny again!</li>
            <li> So, this facial mask is ok. It deep cleans and refreshes you skin without stripping you of all your natural oils. But that&#x27;s about it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for all the different skin problems it claims to address ( such as pimples, large pores, uneven skin tone ect.) I have enlarged pores due to oily skin,  occasional  breakouts and a few post acne marks. I&#x27;ve been using the mask every night for three weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in the condition of my skin. It has done absolutely nothing for my enlarged pores, which was my main reason for buying this product!!! If you are looking for a clay mask, I&#x27;m sure you can find something alot cheaper (this product retails for $69.00 in the stores) that will work just as well.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes your face feel tight and makes it feel good but I have had blackheads on my checks, nose &amp; chin for years and can&#x27;t find anyway to get rid of them. I thought this would be my solution but sadly it hasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month every other day or so and my blackheads aren&#x27;t going away still . I really wanted this to work but it just didn&#x27;t /:</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  Expensive but good.  Don&#x27;t know that I will purchase this again do to the cost!</li>
            <li> I use this and my daughter and son use it also.  Very good stuff!</li>
            <li> I will say that when after reading the other reviews I was very hesitant to purchase due to the fact lots of previous customers said the seals have been broken.&lt;br /&gt;When I received mine, it really does look like it had been tampered with. The box it came in itself was sealed with a clear round sticker as you would probably find on most boxes. However, whenever I opened the bottle, the foil itself was not &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; well, and there was brown &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; around the rim of the lid, possibly looking like some of the product leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will say when I received the package it was very warm from the delivery truck I suppose but I&#x27;m not sure that would/should make the product leak through the foil.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m debating on returning this product.</li>
            <li> I expected so much more from this mask. It works okay but the texture is &amp;#34;chunkier&amp;#34; than I expected. It removes easily and rinses away cleanly without too much harsh scrubbing. So far the results seem to be on par with every other face mask I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing, wonderful, and gross. so you put it one and after a few minutes you see it has started to dry, but you also see the areas where &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; oil/dirt/makeup/whatever has been pulled out of your skin. it&#x27;s super cool and super gross all in one. i do this once a week and it really helps. i have oily/combination/sensitive skin so i&#x27;m sure you could do it more often, but my skin seems to react to everything so i try to keep masks and exfoliation to a minimum, but seriously this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Why do so many people like this product? It is over priced, over hyped and has a tiny bit of product in the jar! Their are so many different masks out there to try, this one really did not do anything other than make my skin feel dry and tight. It has poor ratings on Beautypedia.com, and can cause skin irritation over time. Please people, don&#x27;t follow the hype of youtubers and bloggers, try things out for yourself. Keep in mind, most of those people get a lot of items for free and don&#x27;t always give honest reviews.</li>
            <li> I was worried about this product at first, because there were several reviews that mentioned that their product seemed used. Mine did not. The packaging was in perfect condition and nothing had been tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it works great. I have blackheads that seem to never really go away no matter what products I use. This works. my pores are actually clear for the first time in a very long time. Plus you can actually see it working.&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this stuff (and the reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars) is the smell. It stinks. But the smell is worth the results.</li>
            <li> It truly pulls all impurities to the surface. I recommend doing this mask with nothing scheduled for a day or two. I do this mask as a weekly ritual and a more mild mask mid week. Works great! If you plan it right you can definitely beat a big breakout before hand. I&#x27;m a happy customer!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool! Besides that it shows your pores being cleaned out (Not a reason why I bought it, but it is horrying/cool), it really does work! I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it works FANTASTIC for blackheads, but not really for other kinds of acne. It made a very noticeable difference on my nose which had a lot of blackheads that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. But with the other spots on my face, I didn&#x27;t notice that much difference after washing it off. It smells sort of minty, but it doesn&#x27;t tighten or sting your face when you put it on. It is expensive, but you only need a little at a time, and if you do spot treatment instead of your whole face, I think it is worth the money. That is, if your buying it strictly for blackheads.</li>
            <li> I really loved it! Gives your face a really clean feeling in just 20 minutes. Skin is noticeably clearer after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a weekly mud mask, but it also works for a spot treatment for those pop up blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of the product is how my skin gets so much softer after a single use. The mask has a really pleasant smell which makes masking an enjoyable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may think it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. It seems like a small amount, but it lasts a while. Just use the suggested amount and it will make your money worth it!</li>
            <li> I had heard rave reviews on this product. I have used it several times already and seen no results. Just pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have been hearing all the hype about this product and decided to give it a try. Amazon definitely had it cheaper than most other outlets (reputable outlets anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it says it will. Does absorb oil, does make your skin smooth, and does help with loosening up debris clogging your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it 3 stars because for the price..you do not get a lot of product. The amount you pay, does not justify the amount of product you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I get the EXACT same results using my Indian Healing Clay (Bentonite Clay also sold on Amazon) with a greater return. My clay mask gives me the same results as the GLAMGLOW clearing treatment, however at a fraction of the cost, and with ingredients that I know (because you are mixing it.) I personally prefer the Healing Clay over the GlamGlow. (healing clay results are the same: absorbs oil, does make your skin smooth, help with loosening up debris clogging your pores, and with continued usage does help with balancing your skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those purchasing the GlamGlow, it&#x27;s not a treatment that will give you perfectly clear skin overnight. You have to continue with it. So don&#x27;t use this product thinking your acne marks, blemishes and blackheads will be gone after one use.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is amazing to see the junk in my pores. My skin always feels so soft when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I purchased GlamGlow after hearing rave reviews but did not want to pay full price. This product is amazing and I got it for a fraction of the price!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but it&#x27;s freaky to watch the stuff come out of your pores. And the label is right--you really don&#x27;t need that much. I even had a t-zone pore party with 6 of my friends, and there&#x27;s barely any gone. I have terrible blackheads. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> Ever since i started using this my face has cleared and my pores have gotten smaller. I would usually use it twice a week or sometimes 4 times a week and it would always leave my face feeling clean and so so smooth. I have had it since October so this little bottle has lasted 5 months. I would recommend to use it only 2 times a week though because the times i had used it frequently, it kind of made my face feel a little dry (not dramatically though, just a little dry feeling). I have gone through so many acne treatments and this is probably the only one that has helped me clear the acne (pimples, zits, and pores).</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I will use it all and I think I will probably order again. It erased any black heads I had.</li>
            <li> Really good so happy with the product! It&#x27;s amazing how it draws everything out and you can see the results working straight away.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted to try this product and I was not sure it would be worth the money.  But she loves it and it is working to clear up her face.  She says it feels wonderful after use and easy to use.  So I guess it was well worth the money if it works and makes her happy.</li>
            <li> The hype over this product is a bit much. It&#x27;s good in that it makes the skin feel great after use. The skin is soft and firmer than before but it doesn&#x27;t really do much to clear imperfections or black heads. If you have very sensitive skin it can cause breakouts as well.</li>
            <li> Loved how this product worked.  This is highly recommended for ANYONE to use to get a healthy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  Easy to use too!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! As a sufferer of adult acne, most products make my skin look worse. This not only reduces shine, but it clears up painful blemishes (cystic and regular white heads) and it doesn&#x27;t rub your skin raw when washing off. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I expected this to be a great product! BUT, it is not worth the money! Although the mask appears to work when you first put it on, i did not notice a decrease in blackheads or an increase in clearer pores.  The product is also extremely small and you may only get a few uses out of it.  I would have returned it but it was too late.</li>
            <li> This stuff does pull all the oil to the surface and after washing it off, my skin feels baby soft. However, I think I had higher hopes that it would pull the blackheads out and it does not. I have sensitive skin so I am using once a week. Great mud mask just not 100% for what I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My skin always looks amazing after I use it. I&#x27;ve recommended it to anyone who will listen to me drone on about skin care.</li>
            <li> It worked just like it said! I even got my mom and dad to try it! It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week. It is good for clearing, but doesn&#x27;t work for acne treatment. And not so magic to lighten my complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! It totally works. Gets the gunk right out!!!</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best facial masks I&#x27;ve ever used. It always leaves my skin feeling so much cleaner and less oily than before. I can definitely tell when I haven&#x27;t used it regularly though because my skin will go back to how it usually is. Definite must buy!</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Love how it pulls oils out of the pores. You only use a very thin layer. Smells like licorice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Gives a really deep cleanse to the skin. Really helps with breakouts.</li>
            <li> First use of this product will have you embarrassed at how much dirt lies within your pores. Later uses reveal healthier skin.</li>
            <li> I was anticipating a product that cleared out pores more efficiently.  I was slightly disappointed because it didn&#x27;t just pull out the debris or black heads on my nose.  Black heads on my nose is a constant battle of mine... I hate them with a passion.  I applied the product as directed and waited the maximum 20 minutes as recommended.  My skin was smoother and refreshed after the application but the black heads have not decreased after 3 uses.  I will keep using this because I am hoping that there will be a cumulative effect and the more I use it the better my pores will be.</li>
            <li> Although it has cleaned out my pores some, it doesn&#x27;t really shrink them as advertised.  Makes my nose, shin &amp; forehead REALLY tight &amp; dry. (I have combination skin w/ an oily Tzone).  I use it about once a week &amp; have not noticed a huge difference but it&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> Got a great price on this product (half what I saw it else where) so I decided to try it after reading a few amazing reviews.  Nice quality product, beautiful packaging, and I feel like it did draw impurities out of my pores.</li>
            <li> My sister turned me on to this product. We both find it satisfying to see little dots all over your face when this begins to dry--which I hope and assume are impurities being drawn out of my pores. I think other mud masks do the same thing for cheaper, but I do like this one. I have taken to putting it on and around my nose, and then I use the excess and a little bit more to spread around the rest of my face and other problem spots, so it&#x27;s applied elsewhere as a light film--saves product and still rejuvenates the whole face that way!</li>
            <li> I do not think that this product worked, especially for the amount that I paid for it. I think the color change that the mask does as it dries makes you think it is blackheads. once removed however my face looked no different. My pores didn&#x27;t look the slightest bit changed.</li>
            <li> I think this mud clearing treatment is a fantastic luxury product to treat your face to every once in awhile. I have seen people use this religiously however I am in no way financially stable enough for an investment like this every month or so. The mud is dark gray and dries mint green on your face. Admittedly, the first time you use this you will see the most results. For me, I noticed that I never experienced the same success from the mud as I did the first time. Having said that, I do think that it still works but just not as well as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little GLAMGLOW comes in a big white box with packaging to keep this thing pretty sturdy. I think the packaging is a little cumbersome so I place the small treatment in my bathroom&#x27;s medicine cabinet. I enjoy using this every once in awhile when I have my &amp;#34;personal days&amp;#34; where I like to treat myself, but I personally can&#x27;t see this as a steady repurchase based on the price.</li>
            <li> This is not the legitimate glamglow supermud treatment. I kept the previously purchased mask container from sephora and it is not the same as what I received in my order, it&#x27;s similar but not the same. The smell is a bit off and does not work like the true glam glow mask. Should&#x27;ve figured what I&#x27;d get for the price but the real product is worth it!!</li>
            <li> One of the best Masks I have ever used. got this for my girlfriend and she loved it. The box is a lot bigger than the container though. It would be nice if they gave more for the price. Overall it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Always a quality product with no issues and a good Seller.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about ordering this from Amazon seeing as it is MUCH lower than the retail price ($69 plus tax at Sephora) but since it was shipped from and fulfilled by Amazon, I took a shot. It is 100% authentic- came with the box, pamphlets, and my tub was sealed. I am so excited to have this mask as it is totally amazing for combination skin! You can really see it cleaning out your pores. Definitely try it! I&#x27;ll never buy it from Sephora again!</li>
            <li> cleaned pores immediately. !!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite masks.  I battle adult acne, and this really helps.  It is a small jar, but you only need a thin layer to get the job done.  The little jar can really go a long way.  You can actually see this mask break up excess sebum and pull it from your pores.  The combination of both glycolic acid and salicylic acid works wonders for me.  I&#x27;ve found that many acne products have one or the other, but I really like how this mask utilizes both.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with glamglow, a friend mentioned it in passing and the next day I ordered it.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but so are other products that cost much less. It looks cool when it dries but why pay just for that.</li>
            <li> This mask was pretty good! Gives a nice cooling feeling while you have it on, maybe due to the eucalyptus in it? It&#x27;s pretty watery, not as thick as I thought, but it doesn&#x27;t run down your face by any means. It also has little chips in it, almost like dried flakes. It works fairly well, I noticed significantly less breakouts after using it a few times. I believe my pores also shrunk a little after using it a few times. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t get rid of every blackhead on my face, but still a pretty good product. It wasn&#x27;t irritating at all, not much redness at all after washing it off, and I leave it on for way longer than is actually recommended (probably shouldn&#x27;t). I do wish it was a little cheaper because I&#x27;d certainly buy it again immediately, and the jar is very small. I spread it pretty thin, and I was still only able to get about 8 uses out of it, the jar says you can get 17 uses out of it. Maybe I have a big head. Nevertheless, Amazon gives a great price as always, and if you&#x27;re looking for a new mask to try, don&#x27;t be afraid to give this one a go!</li>
            <li> Good product! It will be perfect if there are more promotions for it! I really like it! What I dislike is the size of it. It is too small.</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft</li>
            <li> I just received my Glamglow today and I am already in love. I have many friends who own this product, and I am so happy to finally have my own. At first I was wary because of the price, but this is 100% authentic Glamglow. I love that this mask shows you where your face is dirtiest. You could use this every day, and it would still bring out dirt. This is a fantastic product that I will repurchase again and again.</li>
            <li> this product makes my face feel so soft &amp; clean. the results last for several days, too!! it arrived in a factory sealed package, obviously new. I use it once a week &amp; have had much nicer skin since I started using it. I&#x27;m going through menopause &amp; my face has been having breakout issues, but this has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I love the product.. Great stuff! It really works.. I have used it before and knew what to expect. HOWEVER, the jar from seller &amp;#34;pretty77&amp;#34; was already opened. The seal was missing and there were dried clumps on the lid. I scooped through the remaining product and.. a long hair was inside. DISGUSTING.</li>
            <li> This is  a great mask to do once per week. I&#x27;ve had breakouts on and off most of my life and now I use this mask once per week, use a clarisonic brush twice per week with Cerave soap and get a facial once per month and my skin looks great! super clear and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;our skin comes into contact with so many toxins throughout the day: exhaust from cars, AC units, makeup, our cell phones and our hands. So there are only two reasons our skin can break out germs and hormones. Best way to deal with it is to get our hormones tested and find the right skin care regimen and stick to it for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;we all have friends who sleep with makeup on and still have great skin. They simply have  great skin genes!&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a dream in a jar. It&#x27;s gross how much oil you can literally see it sucking out of your face, but amazing how much it will reduce the size of your pores once they become unclogged! I&#x27;m already on my second jar!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how I would like this product, since I&#x27;ve never heard of the brand until recently. But it turns out I love it. It works amazingly at minimizing your pores (which is the main reason I wanted to try it) Also pretty decent at removing blackheads. Personally it drys my skin out a little, so i usually put some lotion on afterwards. Also my boyfriend loves using it. After a day working in a warehouse, it really helps extract all the dirt and grim. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Was so excited about this purchase but when it came the seal in the jar was broken and some of the product was dry on the side. So disappointed with the packaging. Product is great tho.</li>
            <li> Im not dying for this product.  It works OK but it doesn&#x27;t really clean out my pores as well as Biore.  Also, the tea tree oil really burns my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is so great I can see a difference right away.  I started having acne problems in my 30s and since using this my skin has come a long way.</li>
            <li> Order came thru like a charm.  I Love Amazon, it&#x27;s my all time favorite one stop shopping go to place.</li>
            <li> Very good product my face is softer and super clean</li>
            <li> Product in great condition, nothing damaged. Fast shipping. Overall great product, I&#x27;m seeing improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. In one treatment, my skin is getting better. By the third day after, any problem areas have diminished and are on their say out. I use about once every two weeks after a lavender steam, and it keeps my skin glowing and clear.</li>
            <li> I was leery of purchasing this here on Amazon so I picked mine up from another retailer. That said, I love this mask. I have only used it once and saw immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell wasn&#x27;t off-putting. It was a little &amp;#34;mediciney.&amp;#34; Texture is what surprised me. First, it is thinner than I had expected. Just looking at it I thought it would be very thick and heavy.  In reality, when I started applying it, the product was light and easily spreadable. I found this to be a big bonus as it will now last much longer than I thought considering the small size of the tub. It&#x27;s also a bit grainy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face and applying the mask I let it sit for 20 minutes. I set a timer so I wouldn&#x27;t forget. It came off about as easily as other mud masks. So there was a lot of splashing and rubbing to remove it. All the areas I had put it on were wonderfully clear of gunk. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Other masks remove some, but this took it ALL out. I used a salicylic acid moisturizer after and my skin felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke the next morning and ran to the bathroom. I had read other reviews where people experienced break outs after use. I am happy to report that I didn&#x27;t. Maybe the combination lotion I used for acne did well enough to moisturize and zap bacteria and prevented that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very, very happy with GlamGlow. I will definitely keep this in my arsenal and utilize it about once a week.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars except its pretty expensive. Does last quite awhile though.</li>
            <li> People raved about this so I decided to splurge and I&#x27;m disappointed. I didn&#x27;t find it to be any more effective than any number of other masks/treatments that I&#x27;ve purchased for much less money.</li>
            <li> The image is quite deceiving, the bottle is actually very small and the cream stinks like cow poop. It burns a little when applied to face, but very interesting to see the black dots on your face after its dried. It is fun for the first time use only.</li>
            <li> It did well, but for the price I expected it to do much better.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product as I kept seeing it recommended in magazines and it received such high ratings on Amazon.  The down side is it is fairly pricey, although not as expensive as on other sites.  I think it is a good product and does a good job cleaning your skin on a deep level.  However, I have also found other 100% natural mud masks that I believe deliver the same great results for less money and more product.  I gave it 4 stars because of the price, not performance-if money is not a factor for you, then you will probably love this product.  Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! It literally pulls your blackheads out. The first time I only had it stay on until it dried with not too many results. Make sure you keep on for a full 20 minutes (even after it dries) and you will be amazed! It is a littl gross, but it pulls everything out! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I use this 2x a week and it has really helped with my acne! I use a moisturizer after and my skin feels great! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I am seriously obsessed with this mask and the thirsty mud.  They are awesome to use together as well.  This mask is geared twords helping to clear breakouts which really does work.  In the product it contains activated charcoal that sucks all the oils out of your pores.  This mask works best if you use it at least 3 days a week.  They also make a matching cleanser that literally makes your skin feel so clean once you use it.  It is a more pricy mask but believe me it is seriously worth it!</li>
            <li> I went online and did a bunch of research as to what all this product was about and was beyond ready to try it. After getting a sample from Sephora (That I got three uses out of, for free) I was ready to purchase. I bought from Super Deals and I am not 100% sure if it is their product or just how Glam Glow packages their product.. when I got the product it was sealed in the box, so I opened the box and there was the jar. The jar is small but I know I will get a lot of use out of it. What was disappointing was the fact that the jar isnt even half way filled... Is this normal for Glam Glow? Have others that bought from other places had this issue? FEEDBACK is needed for any future purchases. As for the product, it made me break out at first and then everything cleared up after a few days. Now using it twice a week is just apart of my schedule!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It showed you where the balckheads were but did absolutely nothing to pull them out, if anything my pores looked twice as big with blackheads still in them. Definitely not impressed.</li>
            <li> Glam glow face mask is nice, it makes your skin smooth and gets very clean. However, I do not see it as a miracle cream. It works nice but idk if it is worth them money.</li>
            <li> This is a spendy product, no doubt. See if you can hit up Sephora for a sample first.&lt;br /&gt;But honestly I really like it. For the record, my skin is combination type, and I don&#x27;t have break outs, but I do have blackheads. No, it didn&#x27;t make my pores just disappear, but it did clear them out and reduce the size of them. The smell is a little weird at first, but I didn&#x27;t notice it as much when it was on my face. You can see all the oil in your pores being extracted from your skin, and it&#x27;s kinda cool and gross.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it, and would probably repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying love love love....it does everything it says it&#x27;s suppose to do...it leaves your face feeling smooth, glowing, and amazing...</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this product because she works at a high end spa and this is the product they use on their clients.  It is much cheaper buying it here (I know, it&#x27;s still pricey).  The product is helping clear out my blackheads and I use it once a week.  You do not have to use very much.  I have done 4 treatments and I am probably have used 1/3 of the small bottle.</li>
            <li> I have persistent acne on my face that I make worse by picking at. Picking at so severely that I use lancets and needles to get the job done. However when I have this on my face I obviously can&#x27;t pick but once I rinse it off  I don&#x27;t want/need to. It seems to draw out all the yucky stuff and make my pores seem smaller. I will usually use it Asa spot treatment on a blemish which also stops me from picking at it. The only down side I&#x27;ve seen is the price but in reality with all the other pricey face stuff it&#x27;s not that bad. I have had my 18 yo son use it as well and he loved the results and how soft it made his skin afterwards. I also use Junilla of Sweden Lerosett Spot Treatment/Mask which is very similar in texture and results. Lerosett is cheaper so I use it more often and use the GlamGlow when going to special events and such. It&#x27;s a great product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel afterwards but it does not pull the black heads out like it says. Also the jar is so small for the price. If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive I would use it everyday but it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
            <li> I saw this mask on Pintrest and really wanted to try it. I saw it at Sephora but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on it. Then I found it on Amazon for almost half the price! I had to buy it. I liked this product from the first time I used it. I like the way I could see the mask pulling the dirt and oil from my pores, the more I used it the less &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; came out of my pores. I also liked how this could be used as a spot treatment. I saved the last of the product for a special occasion, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have because the product dried out a bit. Other than that a good product. I will most likely buy again.</li>
            <li> It is a great mask. At least for my skin I need to use it every other week. But over all a great product. The service was excellent and I will definately buy mire from this seller.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not sealed very well and product was partly dried out and clumpy.</li>
            <li> The too dry. Awfully dries skin and adds wrinkles. Bad mask. I think all success only in advertizing.</li>
            <li> I just got a sample from sephora but I had instant results! I wash my face so my pores were big and then applied the mask i could feel it working and you could see holes in the mask from where it unclogged my pores!!!!!!!!!! It is so amazing my skin is more clear and softer after one time!! I will be purchasing this item for sure!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this stuff!  It makes my face feel super clean and fresh.  My pores are refined and fines lines are smoothed out.  I just wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
            <li> Best mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Glamglow itself is an amazing product, but this one was very obviously tampered with. When I got it the lid was open and some of the mask was leaked onto the side of the tub. It was also watered down. I ended up just buying this from Sephora, and was very happy with my results. Just like any other skin treatment, it&#x27;s not going to work a miracle overnight. I have had acne since I was 9, and this little mask pulls out all the gunk in your skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, and glamglow also has a foaming cleanser that you can use daily. I use that and the mask once a week and my acne reduces tremendously and so does the redness of my skin. It took about two weeks of use (one use a week) for me to notice a significant difference.The only downside is that the mask is 70 bucks at sephora. But I would rather pay the money than have acne..besides since I only use it once a week, it lasts about 3 months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! I had researched it a ton before buying it, but was still skeptical that it would live up to the hype. Well, it absolutely does! After the first use my face looked brighter, pores looked tighter, and the pimples I did have were smaller and less red. I am a true believer in this stuff - it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product! It really does work and I use it once a week as my number one facial product.</li>
            <li> I have moderate to severe acne.  For me, this is quite expensive so I just use it on certain spots that pop up and leave it overnight.  Leaving it on overnight is not recommended, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Otherwise, it is also good at shrinking large or noticeable pores.  Love everything about this!  Great seller, better price here than at Sephora!</li>
            <li> I tried it and it didn&#x27;t work as well for me as it did for others. I probably will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product and its so much cheaper here on Amazon than at Sephora! A friend introduced me to this stuff for a wedding I was attending and I&#x27;m so glad I found it. This is like a mud mask on steroids. I will never waste my money again on stuff that you can buy at Target or even at the Department Stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud mask does an amazing job of pull out your black heads, impurities and just making your skin silky smooth. Anytime I use it, I feel like my face is prepped for makeup and my skin always looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend was shocked at the amount of oil and black heads that it pulled out that I caught him using it one time too! Great for girls or guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had read about this stuff on pintrest but was a little unsure. I did not want to pay the price of retail and good ol amazon always finds a better deal. Well this stuff is pretty amazing. Cleans pores like no bodies buisness.</li>
            <li> I have large pores especially on and around my nose. I had become resigned to the fact that I will always suffer from tiny blackheads on my nose. Some products have helped but  there were always some little blackheads still there. I saw glam glow on Pinterest and it looked interesting. Being the product junkie that I am I had the order it. It has an actual muddy consistency but went on fairly smooth. With a thin coat on my T- zone it started to dry very quickly so you must be fast in applying. I noticed that there were distinct holes where my pores are and I could actually feel the gunk being pulled out of my pores. Minuts after the oil was actually visible on the mask. After rinsing with a washcloth the results were amazing. My blackheads are gone! My nose is clear of the tiny blackheads for the first time since puberty. (I am 47) I&#x27;m in love with this product,  though it is very pricy , it is worth every dime. I used it once a week for two weeks only in my problem ares because of the price I use it sparingly but it doesn&#x27;t require much to render amazing results. One of my all time favorite products, highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Nice product with good value.</li>
            <li> I love my glamglow mask. I use 1-2 times a week and my skin is noticeably clearer, smoother, softer. I recommend trying a small free sample from Sephora before purchasing, as I hear it can be too severe for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask. This will help clear your skin and give you a nice flawless great feeling face afterwards. I use it weekly and would say its worth the tag!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and well worth the money. Pore size is reduced, bumps and acne are less noticeable in just a week, and it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for my extra-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After reading raving reviews of this product, I had high hopes. I thought it worked okay, it did reduce some size of pimples and seemed to open up my pores, but it certainly didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34; out blackheads. I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love face masks and have tried a bunch of different kinds. However, I&#x27;ve always been on the lookout for the &#x27;perfect&#x27; clay and mud masks. I believe I&#x27;ve finally found it. For such a pricey item, I only use this on my t-zone and around my cheeks where my pores are larger. If any of you are fascinated by things like pore strips (because of all the icky stuff you can see), then this mask is right up your alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is oily, and all you oily people out there know how hard it can be to maintain it. After the first time I used it, i could see how much clearer my skin was. That amazed me. Masks often take a few times to really start showing results. Not this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see how well this mask drew impurities to the surface, I used a pore strip right after. Typically when I use pore strips, I always feel like they could have done more. Since all the gunk in my pores were pulled to the surface by this mask, that little pore strip removed it all, and yeah, it&#x27;s kinda gross but hey! Just saying how it is! I&#x27;m sure that with a few more uses, this mask would&#x27;ve removed what my pore strips did but why waste the product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone with oily to oily-combination skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen little difference so far my big problem is big pores and blackheads. I see my pores are a little smaller and blackheads look cleaner I know I haven&#x27;t used it for long so will see how it does after more uses.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this face mask. I wanted it to be the answer to my clogged pores. I wanted it to live up to the hype of being the best facial product in the world.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that is just too much pressure to live up to. This facial mask did not give me immediate results of clear, unclogged pores and skin. I have used it twice a week since I bought it in early August. And I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin tone or clarity.&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t aggravate my acne-prone skin either. Which I have to say is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a pricey product to not be in love with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give some advice to anyone who has deeply clogged pores. Using this product does appear to loosen the clogs enough so that if you use one of those pore strips (you know the kind...starts with a B) immediately after the mask you will see some results. Not dramatic. But more gunk on the strip compared to using it alone. Just a tip.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and I. So far we&#x27;ve been pleased with he results. I will buy again I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome at cleaning out pores, you can see where it has pulled out the oil when the mask dries!  I was skeptical about this purchase but I&#x27;m so glad I got it, it&#x27;s working wonders on my combination skin that tends to break out a bit during &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; without making it flakey and overly dry! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different mud masks over the years and this is the only one I&#x27;ll be buying a second time.</li>
            <li> When I got it,, it almost full out</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Really works.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this product after having read all the great reviews. This product is probably fantastic and you would be better off spending the extra money and buying it directly from Sephora to ensure that the product is indeed new. When I received this product, it did not arrive new and was obviously used. Before I opened the box, I noticed that it was resealed with a new sticker on top of the original seal and when I opened the jar there was product already on the outside of the seal. When I removed the seal half the jar was gone and it had finger indents where the product had been removed. I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using the product.</li>
            <li> Did not really clear up my black heads as it said it would do. Make my skin soft though. Not worth the $</li>
            <li> I WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN. How can you sell a product knowing that it has been tampered with. This seal was opened inside the bottle and it looked as if the product had been used, how distasteful.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to the upcoming mask to clear out my skin, however, by the time I opened it, it&#x27;s only half of the container and it dried out already for who knows how long. I don&#x27;t know what should I do with it cuz I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s gonna be the same if I buy it.</li>
            <li> Because it changes color in certain places when it dries, I can tell that it works. However I don&#x27;t really notice a physical difference after using it. It doesn&#x27;t smell pretty and it leaves skin very dry so moisturize after using!</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is a great product!! I have done two full masks two or three days apart, and twice I have used it as a spot treatment. After both masks, my skin was noticeably softer and my trouble spots - around my nose and middle chin - were clearer. A couple of masks made them all but disappear! I use this product as a spot treatment primarily now, in an effort to conserve the mud/cream. It is pricey, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I went in to Sephora once and upon checkout they gave me this sample. When I tried it I absolutely loved it, my face felt smoother, pores were instantly smaller and I had this glow that I never saw before. I absolitely loved it so I forced myself to come here and buy it (even thou it&#x27;s not MUCH cheaper than Sephora once you actually ship it to Canada).. The only downside is that when I opened the packaging before I could take off the lid I could see the product on the outside of it as if it&#x27;s been used even thou it was supposed to be new.. I saw another person had mentioned the same thing with their product. Other than that, i was very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I tend to be very acne prone and I often have a  lot of blackheads, nothing I&#x27;ve tried has ever really helped. This stuff though? This stuff is magic!! I used it for the first time the other night and not only did it leave my skin extremely soft and glowing, it cleared most of the blackheads from my nose and chin! I still can&#x27;t believe how well it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for all the internet hype about something, but this seriously works. I was skeptical but gave it a shot. Let me tell you, it was worth it.  I was amazed at how great my skin looked and other members of my family were begging me to let them use it too! ABSOLUTELY recommend this. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> GlamGlow is amazing! You can see as it works and pulls all the sebum and oils from your pores and really makes your pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been blessed with nice skin, and have always had issues with large pores and a little redness, even despite my best efforts. I use a clarisonic on my face regularly, which definitely helps to keep my skin nice and dry, but doesn&#x27;t seem to help to unclog pores as much as I hoped. I thought I would give Glamglow a try. I used it as soon as I got out of the shower when my pores were nice and open, immediately after I washed my face with the clarisonic. After only one use, and letting it dry for a good 10-15 minutes, the black dots started showing up all over my face. Mine weren&#x27;t as prevalent as I thought I guess because I already take such good care of my face, but when I washed it off I could immediately tell that it did indeed get a good deep down clean inside my pores. I could tell that a lot of the gunk was gone and my pores were already less prevalent. I also noticed that it made my face feel nice and tight, like I had gotten a tiny, tiny face lift. There is a tingle when using it, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable. I can&#x27;t wait to have my friends and family try it out and see how awesome it is. I&#x27;m hooked! And, like everyone else says, this stuff goes a really long way and less is definitely better!</li>
            <li> my skin feels amazing, love this stuff! plus in store its 70$, great deal!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of people recommend this product to me, and it&#x27;s worked wonders for me. Really cleared my face up and it didn&#x27;t take too long either. Good spot treatment too</li>
            <li> Tried a sample at Sephora for first time. Loved it and had to buy more. Leaves skin smooth and pores almost invisible, but cleans them out good.</li>
            <li> I bought this after receiving a sample.  After one use I notices the blackheads were less noticeable and my skin looked and felt better.  The only drawback is that this is a pricey item for 1.2 oz.</li>
            <li> I don;t know what it is but i love how it makes your skin feels smooth and blowy afterwards</li>
            <li> I read about this product for months on various blogs and heard nothing but great things. I finally caved and decided to try it &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s worth every penny and has made my skin pretty flawless!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Feels good and makes you look good. Lasts a long time. A little bit goes a long ways. Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> great product, effective for my acne. great price ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will definitely buy it  again in the future. this white jar, i think is better than the black jar!</li>
            <li> I luv this stuff! U can really see that it is working with all the dots that appear on your face due to pore matrix technology. Once u rinse your face it feels super clean and fresh. I use this 3 x a week and sometimes as a spot treatment when it&#x27;s that time of the month. I&#x27;ve already bought another jar!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you right now this mask is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I do. First I have a shower, and right when I get out, when my pores are still open, apply a VERY thin layer of the glamglow. I leave it on for only 15 minutes, at which point I remove it. I have to stress, you dont need to use a lot of this. You really dont. A little goes a long way. After that, I apply a small amount of [[ASIN:B00L3KEIZO NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream]] under my eyes, and a few dots on the rest of my face. I rub that in gently. You could use a generic moisturizer but I have found it doesnt work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll have amazing skin. Ive been doing this for about four weeks and everyone asks me what im doing which is why im sharing it here. its crazy the difference in quality there are between skincare products. Glamglow is on the top of my list, and I love that you can SEE the dirt coming right out of your pores!</li>
            <li> The product was a little bit dry. There were some dry chunks within the super mud. Seemed like it had been used also...</li>
            <li> I use glam glow then I use a biore strip right after and it works great! I only use this for blackheads.... And I love it. Tried a knockoff and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good. It&#x27;s worth the cash</li>
            <li> I love this product. Ive been wanting it for a while. I use it about once every other week. it keeps my pores looking small and keeps the black heads away. I do wish it came in a larger size though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny!! Sucks the grime out of ur pores</li>
            <li> I received the jar and it looked almost used, with mud on the outside and half empty. I gave it a chance for 2 weeks and this product actually made my skin A LOT worse, did not help with blackheads or troubled skin. I had high expectations after reading all the great reviews and was truly disappointed. I recommend the Aztec Healing Clay on amazon which is less expensive and gives you results from the first use.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes my skin SO soft and it has an amazing texture.</li>
            <li> I purchased the white glamglow here, because it was the cheapest I could find it. I&#x27;ve tried both the white glamglow and the black one, and honestly, I like the black one better. The white dries out my face just a little too much. Still like it though.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it promises and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed an immediate difference with my skin and continuous improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been the best I&#x27;ve come across in years and definitely in my top 5. It&#x27;s completely won me over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Glamglow for this amazing creation</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how wonderful this is! My teenage daughter has battled acne for 3 years now and if there is a product out there for acne we have tried it including prescriptions from the dermatologist.  Some would work for a few weeks but it always came back. This mask is giving her consistent results.  Her face is so much better, and softer. I&#x27;m so thankful amazon had this because I was going to pay $70 for it on a beauty website.  You cannot beat the price or the results!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. The price is right and the product works. It draws out blemishes and lets you know problem areas. A little does go a long way as well. I am considering the moisturizing one now.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises--my skin is definitely clearer and softer after use--but it smells AWFUL. Like rotten mud or dog poop. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a spoiled product because it came through a 3rd party vendor (although it wasn&#x27;t opened), or if I&#x27;m just not getting the &#x27;amazing smell&#x27; that everyone has been claiming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can stand it, though, it does a decent job of clearing up the face.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well on my face, probably would work better on someone with a less oily face. I liked how it felt afterwards and how it worked on whiteheads</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but it definitely works.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! (So does my husband) we have no complaints. Use it only as needed, not routine. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> OMG! I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this stuff - it&#x27;s fantastic. I&#x27;ve fought uneven/blotchy skin my whole life and this has smoothed my skin and skin tone. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product arrived just in time.  A breakout erupted on my cheek the night before.  I used this mask two nights in a row. The breakout is SIGNIFICANTLY less.  Easy to apply, dries quickly and my skin felt smooth and not dried out as other clay masks tend to make it feel.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I like white mud better than black. I got trouble and combination skin type, I feel good after using it, it helps clean pretty well.</li>
            <li> ordered 2 times only to get one that was dried out and the other one looked like it was used!</li>
            <li> Works just as it said it would. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearing ... not a whole lot more than others I&#x27;ve used but what makes this one special is the tightness that it gives your face along with a glow</li>
            <li> Great product just wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice mask but I don&#x27;t see the difference between that and a drugstore brand like neutrogena.</li>
            <li> USED.  I am returning this product.  It is gross and unsanitary to sell used cosmetics.  The package was open and dried mud was on the outside of the jar.  Going to sephora for the real deal.</li>
            <li> both items were leaking when received</li>
            <li> works well leaving my face smooth and refreshed with smaller pores.i wish it was bigger though! overall very pleased. cant wait to try the others</li>
            <li> I highly recommend not buying this from amazon and saving you&#x27;re money to get it from Sephora. I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and I first bought it from Sephora. The one from Sephora was incredible, it cleared my face right up. I bought it from amazon and it&#x27;s horrible. I received it on time but when I opened it it looked like someone had already used it. It didn&#x27;t help my face at all. The seller said if I sent it back to them I would get a full refund and I sent it back but still haven&#x27;t received the refund.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my skin and made me break out worse. I was expecting something great from all the reviews I read, and this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> love the product have been using it once a week and my skin is looking lovely and no breakouts. Great product</li>
            <li> A friend shared with me and I loved it....Had to tell my girls!  It just makes your skin feel so clean and toned and refreshed.  I have to tell my husband to stop touching my face.  Ha ha  So, needless to say, he loves it too.  All I can say is...you have to try it and if you don&#x27;t like it, can I have it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews that they thought their jar had been tampered with and the seal was broken, I took extra close look at mine when it came in the mail and everything was sealed and intact. AND the mask is amazing! I could feel it working as soon as I put it on and within minutes I could SEE the spots in the mask where it was cleaning out my pores. I&#x27;ve always had horrible blackheads on my nose that have been impossible to get rid of and the pore strips have never worked. After just one use of the Glamglow mask I can see such a difference already!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel nice and smooth when I use it. It smells slightly minty. I didn&#x27;t think it worked that well at clearing up any acne, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in pore size either.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY not worth the price! This mask does nothing special or different than any other cheap-o clay/mud mask out there. I don&#x27;t know why there are rave reviews for this item. It&#x27;s just a basic mud mask that may help w/ pore congestion...like any other mask. Don&#x27;t spend your money on this unnecessarily pricey item!</li>
            <li> This product really cleans out your pores! My face feels super clean after applying and rinsing, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My skin is nice and soft. Love the product.</li>
            <li> This does wonders on your skin and is completely natural. It literally made my skin glow</li>
            <li> I expected more from this product. but this is just a cosmetic clay. go to the Russian drug store and buy there powder cosmetic clay. it is the same, but you pay for this powder is much cheaper for more volume than this little jar of expensive&gt; or it is a fake because it does not look like new and the packaging has been opened.</li>
            <li> Overrated in my opinion</li>
            <li> Only used it twice, so havent noticed any major changes... but my skin does feel and look softer afterwards!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff the bottle is small but it still goes a long way. I don&#x27;t have to use it every night just once or twice a week and it makes my skin feel super clean.</li>
            <li> The missus loves it to death and swears by it. Who am I to argue?</li>
            <li> Just like the title says it will make you glow! As it tightens you see dark spots were the oil is drawn out. This is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve come along in my career of cosmetology.&lt;br /&gt;After using it every 3 days or so for a month I saw an over all improvement in my skin color and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret trying this mask!</li>
            <li> On the very first use I noticed change in my face I am 21 years old and used it in my t zone . All those black heads around my nose? DISAPPEARED</li>
            <li> This product really helps with my acne. I only use it maybe once or twice a month or whenever my acne flares up and I see clearer skin almost instantly. I will surely repurchase this!</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews FIRST: this product was previously OPENED, with interior seal BROKEN.  I&#x27;ve purchased product ffrom Sephora previously-- seel tight and unbroken. The product itself looks as though it may have been previously used, possibly as a SAMPLE jar?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have contacted seller.  I&#x27;ll report back concerning seller&#x27;s actions.</li>
            <li> The second time ordering from Amazon.. First time no issues with product this time around product had been opened</li>
            <li> Works pretty darn good, makes your skin soft and clears out your pores. Just doesn&#x27;t get to the pores you want it to get to. Just like the biore strips. but overall its a really great product to help clear your skin, and make your face tighter.</li>
            <li> Really good! Cleans the skin and tone it</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I have used this glamglow mask several times from Sephora samples and from friends, and it has been incredible for my skin.  The product I was sent, however, was most definitely not it.  The packaging and consistency/texture of the product all seemed to be the same, but the product itself is nowhere near as good as the real glamglow mask.  I suppose that&#x27;s what you get for only paying half the retail price, but I was still sorely disappointed to see no result from a product I&#x27;ve previously had so much success with.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this product!! You know how a lot of masks make your face feel tight for about 30 minutes after and it&#x27;s just unpleasant?  NOPE! This certainly tightens your pores but not in an uncomfortable way.  My pores are so much smaller after using this and after repeated use, I can see a difference in my skin.  The only bummer is that my face is so smooth afterward, I just want to keep touching it but that would defeat the purpose!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product! So much cheaper than in the store and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims to keep my acne under controll</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Higly recommended&lt;br /&gt;Just a little bit small</li>
            <li> way too expensive for the amount in there and i think it had more twigs in there than needed.</li>
            <li> this product was not authentic I got the same mask from somewhere that I know sells original and I could easily tell it was fake ,I would like to return and get my money back</li>
            <li> i used it once and I can not judge it well, but I felt shade of debut</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Makes my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Great mask and great price on amazon</li>
            <li> Works as well as other reviews said it would! Product was exactly what I expected. Will definitely continue buying this.</li>
            <li> It will shrink your pores in one application. Noticeable difference. Skim will look smoother. \&lt;br /&gt;You will love this product.</li>
            <li> I get really bad hormonal-induced cystic acne and upon using this mask my breakouts tend to disappear more quickly than with BP or even retain-a.  I also steam my face for about 15 minutes prior to using this mask.  The great thing is that you could use this as a spot treatment as well. I think this stuff, while pricey, is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a slight problems being a teenager and she sparingly uses this product and works great.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My skin is bright and clear!</li>
            <li> Love love this mask!! It is an authentic product! Came sealed and looked and worked like the glam glow you would buy at sephora! A def must have in my skin treatments!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I try lots of beauty products and rarely am impressed enough to purchase a second jar of anything.  This is my second jar of this. Having paid full price elsewhere the first time, I was very happy to find it for less on amazon.com.  I read a few reviews that some seemed jars seemed used.  My jar was sealed with foil and the outer packaging was also sealed.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.  I like how it feels right after I use it.  You do have to use it a few times a week to maintain the results.</li>
            <li> New favorite beauty product!!</li>
            <li> This product was NOT sealed and it was dried out.  Unfortunately I missed the return deadline by one day.</li>
            <li> Still trying it out, I can&#x27;t tell yet if I like it or not.</li>
            <li> Miracle cure for those mornings after you sleep in your makeup.  I also use this as an &amp;#34;overnight&amp;#34; treatment and it reveals an even toned and soft complexion. If you use the full face application as opposed to the spot treatment option it runs out very quickly. A little pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant buying this product simply because of the price. I am so glad I did. I have been using it for the last three days on my problem areas, and I can&#x27;t believe the improvement I have seen. Yes, my pores are diminished, but more importantly, my breakouts are gone. I hate hearing the term &amp;#34;Holy grail product&amp;#34;, but that was before using a product this amazing. So far, I experienced any dryness, but again, I only have used on my problem areas. I will repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift. She loved it and apparently her husband does too. Much better price then other retailers. Came in on time and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t see the diffrenton my skin when using this</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It evens out my skin tone and gets rid of the little zits I get on my chin. Truthfully, it doesn&#x27;t last long, but it is totally worth the cost to keep getting it. I alternate between using this and the Glamglow exfoliating mask. Definitely recommend both products.</li>
            <li> I saw both good reviews on Amazon as well as Sephora but this product was cheaper on Amazon (about $10 cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can actually see the mask picking up the oil from your pores. As it says on the packaging \\&quot;Pore-Matrix will reveal dots of vacuum extractions, absorption &amp; encapsulation of sebum oils, bacteria &amp; toxins.\\&quot; SO TRUE! All along my t-zone area, which is the oiliest on my face, there were lighter dots where the oil was being sucked up. As time went on, the dots became larger, which showed the mask was doing it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing off the mask, my skin was super clean and soft. I applied my usual moisturizer and usually my face becomes super shiny after an hour but after using this product, my face was not super shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend and I will be purchasing again when I run out. The size of the product is a lot smaller than I imagined but if you use sparingly, it should lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was very surprised to like this as much as I did. I figured it was truly more hype than anything, but this really works well! After the very first use I noticed a difference in my skin. I break out fairly easily so a new product is always a little unnerving, but this helped clear my skin really quickly. I highly recommend trying this for anyone that has even considered it. I think you&#x27;ll be very pleased!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! When someone else compliments your skin you know a product works.</li>
            <li> Works super fast and brings blackheads to the surface!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! I use this every Saturday night and it seems to improve my skin greatly. It helps pull all the gunk out of the pores from a week of make-up and everyday stuff. I completely recommend this for every woman to have in their skin care routine. Plus when you open it the packaging says &amp;#34;Hello sexy!&amp;#34;  and who doesn&#x27;t need that every now and again?</li>
            <li> This mask really does have some sort of \\&quot;vacuum action\\&quot; that sucks all the gunk and grime out of my pores. I use it both as a mask and as a spot treatment (it is especially effective when I get pesky breakouts during that time of the month). It really is the real thing, as I had purchased this previously at a beauty department store. Worth it!</li>
            <li> I would say the product is okay. It is a good mask. Compared to borghese&#x60;s fango, this one is more gentle, and as fresh and clean as&lt;br /&gt;fango did.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the product is absolutely USED, the seal tape was opened before I did so. And cake left around the lid. It is some kind of disgusting, for you never know what happened before you have this in your hand. Anyway, I will never buy any product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t really make my skin appear any different. I&#x27;m glad I bought it on Amazon instead of paying full price for it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I really like....but...it does dry out my face A LOT which causes more oil production...but does help with black heads. So I&#x27;ll take it! However when I opened my jar it was already crusted over...? Not sure if it was opened before?</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic because of the price of the product but I bought a jar anyways and let me tell you, it does make your skin look gorgeous! Not only did it make my skin brighter and tighter, it has helped tremendously with my acne and dark marks. This is worth the price! It is simply fabulous!</li>
            <li> I used it twice and it dried out</li>
            <li> I love it!! but too expensive :)</li>
            <li> Small jar for a big box, but does seem to work. My mud is slightly clumpy which is my only hesitation for a 5 star (maybe that&#x27;s how it is suppose to be?). However, it has delivered improved skin texture and slight improvement in pore size as it claims.</li>
            <li> I find this is better at cleaning out my pores than any other mask I&#x27;ve tried, including skinceuticals clay masque.  Especially if I use a pore strip right after I take the mask off-It worked almost as well as having an esthetician do extractions, which is much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Just in case anybody is wondering based on previous reviews, the product sold by Salon N Body Warehouse is completely legit. Everything came sealed and was fresh. I ordered some samples from the Glam Glow website and the consistency of that product matched the product being sold by Salon N Body Warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not sold on this product, I&#x27;d recommend ordering samples from their site. It has worked really well for me. I&#x27;ve never had a mask actually make my skin glow once it&#x27;s removed like this one.</li>
            <li> Just to clarify, the Glam Glow mask itself, hands down 5 stars.  You just can&#x27;t order it here on Amazon because the product you receive has already been used, which is gross.  After receiving a pre-opened, pre-used product, I drove my butt to Sephora and bought one at full price.  The product itself is AMAZING.  Use this in tandem with a Biore pore strip, and you&#x27;ll see immediate results.  Fabulous face mask, worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I&#x27;ve attached three pictures of the version I received from Amazon.  The outer box, you can see the round factory seal sticker (it&#x27;s clear) with a piece of clear scotch tape on top.  That should have been my first red flag.  The inner packaging (the paper holding the jar in place) was torn so the jar just kind of rattled around in there, and there are two instructional brochure things that were supposed to be there that were missing.  The new version (from Sephora) is packaged so tightly you have to rip the paper to get to the jar, but that part has clearly already been done for me.  I also included a picture of what was under the lid of my jar.  There should be a foil safety seal, sealing your product and keeping it clean and moist.  The picture is just the way I received it, with product smeared along the lid, as if someone already used it and wiped it off their fingers.  This dinky little plastic disc is NOT a factory seal, and the new products don&#x27;t even come with that little disc.  That&#x27;s something they added on, out of the goodness of their hearts I guess.  /sarcasm/  I also have a picture of my (brand new from Sephora) jar, showing what the seal should look like.  Please please do not use a product that was already opened, unless you want to risk breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed in the misrepresentation of this item.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, a new, unopened jar of Glam Glow is my new favorite skin care item.  You just can&#x27;t get that here.</li>
            <li> Love Glam Glow. Shipping was quick. Product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Make your skin feel like silk. The product is very good. I will definitely get it again . I love this mask. You don&#x27;t need a lot on your face.</li>
            <li> You will not regret buying this product. It&#x27;s great. The first day it got here (and shipping was fast) my husband and I both tried it. And when you put it on it hardens like a regular mud mask. As it dries you start to see little brackish Brown oily spots start to appear mine were pretty tiny, so I had to look kind of close. My husband&#x27;s on the other hand were very noticeable, mostly where he shaves and gets razor bumps. We left it on about 8min. When we washed it of our pores were noticeably smaller, skin smother and tighter, and you have a little bit of a glow! I love it.(I also washed my faces before and after using this product and put moisturizer on after.)</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have had a bad couple months with acne. I was hoping that it would be a miracle mask. I don&#x27;t think its a miracle mask but it did seriously help my skin. It been two weeks of using it every couple days and its turning my skin back to its original bright and beautiful self. It is very drying but I just compensate the dryness with some oil on the face and it evens it out. I would definitely recommend this product!! Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I liked this item well enough to order more.&lt;br /&gt;It is an awesome mask. You can actually SEE the oil being pulled out of your pours.  It did NOT dry my skin out. I suffer with moderate acne and it did help with normal break outs. Other than that, I did not notice a ginormous difference in my skins discoloring, size of my pores, etc. But there was a definite decrease in my break outs, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> So nice to buy something that lives up to the hype.  My daughter and I both love this stuff.  Nice mask that is really refreshing.  My daughter loves it for acne control.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though, you don&#x27;t get a lot of product for your money. That is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now. This is a staple product, I will never go without! Glamglow Super Mud is a real treat! My skin is combination- EXTREME. I have severe dry patches under my nose &amp; between my eyebrows, and I have cystic acne on my chin. Since using this product regularly my cystic acne is FAR less. I try to use it about once a week on my trouble spots (chin &amp; nose). G.G. mask feels like it gets under my pores &amp; really fights off any of that icky build up. I am a believer in this product. I paid $69 at Sephora for it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the hype</li>
            <li> great for clearing up your face from unwanted dirt and blemishes</li>
            <li> My face always feel super clean after I use it, but once I take the mask off I still feel like my pores are clogged.</li>
            <li> I like the way if feels on my skin. My skin does feel softer afterwards. I did break out a little after the first use and each time I use it the break outs are smaller. With more use I&#x27;ll determine if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll continue to use. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff- this really does what it says it will do. It gets rid of the gunk in your pores.  Smells like black licorice, which is not unpleasant for me who really hates black licorice.  I would buy again and keep using.</li>
            <li> I didnt give it 5 stars because it is pricey and it is small. The product is neat, rocky, very different that any other mask I&#x27;ve done. The mud is wet; depending on how much you lather on the mud dries within 7-15min. The feeling afterwards is CLEAN &amp; FRESH. It did not dry my face. I love the feeling and look of my face afterward.</li>
            <li> AS OF YET, NO SUFFICIENT RESULTS SEEN; HOWEVER, FOUND ORGANIC MUD MASK IN BAG FOR A  LOT LESS THAN THIS.&lt;br /&gt;A LESSON WELL LEARNED; ALL THIS ADVERTISED TO PROMOTE SUCH EXTRAVAGANT RESULTS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE.&lt;br /&gt;CONSIDER THE CHEAPER MUD MASK........BETTER CHOICE AND MORE FOR  THE $$; YOU CAN HOLD THIS JAR IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND AND WASN&#x27;T WORTH THE $50!!!&lt;br /&gt;BAD CHOICE ON MY PART!!!!</li>
            <li> i love it. i was iffy about buying it on-line but it works great! I would recomend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This mask does everything it says it does. It literally pulls the JUNK out from your pores and shrinks your pores right up. I noticed a difference the first time I used it, but after the second and third time I was even more impressed. I have oily skin and pretty large pores, and this mask works for me. I also put some on a big open pore of my husband&#x27;s where we can usually squeeze out a big blackhead about every other day. After 2 applications of this stuff, the pore on his face is almost invisible now. WORTH EVERY PENNY! When I run out, I will definitely be buying more. Amazon is also cheaper than the Glam Glow site and Sephora&#x27;s site! You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this mask...</li>
            <li> I have been searching for YEARS what could possibly help my horrible skin?!!!! I kid you not this stuff is amazing and strange!&lt;br /&gt;It almost looked like tar when I opened the jar for the first time. But it dries pretty quick and I live in the humid south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what makes it work but I saw instant results. I bought here versus Sephora because of the cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use nightly or if I don&#x27;t have as much time I do spot treatments.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking my skin would undergo a miracle transformation, leaving me with a glowing complexion after just one use! Ok, not really but I did expect it to make a noticeable difference after several uses and I&#x27;m afraid I didn&#x27;t really see that. My face did feel quite clean even after just the first use, but my skin also felt very tight and I felt like I needed to moisturize immediately to relieve that sensation. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, but I think the regular ol&#x27; masks I&#x27;ve bought for years at the drug store for 5 bucks do just as good a job. I would not purchase again simply because this is a high price when I feel like there are many equally effective products available for so much less. I had hoped to see significantly diminished blackheads around my nose and truthfully, I can&#x27;t really see that there is any difference in that respect at all. I will say that I do believe my skin was less oily midway thru the day for a day or two after using the mask, but I see the same results with the lesser priced clay/mud masks, too. My own opinion is save yourself some bucks and stick with the products that cost less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive and the jar is tiny, but they allege you can get 1,000 uses out of it.  My fiancee was happy with it, so if you&#x27;re looking for that beauty product that your S.O. might not buy for themselves but would appreciate as a gift, try this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product! You can actually see the grease being pulled out if your skin. After using it, my face always feels clean and my skin feels tight. The pores are visibly smaller than before using it. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> there is a weird smell but easy to ignore once you see how deep it cleans. I reccomend this product for anyone trying to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to read such rave reviews!  Disappointed because it just doesn&#x27;t work the way the reviews and company claim. Big let down for my skin type. I have used as a spot treatment and full mask. I feel that I broke out more after using it. :(.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but this one is the best by far.  These product was more than expected &amp; I would highly recommend to others (and I do)!</li>
            <li> Pricey mud clearing treatment that does not work. Did not de-clog pores as stated in description. Maybe product was old? Very disappointing. Would not waste money on this.</li>
            <li> I heard amazing things about GlamGlow and they are all true. Your face feels so smooth afterwards, and it&#x27;s just an awesome mask to watch work.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Dries pesky overnight pimples. My sister loves it too. It is the only product that has given her results.</li>
            <li> Although I like this product, it isn&#x27;t the miracle I was looking for. I did notice a difference in my pores, but the blackheads didn&#x27;t seem to actually go away, they were back the next day.</li>
            <li> this is the best mud I have ever used! First use for 20min and my skin is clear and smooth!!</li>
            <li> This product did not clear or reduce my pores as I was hoping for and as I had read in other reviews.  I did see it \\&quot;working\\&quot; as in I could see spots on the dried mask but it didn&#x27;t make any difference on my face once it was washed off.  On another note I didn&#x27;t find the smell bad as other people had mentioned.  I will use the rest of the container but I definitely won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed fine until I opened it and tried to use it but it was clumpy,like it had been an old or poorly made product.</li>
            <li> This is such a cool mask! I love looking at my pores after I&#x27;ve had it on for awhile. My skin feels fresh after I wash it off. A little spendy for the amount that you get though.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  Yes, it did leave my face nice and smooth.  But as far as removing blackheads, a lousy investment.  My husband and I used this product as a face mask.  Saw no removal of blackheads in the days aftwards.  My husband used a Biore blackhead strip, saw so much more of a result from the strip that this treatment (and much cheaper too!).  Definately will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Honestly it wash about the same as any mud mask except it smelt like licorice. Not really worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had really good results with this product so far.  I hope it continues to improve her complexion.  Of course I would love to see a price reduction, who wouldn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this when I read about it online.  The thought of something absorbing the [insert grossness here] out of my pores was so cool!  But when it comes down to it, GlamGlow is just an overpriced mud mask.  It does leave your skin feeling nice and smooth (like any other mud mask would do), but it doesn&#x27;t pull anything from your pores.  I think it&#x27;s just some sort of chemical reaction that makes the black dots form.  Sadly it&#x27;s not the miracle mask we were all hoping for.  Speaking of chemicals, I&#x27;ve read elsewhere that the ingredients in this really aren&#x27;t great for your skin. So if you&#x27;re looking for something natural this is not the mask for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated this 3 stars because it does leave your skin feeling nice, but it&#x27;s so ridiculously overpriced I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.  GlamGlow is a little too proud of themselves.</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin treatment.  Look no further.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use this a couple times a week and sometimes will just use it as spot treatment. It definitely cleans and exfoliates my skin, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a drastic reduction in my blackheads, although I remain hopeful. Even though I haven&#x27;t seen wonderful results, I love the smell and process of using this product so much that I&#x27;ll probably try more glamglow products hehe</li>
            <li> GlamGlow is the most amazing clearing treatment I have ever had! I used to always be buying new cremes and washes trying to clear up my acne, but now, I just use GlamGlow! It makes your skin clear, and brighter to, as in even skin tone. After you use it you can literally see the immediate difference and your face feels so smooth! Yes, it&#x27;s a bummer you only get 1.2 ounces, however I have had mine for a year and still have half  left. When you start using it, it works. So you begin to use it less and less and that&#x27;s why it lasts so long. My sister and I both bought it off amazon and it came in perfect quality. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Not the miracle blackhead extractor people promised it to be. It left my face feeling very soft but there are lots of projects that can do that.</li>
            <li> After reading the hype surrounding this product, I really thought it was going to be a little jar of magic that would literally fix any imperfection in my skin. While it works well as a face mask, a lot of the hype is just hype. I noticed a firmer feeling in my face after using this, but as for miraculously making blackheads disappear, I thought it was lacking. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My baby sister recommended this product to me and I received another Glamglow sample via Ipsy so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using the mask about every third day for a few weeks and my skin does look very nice. Haven&#x27;t had any unsightly breakouts and you can definitely feel the mask working as it dries. It rinses nicely but I always follow with a toner to be sure. Overall, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a revolutionary product... I&#x27;d probably pay Amazon prices for it again, but not Sephora&#x27;s. If you&#x27;re looking for something similar that is inexpensive, try the mint julep masque from Queen Helene that you can get at Walgreens for like $6. If that doesn&#x27;t do it for you, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you have acne. It does work by getting rid of acne, but does not clear blackheads. I have a lot of blackheads on my nose and it will not remove them. You can actually see all the spots where it is removing oil. I apply it every night after I shower. I only put it on my nose and cheeks because that is where my problem is. It does make your skin really smooth. It does not have a bad smell like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product did make my skin feel nice. But, unfortunately it did nothing for my blackheads. Also, made my regular pimples get bigger. I did contact GlamGlow, but they won&#x27;t stand by their product unless you buy directly from them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Glam Glow for several months now. I like how it works on the blackheads I get on my nose. I don&#x27;t notice much improvement when I put it on breakouts though.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.....makes my skin amazing :) It makes my skin feel like I had a facial.....A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from Sephora before and loved it. Do not purchase it from this seller. The item had already clearly been opened, and possibly used. In fact, there was only about half as much product in the jar as there was supposed to be! This really is a wonderful product, in general and is great at minimizing pores and clearing up blackheads. Just be sure to buy it from another seller or at a beauty supply store!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I have some patchy areas with darker spots on it and this product is totally taking them away. The large pores on my nose are shrinking.  The chin acne that I&#x27;ve never been able to fully clear up as an adult is clearing. My skin is getting back the youthful glow that I had in my twenties.  I will be purchasing more when needed.  I&#x27;ve only done 2 &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; treatments and the rest are spot treatments. I can&#x27;t say enough about it!</li>
            <li> This product works so well!, I am absolutely in love. Clears all my blemishes and blackheads. One of the most amazing clarifying masks! shipping was also really fast and affordable to Australia!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I ordered this product, with all the great reviews. It just got delivered and I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it and try it. I opened the box and I was very disappointed... It looks used there was mask on the out side of the container and around the lid. I&#x27;m scared to even use it....</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. It makes my skin glow noticeably. I will continue to use this product, it is soft and light yet effective. I have been threw many products, this one I actually like.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It has helped clear up my skin and give it a nice radiant glow.  I wish it was cheaper so I could use it more frequently.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin I use it two times a week and it keeps the oil at a minimum and it&#x27;s helped my skin clear up. I have problem skin nothing seemed to help until I got this.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price but it works so well that I had to buy it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a product I don&#x27;t want to go without, I&#x27;ve never had skin so smooth and clear!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face nice and soft, my pores appear smaller and it gives me a fresh face feeling. I thought the jar was very small when I opened the box, but a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to taking care of problems immediately. Thiscis too expensive and not worth the hype or the price for such a small amount. The fancy packaging doesn&#x27;t make up for it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the messier facial products I have used.  It works well though and brings all impurities right to your skin&#x27;s surface.  Pimples or blotchiness after is common apparently.</li>
            <li> I feel like this mask is giving me an instant face lift! Not only that, but it has REALLY cleared up my face in just three uses.. (every other day) I will definitely buy again and recommend  this product!</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product but when it came the lid has product caked all over it as if it had been previously opened. I took a picture of it and can&#x27;t believe this is a product amazon would even allow to be shipped. Based on this experience alone, I probably will not be purchasing from amazon for quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love the product. Used it all over the first 3 nights and noticed that I broke out a little more (which is expected)...however after 4 days my face appears clearer and honestly, less oily throughout the day. Now, I just use it sparingly for overnight spot treatments.</li>
            <li> Great product. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for about 3 weeks now, putting it on 2x a week. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my pores or breakouts due to using the product. It is neat the way your skin looks with the mask on, but I think the price is too high!</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this was going to be a waist of money. I&#x27;ve tried for years to find the perfect product for those pesky blackheads. Well, my mind is blown. I would buy this again, and I won&#x27;t regret it. 😍</li>
            <li> Wow!  My teenage daughter was having an issue with breaking out on her chin and nose. She went into Sephora and asked them if they had any recommendations. The sales person let her try Glamglow right in the store. Within 2 days - no trace of any pimples. I love the product too!  We both use it alt least twice a week.  It has reduced the size of my pores. Nice!  Ordering from Amazon saved me $20.</li>
            <li> So I bought this for a friend and I&#x27;ll admit her face looks much smoother, tone... it looks good. I&#x27;ll also say she complained about her skin being sensitive to most products and since using GlamGlow, zero complaints.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing &amp; works wonders for the skin. I was excited to receive the product, however, it had no plastic wrap on top, no seal on the jar, half of the product was missing &amp; there were black fingerprints on the bottle. Pretty ridiculous. Shipping this back ASAP. I would rather pay the extra money &amp; get the correct item. Also, the product smelled terrible. Not like the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up 2 jars and noticed my black &amp; whiteheads are still there on my face. The mud only showed up all the black &amp; whiteheads when it dries up but it DOESN&#x27;T completely remove them at all. I always end up pop/squeeze out my black &amp; whiteheads myself to get them out. This product is expensive &amp; a waste of money &amp; time using it when they just DON&#x27;T WORK AT ALL!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It really helps to draw out blackheads and dries and shrinks any current blemishes. I&#x27;ve used it as an all over mask as well as a spot treatment and it works wonders. It&#x27;s definitely pricey, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I have sensitive skin and if you do I recommend only using it once a week. Otherwise it might cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been debating for almost a year on whether to spend the money on GlamGlow products because my thoughts were, &amp;#34;how could this mud mask be that much different than something that&#x27;s a lot less expensive? They probably do the same thing.&amp;#34; Boy was I wrong. I have only used this mask once, right when it came in the mail and it really seemed to improve the vibrance of my skin and make my (recently more noticeable) pores appear smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I want to give it more time to see how the clearing effects work with my skin. I have naturally very dry and sensitive skin, with some stubborn areas that I break out in, but this mask felt very refreshing. It does have a tingle similar to what you feel with products that have mint in them, but it was not irritating. I will buy this product, along with other GlamGlow products again and again.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than anywhere else. A little bit goes a long way. It makes skin so soft. It came package in a regular glam glow box, I would recommend to anyone who is interested in buying this product.</li>
            <li> Pulls out all the gunk out. Nice for oily people I think since its a bit drying.</li>
            <li> Works great on black heads,  leaves the skin feeling smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much for pimples. Jar doesn&#x27;t last very long if you are doing your whole face. Highly recommend for black heads.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I researched a lot in order to find a product that would get rid of my black heads. I have larger pores and it takes a lot of work to keep them clean. I use this on my nose and chin only. I LOVE IT. The first time I got it, I used it all over my face, but I realized it wasn&#x27;t necessary. It is a little container, so I figured I would use this on the bad stuff only.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product! I can see what all the hype is about it. It took two treatments so far to really penetrate the blackheads I had on my nose. I am Irish-Italian and have pretty oily skin. I have always had an issue with my t-zone and trying to combat the blackheads on my nose have been a constant war. This product certainly holds up and does far above what I expected. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it continues to make my skin glow! :)</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money and actually works!  It helped clear up my breakouts and I now use it for spot treatment.  One container lasted 3 months for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Sept 25, 2014 and got it today Sept 26, 2014 so the fast shipping is a plus. Overall I am in LOVE with GLAMGLOW!! Always have and always will. I cant explain what it does for your skin. Lets just say all the hype is true but then again it may not be all that great to other people. Everyone has different skin types so it works differently. Im verrrrry oily and so far your able to see all the oils and dirt being sucked out of your pores. I am huge on actually seeing results working instantly and it WORKS! Although i have only had it for a couple hours I have tried this for a few months now. How? I went to each Sephora in my area and asked for samples lol yeah I know but hey gotta do whatcha gotta do ;) Anyway off subject now.... THE REASON WHY I GAVE THIS A 3 STAR is because my product was tampered with. I opened the tape sealing and noticed that there was a smaller sticker covered by this tape but I ignored it. When i opened it the back of the product was facing front.. yes i know it could of shifted buuut when i opened the actual container the product was all over the rim and you can totally tell it was open. To me it looked half full and idk if its just me but yeah no it was used. So it suckks sooo bad but wtevr I just know now that I WILL NOT be purchasing this item from Amazon anymore. Strictly going to purchase this at Sephora and open it for the very first time by ME! Ugh....</li>
            <li> I really looooved this product,, Its super great I felt that my skin really glowing and all problems solved :D</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this product because of all the bad reviews. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t work on certain skin types, or people just have really high standards. Cause I love it!!! I decided to get a sample from sephora and I will definitely be buying it. (Next paycheck)</li>
            <li> This is a great product and when comparing prices you really can&#x27;t beat this! I&#x27;ve had mine for several months and I am just now scraping the bottom. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product (GlamGlow) was older and showing it&#x27;s shelf life, or it was out in the cold winter weather too long before I got home to take it inside, or maybe this is how the product was ment to be--lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the visual results, but have to be care when applying due to the harden chuncks.</li>
            <li> All around amazing product! Really makes skin glow and look soft!! Best mud mask ever!! This is Definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Simply put: wonder product.</li>
            <li> I tried the product several times, and did not see any results. I still saw the same blackheads that were there before I used the product. I was so hopeful.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great, my face felt so clean and soft after using, this was the best price i could find and i would buy it again</li>
            <li> This worked for me like any other mask.It didn&#x27;t reduce my pores or make a difference in my complexion at all. Very disappointed especially for the price!! I would give it two or three stars but it won&#x27;t let me change it above</li>
            <li> After just one use, my skin felt smoother. After a week and 3 uses, my skin is less oily throughout the day. Definitely worth the splurge!!</li>
            <li> Glam glow seems to be a decent product, next time I will be purchasing it from Sephora only! I received my glam glow in the product box that was not sealed with plastic on the outside. Inside, the container that holds the mud looked like it had obviously been opened and used. There was residue around the rim of the jar and the product was not filled to the brim.</li>
            <li> My skin was very smooth after using the mask, but I didn&#x27;t really see the oils being &amp;#34;sucked&amp;#34; out of my skin as I&#x27;ve seen this product advertised.</li>
            <li> this is the same stuff i get from online sephora and its great!</li>
            <li> You know, the product wasn&#x27;t as a great as I expected. Save your money and look up a home-remedy on pinterest.</li>
            <li> be careful when ordering this online.  would have given it 5 stars had it not come opened, used and partially dried out.</li>
            <li> Amazing how this product has gotten rid of my blackheads love love love it. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this product</li>
            <li> I would probably rate this higher if it was less expensive. It&#x27;s a relatively small jar for a relatively steep price, though I did appreciate the ego boost (the packaging greeted me with &amp;#34;Hello Sexy&amp;#34; when I opened it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the effectiveness, I&#x27;ve found that there is absolutely NO results whatsoever on zits. It does appear to be pulling some oil from my blackheads, and I do get some sort of sick satisfaction out of seeing that. It&#x27;s does not, however, seem to be pulling the blackheads themselves out. They are just as prevalent and visible as always... I had some of the &amp;#34;oil spots&amp;#34; in places on my cheeks and forehead that I did not expect, and I almost feel as if those pores are MORE visible than before, though that may be just because the mask brought their existence to my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, like I said, I get a sick enjoyment out of seeing what it does appear to be pulling out of my skin, so I will continue using it until it&#x27;s gone. Unless I start to see a larger change in the general state of my skin, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product has little pieces of hard granules inside the mud so when you see it in pictures in it&#x27;s dried state it makes it look like it&#x27;s actually distracting and cleaning pores when in fact it&#x27;s the dried granules. And when it dries on top of the pores it makes them stand out... I see no difference between a cheaper regular cleaning mud than this one, to me it&#x27;s overrated and I would not purchase it again, save your money and go with a cheaper variety.</li>
            <li> This product will do nothing for you if you have problem skin. Save your money, it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> It clears up my acne quickly, but does not do much for previous scars. I have also noticed that it faded my dark marks. All in all this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and looking radiant. I use this mask weekly and love the results I&#x27;m seeing because of it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Package looks like it&#x27;s old or been used, it wasn&#x27;t wrapped in any plastic. The product was all over the cap, beyond the removable plastic cap, when I opened it. There was dry and crusty product around the edges. I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;m getting a legit product.</li>
            <li> The mask cover sheet was broken</li>
            <li> I read reviews before purchasing and one of them said that the product was super tiny. Well, it is. BUT, it&#x27;s totally worth it. I was amazed to see the difference after one use. I have large pores, well, not anymore! I will purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail, and more pleased when i actually used the product the first time. It&#x27;s nice you don&#x27;t have to slather on the product to get its benefits, considering the small amount of product in the container. The first time i used it i saw a noticeable difference in the size of my pores and i really liked the tingling sensation it gives. The last few times i used it i didn&#x27;t get the same super-noticeable results, but that&#x27;s probably because my pores were still small from the first use, though it has definitely helped lessen my acne issues. As of recently i&#x27;ve been using it as a spot treatment, and good lord almighty does it work!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask. My face was brighter, softer and more youthful looking after a few uses. A little goes a long way when using this mask. My makeup looks more flawless, when I put it on after using the mask. This stuff is absolutely amazing. I have hyper pigmentation and oily skin. This product does a good job at removing excess oils in my T-zones. It also goes a good job at clearing up my pores and making them appear smaller. Cant really say about it helping to  lighten up the dark spots because I have not been using the mask long enough to make that determination. I received a small sample at Sephora, but then I saw the price, $69 bucks. I came onto amazon and saw it for much cheaper. I am sure we are paying for the packaging that comes with the mask, because the info card is so pretty. All in All I would recommend this mask in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> 1. This stuff is addicting. You are now warned..&lt;br /&gt;2. smells very natural with a nice fragrant. ( I think it&#x27;s the green tea )&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash your face before applying. then apply. This stuff attacks surface oil. So wash off the surface stuff so the product can attack the pores.&lt;br /&gt;4. Immediate difference in my complexion after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;5. I used a clean foundation brush to apply it. Less mess on my fingers..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! and buy online!</li>
            <li> I really could not wait to try this product after seeing it online, I read the reviews &amp; thought I have to try it! It is amazing &amp; what&#x27;s even better is you can see it working &amp; extracting oil &amp; dirt! It&#x27;s worth the extra bucks!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my glam glow but when I got it it was already open. The seal was broken. I am so upset with the delivery of this product... 😠😡😬</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for Glam Glow Super Mud all over the web, including Amazon.  But I was still unsure if I wanted to pay such a hefty price for a product, so I bought the samples from the Glam Glow website to try it out first.  ($11.95 you get two samples of SuperMud and two samples of YouthMud)  I tried my sample and HOLY COW is it worth the price.  I actually came to Amazon to buy a full size container.  It does everything it says it will, left my pores noticeably smaller, my face super smooth and bright.  As soon as I washed it off I was amazed by the results.  I do not understand where any of the bad reviews come from... does it revert your skin back to the day you were born? No, but with my horrid complexion, I saw vast improvement after one use.  This product is worth the hype and if you are still unsure, try the samples like I did!</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for all things beauty and this was no exception. My wonderful mom ordered it for me as a gift and I really like it. I have oily skin and I think that it actually helps for a few days after using reduce the oil on my face. Also I love when you have it on you can see it working. My husband is always like... \\&quot;wow that&#x27;s cool, but I don&#x27;t understand how it works\\&quot;, lol. Great product.</li>
            <li> I did not see much of a difference using this product.</li>
            <li> This mask was fantastic!  It clarified my skin, and left my pores much smaller.  The result was quite drastic the first time I used it, and now the results are less striking, and instead the mask maintains the improvements to my skin.</li>
            <li> Fun for a mud mask party with friends. Not sure we noticed a difference in pores but definitely noticed smoother skin.</li>
            <li> While I do not feel beautiful when this mask is ON, I do feel beautiful afterwards. I put it on, leave it for 20-30 minutes, check myself out in the mirror a few times and then rinse clean. It&#x27;s a little messy and pricey, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. However, this is the best price by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the mask is on, you see dark spots. This is supposedly the oil being sucked out of your pores. I read another review that said it wasn&#x27;t your pores showing, but rather just pieces of the mask since it&#x27;s gritty. I 100% disagree. The spots I see on my face while the mask is drying are only on the problem areas (where my pores are bigger.) It&#x27;s not all over my face, so I know it&#x27;s not just the grittiness of the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make this last a long time, I only use it on my problem areas and not as a whole face mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order again.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product. had dullness and this definitely improved appearance of dark spots. Many people have been telling me my face  has been glowing. I would def recommend this product. It has lactic acid and 3 other very effective acids in it. It is pricey but totallllly worth it. I have tried many high end products including philosophy microderm and kinerase, this is my favorite. Would recommmend this to everybody I know. My brother noticed my skin improvement after just 1 use and the next day he had it on!!</li>
            <li> It put my pores clean up.It maybe  the best product that I‘ve ever used.Now I use it three times a week，and those blackheads on my nose have gone.</li>
            <li> I have great,smooth, clear skin immediately after using this. However the glow only lasts for the evening in which I use it. I wish it sucked out more gunk than it does. For me, it&#x27;s just pulling out oil. I am very oily so this does help the overall appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! After just one use my skin looks so clean and feels great! I sometimes have problems with products because my skin is some what sensitive, but glamglow hasn&#x27;t been a problem. If you decide to buy, defiantly buy from Amazon I save you some money! Even though its worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used once, and left the mask on for about 13 minutes and it was the coolest mask! I literally watched as the &amp;#34;gross stuff&amp;#34; started to surface. Was one of the best masks i&#x27;ve ever used! I have recommended it to all my friends who use masks too &#x3D;] Spend the money on this ladies you will NOT be disappointed</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for this to come in the mail. I&#x27;ve read so many reviews on here and youtube saying this is the best stuff for blackheads. My problem is large pores and blackheads that I have never been able to get rid of no matter what I try. So I was extremely excited to try this for the first time and when I washed it off my face....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing. Not a dang difference. Not one pore was cleaned out. It looked exactly like it did when I put it on there. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, so I&#x27;m willing to give it a few more tries. I know my face has been plagued with these for a long time so I&#x27;m willing to hope against hope that maybe it&#x27;ll take some time to get those pores cleared out. I&#x27;ll keep updating my review as I continue to use it. Having said that, I&#x27;m very upset for paying so much for a product that did nothing the first 2 times of using it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Brightens and cleans poors without irritating skin.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply. Easy rince off with water.&lt;br /&gt;Will be using often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> This is the clearest my pores have been since puberty (13 years)! Blackheads literally fall out of my pours around 15 minutes after washing the mud off. Pimple are brought to the surface within a few hours. I just pop a little spot treatment on the next day and they are GONE! I know it is slightly expensive but completely worth the money! Kinda gross: I&#x27;ve had a bump on the side of my nose since I was 15. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every method of removing said bump for 11 years to no avail. The fifth or sixth mask I used, around 30 minutes after washing off the mud, I scratched my nose and something fell off into my hand. It was a MASSIVE blackhead. Disgusted and yet intrigued I went to the bathroom. NO MORE BUMP! It was completely gone!! This stuff is serious miracle mud!</li>
            <li> I do like this product.  I do not see that it did much for my skin though.  I like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I am very upset to see my glam glow arrived opened, used and old. Iv&#x27;e never had problems buying things on amazon beauty related but this will be my last purchase. Don&#x27;t waste your money on something thats already been tampered with.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie especially with skin care.  This mask truly deep cleans your pores and leaves your skin feeling very soft.  The size is on the small side but a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommendt his for anyone that has oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and Glamglow Super-Mud Clearing Treatment helps keep my skin soft and clean. I typically use the product 3 or 4 times a week that regiment works for me. I feel like this product has made a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this out because of all the great reviews it had gotten.  The mask felt really great on, but it didn&#x27;t pull much out of my pores and I felt like I broke out more after using it. I&#x27;ve given it a few tries and it still hasn&#x27;t amazed me. So it might work for some, but I was not one of those people and I would not buy it ever again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this mask from Amazon before and it was great.  This time though, the outer box wasn&#x27;t wrapped in plastic and when I opened it up the box, it was clear that the jar had already been opened; there was product caked around the lid.  I still had some of the last jar left in my medicine cabinet, so it&#x27;s my fault for not opening it or noticing the lack of outer packaging until the return window had already closed.  I smelled it and compared it to the last jar, and it seems like the real thing.  I used a little and nothing crazy happened, so hopefully there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.  Either way, I won&#x27;t buy from Amazon again and will just pay full price at Sephora.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in the size of my pores but this mask was the best spot treatment EVER! it also worked wonders on the little of blackheads that i do get around my nose.</li>
            <li> This product works!!! Easy to apply and take off!! I will definitely buy this product again and will recommend to others as well.</li>
            <li> I found this works very well. It cleaned my pores better than other productsI&#x27;ve tried and didn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> good good great love it! I like it&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the same as I got from Midtown plaza</li>
            <li> I heard rave reviews about this product and thought I&#x27;d save some money by buying here on Amazon. The product arrived, I opened the container, and there was about an inch long SLIT in the tamper resistant top. Product had leaked out of the slit and was smeared all over the top as well. This product was clearly tampered with and I was disgusted. Please do not buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I put this product in my cart and thought about it for a few days. I wasn&#x27;t sure if the size of the product would be worth the cost. In the end I bought it. I hoped for the best but anticipated a waste of money. When I got the product in the mail, my first reaction was that the packaging is WAY oversized for the amount of product you receive...CARBON FOOTPRINT. Anyway, that might be my only major gripe about this product. I have a lot of blackheads on my nose, because I was a rebellious teen and didn&#x27;t listen to my mom about proper face washing, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Must admit, I was skeptical when applying since you use a VERY thin layer. As it dries tiny holes appear where the blackheads are, at this point I am even more skeptical, then I rinse. OMG...more than half of my blackheads are gone! Glamglow surprised me! I am anxious to try it again to see if it works just as well. I am giving it 4 stars only because of the size.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get overnight results but overall it has really helped my skin - texture, smoothness, tone, pores, breakouts- everything looks better</li>
            <li> I was suspicious about this product after seeing it on Dr. Oz. I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased. I am a male with chronic issues with blackheads on my nose. Daily use of this product reduces the visible blackheads by about 85%.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week.  Especially before any special event.  Makes my face so smooth and pretty.  My makeup goes on so much better the two days after.&lt;br /&gt;I also do this and then immediately do a Biore strip on my nose.  IT IS DISGUSTING what it pulls out.  Before without Glam Glow the strip didn&#x27;t really get anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a foundation brush to apply...much better than finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after countless sightings on social media... It certainly didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I felt like I was putting toothpaste on my face (it smells and tingles like toothpaste) additionally I didn&#x27;t notice any significant positive results. My skin broke out with a few acne bumps prior use. I would recommend kerstin florian mud, which I had much better results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Clears away all your impurities. Its great to see all the circles of cleaned out pores on your face and the way it leaves your skin after, super soft and vibrant -- AMAZINGGGGG!!! def. Recommend this to everyone, even sensitive skin (as i have super duper highly sensitive reactive skin).</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and glowing and super soft after every use! Great product! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size of the package (its too small).</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I first saw it on Pinterest and decided to give it a whirl, especially with the price deal on amazon. First of all, I was very impressed by the packaging. It does instantly shrink your pores, however it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suck out the blackheads&amp;#34; like some people claimed. The only problem is that there are weird chunks of grassy/leafy-like stuff in the mud but I just wipe those off on to a paper towel. Overall a great product, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> It seems to help a little bit but isn&#x27;t the miracle I had hoped for. My skin is very acne prone so it might work people with more mild acne?</li>
            <li> UPDATE (6/27/2014): I ran out of this mask about two months ago, and tried a cheaper mask that offered similar results. It was a no go. It definitely didn&#x27;t work as well as GlamGlow and it made my skin look splotchy. I sucked it up and purchased another container and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My skin&#x27;s been acting up with the warm/humid weather, and this mask is a lifesaver. After using the cheaper brand I&#x27;ve realized that GlamGlow gives me immediate, visible results. One of the few products that is really worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;My go-to mask for dealing with my oily, acne-prone skin is Origins Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask, but since I&#x27;m kind of a beauty product junkie I decided to try out this mask based on all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the container is very small. I was shocked, considering I spent $50 on it. However, the directions clearly state to use a very small amount on your face. This makes the mask unusual from other masks I&#x27;ve tried, and I was skeptical that such a small amount of product would make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily it seems to work great. I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for a few months  (along with my Origins mask) and it really does help suck up oil from my pores. Once you&#x27;ve applied the small amount of product to your face, it immediately begins to dry and you&#x27;ll soon start noticing small dark spots around any oily areas. Some of the spots continue to get bigger as more oil is sucked out from your skin. It&#x27;s nice to see that it&#x27;s actually working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually leave it on for about 10-15 minutes, then rinse off. My skin feels firm and taunt, and I immediately moisturize it. Overall a great mask to incorporate into my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great when I use this mask.  Very soft and clears my complexion.  Definitely gives me a glow!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will order again.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> like so far, small portion, but lasts pretty long, makes my face feel very soft, dont know if its a placebo effect but I think it does a good job!</li>
            <li> product is what expected and did everything that I wanted to do and no problems with shipping and just great with product</li>
            <li> I was Very disappointed when I received this.  The product was used and half gone and the jar had mask on the outside from someone previously using it? I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to get my money back.  I&#x27;m sure the product itself is great .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost all of this stuff already, and it was worth the price. Make sure to splash your face with cold water after to close up your pores or they&#x27;ll leak pore juice all day. Don&#x27;t put it on too thick, it just wastes it and you&#x27;ll have wrinkles on your face like you just slept on a wrinkled pillow for a few hours. Yes, I did that.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter, she loves it!</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best immediate-gratification face masks/spot treatments on the market. You can SEE what it gets out of your pores, and its gross but also amazing. Clears blackheads in 15 minutes and doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry or flaky. LOVE!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised. This mask works awesome! My face feels baby soft &amp; smooth. I actually like the way my skin looks too! Definitely will repurchase!</li>
            <li> I love how my skin does glow with a fresh flush after using.  I use it at 40 and have my 14 year old son uses it to keep breakouts under control.  It seems to reduce the irritation, redness without obviously drying the skin.</li>
            <li> WARNING!! this is not the same product Sephora sells. I compared the one I actually bought from Sephora to this one &amp; there were a few minor changes to the wording on packaging. The seal is for sure different. I just threw this away because I was too scared to put it on my face after inspecting it.</li>
            <li> The product itself comes in an octagon package which is much bigger than the product itself but I knew that before I purchased the item. It doesn&#x27;t look the greatest (like a dark grey with a hint of blue) but you can feel it working as soon as you put it on. Once you wash it off, your skin feels smooth and silky. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed a difference. I had a white head for about a month that would not go away, and after I used the mask once it took it right out. My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product that I purchased from this seller as the product came in a half sealed box (when you buy from Sephora it has two seals on the box)&amp; the jar had product around the top so I don&#x27;t believe that this is a \\&quot;new\\&quot; item as stated on the product page. The product in the jar does look &amp; smell like the samples that I have gotten from Sephora but still leary of using it.....The price from this seller is 50% lower than Sephora but don&#x27;t want to risk putting it on my face not really knowing what it is, I have requested a refund/return......</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference. .</li>
            <li> Super mud cleared my skin after only a couple applications. My poors appear to be smaller.  Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Smells a lot like black licorice but does exactly what it says.  Definitely see a difference in my pore size.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and cant really tell a difference. However, it is fun to use and it feels like its working.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it once a week! My 19 year old daughter got me started using it and now all the girls in our family are using it too! Two of us have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t cause us any problems! Love that it cleans out pores without stripping your skin! Also it is great that Amazon has such a great price for it. Have spent more $$ at other stores previous to finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every other day for less than a week and I can already see a huge difference in the amount of blackheads I have. I would say ~25% are gone and the ones that are left are dramatically smaller in size. I will definitely be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> Great seller. Item as described.</li>
            <li> Works amazing, doesn&#x27;t dry my face out at all</li>
            <li> I may be one of those unlucky people that when using this product, it doesn&#x27;t come out as what others have stated. I do feel my skin is clearer and less full of gunk with this product. But blackheads remain, those stubborn stubborn things! However what&#x27;s saving this from being a three star review is the fact that this mud mask helps me control my skin disorder: seborrhea, which is extremely difficult to deal with regardless of how many creams i use from the doctor. I apply it where patches are, and after waiting 10-20 minutes and removal, i am good for 4 to 5 days in the winter (1.5 to 2 weeks in the summer) without doing anything special to my face besides preventative care. As it eats away what&#x27;s causing my problem, it takes longer for it to appear again vs sterroid creams. I only have a red spot on my face where the seborrhea was thereafter and it disappears within a day of healing. It is a blessing, and i&#x27;ve been using it for this purpose since 2013. There&#x27;s lots of acidic type of natural ingredients that are so awesome for treatment. So thank you creators for this product. I am happy, and just ordered another one as my last one is almost empty.</li>
            <li> Really fantastic product. it feels really good on, but it is very expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and absolutely love it.  Pores are minimized and face looks so smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product and I will order again!  I tried it at a department store and the feel of the clay mask as you put it on your face is very refreshing and cool.  It dries without being too harsh and crinkling your skin and washes off easily in the shower.  Even though the amount seems tiny (1.2 oz) it lasts a reasonable amount of time and doesn&#x27;t dry out in the jar.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using this treatment! It smells like liquorice which I don&#x27;t like so much but the benefits of the mask is totally worth the smell.</li>
            <li> expensive mud that just dries out combination skin like every other product does.  I don&#x27;t know how this would work on more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin, but then again, I don&#x27;t think perfectly complected people are spending an arm and a leg on products for skin issues.  I have small pimples on my &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; but nothing drastic- no huge zits that will leave scars for a lifetime.  My skin gets oily and very dry-- both very easily.  I followed the directions on this product, used it a month and my skin is the same. definitely don&#x27;t spend more than $30-something to try this. I read mixed reviews and tried it because it wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive on amazon, but have heard of people spending upwards of $60 for this.  since trying this, I finally got in with my dermatologist again and am on a legit prescription regimen that is working better. so far.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t Write reviews but this stuff totally made me break out. I usually have one or two pimples on my chin and that&#x27;s about it if anything, but I used this stuff and my cheeks are blotchy now and it looks like I have a rash all over my face. I&#x27;m terribly disappointed with this purchase especially for the price attached. I have relatively normal skin not to oily and not to dry. I won&#x27;t be ordering anymore product from this company. I wish I could give less than one star.</li>
            <li> I got this product because ive used everything to get rid of blackheads. Nothing ever works for me. I have bery oily skin as well. When this product goes on it feels fresh on your skin, maybe from the minty smell, and when it hardens it really shows all your pores. Im not sure if i didnt take all the product off but it didnt really make too much of a difference with the blackheads. The only amazing thing about this product is how soft your skin gets when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed!!! I should have listened to the other reviews. This item appears to have been used already! There is product around the cap and inside, more than half of the product is gone from the container! Who does this and why would this be resent out as a new item??? I should be paid for wasting my time and now having to waste more time and gas driving to UPS to return this. Heading to Sephora tomorrow. NEVER buying this here again! DO NOT BUY THIS HERE!</li>
            <li> arrived opened and used</li>
            <li> I liked this product as first glance, it smells nice and feels cool when put on your face. However, I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin and the product dried up inside of the container after a few months. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but may still recommend it to a friend depending on what they were looking for.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work that well except for making my skin smooth, but it also dried it out... Paid way too much for results like that.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mask- it does what it says it will do... including dry out your skin.  I happen to already have the GlamGlow thirsty mud treatment so I just lather that one on my face after this one comes off and then go to bed!  Warm water rinse in the am and some moisturizer, and your make up goes on great.... Well worth it, especially with oily skin people- such a clean feeling! I will say however that I was not overly impressed with the shipping and packaging of the item.  It did look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; and not official, however I chose to try it and see- I have samples of the original product from Sephora and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference.  For $50 you still want better looking presentation, but hey it works and saved me $20!</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it my skin had an amazing glow.... It made my skin look much younger, especially in the winter months when my skin seems very dry Nd dull</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this mask, and the fact that amazon has it at such a discounted price is incredible, but I have to say it&#x27;s really not worth the price for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian with pretty dry skin, hyperpigmentation, and some acne. The mask didn&#x27;t dry my face out which was surprising in a good way. You can definitely see all your pores as promised which was more than disturbing. Anyway, I found the consistency of the mask super dry and kind of hard to spread. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the only one with this problem, but I would definitely recommend to use the whole thing within two months or else it will dry up on you. Once the mask is on, it feels like any other clay mask (i.e. you can&#x27;t move your face). It didn&#x27;t bother my face, make me break out or anything, even when I left it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are very rapid. After my first use, I could see my pores looked cleaner and tighter, and overall, my face was a lot softer. This would last for about 24 hours or so and then my face would return to it&#x27;s normal sad self so I didn&#x27;t see any permanent changes in my skin which is partially why I say this product is not worth the money. After using it consecutively for a couple weeks, you can see your results plateauing. Personally, I didn&#x27;t see amazing/life-altering results from this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I used up my first jar, I got a second one for Christmas. Now I usually use this before I go on date night or if I just want my skin to look extra healthy for an event or something. Over all, I would say it&#x27;s a good luxury product if you&#x27;re looking to pamper yourself, and it would also make a great gift. However, I can&#x27;t justify using such an expensive mask as my normal face mask. There are definitely cheaper products that will give you similar effects for much less money.</li>
            <li> If you have blackheads or large pores around the nose or in the t-zone like I do this is a must for helping to unclog &amp; for smaller pores.  Love this product, it can be bought in some make-up stores but you will pay more.</li>
            <li> I was hearing so many good things about this stuff so I ordered it. I applied it and let it dry and ewww! lets just say my face was not as clean as I thought it was.. however after multiple uses I have yet to see any improvement in my skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!! will be repurchasing!!</li>
            <li> This costs MUCH less on Amazon than at Sephora, so that&#x27;s a plus. The mask was nice; I think it did tighten up some pores for a few hours directly after the treatment but I don&#x27;t think it was helpful enough to justify the price. I used it 1-3 times a week for 5ish weeks (until it ran out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try a different version of GlamGlow in case this just wasn&#x27;t ideal for my skin type. I think I had too high of expectations because of the glowing (har, har) reviews.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome cleansing mask for oily skin and acne skin ! the best ~~~ I will keep using it</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this has changed my life, or drastically changed my skin.  I really don&#x27;t notice a difference after I use it - I suppose it&#x27;s an ok mask, but don&#x27;t expect to be really wowed.</li>
            <li> I do like it.  It cleans my skin very well. I think that I like the one that comes in the black pot just a little better.  But they are both good products and buying them off of Amazon is much cheaper than Sephora.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted for cheaper then department store prices. Works great and last a long time for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> THis was a Christmas Present for my daughter - she loves it.  She swears it is the only thing that really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This rocks, seriously, I have family and friends try all the time. Even the guys who would never admit they&#x27;ve used it love it. I need more.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing for clearing acne and lightning as well. Glycolic and lactic acid. My favorite mask ever! You will love this!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister and she loves it. She has tried other face masks in the past, but believes that this is the best one!</li>
            <li> Seems to lighten freckles. Other than that I think my skin looks worse after I use it. Clogged pores look more bumpy and I break out the next day. Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is why I Love Amazon! I was able to purchase this on here before Sephora picked it up as a line staple. This stuff is a spa day in a jar! Not an every day use, but a must if your skin needs a litte rehab. The best part is where you can see all of the junk being pulled out of your pores!</li>
            <li> This product is given so much hype but despite this for me the mask did not deliver what it has promised. I have already use this mask for 5 or 6 times but I do not see any good changes in my skin. My skin is very sensitive and acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;After using this, my pores looks bigger and got some more acne. : (</li>
            <li> Glam Glow is amazing. After a few uses my skin was tighter, pores were smaller and my blemishes were gone. It gets a lot of the gunk out right away and, after continued use, my skin looks much better. A little bit goes a long way also, so I feel like I got my bang for the buck. Purchasing it from Amazon was also a good idea because if you get it at Sephora it&#x27;s pretty pricey. $70 is too much I think, but at around $35 it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from severe blackheads/enlarged pores around my nose and on my nose, and I agree with the other commenters: this mask completely cleared out the pores on my nose and the area around my nose. Also, it did an amazing job shrinking these pores as well. From a distance, you can&#x27;t tell I have pores around my nose at all, and the ones on my nose aren&#x27;t as bad (the blackheads on my nose are more stubborn). For me, it&#x27;s worth the money. Dramatic results sometimes call for dramatic prices.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love the price even better. I love how it leave your face glowing even after a few days I tried it on my friend they loved it.  I just wish the container was a little bit better with more product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after I use this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do what it claims. My pores haven&#x27;t decreased in size and it hasn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t anything for my blackheads. Don&#x27;t think I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> The product is not a new item. It has been used before.The box was opened and it was dirty. Don&#x27;t buy it.i</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing will buy again. Really does wonders for the face you must try it. I use it once a week and it really gives your face an instant lift.</li>
            <li> Okay I was skeptical about this product, especially since it is so much cheaper on amazon. I purchased this in Novemeber and I just did my last mask tonight (Feb). It lasts forever because you need a thin layer. I will be repurchasing this product again after I finish this review!</li>
            <li> Does great on my nose. I hate the gross giant pore I have on my nose and it cleans them well and shrinks them.</li>
            <li> I was convinced by the girl at sephora to change out the mask I chose for the glam glow mask and boy am I glad she did. I have been an esthetician for 10 years and this mask is even better than the pharmaceutical grade masks I have used at work. My skin showed instant results ( softer smaller pores more even complexion redness reduced ). I can only image what prolonged use will do.</li>
            <li> Just an FYI for those of you out there that have yet ro try this product.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product on several areas of my face that had some superficial markings left due to acne breakouts, I was left with a very noticible darkened areas on my face. Unbelieveable that a product that promotes the healing of dark marks actually exacerbated the same exact problem.</li>
            <li> Im really loving this stuff.  My face feels so smooth and soft, but most of all clear from black heads.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I had ordered it awhile ago and something happened and I did not get the first order! I was given a refund by Amazon (Thank You!!) and I placed another order!! When I got it I was so excited to use it. I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. I have large pores. Ive used this now three days in a row! Ive noticed my pores have cleared up and on the tip of my nose the pores have gotten smaller!! YAY!! I love that I can use this everyday and it wont irritate my skin. The second day I used it and then used a nose strip and got a LOT more stuff out than using the nose strip alone. The Super-Mud seemed to help open up my pores and let the whiteheads come out easier. i have also used which hazel as a toner after rinsing my face, then of course moisturizing. My skin does feel much smoother. My daughter has also been using this and I can see her skin clearing up, which is great for a 14 year old!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell...</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this treatment after seeing it all over the internet and having heard great things.  I had a sample of another mask by this brand that I really liked.  This however did very little long term.  Sure initially your pores may look smaller but the next day there they are again and look now you have blemishes too!!  Oh great!  I gave this treatment several chances to wow me and it was just disappointing and so expensive to not be wonderful.  As an aging young lady I don&#x27;t mind paying some cash for a product that works, but I really wish I had returned this in time to get a refund.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy more for my stubborn skin. It heals and calms my cystic acne and blemishes and makes my skin feel amazingly smooth and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was reluctant to buy it at first because of the price. But after a lot of thought, looking at reviews, and getting some Christmas money I finally decided to try it out and I&#x27;m not disappointed in the slightest. It&#x27;s almost completely gotten rid of my blackheads after just 2 uses! I would recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works wonders!!! It sucks out all the crap from your pores &amp; blackheads. After one use there was less blackheads on my husbands nose, he has been using it once to two times a week &amp; his blackheads are almost all gone. His pores have diminished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month now. It smells...interesting, and has a very lumpy texture. When I use it, my face looks like the pictures. But after using it at least twice a week, I haven&#x27;t seen any results on the size/appearance of blackheads. I&#x27;m sad to say, it wasn&#x27;t worth the price. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because although it does nothing for blackheads, it does help with breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about beauty product reviews, but I saw so many raves about this I thought I would give it a try and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it once and already see and feel a notable difference in my skin. Skin is smoother and less red. Blemishes are smaller. (I have cystic pimples that leave scars and last a very long time.) Directions say to leave on from 5 to 20 minutes. I tried it for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get a rash from many products but this one has given me no reaction at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many clay masks are hard to wash off and take some scrubbing. This one comes off very easily with warm water and a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like mint and licorice. This might be a con for some, but I like the smell, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is pricey I already think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and it makes my skin smooth and clear, but is it worth spending almost $50 dollars for it? I don&#x27;t think so.  There are a lot of other products on the market that do the same thing for half the money.</li>
            <li> To buy friends, she said after the use super good, show me the photo works, the black head on nose less, she is very happy, when discounted buy price is cheap, it&#x27;s very good of, run out to buy again.</li>
            <li> Best mask I have ever used! My face feels super clean, smooth and tighter! You can feel it working! It&#x27;s expensive but if you use it sparingly then it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> What a crock of crap this thing is. You want to know what the different colors are on your face when you have the mask on? Its the different thicknesses drying at different paces. Does NOTHING for your skin. Wish they would give me my money back that&#x27;s how bad this treatment is. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> This is an AWESOME facial mask! There is truly no comparing this to other masks, it&#x27;s that good. ...and buy it here at Amazon, what a deal!!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS ... HAVE USED IT SEVERAL TIMES.  REALLY LIKE THE WAY MY FACE FEELS AFTER .  SMOOTH AND HAVE NOTICED ANY BLACKHEADS HAVE DIMINISHED.  WOULD RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I see no difference in my skin and my breaks outs are still there and still coming.. I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle to see if it helps..</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the negative reviews before buying this. I have a ten dollar mask that does equally well - that this costs $50 is ludicrous. I very strongly do not recommend!</li>
            <li> I wanted to be excited about it, I really did. Maybe I&#x27;m just a sucker for the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is oily, acne-prone, and has a reddish undertone. After using the mask exactly as directed, all of those characteristics amplified. My skin was slicker, more red, as though I was constantly blushing, and I had more spots than before. Thinking it a coincidence, I tried the mask again about a week later, after my skin had cleared. Same result. A third time a week after? Same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars? It is fascinating to watch the oil seep through and turn the mask dark, and it does wash off clean. More importantly, I think it just isn&#x27;t the product for my skin type. I gave it to a friend with clear, pale skin, and she adores it. It&#x27;s helped her even out her skin tone, so it does work- just not for me.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!!!  Item is NOT new!  Top of box is loosely closed and properly sealed, jar is dirty and has dried out pieces around the top edges!  Obviously has previously been used or tested!  GROSS!!!!  F----</li>
            <li> Love this. Worth the splurge. You can literally see the clay pulling out dirt and oil from your face. I would save up and purchase a larger container so that all my skin would have more time to react, as well as to maintain the clean, soft and clear face that was left behind.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! Not to be gross, but I get lots of satisfaction out of being able to see the product working (aka the gunk getting sucked out of my pores). I use this when I feel like my face needs it. Usually about once every other week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.itsthelifeofalady.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> I love this but it&#x27;s pricy.</li>
            <li> GLAMGLOW IS THE BEST MASK OUT THERE. Hands down. BUT. The real trick of making your tiny expensive jar of glamglow go far is that after you leave the mask on for 20-30 minutes, rinse off with very warm water, and then follow with BIORE PORE STRIPS. One on your nose (a nose strip) and one in any other problem areas (e.g. t-zone). Biore sells special &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; strips for this purpose. Leave the pore strip(s) on for 20-30 min. (don&#x27;t follow the box instructions!) While the strip is on YOU CANNOT MOVE. DON&#x27;T TALK. DON&#x27;T LAUGH. NO NOTHING. Shut yourself in your room, sit down, read a book, watch TV, etc. until the 20-30 min. is up. When you take the pore strip off, pull it off suuuuuper slooooowly. If you&#x27;re not amazed by the results, you did it wrong (i.e. you moved your face excessively during the pore strip portion of the process). I don&#x27;t work for Biore--this is seriously the best method if you want to get rid off gross dug in blackheads. This method will leave &amp;#34;clean craters&amp;#34; in your nose where columns of gunk used to reside. Anyone who&#x27;s complaining that glamglow doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;totally get rid of blackheads&amp;#34; OR that Biore pore strips don&#x27;t do what they claim to do will find that their problems with BOTH PRODUCTS are solved with this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me. You won&#x27;t regret trying this.</li>
            <li> such a shame that although it was an amazing price it was an expired product BYE FELICIA</li>
            <li> I just love the results, I was looking for an all in one mask that would treat all my skin problems.Just bought my first bottle and am planning to continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve considered buying this for months. There&#x27;s nothing about this product that is worth more than $10. I could never justify the price, but my curiosity finally got the best of me. I have hormonal cycstic acne, so not a whole lot helps, but all the reviews claimed this was a miracle worker. Maybe for simple acne, it might do the trick. There are things you can purchase at Walgreens that work better than this product. If you have any type of severe acne, please don&#x27;t waste your time here. Its not super, theres no miracle, it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It looks and feels so good within minutes of application. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my blackheads have diminished significantly. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin in a lot more smoother. Just use it after exfoliating and it produces the best results.</li>
            <li> i used it it dry on my face quickly and i dont feel good my face i have used it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> The product is good, it did bring a bit up out of my pores.  However, I was expecting the drastic result the promo video shows.  To be fair, I don&#x27;t have problem skin, so it might just be that I&#x27;m lucky.  I&#x27;ll definitely use the rest of it but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy more since it isn&#x27;t cheap.  I&#x27;d say give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve never had something work so effectively, so QUICKLY on my skin. It left it soft and clear, minimizing pores drastically. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> This stuff delivers!  I have always had larger pores on my nose and blackheads and after reading so many good reviews on this product and a friend&#x27;s recommendation, I decided to buy it.  I do not typically spend a lot of money on skin care and makeup usually just purchasing drugstore available products, so this really was a splurge for me (although the price on amazon was much better than anywhere else).  Immediately after the first use I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but 24 hours later there was a visible difference, and after a second use a couple days later my skin looked even better.  I am only using it on problem areas on my face, so I should be able to get quite a few uses out of the container.  I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, who is always trying to find things to help keep her skin clear.  She was very pleased with the results, used it one evening and the next morning her skin already looked clearer and had a healthy glow.  Wish the price was lower though.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about buying this product after all that I heard about it, but $60 is a lot to spend on a product I might not like.&lt;br /&gt;So, longstory short I went to check out their website (glamglowmud.com) and they offer SAMPLE sizes which are about $12.00 and $14.00 after taxes and you get 2 packets of each type of glamglow, also the shipping was free. The Supermud [white jar] , and the youthmud [black jar], my product also arrived the day after it was shipped.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried the supermud, and it makes your skin feel great, but not a miracle treatment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, You really should try the sample first!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week but I can already see a difference. Not giving it 5 stars only because it hasn&#x27;t really helped with my acne on my chin. Regardless, the rest of my face is completely clear and my pores are visibly smaller. Hopefully my chin will see improvement soon.</li>
            <li> I actually tried this as a sample before I bought it so i knew I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud actually extracts goo from your pores.  I use it and so does my nearly 15 year old child who has some acne going on.  We leave it on for the full 20 minutes and you will see the stuff that comes out of your pores pooling on top of the mud.  Kinda gross, but better out than in ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is sensitive maybe try it in a small spot on your face and leave on for 5-10 minutes the first time to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I&#x27;m 40, so it&#x27;s good for all ages that need a pore-cleaner-outer.</li>
            <li> My skin felt great after using this product. It works exactly how it says it should. I use it once a month.</li>
            <li> This mask feels great, and smells great, but if you are looking for a miracle in a jar you will not be happy.  You can see the oil and yuck that it &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; out of your pores but it does not make them smaller or less yucky as you would imagine.  Use it as a part of your regular beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This mask is well worth the money - smells great and leaves your skin just glowing and so soft.  I use it once a week and I think my pores and texture of my skin are looking much better.</li>
            <li> saw reviews online and decided to try it out for my teenager. It has made such a huge difference in quality of skin. will definately buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great product, but very pricey for what you get.  The box is huge, but the product buried inside is tiny.  The product does exactly what it says.  Your pores are much smaller and the texture is much smoother, for a few hours.  I feel much cleaner when I use it, but you are afraid to use it because you will only get a handful of uses out of the amount that they give you.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty great, I noticed a difference within the first use. I have used it both as a mask and for spot treatments. The smell gets me sometimes, but that is because I am not a real fan of black licorice. I have no complaints, definitely worth the $$</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews on this amazing product before I finally purchased a jar. It was much cheaper on amazon, so that helped my decision. I have had lots of blackheads on my nose for years. I have tried creams, masks, astringents, nothing helped. The first time I used this mask, my blackheads weren&#x27;t all cleared up, but most of them were to the surface so I could extract them. The second time I used it, my pores were smaller and almost all the blackheads were cleared up. Amazing. It just keeps getting better with each use. At least give this product a try more than once in a two week period. Some people are apparently just trying it one time and expecting a miracle. The more you use it, the better your skin will be!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells great and it has reduced my acne almost completely. It is also the only treatment I have found that gets rid of black heads as well. You literally wipe them away! I  tell all my friends about this stuff because of how amazing it is.</li>
            <li> Loved how my skin felt after , and it smelled really good. Container is a tad small but well worth buying.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  bought this for my son age 32 who was having some skin  issues.  His face cleared up in no time.  Ordering &amp; delivery quick and easy.  Great product.  Will search for one for wrinkles for me.</li>
            <li> This is the skin care product of the millennium. A bit pricy, however, a little goes a long way and what a difference it makes immediately. Recommend to all women with problem skin for that extra confidence boost.</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what it says (for me anyways) I use it once a week and my pores are visibly clearer..black heads seem to have a harder time coming out but my pores are noticeably smaller. I would&#x27;ve given this a 5 if there wasn&#x27;t a brown mold growing on the outer cap. I took pictures but wasn&#x27;t able to upload them to this review. I didn&#x27;t return the item since the brown goop wasn&#x27;t on the inside of the bottle just between the cap and seal. Kinda gross but after I wiped it clean it was fine.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. I had heard about it on pinterest.com and was so interested in whether or not it really worked. I put it on just like the directions said. It started to dry on my skin and then I could really tell it was working. The mud was pulling out the oil from my pores and I could actually see it in the mud. My skin felt amazing immediately after the mask was off. The next morning I woke and my skin was no where nearly as oily as it normally is!!! My skin is softer, smoother, and the biggest thing is my pores are looking smaller!!! Highly recommended to try this product!!!</li>
            <li> great at reducing pores</li>
            <li> First off, I have a strange complex, I&#x27;m optimistic/skeptical all in one. Im in my mid 20&#x27;s and for the last few years I&#x27;ve had some type of breakout everyday. I have to admit that it&#x27;s partially my fault. I see a pimple forming and my immediate thought is ATTACK, not good because the debris tends to spread, thus furthering the problem. Anyway, I read the reviews both here and on Sophora and as I mentioned before hand, I was skeptical as I pushed the purchase button. Needless to say I love how this makes my skin feel. I only used the product a few times, and I can already feel my face being cleansed from all the damage/dirt. Amazing! You can see the pockets of oil as the mask does it&#x27;s job. As far as my breakouts, my skin looks better than it did in high school. I think I&#x27;m in love. The fact that it feels like your face is getting a massage while it&#x27;s being treated is an added plus. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> It made no difference in my skin. It got worse actually.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure when i first got it, not just because of the price, also the type of product this is, a mud mask, how awesome could it be.&lt;br /&gt;Well, tried for about a month now, i have to say, this is the best mud mask i have ever try, I have a lot of stubborn black and white heads, and glamglow help me clear most of those out after 4-5 times use. I know this is on the pricier side, but trust me, it is worth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing the great reviews of how it removes blackheads.  This is a great product and definitely after using it, you will notice your skin is soft and clean feeling however, I did still see blackheads around my nose that it did not remove.  For the price, it did not seem to do enough for my skin to make me re-order.  May try and find a less expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> wow I really was impressed with this mask. face felt great and looked great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It does help to clear out skin but you have to wait a week or so. Don&#x27;t worry if you break out the first 2 times you use it... it is normal since it is taking out all the bad stuff from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy this product on the amazon&#x27;s website because I was a little worried I would get an expired product but I am going to try it when mine is over.&lt;br /&gt;So much cheaper than sephora or other beauty retailers however costco has it (for limited time) for the same price as amazon!</li>
            <li> Very effective! Supermud Quuen!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, great price, and a great product. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I had purchased two of these on Amazon in the past and had no problem. This one does nothing. I am disappointed. It leaves my skin feeling the same. The bottle looks legit except the seal was different from the others so I question the authenticity. Very disappointed. Will not order again. I will order from Sephora where it is for sure the real thing.</li>
            <li> See no difference after uses.  Seem to breakout with a few pimples after use also (i may just be alergic).  I guess it feels good when it dries because you can feel you face tightened.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this for the first time because when I was browsing at Sephora another customer absolutely raved about using this as a spot treatment for breakouts.  I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and am happy to report that she&#x27;s right!  For context, I have sensitive acne prone skin that is also very dry.  My skin has been breakout prone for quite awhile now.  Thankfully, I&#x27;ve had a couple of tours of Accutane that made it much, much better.  I currently use a couple of prescription topicals and oral medications to keep it under control.  Still, I breakout occasionally, especially around my period.  In my experience, most of what I&#x27;ve tried works better for preventing acne, but not so well after it&#x27;s popped up.  (With the exception of cortisone injections for acne, which I use infrequently due to their cost.)  However, this works surprisingly well to help my acne heal after it&#x27;s popped up.  It seems to dry the acne out and while it doesn&#x27;t go away quickly, it seems to greatly diminish its appearance over night.  The only kind of acne it doesn&#x27;t seem to drastically help is cystic acne, but otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good.  So far I&#x27;ve been pretty impressed  I haven&#x27;t yet tried using it as a preventative measure since the cost is pretty high, but am LOVING it as a spot treatment after my skin has flared up.  My one caveat is that I got this in person at a store, not from the vendor here, so I can&#x27;t vouch for whether what is sent out here is the real deal.  But I can say when you get an authentic version of this it&#x27;s absolutely awesome and I would recommend it without hesitation.  I know the price can seem high, but compared to prescription products which are also pricy, or cycling through cheaper products that don&#x27;t work, this seems pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> This works great for pimples, I have been using it for spot treatment for a while and it works well. I also have used it all over for a mask to help reduce pore size and get rid of blackheads. I will probably try a cheaper product the next time to see if this really is that much better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to receive it on Saturday and got it on Friday so that&#x27;s always good :) product seems to be working well but it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> If you have acne, get glamglow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a spa treatment where they used three different glamglow treatments on me which finally inspired me enough to actually buy some&lt;br /&gt;Even though I already knew from Jen that it was good stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I like is that it&#x27;s great for spot treatments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had acne since I was 11&lt;br /&gt;I hate my skin&lt;br /&gt;You ever get one of this big, hard and swollen knots that you know won&#x27;t resolve itself for several days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and then you pick at it because it&#x27;s existence is pissing you off and the pressure from the inflammation hurts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and then, if you&#x27;re like me, you end up ripping your skin up and now you have a great big nasty wound?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put glamglow on it&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to do a full mask&lt;br /&gt;Let it dry and then wipe it off&lt;br /&gt;It takes all the inflammation away&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had this years ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great for taking the dirt out of your pores on the top layer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I squeeze what I think are blackheads&lt;br /&gt;I have learned from the spa treatment that I am too picky&lt;br /&gt;I get sebum out but it really isn&#x27;t infected or about to be but squeezing it does promote it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glamglow removed the dark color from the surface of the sebum so it doesn&#x27;t look like there is a blackhead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also tightens up the pores&lt;br /&gt;I have huge ones because I have abused the heck out of my face for years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it</li>
            <li> Results are showing after 1 try: pores are less noticeable, skin is brighter and smoother, healthier looking, very soft. Took about 5 yrs off my face. I&#x27;ll keep you all updated as I continue to use it. (I bought it at the recommendation of professional make-up artist Tiffany Lee Bymaster, aka \\&quot;Coach Glitter\\&quot;) Note: I am also using Neutrogena BB cream to even out my complexion, and am working on the \\&quot;inside\\&quot; as well: taking Amazing Grass supplement powder via smoothies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m a skeptical consumer generally, but still delighted with this product. My skin continues to look better and better: skin tone is evening out, pores are much smaller, overall my face looks significantly \\&quot;healthier.\\&quot; I have not had any breakouts from this product.</li>
            <li> You really see the oil being sucked up when the mask dries. It took a couple times for me to really see any difference.</li>
            <li> waste of money.  I get better results with department-store brand (Borghese) at half the price.  I also bought the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; mask at the same time, also pricey.  I don&#x27;t see how this has gotten such great reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always fun to get rid of gross stuff on your face.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee this mask!! Clears up skin and leaves it feeling smooth and gorgeous!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and i recommend this for every skin lover. it gives you an instant glow and repairs you uneven toned skin. i am in love!</li>
            <li> Is it just me or did this product cause a serious break out? It&#x27;s wonderfully extracting of my pores though around my nose and cheeks</li>
            <li> Bought two in the same order. One was fine, the other had a completely different safety seal, and was used. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have normal, healthy skin but I have large pores.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products (serums, etc.) to try to reduce my pores. I&#x27;ve also tried primers that claim to make them disappear.  All of this was to no avail.  With all the rave reviews, I thought I would give GlamGlow Super-Mud a try.  It is a miracle!!!  As soon as I rinsed the mask off my face, my pores were clean, tight, and definitely less visible.  The next day I put on my makeup as usual and was thrilled that the dramatic difference in my pore size remained.  I&#x27;m on day three and the pores are still less noticeable, but I can tell that eventually they will go back to how they were before.  BUT, no big deal because I will simply use another treatment and I&#x27;ll be back to good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I Used GlamGlow:&lt;br /&gt;I smeared a thin layer all over my face and let it set.  It started to dry almost immediately and turned a light green/teal color.  When I checked my face I could see darker dots all over, especially in my T-zone.  It appeared to be drawing out all the nastiness from my pores.  As it dried my it tightened on my face and I was unable to move my face without cracking the mask, so I tried to move my face as little as possible.  I let it set for 20 minutes and rinsed it off.  I used Josie Maran&#x27;s argon oil all over my face before heading for bed (Note: that is my normal face product for my bedtime routine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that the mask also made my face incredibly soft, which was expected.</li>
            <li> Warning: do not buy this product. It is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product so far. Would recommend to a friend. This makes my skin feel smooth and pores smaller</li>
            <li> Love it! 100% satisfied with it! Totally worth the money.  Little goes a long way. You skin will feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I like it but feel it is too expense for the amount you get.  A little goes a long way but still expensive</li>
            <li> Rarely do I post reviews, but this product needed one. For starters, I was intrigued with the &amp;#34;pore matrix&amp;#34; aspect of this mask where it changes color as it removes dirt, oil etc from the pores. When I found it was about $20 cheaper on amazon than on sephora&#x27;s website, I immediately bought it. It arrived on time but when I opened it, about 1/4 of the container was empty. I thought either that&#x27;s the way it came (like a bag of chips being half empty) or it was used. Since I was so excited for the mask I disregarded the latter. So I washed my face with my normal routine of Cetaphil in the shower, then when I got out I used a $1 foundation brush from elf to apply the mask all over my face. After 5 minutes I could already see it change from a dark grey color to a white- toothpaste color. It was indeed interesting to see. It was also a pain to get off. I hate scrubbing my face to get rid of masks and I prefer to do it in the shower but anyway.... I don&#x27;t want to ramble too much but it was good to try, but did not heal any of my existing pimples or really do anything for my skin. For reference i&#x27;m a teenager with mild acne, mostly whiteheads along my cheeks and chin and neck... In conclusion if you can grab a hold of a sample size version you should def try it out.. but don&#x27;t spend $40-$60 on this gimmicky face mask.</li>
            <li> Love it. it really does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I like this mask, but I was very disappointed because the seal was broken!! It seems it was tampered with.. not nice.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say enough about this mask. I&#x27;m about to finish my second tube. clears my skin and my pores like nothing else</li>
            <li> Very good. Highly recommended!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap, so I didn&#x27;t want to pay the Sephora prices, but I was a bit hesitant to buy this from Amazon. I immediately tried it when I got it and have now been using it for a month. I have naturally nice skin (I never break out), but I have a big problem with clogged pores and blackheads on my nose. It&#x27;s frustrating and I&#x27;ve tried it all. I have used Biore nose strips religiously for years with minimal results. The first time I tried this on its own - it&#x27;s really cool to see it working! You can see all of your pores and blackheads. Crazy! Anyway, it cleared up my nose better than my last facial! The next week I used a Biore strip before using the treatment. My nose was completely clear! I don&#x27;t know how it works on zits, but it&#x27;s great for pores and blackheads! I use it every week now in conjunction with the strips. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I have really deep sole lines that fill with makeup and look terrible. Glamglow tightened those areas up and i have minimal make lines there now! My pores are much smaller too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it!!</li>
            <li> All you need to know is that I have REALLY sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m right in the middle of that young adult acne stage, and it was getting really bad the last few weeks, so I decided to try this out, when it came in the mail I used it as a full mask (i love it btw) and then as a spot treatment over night, I didn&#x27;t wake up with completely clear skin, but there was a serious difference in just 2 times of using it, my skin is so much softer, and the redness is almost completely gone. This mask is very soothing and has a cooling tingle, and smells nice! If you have seriously problematic skin this is defiantly something to try, give it a few times as it may break you out if u have acne that has not surfaced yet, it will draw everything out of your skin but after that is over (give it a week) your left with clear soft radiant skin, I&#x27;m so excited about how my skin is looking. (and if you&#x27;ve had acne, you know that&#x27;s a good feeling). Nothing bad to say about the product, the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is bc I experienced some shipping errors, but the product was in perfect condition!!! And the packaging is adorable! (yes it comes in the cool box) Definitely a must-have in my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> I was very eager to try this product from all the positive reviews however I didn&#x27;t see what the big deal was. I have tried other masks in past that I felt were better</li>
            <li> This product did not have the original plastic cover when you open it. It was covered in a foil. It has a more watery consistency then the one I had previously bought at sephora. However, it still does its job and for the price its a steal.</li>
            <li> Works great and clears up my skin and makes it super soft in just a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot but hate the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other face masks, you use very little product so a little does go a long way. The scent isn&#x27;t over-powering and is on the minty side. I use it 1-2 times a week all over and spot treat as needed. When this mask dries, it pulls tight so don&#x27;t leave it on longer than recommended. It&#x27;s not at all uncomfortable and rinses off easily. Since you aren&#x27;t piling on product, it rinses off without a ton of effort or mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this my skin does look and feel noticeably different but if I&#x27;m honest, the results are short lived. I keep hoping that with repeated use the end results will start to last longer and longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reasons I bought this was because it was supposed to have a brightening effect and I want to even skin tone. I&#x27;m not seeing a lot of brightening but the other results are positive enough that I would keep buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews here leading me to think some sellers might not be shipping a valid product. First-timers beware. If you don&#x27;t know what to expect and purchase something that isn&#x27;t legit, you probably won&#x27;t get the same results and be disappointed. Sephora carries the entire line but it&#x27;s very expensive. I found GlamGlow at my local (Plano, TX) Costco for $36.99!!! Same exact product/size/packaging, etc. Of course you have to have a membership (or friend or family member with a membership) but it&#x27;s worth it. This is my go to retailer for this product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing the manufacturer could do to reduce costs would be to change their packaging. This comes in a large intricate box that&#x27;s completely unnecessary. It feels high-end but I don&#x27;t want to pay for marketing. I&#x27;d rather be able to save a little money and just buy it in a tube or basic rectangular box.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered GLAMGLOW from amazon, and it is amazing!! I love the results. I will be ordering more of this before I run out:)</li>
            <li> YES!!!! It is pricey but it WORKS!! I highly suggest it if you really want to get DEEEEP into those pores. Love it!</li>
            <li> pretty goods,i will buy it again</li>
            <li> So far so good. Expect further changes on the face!</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of this. I LOVE it. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product I have found that works and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> Gave me a BAD breakout. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Used about 12 times makes your face smooth and clean. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I would buy again if I wasn&#x27;t broke ;)</li>
            <li> I have ordered this from Amazon 3-4 times now and I do admit the packaging has looked shady every time. However, I used it anyway and for the results I have seen in my skin&#x27;s texture and the $20 I am saving, I&#x27;m okay with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I purchased this item I applied it daily for 2 weeks for 20-30 min. My skin was in good condition beforehand, but I did notice a smoother, more porcelain-like texture. Now I use it 2-3 times a week. Glam Glow gets rid of zits FAST and has definitely made a noticeable difference for me. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is on the pricy side, but totally worth it! I just turned 30 and started getting breakouts when i used to always have clear skin. I needed a miracle and glamglow consistently comes through! I used to buy at sephora but Amazon has a much better price!!!! I leave the mask on for about 20 minutes a couple times per weeks. Also works as a spot treatment, and i will sleep with it on if using as a spot treatment.  Highly recommend, it&#x27;s amazing for blackheads and generally clearing up your face.</li>
            <li> MONEY CAN BUY HAPPINESS! Not only does this have the cutest packaging but it did absolute wonders for my skin. As a 21 year old you don&#x27;t expect acne to be a big problem in your life anymore, i&#x27;ve been on 6 different acne prescriptions. I&#x27;m currently on Epidoux and Doxycycline, which my dermatologist said would take about 3 months to work and i&#x27;m only on month #2. Obviously any average human doesn&#x27;t want to hear that your skin still has yet to even remotely clear up for another 3 months. I came across GlamGlow on Pinterest and thought i would give it a try because the price and reviews were great. THANK GOD I DID! Within 2 days...yes 2 days my face was completely clear, 100% no foundation needed NOTHING! I suffer with acne very badly on my chin, nose and t-zone/mid forehead area. Poof...GONE! I do have a few dark spots that I see diminishing from the use of this mask. The container is smaller but i&#x27;ve used the mask fully on my face 4 times and now just using it for spot treat so it&#x27;s going to last me awhile. I had read some reviews that some people&#x27;s packages came used or damaged, i didn&#x27;t have the problem at all. Everything about this is wonderful. If you&#x27;re reading this, BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT! xoxoxox!</li>
            <li> It works awesome!! Just don&#x27;t use it everyday or it will dry your face out :)</li>
            <li> Amazing!!  I feel like my skin is brand new after using this.</li>
            <li> This product really does make my skin feel healthier and glowing.  It&#x27;s kind of gross to watch the impurities get pulled out of your pores.  Glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> I saw this product on Pinterest. It is a bit spendy, BUT worth EVERY penny!! It&#x27;s crazy how well this works! You see a change after 1 use!</li>
            <li> Being deployed on an aircraft carrier is really rough on your skin. Not enough sleep, poor diet, (and in my case being a mechanic) causes my face serious damage. Not a day goes by that I get off work and my face isn&#x27;t greasy, oily, and pretty much disgusting. My acne came back and I was suffering because of it. When I put this mask on, I can visually see all of that crap being literally sucked out of my pores. It&#x27;s disgusting but awesome, because you know it&#x27;s working! Not to mention my skin felt incredibly clean afterwards. I&#x27;m going to continue using, and if my results continue to be good, I won&#x27;t hesitate to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Product! Works great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Does clear up my skin a day after using.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sephora actually. My bf didn&#x27;t me to have to wait for shipping so we went to go get it. It was around $70 when we got it. Now I&#x27;m thinking I should&#x27;ve waited to get this price. Maybe I&#x27;ll buy another jar on here. This product is great. It is clearing up my skin while taking the oils out. It&#x27;s fading my old acne scars and it doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin. My skin in naturally dry so I use a moisturizer after but on normal skin, you should be fine. Definitely try this!</li>
            <li> I got a rash from using this so i stopped using it... It does bring out oils (you can see dark spots on your problem areas), but it didn&#x27;t bring up any black heads for me which is why i wanted the product in the first place. I would say it&#x27;s not as great as it&#x27;s made out to be but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Product probably works really well for most people.  If you have cystic acne, I do not recommend it.  It only aggravates the cysts.  I was far more broken out after using the mask.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitiant at first because of the price, but I am so glad I decided to buy this stuff!! I have light scarring and acne problems and have been using this mask for a about a month now and have a seen a HUGE HUGE imprvement in my skin. It has reduced my scarring and helped my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! It actually works. #amazing</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the one purchased from Sephora and also the paper the covers it was already opened when I received it i dont know what the deal is :/</li>
            <li> This is such a great mask.. And it&#x27;s way cheaper on Amazon compared to Sephora!  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several weeks 2-3 times per week.  I have seen no results.  My pores have no cleared at all, nor have they shrunk.  It&#x27;s very drying.  When I got it, the seal was leaking a bit, but it seemed more like this is just a small company without a good packaging process yet.  As an FYI, for those that saw this on Pintrest with the black spots you thought were oil coming to the surface.. no, there are bits and pieces of black (charcoal?) in the product.  That&#x27;s what you are seeing.</li>
            <li> I love the mask. It makes you feel nice and firm once its washed off. Surprisingly it lasts a long time for such a small jar. I would recommended it.</li>
            <li> Addicted to this mask . Amazing resutls from the first use</li>
            <li> Shipping as expected arrived on time. Item is new and sealed. I used it the day I got it. It is amazing! Love the way it made my skin feel. It cleaned most of my blackheads. It definitely makes a difference on you skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product.  Works well and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  Definitely better to buy it on amazon than pay the in store price!</li>
            <li> Amazing face mask!!! Came in manufacturer packaging and mask works great!! Been using it twice a week for last few weeks clears breakouts (i have very  mild ones to begin with) and makes my skin feel so clean yet smooth. Will be repurchasing!!!</li>
            <li> This mask is great! I use it at least 3 times a week and leave it on for about 20 min. When I wash it off my skin feels so much better and cleaner, and so many blackheads were gone. Whatever blackheads were left would either wipe off or just needed a little pressure to get rid of. After just a week my skin looked and felt a million times better, my pores were so small and I barely had any breakouts or pimples. Even better is that here on Amazon this product is a lot cheaper than I&#x27;ve seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Works well, but not sure if I would pay that much again for how little of an amount it gives though. Definitely could tell the difference in my skin though; it takes away redness, clears pores, and smooths. I only use a little amount every once in a while for it to last longer.</li>
            <li> my favorite face mask on the market. Leaves my face soo smooth after the first use!</li>
            <li> i am new to this product but will be buying it again.  i think it will be a good thing!</li>
            <li> This mud is a miracle in a jar! I have been using it for a few months now and really have noticed a difference in my complexion. It does dry out your problem areas so I tend to use it around the time of the month I start to get a little more oily and have break out issues. Works like a charm every time!</li>
            <li> It gave my face a clean feeling after use, but it didn&#x27;t clear all the blackheads. So I don&#x27;t feel this deserves a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> good for black heads !</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of clearing up my T-zone and hormonal cystic acne.  I was a little put off by the price but they say a little bit goes a long way.  It smells great, like I was getting a facial at a spa.  Even though it was kind of gross to see how much oil was being drawn from my skin, I liked to see that it was working so quickly.  I left it on for 20 minutes and after one use I can already notice a difference in the size of my pores and my skin feels so soft!  I am very happy with this purchase and will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> the product not new....</li>
            <li> I saw the product demonstrated on the TV show The Doctor&#x27;s.  They were raving, and their guinea pig looked pretty good;therefore I tried it.  I was wowed!  My skinned looked wonderful.  It actually glowed.  I went out to lunch later and did not wear make up.  All I heard were comments about how beautiful my skin looked.  These comments came from people who are used to me me looking attractive.  I noticed the difference and so did they.  I will be a continuing costumer.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!  Addicted!!!</li>
            <li> It sort of burns while it&#x27;s drying, and it&#x27;s definitely uncomfortable, but I was willing to put up with it if the mask did what it claimed.  It does sort of make my skin a little softer, but not enough to pay this much for this mask.  I did not notice any diminished pores on my nose, which is what I was hoping for.  The pores on my nose were still clogged after treating them with this mask twice.  It also gave me a massive infection when I accidentally got the product too close to the piercing in my nose.  Overall, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the product and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have ever used. I have horrible skin and this product has helped clear my skin more than other things I have tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really amazing!! It truly works and clears your skin quickly. I only wish I had purchased earlier!!</li>
            <li> I am using this mascara once a week. It&#x27;s very nice.I have a pore issue and I believe the product will help to diminish the problem.</li>
            <li> It did remove some of the blackheads on my nose, but left over 50% there. Not as effective as I hoped it would be. Definitely not worth the $50 I paid for it on amazon. Should be $10, because it should just be sold at walmart. It&#x27;s more effective than the products I have bought at walmart, because those had no effect what so ever, but this had a very little to no effect as well. Extremely disappointed. I had high hopes for this product and thought it would have a medium effectiveness at least. No such luck. I will continue to use the product simply because I paid for it, but would not recommend purchasing. It also says on the packaging you can leave on 5-20 minutes and let me be clear I left it on for the full 20 minutes, but could still clearly see blackheads everywhere. Nice size jar, but not worth the money. Oh and the scent lingers on your face. I&#x27;ve washed it several times and can still smell it.</li>
            <li> I purchased GlamGlow on here for cheaper than their website, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made!  It virtually erased my pores, and it shows black spots on the pimples that it is removing.  INCREDIBLE.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and worth the price. Not to mention it&#x27;s the cheapest I could find it. I noticed immediate results and will continue to buy this product. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!!!</li>
            <li> It is miniminze my pore. I tried to use it two days in a row and got my skin become sensitive. So I use it every three days, worked well on me. Smaller pore but not around my nose.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t be fooled by everything you read about this product &amp;#34;sucking the gunk out of your pores&amp;#34; and being able to see the stuff coming out right before your eyes. I got this yesterday and tried it, I left it on for 20 min and it did feel good on my face and smelled like mint meets licorice. I kept checking to see if I could see the dirt being pulled out and really all you see is where the mask turns a darker color over your pores but nothing comes out. I washed my face and it was very smooth afterwards  but I didn&#x27;t notice smaller pores or a whole new face like most people are saying :) its basically a nice mask that leaves you with a fresh face feeling but isnt a miracle working solution.</li>
            <li> I am not usually into beauty products but as I have gotten older I have developed a lot more dirt in my pores because of wearing make-up so often. I listened to all the reviews I had read- the first time you use this product you will be grossed out! This stuff will find all the dirty pores on your face! That is why it is so amazing. I use it every other day for spot treatments and my pores have diminished by half! After each use my face feels refreshed and smooth. I recommend this product and will continue to buy it! This product is around $65 in stores and I got it for $45 (shipping included) on amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of masks in the past, and I have to say, this is my all time favourite!!  This is a case where it does what it promises.  After the first use my skin felt extra clean and super soft, with the pores on my nose and chin barely visible.  Three days later and my skin still hasn&#x27;t been as oily as it was before.  People have commented on the smell, and I am a person who is very sensitive to smells, I get headaches if cosmetics or fragrances are too strong.  Super-Mud has a pleasant fragrance, which is barely noticeable - I had no problem with it whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mask, I just wish they would sell it in a larger container, but I guess the cost prevents them from doing so.  Give it a go - you will NOT regret it!!!</li>
            <li> Took the stubborn blackheads right off my face...worth the price!!  The longe you leave it on, the better it works...would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I dont know if this is normal, but my product was watery and had little hard lumps in it.&lt;br /&gt;Possibly old or stored improperly? Either way, tried it, noticed no results. Expected MUCH more for the cost.</li>
            <li> I saw this on the Doctors and thought I would try it.  I just finished the jar today and I see absolutely no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I llllooovvvveeee this stuff. But it is wwwwaaaayyyy too expensive, for such a small bottle. Also...when I received mine, the top layer was already semi-dried out. And when your applying it to your face, don&#x27;t leave the top off!!! It dries out even faster. I got to use almost half of this, while the other half was just unusable. I loved it, but they need to find a better container to put this in so it doesn&#x27;t dry out and get all crusty.</li>
            <li> Im very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This mask is fantastic! I love how you can literally watch the dirt being removed from your face even after washing it.  Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, it is the best skin clearing mask!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great. It helps so much with clearing up my acne. You don&#x27;t get a new face or a new layer of skin, like some people seem to expect from products, but this one sure makes a difference (however small) to me. Keep it on for the full 15-20 mins, add moisturizer when your finished depending on your skin type and your good to go!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I love love love how my face feels.</li>
            <li> Arrived in less than 2 days. Half-the price of sephora. unopened - legit product. I took the risk of getting something tampered or fake for the price, but it was in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far-the first time I put a thick layer all over my face - second time a used a thin layer. Pores were noticeable smaller and complexion looked wonderful ( I usually slather my face in liquid makeup in the morning and I haven&#x27;t had to use it the past 2 days, just some bare minerals and blush). It brought out some pimples that must have been deep down so I am waiting for those to clear up - even helped a little with acne scarring and pigmentation. I plan to use about once a week now that I have cleared out my pores. I&#x27;m very happy and surprised with this product. I will definitely order again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: it smells alright (not great) and feels weird (although not a bad weird) as it dries. Also, looks pretty cool when you have the specs all over your face.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li> Works great as a mask but even better as a spot treatment.  It clears out pores better than any other product I have tried, and you can see the proof on your face before you was it off (dark spots are residue sucked from pores).</li>
            <li> The box the product comes in, is huge compared to the actual product itself. A little product goes a long way  though. Totally worth the money I think because it cleared my breakup in only two days.&lt;br /&gt;I lift my treatment on for 20 mins for two nights.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it it was cheaper, but I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a superb mask for all over oil control &amp; pore shrinking. Use it prior to a night out or to freshen your skin for an all day fresh feeling. Great for spot treatment on underground zits or stubborn blackheads. Love this product!</li>
            <li> First off it has never done the &amp;#34;pulling out&amp;#34; o&#x27; the blackheads, etc. like the website states.  It works like the Tingling &amp; Exfoliating Mud Mask does without the tingling to it.  I am in my forties and still going through the break out prone skin issues and was hoping this would work as well as the Glam Glow mud product does but it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ll stick with the little black bottle!</li>
            <li> when you see the gross pictures online you think- this has got to be great. when you put it on you get the satisfaction of what looks like all the stuff is being pulled out of your pores. when you wash it off your skin does look fresh, soft and shiny - and your makeup&lt;br /&gt;goes on beautifully. But in reality - nothing has been pulled out of your pores - you just have some nice clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;for the price and results i would not buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;one more case of hope springs eternal.</li>
            <li> 4 rates. I like it although it&#x27;s not excellent as people says. Definitely, I look energetic after i use it.</li>
            <li> I would not order this again because of the cost, but it works and I use it sparingly-it does smell slightly odd.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...non drying to skin. I would highly recommend this product  for a brighter appearance and youthful look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like my skin is any different, like it does anything at all? Gave 3 stars just cuz it&#x27;s a nice mask when I want to relax. I really don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about over this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used prime and got my mask in 2 days. I was really excited after reading all the reviews. The packaging was nice ,but it is a small jar. Any who, the product was black and goopy and spread a little on m checks and chin. I laid down and accidentally fell asleep for four hours. So I jumped up washed my face and I was pleased with the results . my texture looked immediately better. I have super super oily skin with large pores so I&#x27;m always looking for something to work with my skin. I am going to continue to use this mask every other day and leave it on for about an hour and update with my results. So far I&#x27;m please d. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so high for a small jar</li>
            <li> i think the formula is different . i brought one in hk store , which contained more leaves than the one from here . And this is more watery then i used before.Also i cannot feel its functions.  i&#x27;m afraid to use it now-_-</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I&#x27;ve used it twice as a full facial mask.  Either my skin was as not in as bad of shape as I thought or it&#x27;s not doing what I expected. I have large pores and they seem.</li>
            <li> What a waste of hard-earned money! This cream does NOT clean out your pours. All of our noses have pores and when you put any mask on the pores show up. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Please.</li>
            <li> I am a total cynic and didn&#x27;t hold high hopes for this product.  WOW, was I wrong!  This Super-Mud left my skin squeaky clean and my pores visibly smaller.  I have experimented with many, many products in my many years, and I have never seen one that made my pores visibly smaller!  My skin looks like fine porcelain.  In fact, it took hours before my skin had enough natural oil for me to apply powder!  I rarely give 5 Stars, but GlamGlow Super-Mud absolutely earned all 5 of them.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using glam glow 3times a week for about a month and it makes my skin feel great. Every time I use it I can see what it is pulling out of my pores and after my skin feels smooth and my pores are smaller. However it has also pulled things to the surface and created a lot of bumps that are yet to disappear and it hasn&#x27;t worked too well on my acne.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used.  It does exactly what it claims.  My pores are clean and smaller than before use.  I love it!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I love this stuff! It goes on well, dries quickly, smells great, and does what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do. And I love seeing my pores clean themselves out. It assures you that it&#x27;s doing its job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before by ordering from another company.  I paid $20 less and arrived in good condition through Amazon.  This product has a tendency to dry out if you are not careful in keeping the lid tight and just over time. It arrived from this company with the silver foil intact and the product very moist as it should be.  Glamglow clearing treatment works well clearing my acne and makes my skin look younger and brighter.  I always have compliments the days I use this product.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> skin definitely feels clean after use! washing it off is a bit more difficult though after leaving it on for a while.</li>
            <li> Read many reviews about how amazing this product was, and decided to try it, while silently praying it truly worked because it is very pricey..let me tell you it is AMAZING! I had a lot of blackhead that were very deep and no matter how much i cleaned my face, tried to remove them or used the biore strips, they never went away. The first time i used it i though i was burning my face off, until it began to dry and could see the little spots of gunk that were pulled from my pores, i was horrified. I have been using this twice a week and you would not believe how my blackheads have disappeared. The ones that have not been cleaned out, have surfaced and are no longer deep and easier to remove myself! I know the bottle is small, but you only need a little bit and it will go a long way!</li>
            <li> Love this mask it&#x27;s great for those pesky blackheads on your nose!!! I have acne prone skin and this helped a lot! It didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout, I know a few people had that happen after using the product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I understand the hype behind this product. I purchased this product from amazon because the price was better than sephora. I used the entire container and noticed no difference in my acne, blackheads, whiteheads or oiliness. The mask tingles a bit when you first out it on and it dries to a blue color with holes where apparently your pores were cleaned out. Didn&#x27;t notice anything except that my skin felt softer the day off and after. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Firms and  reduces pores.</li>
            <li> Excellent.. I loved it</li>
            <li> Some people said that they got this product and it had been tampered with. Mine was not tampered with at all. The shipping was excellent,  even though it was standard, it still came early. The product itself was amazing,  and it was easily the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried. I washed my face just like any other person would do, and applied a very thin layer. It started to tingle around the tops of my cheeks immediately, and dried within a few minutes. I previously had blackheads around my nose and on my chin before using this product, but when I washes the product off, they were gone. I will definitely use this product again and again, and I recommend this for anybody that is insecure about their skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. Black heads are still there.&lt;br /&gt;It went straight to the garbage can.&lt;br /&gt;Aztec secret - Healing Clay is way better than this.</li>
            <li> This mud treatment is spectacular! It draws the gunk from my pores out and leaves me with fresh clear skin. In fact, I used it as a spot treatment on someone else to unclog a really clogged pore and it worked fabulously. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Bummed. Pretty sure that this is not legit as the foil seal is definitely different than the official package that I got from Sephora. The foil seal on official is stamped with &amp;#34;GlamGlow&amp;#34; and this one says &amp;#34;For Your Protection&amp;#34;.  And, as another reviewer noted, the smell is slightly different.  The entire package, which is the worst thing about this product, official or otherwise, as it is way over-zealous and wasteful, was ever superfluous but lacking the plastic sealing.&lt;br /&gt;The original, while expensive, is AMAZING, and hey, its less expensive than a facial considering that you will get several uses out of it.  My recommendation is to save your money and buy the real deal.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I saw this on pintrest. Looked it up and did a little home work. Placed order. WE LOVE IT! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice a week for ?? 3 almost 4 weeks now I think and my scars are slowly fading away my pores were really big like someone had poked my face with toothpicks and now I hardly notice them. Definitely worth the money :D</li>
            <li> So you will look like some creature from the blue lagoon wannabe when using this - but that&#x27;s ok.  It feels great, you can see it working, and your skin will feel smooth, clean, and fresh after.  Other users have whined about the smell but come on people - you&#x27;re rubbing mud that has antioxidants in it on your face.  Do you think it will smell like ice cream?  The smell is really not offensive at all.  It smells like exactly what it is - mud rubbed on your face.  If the idea of smelling mud repulses you, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be buying a mud masque.  I am very happy with the product though, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is a very tiny bottle but rest assured - a little goes a long way.  I was skeptical - I opened it up and thought &amp;#34;this will last me 1 maybe 2 uses&amp;#34;... not so at all.  I have used it about 15 times now with covering my entire face and I still have about half of the bottle remaining.  You don&#x27;t goop it on - you spread a thin layer.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it - I have very oily skin and this really helps me to manage it.</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne. I am 22 and have had acne since I was 12/13. From all that acne came scaring and really bad uneven skin. It was so bad I would hate to go out in public and put pounds of makeup on my face to hide it. This has made my pores smaller just after 3 uses!! It has also helped with my acne and the scaring. This stuff it AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Very true to its hype. Love it, Love it, Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids use it all the time too. Awesome</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of difference within 3 uses. My skin is softer than ever and I hardly ever break out now. It reduces a lot of redness as well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> First off, i loved it. Smells like Eucalyptus. Mud is a bit grittier than i would have expected, but it&#x27;s not a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;It works by absorbing oil over your pores. The mud goes on black/green then dries pale green except where the oil is preventing it from drying (spots). My skin had a great feeling afterward and my skin didn&#x27;t break out. Wish the entire box was full of this stuff. You only get a little bit for a lot of money, but for a special occasion, this was fabulous. I&#x27;m going to give this to my sister for her bachlorette party.</li>
            <li> So all the reviews on here are very misleading.  I bought this product because after reading the reviews I really believed it would clear my blackheads, silly me!  This product is expensive (and even more expensive in Sephora) and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it makes my skin feel tight while its on and after I do notice my skin is softer, but honestly this product is really not worth it.  If you&#x27;ve tried everything like me to get rid of blackheads, this mask will most likely not work for you!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t even noticed a decrease in the amount of blackheads on my nose!  This doesn&#x27;t work for regular acne either, too bad I was really hoping this would be a great mask!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the gunk just oozing out of my pores. Not so much. I even steamed my face the second time to open up my pores in an effort to assist the de-gunking process. No luck.  I didn&#x27;t get any miracle pore cleansing BUT it seemed to tighten them up and give an overall nice facial feeling temporarily. It&#x27;s a decent product. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It tingles yes but will work wonders for your skin!</li>
            <li> This product came to me opened, clearly it was used. I am so disgusted by this, I will purchase at Sephora&#x27;s next time.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!  Glam Glow  was recommended to me by a friend a my nail salon, and I am so glad I decided to try it. This product is EXCELLENT in getting rid on pimples, and especially at the onset of a breakout. I LOVEEEEE chocolate, but whenever I have a piece of chocolate, I always have a breakout...ugh! but with Glam Glow, I place a dab of it on the pimple, and I can feel the tingle as it goes to work on attacking the problem, the next day, the outbreak is pretty much history. This product can also be used as an all over face and neck mask.  I love and need to buy more soon. The negative to this product is that its costly, and very small amounts, but it WORKS!</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to this stuff! It really works!</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t think it is brand new...</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product I read a ton of reviews on it because I like to know what I&#x27;m buying before I actually spend a lot of money on it. I was super excited and I was telling all my friends about it and when it finally came in the mail I wanted to try it immediately and I did. The first few times was okay and then I started breaking out. At first, based on the reviews I had read, I thought it was normal but it&#x27;s been 2 months and my skin only seems to be getting worse and worse. I am so disappointed and so upset because I used to have fairly good skin and now I have AWFUL skin. I wish I could take it all back and I wish I would&#x27;ve never used this mask. The only reason I gave it one star is because it smells good and feels refreshing when it&#x27;s on. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all. Most awful purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Good quality, shipping very fast!</li>
            <li> My product was not opened &amp; I love how it takes the oil out if my face! I do I once a week &amp; only have the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> I really like using this mask. I have oily skin &amp; a lot of blackheads. While I don&#x27;t see it actually pulling stuff out like other users have said, I can tell a difference after a couple of uses. If my face is broke out I use this  3-4 days and it&#x27;s completely cleared, which says a lot since I have cystic acne/pimples . I have fewer blackheads so long as I keep using the mask.  I will absolutely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product at first but it gave me skin irritation after the second use so I had to stop using it. I was really bummed.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, and great price! This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!!! Love it. In the span of me using it ( which hasn&#x27;t been that long) it has balanced my skin and it brightens it as well.I work alot and it has helped me not look so tired.who could ask for anything else?</li>
            <li> Small, expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper on here then anywhere else!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift by request. I was very happy with the results of this product!!! 5 star happy, but after reading everyone&#x27;s reviews about the jar being opened I think mine had been opened Previously too. :(  I think I was just too excited to try it out to really notice or think anything fishy of it.</li>
            <li> I have only used it three times, but so far, so good!  This product came just as described and is the same stuff you can find in sephora, at just a fraction of the cost (YES!!!!).  It&#x27;s tingly and tightening when you put it on, and afterward, my skin feels amazing!  I recommend that you give it a shot, especially at the Amazon prices!</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles! My face is no longer very red in my T zone, and I don&#x27;t break out during my time of the month (which I ALWAYS do). It makes my skin so smooth and soft and clear. My complexion is almost flawless.</li>
            <li> I was a little sticker shocked with the price but I read all the reviews and decided to try it. I have problem skin and one pimple that I have been battling for days, a little bit of this stuff and it killed that pimple. Plus the rest of my skin looks amazing just after one use.</li>
            <li> Brand new sealed and everything! Very happy I will be ordering from here for now on!</li>
            <li> This product is used and its not authenticity，it&#x27;s been opened and the inside is dirty, don&#x27;t buy it from here, it&#x27;s cheap for a reason!!!</li>
            <li> GlamGlow makes my face feel amazing! I use it once a week and my skin looks great. It removed everything from my pores, made my skin feel nice and refreshed. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I&#x27;ve used this same jar 4x already and still have 1/2 a jar left. Not so bad for my money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Better price than Sephora and brand new.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on the overall effectiveness of this product, because I didn&#x27;t make it that far. When I applied the mask to my face, I instantly became nauseous due to the wretched smell of this stuff. It literally smelled like a diaper pail. I had to take it off right away because the smell was so horrid, and I washed my face three times afterwards until I couldn&#x27;t smell the foul odor anymore. It&#x27;s possible I got a bad batch, but I don&#x27;t plan on shelling out another $69 to find out.</li>
            <li> You can seriously see the gunk getting pulled out of your pores, just like on the video on their website. My skin felt amazing after the first use and I&#x27;ve used it a couple more times since then over the last week. In that time, I have no more blackheads on my nose ( which I&#x27;ve had since my teens) and i was suffering from a terrible breakout on my chin that would just not go away, but after 3 uses, it&#x27;s pretty much cleared up :) and my skin is glowing. Basically every woman should own this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product for some but unfortunately not for me. I have sensitive combination skin and doing mask treatment would only irritate my skin. I use as spot treatment and works moderately well.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews stating the product they received was used/opened, I did have some concerns. However, this was not the case with my order. The white box the mask comes in was sealed and included all the original product information. The jar containing the product featured a foil seal ensuring the product was new and completed sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally received a small sample from Sephora and knew after one use I had to purchase this. I have used a lot of face washes/masks in my time and NOTHING compares to Glamglow Super-Mud! I suffer from hyper pigmentation, blackheads, and oily skin, this mask addresses all those problems and then some. I apply this mask to my clean face, let it sit for 15-20 mins, and rinse. Upon rinsing off the mask I am left with soft, firm, and clearer skin. My favorite part about this mask? You can actually see it working! As this mask dries, you can see all the impurities being pulled from your pores. I saw great results after one use and continue to see the benefits with each use.</li>
            <li> This product did make my skin soft, but saying that it does anything other than that wasn&#x27;t true for me. I was hoping it would clean out and shrink my pores like it claimed, but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all. If you&#x27;re looking for it do that, I&#x27;d try a different product. It was unfortunate, I was so excited at it&#x27;s potential.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel great, does not clear blackheads. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 6 months twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out all the time! After using this product for 2 days there was a noticeable difference! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I did have some dark spots on my nose and chin once the mask dried that resembled oil. My husband used on his nose and he had the same outcome. The mask dried fairly hard and left my skin a little dry but nothin my favorite moisturizer could not fix. My skin did not looked like my pores where all sucked clean. I still had a lot of blocked pools on my nose and chin that probably can only be removed by extraction by an estatition or dermatologist.  I will repurchase as I have been on the lookout for a mud mask. The price is on the high side  at $70 for a small container. I kept watching amazon and the price dropped to $44 and I snagged myself a container.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is very effective.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the high price.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but thought why not, purchased this and it really does work great! My skin was smoother after my 1st use. Its a small bottle but you really don&#x27;t use much so make a little go a long way. Makes the $$ more worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is okay...after using it it leaves my face smooth, and it does give me a nice glow but as far as clearing up acne and blackheads this product just did not work for me. I have big pores and I don&#x27;t notice any difference in the size or appearance of them either. I use it every other day and havent seen a change in my skin at all. I&#x27;d just say this product isn&#x27;t for people who really have acne or blackheads. Its a good mask but not for clearing up skin as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I use this product two to three times a week, pre- or post-shower.  I generally leave it on for 20 minutes or longer, cover the whole face or just the problem areas if I am in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GLAMGLOW Mud has certainly made a difference, especially in clearing out the pores on my nose.  It does a good job of removing oil and dirt, as well as minimizing pores.  It is fairly gentle.  You might notice a tingle or slight sting if you have a pimple you&#x27;ve been picking at that&#x27;s a little raw.  Otherwise, I have had no issues with sensitivity and my face is always calm and smooth after a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely worth the money - I probably get about 10 treatments per jar.  After all, you aren&#x27;t loading half the jar onto your face: a thin layer will do the trick!  It does what it says it will do AND you get the perverse pleasure of seeing the oil from your face seep up to the surface of the mask - a must for all weirdos who take strange pleasure in seeing things like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to know that a clearing mask WILL cause you to break out in a day or two.  This is part of its job: bringing bacteria and debris to the surface so that it can rid your face of these issues.  A lot of people will be upset when a mask does this and insist that it&#x27;s a bad product or not doing it&#x27;s job, but that is why these masks work so well.  What you will see is that, when used regularly, you will get beyond the triggered breakouts and enter a state where your skin is healthier and clean and you can use the mask without breakouts.  You have to endure a few treatments followed by breakouts to see results, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding results! Worth having! Love the results!</li>
            <li> Worth all the hype! you can definitely see all the gunk being pulled out of your pores. Leaves your face feeling so clean and refreshed. I&#x27;ll definitely be re-purchasing once it runs out.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing!!</li>
            <li> After hearing all the hype about glam glow I had to try it. I&#x27;ve always had problem blackheads that I can&#x27;t get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;It works nicely and you can really see it pulling the gunk out of your pores. Leaves your skin supet soft and healthy. I expected it to work a little better for the price. Like one application and zap no more blackheads but thats not the case. Theres difinite improvement each time so im hoping by the time the jar is gone i get the results i was hoping for.</li>
            <li> love this!!!  didnt come dried up or open.. it does what it days it does and i simply love it!! i use in once every 3 weeks and spot control...</li>
            <li> Very good mask, I love it, and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I am still playing around with this product, but so far it seems to work quite well with my skin. Certainly is different from other masks I have tried but I really like the results during and after use.</li>
            <li> I have the worst pores!  GlamGlow has helped clear them out &amp; give me soft and smooth skin!  Just ordered my second jar!</li>
            <li> Very cool to see the stuff that comes out of your pores float to the surface - leaves skin smooth immediately after, but I do not see this product doing anything of real value for my skin.</li>
            <li> What I love about this:  when you rinse it off, your skin is SO soft.  I love it.  I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;m supposed to use it so I just do it once or twice a week.  I&#x27;d use it every day if I had enough of it.  I immediately moisturize afterwards.  It&#x27;s dark gray and dries to a lighter gray.  Not hard to rinse off but still a little messy.  Good product!</li>
            <li> This product is not for me, it makes my skin itchy, dry, and I got lots small bumps on my forehead since I used it. I can&#x27;t finish using it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Does not do as indicated. A completely ridiculous description of what this does. Please, save your money.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! I saw a huge difference after the first use and now my skin looks so clear! I use it as sot treatment on my nose and chin. A must have!</li>
            <li> I freaking love this product, after one use all of my blackheads were pretty much gone!!!!I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should spend so much on a product if I didn&#x27;t know how it work because on the website it was about $70 and when I saw it on here I had to get it. Best mask yet!!!</li>
            <li> I like it well enough it didn&#x27;t suck black heads out of pores like video said but as a clay mask it worked well and its small enough to travel with and make it through airport security so I can travel with it</li>
