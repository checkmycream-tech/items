            <li>However the quality of the hair is awesome just the packaging and</li>
            <li>America(n) Ladder had a not so pleasant scent!..</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>she said the wefts were in great shape.</li>
            <li>and I just straightened it and it looks great and blends well .</li>
            <li>I am giving this hair 5 stars because I know for a fact that this hair is GREAT.</li>
            <li>WAS GREAT</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risks!</li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe the good reviews were paid for</li>
            <li>This hair looked good until I washed it....</li>
            <li>You would be better off going to the beauty supply store buying a pack of Milky Way!</li>
            <li>The wave pattern in the hair was more of a square pattern probably of the packaging idk!..</li>
            <li>It straightens nice and it curls (use hair rollers) .</li>
            <li>It was okay,</li>
            <li>I was okay with product</li>
            <li>and maybe more</li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re able to get it refunded because I didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s still sitting in my closet.</li>
            <li>Some were really great and some not so much.</li>
            <li>WIL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I think is the most important part</li>
            <li>was scared at first but will most def be ordering again whenever i need more hair.</li>
            <li>When I got this hair extensions it was looking fine but as soon as I washed it, it messed up.</li>
            <li>And I got free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>There are some good things about this hair but the cons FAR outweigh the pros in this case.</li>
            <li>I know if you get the GOOD hair it should last up to a year or more and that what mines seem to be doing</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t as long as I asked for and the quality was not that great.</li>
            <li>and I ordered it right from here!</li>
            <li>So I got my hair on the expected date which was great</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was true to length.</li>
            <li>I got a full refund</li>
            <li>Its been and still is a great journey with this weave, but now im back here to order more for back up whenever this weave wears out</li>
            <li>received it earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package, hair was beautiful and felt amazingly soft</li>
            <li>It felt nice and soft at first</li>
            <li>but after the first wash, its a wrap!  </li>
            <li>I RECIEVED THE HAIR YESTERDAY AND WAS SO EXCITED TO HAVE MADE MY FIRST VENDOR HAIR PURCHASE, I OPENED THE PACKAGE</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS WHAT GOT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE I TRY TO LOOK GOOD ON A DIME, BUT WITH HAIR YOU HAVE TO REALLY PUT OUT THE EXTRA MONEY</li>
            <li>it is a different type of hair more remy and its only nice for so long&lt;</li>
            <li>Im absolutely in love with this hair, and Im sure Ill be able to use it again.</li>
            <li>ALL THE HAIR IS PRETTY</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 bundles to make sure it was legit got them from different sellers</li>
            <li>Also one bundle had so many grey strands</li>
            <li>Had no issues, hair did not tangle, super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really plan to straighten it or dye it.</li>
            <li>It does look and feel like the real deal</li>
            <li>So there is no reason why it should be shedding as much as it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get bone straight</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy some real virgin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really think it depends on which vendor you buy the hair from.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really recommend to somebody</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t shed too much.</li>
            <li>BUT WHAT REALLY MADE ME UPSET WAS, IT HAD WHICH LOOKED LIKE</li>
            <li>AS MUCH AS I CHANGE MY HAIR,</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>tangled up 2 days after I installed it, it only looked nice for only one day</li>
            <li>This hair was exactly what I wanted, I have had it seen in for a little more then 3 weeks</li>
            <li>2 packs was enough for a full.</li>
            <li>This hair is very soft, it doesn&#x27;t tangle, falls back to its originally hair pattern when washed, blends well with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>Wig Fashion Inc iss Excelllenttt soo get your hair from that particular seller...</li>
            <li>highly doubt its virgin hair.</li>
            <li>honestly was worried about this hair due to mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>The first bundle measured about 1 &amp; 1/2 cross body arm lengths.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft, light, and blends PREFECTLY with my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>not a lot of shedding or tangling so far .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a professional licensed stylist I&#x27;ve used and worked with a lot of extensions</li>
            <li>The second barely reach 1 full cross body arm length.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd time purchasing this product, and also my absolute last.</li>
            <li>So far this is just my second day with the sew in.</li>
            <li>I was almost positive that the hair would matt up before the third day and my money would be wasted but Its day three</li>
            <li>, please dont waste you money, i cant stress this enough, in the trash it goes, i was able to get refund for both orders, so its a relief to know my hard earned money didnt go into the trash.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Initial wave does return after washes and flat irons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AS IF SOMEONE TOOK A BLACK MARKER AND MARKED ALL OVER MY DESK</li>
            <li> Customer service is great, too bad the hair was not!</li>
            <li> No more than my natural hair) and the curl pattern bounces back every time I pull it out of my two strand twists in the morning.</li>
            <li> Clearly not 100 grams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO RUN WATER ON THE ENDS AND WAITED FOR IT TO DRY</li>
            <li> AND THEY WERE SO DRY AND BRITTLE.</li>
            <li> There were little red and baige things sticking to the 12 inch hair when I took it out of the bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though they were the same length, one bundle had much less hair than the other.</li>
            <li> Its not really brazillian hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;After a couple emails, the company did give me a partial refund.</li>
            <li> The hair came saying it is unprocessed</li>
            <li> AND IT FELT GRIDDY AND ROUGH</li>
            <li> It started to shed after a month and when washed the dye would come out but other than that it did its job</li>
            <li> An the shedding is at minimal!.</li>
            <li> so it looks a little frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> There has been very minimal shedding (</li>
            <li> Does anyone know any other ways I can make it look shiny and less frizzy?</li>
            <li> but it has been dyed black because I washed it and noticed the color from washing it.  </li>
            <li> and it had black dye in it</li>
            <li> Black dye was running from the hair.</li>
            <li> I still went ahead and installed it, it&#x27;s been less than 1 week install, and it is already tangling.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I WENT TO RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH IT, AND THE AMOUNT OF SHEDDING WAS A MESS, I RECIEVED THE PACKAGE</li>
            <li> I am so upset that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The hair was stiff.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m annoyed and disappointed was hoping it would be able to be re-installed.</li>
            <li> very little shedding during wash.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I was slightly skeptical as I read every single review.</li>
            <li> She had her hair in for two weeks and it was horrible and tangled, it looked a hot mess.</li>
            <li> Also one of my petpeeves about buying expensive hair is I don&#x27;t expect it to shed.</li>
            <li> WHICH IS SAD BECAUAE</li>
            <li> i would not recommend this hair at all and my wefts were sealed and it still shed like crazy</li>
            <li> I see a couple of people saying that the hair they received is bad</li>
            <li> THAT WAS HOW BAD THE SHEDDING WAS.</li>
            <li> This hair shed worse than beauty supply hair!!!</li>
            <li> What a WASTE of money!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and it tangles terribly.</li>
            <li> The worst hair I&#x27;ve ever received!</li>
            <li> hair sheds horribly.</li>
            <li> It tangled and shed horribly!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It was okay, It started to shed after a month and when washed the dye would come out but other than that it did its job I was okay with product</li>
            <li> Had no issues, hair did not tangle, super soft and manageable. was scared at first but will most def be ordering again whenever i need more hair. ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> So far this is just my second day with the sew in. very little shedding during wash. I got two packs of 16\\&quot; got it layered by my stylist. and then cut it a bit shorter myself at home. Now it&#x27;s about 14-15\\&quot; . honestly was worried about this hair due to mixed reviews.My stylist was impressed by the hair and the price. she said the wefts were in great shape. 2 packs was enough for a full. I don&#x27;t really plan to straighten it or dye it. but if I do straighten it I will come back with a update on that as well .  Pay attention to sellers I think is the most important part I got mine from wig fashion . inc And I got free 2 day shipping. I hope it lasts 6-8 weeks and maybe more I will have to see !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 week update. and I just straightened it and it looks great and blends well . not a lot of shedding or tangling so far .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost at 3 weeks. and it tangles terribly. I can stretch it to make it my 6-8 weeks I THINK. It straightens nice and it curls (use hair rollers) . and I wash it with pantene conditioner. It was good while it lasted. But I&#x27;m annoyed and disappointed was hoping it would be able to be re-installed.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews but it had a overall 4 star rating so I purchased. This hair is in no shape or form any type of human, Indian, malaysian nor brazilian hair!!! You would be better off going to the beauty supply store buying a pack of Milky Way! It does look and feel like the real deal but after the first wash, its a wrap!  Lesson learned, you get what you pay for but even at this price it is still a rip off! Please save your money.  Geico please everybody.</li>
            <li> The worst hair I&#x27;ve ever received! I am so upset that I wasted my money. The hair isn&#x27;t the length it&#x27;s suppose to be. It&#x27;s NOT soft and doesn&#x27;t feel or look like human hair. Whoever likes this hair either don&#x27;t know about quality hair or the work for Foxy because I can&#x27;t see why someone will put this garbage in their heads. My friend bought hair from this company the same time I did. She got her hair installed but obviously I got bundles from somewhere else. She had her hair in for two weeks and it was horrible and tangled, it looked a hot mess. My hair still held up and lasted months because it wasn&#x27;t this Foxy hair. Buy at your own risks! Make sure you&#x27;re able to get it refunded because I didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s still sitting in my closet.</li>
            <li> Its not really brazillian hair it is a different type of hair more remy and its only nice for so long&lt;br /&gt;It sheds and tangles</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I was slightly skeptical as I read every single review. Some were really great and some not so much. I thought that maybe the good reviews were paid for but I decided to throw caution to the wind and purchase. I was almost positive that the hair would matt up before the third day and my money would be wasted but Its day three and I have had not one issue. The hair is soft, light, and blends PREFECTLY with my dark brown hair. There has been very minimal shedding (No more than my natural hair) and the curl pattern bounces back every time I pull it out of my two strand twists in the morning. I have yet to wash or straighten it, But that will happen within the next 3 days so I will be posting another comment then. Im absolutely in love with this hair, and Im sure Ill be able to use it again. Thank you for a beautiful and affordable product!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing this product, and also my absolute last. There are some good things about this hair but the cons FAR outweigh the pros in this case. I installed this hair on a dome cap to make a u-part wig. This is what i experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;I received it earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package, hair was beautiful and felt amazingly soft&lt;br /&gt;It took well to a dye.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a curl all day when curled by flexi rods.&lt;br /&gt;Initial wave does return after washes and flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;It was true to length. I ordered 2 bundles of 16 inches which measured to about 17 inches when stretched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;This hair sheds horribly. I did seal the wefts with fray check after i co washed it. I also did not cut my wefts when making the wig. So there is no reason why it should be shedding as much as it does.&lt;br /&gt;It tangles like there is no tomorrow, especially around the nape area.&lt;br /&gt;It does get bone straight when flat ironed but doesn&#x27;t last long, it waves back up within a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;Color of the hair was definitely #2 and not a #1b&lt;br /&gt;Although the waves returned after washing, the hair no longer had body.&lt;br /&gt;Though they were the same length, one bundle had much less hair than the other. The first bundle measured about 1 &amp; 1/2 cross body arm lengths. The second barely reach 1 full cross body arm length. Clearly not 100 grams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;I highly doubt its virgin hair. I co-washed it upon receipt and the water was brown which leaves me to believe that it was dyed and processed. Because it sheds and tangles SO MUCH i would not recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ve had beauty supply store hair that lasted longer than this hair  Save your money and buy some real virgin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;After a couple emails, the company did give me a partial refund. Customer service is great, too bad the hair was not!</li>
            <li> I am giving this hair 5 stars because I know for a fact that this hair is GREAT. let me explain....guys I brought my hair in the beginning of AUGUST 2012 !!! And I am still wearing it now ( FEBRUARY 2013). This hair is very soft, it doesn&#x27;t tangle, falls back to its originally hair pattern when washed, blends well with relaxed hair. Its been and still is a great journey with this weave, but now im back here to order more for back up whenever this weave wears out which seems to be NEVER! I see a couple of people saying that the hair they received is bad but I really think it depends on which vendor you buy the hair from. I know if you get the GOOD hair it should last up to a year or more and that what mines seem to be doing and I ordered it right from here!</li>
            <li> I OMBRE IT BEFORE INSTALLING IT, NO CHANGE IN TEXTURE AT ALL THE HAIR IS PRETTY HAS NOT TANGLE I LOV IT&lt;br /&gt;I READ A LOT OF COMMENTS BUT I MUST SAY, PLEASE BELIEVE ME NEVER BUY STORE BROUGHT HAIR BUY THIS HAIR&lt;br /&gt;YOU WIL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this hair!! There were little red and baige things sticking to the 12 inch hair when I took it out of the bag. I washed it but whatever it was it did not come off the hair. Also one of my petpeeves about buying expensive hair is I don&#x27;t expect it to shed. This hair shed worse than beauty supply hair!!! What a WASTE of money!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> tangled up 2 days after I installed it, it only looked nice for only one day I wouldn&#x27;t get this again</li>
            <li> When I got this hair extensions it was looking fine but as soon as I washed it, it messed up. I can&#x27;t really recommend to somebody</li>
            <li> The hair I recieved was NOT what I was expecting at all. it wasn&#x27;t as long as I asked for and the quality was not that great. The hair was stiff. It felt nice and soft at first but when I washed it, it really got stiff. It tangled and shed horribly!!!! I am a professional licensed stylist I&#x27;ve used and worked with a lot of extensions and I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> This hair was exactly what I wanted, I have had it seen in for a little more then 3 weeks and it doesn&#x27;t shed too much. I have not washed it so it looks a little frizzy and dry. I plan on wanding it tonight. Hopefully that will help. Does anyone know any other ways I can make it look shiny and less frizzy?</li>
            <li> The hair came saying it is unprocessed but it has been dyed black because I washed it and noticed the color from washing it.  I sealed the weft to stop shedding so that helps.  Also one bundle had so many grey strands it was unreal.</li>
            <li> It shed by the handful I got a full refund and it had black dye in it when I co washed the hair i would not recommend this hair at all and my wefts were sealed and it still shed like crazy</li>
            <li> This hair looked good until I washed it.... Black dye was running from the hair. I still went ahead and installed it, it&#x27;s been less than 1 week install, and it is already tangling.&lt;br /&gt;This is not virgin hair. I would not buy from this seller again. I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> So I got my hair on the expected date which was great I ordered 2 bundles to make sure it was legit got them from different sellers the one from America(n) Ladder had a not so pleasant scent!.. The wave pattern in the hair was more of a square pattern probably of the packaging idk!.. It hass a lot of gray strands even had a red one as well!.. However the quality of the hair is awesome just the packaging and oh weft (track) is messed up its not even done properly but I&#x27;m a hair stylist so I can make it work to my advantage I will update this review whenever I install the hair in... The next bundle that I got from Wig Fashion Inc iss Excelllenttt soo get your hair from that particular seller... An the shedding is at minimal!. I&#x27;ll be back in two weeks or so I&#x27;ll order an next 2 bundles an have the hair installed an let you know the results okay Bellas!..&lt;br /&gt;XoXo! Byee!</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED THE HAIR YESTERDAY AND WAS SO EXCITED TO HAVE MADE MY FIRST VENDOR HAIR PURCHASE, I OPENED THE PACKAGE AND IT LOOKED AS PIC THAT WAS THE ONLY PLUS. I FELT THE HAIR AND IT FELT GRIDDY AND ROUGH, IT SMELLED LIKE PLASTIC WHICH I UNDERSTOOD BECASUE IT WAS IN PLASTIC. I WENT TO RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH IT, AND THE AMOUNT OF SHEDDING WAS A MESS, I RECIEVED THE PACKAGE AT WORK SO I WAS SITTING AT MY DESK WHICH IS WHITE AND IT LOOKED AS IF SOMEONE TOOK A BLACK MARKER AND MARKED ALL OVER MY DESK THAT WAS HOW BAD THE SHEDDING WAS. IT HAD A LOT OF SPLIT ENDS. BUT WHAT REALLY MADE ME UPSET WAS, IT HAD WHICH LOOKED LIKE CLOTHES FUZ I PULLED OUT ABOUT 5, I HOPE THATS WHAT IT WAS ALL I COULD THINK IS THAT IT COULD OF BEEN,YUK . I WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO RUN WATER ON THE ENDS AND WAITED FOR IT TO DRY AND THEY WERE SO DRY AND BRITTLE. I ENDED UP PUTTING THE HAIR IN TWO PLASTIC BAGS AND TRASHING IT. LADIES PLEASE AVOID THIS HAIR. THE PRICE IS WHAT GOT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE I TRY TO LOOK GOOD ON A DIME, BUT WITH HAIR YOU HAVE TO REALLY PUT OUT THE EXTRA MONEY AND I HAVE TO ALWAYS SAY TO MYSELF YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I CONTACTED THE COMPANY AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT WHICH IS SAD BECAUAE I WOULD OF BEEN ALONG TIME CUSTOMER AS MUCH AS I CHANGE MY HAIR, BUT I WILL GO ANOTHER ROUTE WHEN IT COMES TO HAIR.*******update*****recieved the second pack of hair today and it had alot of gray hairs in it, please dont waste you money, i cant stress this enough, in the trash it goes, i was able to get refund for both orders, so its a relief to know my hard earned money didnt go into the trash. Thanks Amazon.</li>
