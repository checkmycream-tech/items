            <li>I love the flavor of this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more like a pleasant dinner mint sort of feel..</li>
            <li>Great natural toothpaste and very good flavor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wake up with morning breath either which is an amazing</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a fluoride free product and this one seems great.</li>
            <li>It has a great mint flavor, smooth texture and no after taste.</li>
            <li>Happy that it&#x27;s fluoride and gluten free.</li>
            <li>Kind of like when you add some flour to a liquid, it is still liquid but a thicker consistency.  </li>
            <li>Nice and minty.</li>
            <li>Nice mellow mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Nice and foamy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for you, and doesn&#x27;t contain all those additives and harmful chemicals :)</li>
            <li>but honestly my teeth have never been healthier.</li>
            <li>It has a great flavor and texture, and my mouth feels so clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean, refreshed and I feel great knowing</li>
            <li>But when this toothpaste hits your gums, it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This product is the best natural toothpaste around!</li>
            <li>It tastes great and leaves my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>This is a nice toothpaste and I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain SLS.  </li>
            <li>It ain&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li>I am very happy so far.</li>
            <li>My issue is peppermint is more popular</li>
            <li>This one has been the best thus far.</li>
            <li>It was a great purchase and I&#x27;ve ordered consistent refills since then.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s has always been too strongly flavored for my linking but this product is a nice balance.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazing after brushing and the mint gives it a great natural flavor.</li>
            <li>Your&#x27;s tastes great and had fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Ok stuff with the price.</li>
            <li>On top of that, this toothpaste dramatically whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying two or more at a time to save on shipping.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste&#x27;s foam is thicker and has a bit more texture.  </li>
            <li>I can put my mind at ease knowing I&#x27;m getting a healthy cleaning</li>
            <li>However, I would like to try arganant since they got 0 for being the safest and are known to brighten your teeth and do wonders on keeping your teeth and mouth healthy.</li>
            <li>Although I do love the taste of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love the feel of the tube.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the taste of it however..</li>
            <li>I like the Desert Essence a lot more.</li>
            <li>Really, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel great after brushing, very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The taste is great, and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I really love this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>JASON&#x27;s Sea Fresh toothpaste has a good consistency as well as taste.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon</li>
            <li>However with all that said, I love the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Flouride free!</li>
            <li>I love the Jason Seafresh Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I had heard about the cases of peripheral neuropathy that resulted from the zinc that is in many denture cream adhesives.  </li>
            <li>I have all of my teeth and therefore do not have to use denture cream adhesives, but just to be on  the safe side, I asked my dentist if the zinc in my Tom&#x27;s toothpaste might also be toxic.  </li>
            <li>To Jason&#x27;s credit, I&#x27;ve used the gel product in contrast to the paste here and had a better experience.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Fluoride free!</li>
            <li>Better then Toms of Maine, which I have been using.</li>
            <li>Love the click cap so much better then the screw cap.</li>
            <li>how can there be so many 5 stars for toothpaste with poison in it?</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; concept with no fluoride etc...</li>
            <li>There are a number of them and they are ok to use.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>so you know I have tried many tooth cleaners in my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>I have used this brand and type for along time now and still love it.</li>
            <li>I love Jason&#x27;s products but this one irritates my gums.</li>
            <li>but it makes my already sensitive/irritated gums more irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this toothpase.</li>
            <li>I found my self going for the jasons most of the time, it tastes great and is really foamy.</li>
            <li>The taste is okay - minty, but unremarkable.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It keeps my mouth very clean</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;re here and reading you&#x27;re also looking for a nice toothpaste that isn&#x27;t full chemicals and things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans the teeth and leaves a great feeling in the mouth not harsh, no additives, I love this product because so many toothpasts leave sores in my mouth</li>
            <li>far as the SeaFresh flavor goes - it&#x27;s quite pleasantly tasting, cleans well and leaves fresh feeling in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend doing your own research and looking at the ingredients before buying, just to decide whether they &#x27;feel or sound&#x27; good to you.&lt;br /&gt;Given</li>
            <li>Unless you have strong gums and a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great but something about it keeps me from being thrilled enough to give it a 5.  </li>
            <li>Feels good, teeth feel clean and fresh after using.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge improvement over any of Tom&#x27;s variety of toothpastes, and a thousand times better than Crest or Colgate.</li>
            <li>I love Jason&#x27;s toothpaste, and it&#x27;s practically everything free.</li>
            <li>Great natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love this sulfate free toothpaste</li>
            <li>Great alternative for toothpaste without SLS and fluoride, both of which I have developed sensitivity to over the years.</li>
            <li>I switched to Tom&#x27;s fluoride free about three-four months ago, it was okay.</li>
            <li>It is also a tartar control toothpaste, and it always leaves my teeth feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this is the best!</li>
            <li>I love the flavor in your mouth and it makes your breath feel fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plump and easy to squeeze.</li>
            <li>I get canker sores really easily.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>My dentist strongly advised me to stop using the Tom&#x27;s brand of toothpaste I had been using for months because it contains both SLS and zinc.  </li>
            <li>It tasted better than I thought it would for a natural toothpaste and the size of the tube was also good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this toothpaste and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t care for this at first</li>
            <li>All natural and leaves mouth refreshed and teeth remarkably</li>
            <li>This paste worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lathers nicely and leaves your mouth with cool, minty fresh breath after brushing.</li>
            <li>I wish it were more mild like the Toms.</li>
            <li>My husband has found it online for as little as $4.50 a tube on sale, which makes it a great deal, too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh Spearmint so great is its natural flavors--spearmint sweetened with a bit of Stevia.</li>
            <li>Tastes great and finally found toothpaste with no SLS!</li>
            <li>I am trying to switch all my products to healty, animal cruelty free choices.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone looking for a fluoride free toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>Smooth texture.</li>
            <li>we ran out I filled in with some toothpaste from Trader Joe&#x27;s....</li>
            <li>I have been fluoride free for over a year now</li>
            <li>Cruelty free as well.</li>
            <li>free I will handle the peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is free of SLS and using it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li>reason I wanted to try this toothpaste is because of the combination of it being SLS and fluoride free.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this toothpaste because it is fluoride free and SLS free.</li>
            <li>My primary reason for purchasing is that it is fluoride-free.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste and it makes me feel good that my family, especially my children are no longer going to be using harmful toothpaste products.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you this toothpaste feels like the regular stuff, I loved the texture and how it is refreshing.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth clean and white and tastes great.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling very fresh and my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>When I didn&#x27;t get that, it sort of felt that this toothpaste wasn&#x27;t as strong and subsequently wasn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>It has a really god after taste, is foamy like basic store brand crappy toothpastes (but so much better) and feels great.</li>
            <li>This product smells great, does not leave a film in my mouth and does not have a strange after taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always excited to recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that by switching to this toothpaste I will reduce the frequency of my outbreaks significantly.</li>
            <li>the choices available, I feel like this would be preferable one to many other, more popular toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Fresh and minty!</li>
            <li>And its a pretty safe toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Best part is no flouride, not sure about that stuff.</li>
            <li>It cleans like any other toothpaste and it tastes good!</li>
            <li>I originally bought for my toddler who hasn&#x27;t figured out spitting yet (it does not include fluoride)</li>
            <li>Cleanliness - My teeth feel just as clean with this toothpaste as they did with the store brand toothpastes</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean afterward.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and my throat is no longer congested.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste does make my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>I want to clean up the toxins from my life.  </li>
            <li>you kind of can&#x27;t go back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; feeling toothpaste after using a more concentrated one like Auromere...</li>
            <li>I use this for many years, just love it and is so natural.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean, as well.</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up, found the perfect natural product finally.</li>
            <li>Tingly Clean</li>
            <li>Mine is because I accidentally cut my gums with a plaque picker while trying to clean around the gums.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>If you want something natural, this has a good fresh taste.</li>
            <li>You know that we don&#x27;t need all the amounts of flouride we get right?!</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s very good, when before I was having a few blisters a week).</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it to anyone looking for a great tasting all natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>can use that extra boost of cleaning power to keep them bright.</li>
            <li>can use that extra boost of cleaning power to keep them bright.</li>
            <li>The color of the cap is also cool.</li>
            <li>; or the opposite argument that its good for your teeth.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using about a pea size of this Jason Sea Fresh and notice a difference in my gum health and teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>We use it with the sea fresh mouthwash &amp; we enjoy both.</li>
            <li>Only good thing about this product is that now I know it is poisonous and will now make</li>
            <li>my own natural tooth paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stick with something more gentle on the gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes good, which I can&#x27;t say the same about Tom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems to get my teeth really clean and fresh</li>
            <li>No chemicals and my teeth always feel so fresh and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste and leaves you with a clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I love and swear by Jason toothpaste, so much better then Toms and about the same price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>(I use an electric toothbrush which aids tremendously</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways we enjoy a lot of coffee, a nice amount of red wine and our teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways we enjoy a lot of coffee, a nice amount of red wine and our teeth</li>
            <li>It has a good consistency, leaves a fresh taste, and foams well enough to make  you feel your teeth have been cleaned.</li>
            <li>It tastes yummy, but is super bubbly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other natural brands but like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to consistently use lip balm and gentle toothpaste to restore the damage.</li>
            <li>I really like how smooth the toothpaste makes my&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this toothpaste 5-stars because it fit my needs very well.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li>After switching to Jason Sea Fresh toothpastes, guess what?</li>
            <li>It was minty, but fresh minty...</li>
            <li>I guess we&#x27;ll know the true result when I go to the dentist  ;)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i guarrantee you&#x27;d sell alot more if you make it CLEAR</li>
            <li>Jason - Powersmile has no sodium laurel or laureth sulfates, no fluoride, no artificial colors, no preservatives, no artificial sweeteners, no saccharin, and no propylene glycol.</li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m finished I look in the mirror and actually smile.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I get with Jason Sea Fresh.</li>
            <li>As a person who has never used natural or organic toothpaste, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I started using this toothpaste and rarely get them anymore.</li>
            <li>Parsley and spearmint make breath fresh.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the spearmint taste, but it cleans and freshens the teeth without aggravating my eczema.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the only kind I use.</li>
            <li>Minty and makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is definitely worth spending the money on, if you&#x27;re looking for all-natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got NO flouride, no SLS, no artificial colors or sweeteners, no saccharin, no propylene glycol.</li>
            <li>No Artificial Colors&lt;br</li>
            <li>No Artificial Sweeteners</li>
            <li>toothpaste version (Sea Fresh) is just that - - FRESH.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No need for powerful detergents in toothpaste when absorption is at 90%.  </li>
            <li>mouth feel so fresh</li>
            <li>It gives you a fresh taste afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this toothpaste to replace the Tom&#x27;s of Main Fluoride Free Natural toothpaste that I was using.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes more like peppermint than the spearmint I expected and has a strong taste to it</li>
            <li>I buy in large quantities so that I never run out!</li>
            <li>toothpaste reminds me very much of the Auromere density and concentratedness (that&#x27;s gotta be a word).</li>
            <li>The flavor is great too; not like other natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste because of the good reviews and I felt my teeth were just not clean feeling after brushing with Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>blindingly white, clean teeth look clean and bright and don&#x27;t glow in the dark (episode of Friends reference..</li>

            <li>Sea Fresh has really improved my mouth.</li>
            <li>Going Back - Okay, so after using this toothpaste twice a day for two weeks I accidentally grabbed one of my store brand tubes one morning</li>
            <li>This effectively makes it harder for the gland to regulate melatonin and seratonin levels.</li>
            <li>Love the simple ingredients.</li>
            <li>The first time I used [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>And so much foam, you almost choke on it!</li>
            <li>For healthy teeth one may also try food grade activated charcoal (AC) powder with a bit of coconut oil mixed in.</li>
            <li>but now I like it a lot more than the big brands.</li>
            <li>This recently became my favorite toothpaste of all the jason toothpaste i&#x27;ve yet tried, taste just like spearmint but not to over powering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, many companies (such as Jason, Nature&#x27;s Gate, Desert Essence, Kiss My Face etc.)</li>
            <li>.The end ;)))</li>
            <li>I will search ofr a better price the next time I purchase this.</li>
            <li>Sea Fresh Toothpaste is the only one I&#x27;ve found that for a reasonable cost will leave my teeth clean, my breath fresh, and never give me canker sores!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t contain flouride or any other chemicals that are added to more mainstream toothpastes, leaves my teeth feeling clean, and it freshens my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using store brand toothpaste for my entire life, I really wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>The flavor is not too strong and my teeth are still pretty white.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s was okay, but it has ingredients (like sodium lauryl sulfate) that are definitely not natural.</li>
            <li>The natural after a while does not do a great job in cleaning or feeling refreshed as much a crest 3rd white artic</li>
            <li>My lips have became better, moist and no longer dry that triggers my ocd tearing.</li>
            <li>Basically its a pure chalk powder + menthol ,kinda</li>
            <li>think if you&#x27;re looking for a healthier toothpaste option, a nice mint flavour, a concentrated formula where a little goes a long way and a really clean tooth feeling then this will work for you!lectric toothbrush which aids tremendously</li>
            <li>think if you&#x27;re looking for a healthier toothpaste option, a nice mint flavour, a concentrated formula where a little goes a long way and a really clean tooth feeling then this will work for you!</li>
            <li>- I was actually surprised how fresh the toothpaste smelled.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how to compare it</li>
            <li>fast+</li>
            <li>B00012NIBK Jason Natural Cosmetics - Sea Fresh Spearmint Toothpaste, 6 oz toothpaste]], I was blown away.</li>
            <li>I really look forward to brushing each time with this stuff.</li>
            <li>really any need to go in to all of that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very minty</li>
            <li>IT CLEANS REALLY WELL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>JASON&#x27;S SEA FRESH toothpaste does not contain fluoride or sodium laurel sulfate, two ingredients I have found irritate  perioral dermatitis, a condition I seem to have developed.  </li>
            <li>I am now ready to buy the mouthwash to go with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really minty and it lasts.</li>
            <li>I want to brush my teeth as much as I can since I got this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s so much sugar nowadays</li>
            <li>if u brush daily ,coz it gonna remove tooth enamel, making your teeth more sensitive to cold/worm or sour/sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I do not buy any other cosmetics from any of these companies, both Jason&#x27;s and Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpastes have been made with relatively safe ingredients without any harsh chemicals and/or fluoride, and I have used and liked them over the years.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>So, we always come back to Jason Sea Fresh (never to stray again)!</li>
            <li>Now my lips look normal and are no longer torn!</li>
            <li>I already have Jason&#x27;s shampoo and other products and love them.</li>
            <li>I am glad to find this due to allergies.</li>
            <li>but I know I am getting as clean a brushing as regular over the counter types without all the additives.  </li>
            <li>Tastes like regular toothpaste without the fluoride, and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong taste in the mouth for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>a nice fresh taste, cleans teeth very well and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of bad ingredients like so many mainstream toothpastes do.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been sore free for a long time after switching.</li>
            <li>Even my husband likes it and he is not obsessed with natural products</li>
            <li>This toothpaste very quickly disappears in your mouth when wet, therefore a lot is required.  </li>
            <li>Bamboo and calcium are the main ingredients for polishing teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL</li>
            <li>It comes highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the price is a bit high for toothpast, but the product works will</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I brushed my teeth the first time I noticed they were brighter and had that silky surface feeling like after a dentist cleaning!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste does not do that at all, it is a more subtle naturally fresh tasting mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are really trying to clean yourself from fluoride and other toxins I highly recommended you give this one a try.</li>
            <li>Jason natural really whiten my teeth and remove plaque as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far it shows much promise!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had to close my eyes to get it into my mouth, thinking that this would be another waste of my money and to my surprise it was refreshing.</li>
            <li>I like that it still acts like normal toothpaste with bubbles and minty flavor.</li>
            <li>brands and I feel it keeps my mouth feeling and smelling fresh when I also floss regularly.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is that this wasn&#x27;t the right flavor for me.</li>
            <li>I believe this is our new default toothpaste!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new brand</li>
            <li>You may be more partial to it, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the lingering taste of it.</li>
            <li>Some of the store brands &amp;#34;mintiness&amp;#34; can be so strong it creates a slight burning sensation in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Be aware new buyers this product does not foam like the commercial brands you may be used to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different mouth feel and taste to get used to at first</li>
            <li>After finding out the huge conspiracy and false science on fluoride, confirmed by my doctor, I immediately tossed my old crappy toothpaste and tap water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better than usual toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Finally, I didn&#x27;t feel any lasting freshness or clean feeling after brushing with this.  </li>
            <li>I used Toms Floride Free natural paste for years in spearmint gel, but when Colgate bought Toms I did not want to give them my money nor did I trust them to take over a natural company due to my health issues.</li>
            <li>Having run out of the natural toothpastes, I decided to try something new and ordered a tube of JASON and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have a nervous/ocd disorder where I tear my lips apart at certain points, so deep</li>
            <li>It tastes good, not sickly sweet, and doesn&#x27;t affect the taste of what you eat later - a scary effect of many toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I brush 1-2 times daily and my teeth are much whiter and my gums are stronger.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste, not only because it&#x27;s Jason&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I really see no reason to use the commercial, chemical laden teeth cleaning products.</li>
            <li>They were always gritty or didn&#x27;t foam much.</li>
            <li>I recently developed some perioral dermatitis and was told that the flouride in toothpaste could be the culprit</li>
            <li>Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil Toothpaste Mint - 6.25</li>
            <li>it contains stevia, a natural sweetener made from leaves of the stevia plant.</li>
            <li>Just not too often as it can remove some of the enamel on your teeth if used too frequently.</li>
            <li>I changed to a natural toothpaste because all the others contain fluoride.  </li>
            <li>The bottle runs out much faster than your traditional tube.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I had frequent mouth sores while using this product.  </li>
            <li>I USED IT FOR MY 4 AND 8 YEAR OLD</li>
            <li>it was suggested I try something all natural.</li>
            <li>B003CTU27W Uncle Harry&#x27;s Natural Toothpaste - Peppermint (3 Oz Glass Jar)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I am absolutely WILD about Jason.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Company claims product to be natural but is not.  </li>
            <li>Since switching to Jason&#x27;s natural toothpaste my gums have stopped bleeding and my mouth is healthier and stays fresher longer than it has ever.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gums or irritated gums already stear clear of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But not a deal breaker so far although I do plan to try something else when it starts to run out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had chronic canker sores ever since I was young.</li>
            <li>Finally I found the only SLS free toothpaste I could find locally, this toothpaste and boy</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Also, it lacks a peppery bite and doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling minty fresh like the Desert Essence does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became very aware after using this that Colgate and Crest would leave a sour taste in my mouth within an hour after brushing, and this does not.</li>
            <li>benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the lookout for new and better health products, but this is going to be tough to beat.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use much at a time and as long as it works</li>
            <li>My favorite is Sunstar Salt Toothpaste from Japan, but it&#x27;s hard to find except in specialty Asian stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a new toothpaste recently...</li>
            <li>I still barely floss, but have no bleeding.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t feel as sensitive as before either, which has been a big bonus.</li>
            <li>For this reason I&#x27;ll probably try another natural brand next time.</li>
            <li>is the only toothpaste I will use because almost all of them, including supposedly natural ones, have toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>leaves various all natural toothpastes without any chemicals to use.</li>
            <li>My sister gave me a tube awhile back, i had it in my rotation with toms natural toothpaste and aquafresh.</li>
            <li>so I tried a couple of different natural ones.</li>
            <li>which is kind of weird because I don&#x27;t know why I decide we should switch our toothpaste up every once in a while</li>
            <li>As usual this item was delivered to me quickly from the retailer.</li>
            <li>At first glance, it is off white and slightly brown.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice and minty.</li>
            <li> Nice mellow mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Nice and foamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for you, and doesn&#x27;t contain all those additives and harmful chemicals :)</li>
            <li> but honestly my teeth have never been healthier.</li>
            <li> It has a great flavor and texture, and my mouth feels so clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean, refreshed and I feel great knowing</li>
            <li> But when this toothpaste hits your gums, it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very strong toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This product is the best natural toothpaste around!</li>
            <li> It tastes great and leaves my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> This is a nice toothpaste and I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain SLS.  </li>
            <li> It ain&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li> I am very happy so far.</li>
            <li> My issue is peppermint is more popular</li>
            <li> This one has been the best thus far.</li>
            <li> It was a great purchase and I&#x27;ve ordered consistent refills since then.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s has always been too strongly flavored for my linking but this product is a nice balance.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing after brushing and the mint gives it a great natural flavor.</li>
            <li> Your&#x27;s tastes great and had fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Ok stuff with the price.</li>
            <li> On top of that, this toothpaste dramatically whitens your teeth.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying two or more at a time to save on shipping.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste&#x27;s foam is thicker and has a bit more texture.  </li>
            <li> I can put my mind at ease knowing I&#x27;m getting a healthy cleaning</li>
            <li> However, I would like to try arganant since they got 0 for being the safest and are known to brighten your teeth and do wonders on keeping your teeth and mouth healthy.</li>
            <li> Although I do love the taste of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> love the feel of the tube.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the taste of it however..</li>
            <li> I like the Desert Essence a lot more.</li>
            <li> Really, I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel great after brushing, very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The taste is great, and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I really love this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> JASON&#x27;s Sea Fresh toothpaste has a good consistency as well as taste.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon</li>
            <li> However with all that said, I love the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Flouride free!</li>
            <li> I love the Jason Seafresh Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I had heard about the cases of peripheral neuropathy that resulted from the zinc that is in many denture cream adhesives.  </li>
            <li> I have all of my teeth and therefore do not have to use denture cream adhesives, but just to be on  the safe side, I asked my dentist if the zinc in my Tom&#x27;s toothpaste might also be toxic.  </li>
            <li> To Jason&#x27;s credit, I&#x27;ve used the gel product in contrast to the paste here and had a better experience.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Fluoride free!</li>
            <li> Better then Toms of Maine, which I have been using.</li>
            <li> Love the click cap so much better then the screw cap.</li>
            <li> how can there be so many 5 stars for toothpaste with poison in it?</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; concept with no fluoride etc...</li>
            <li> There are a number of them and they are ok to use.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> so you know I have tried many tooth cleaners in my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> I have used this brand and type for along time now and still love it.</li>
            <li> I love Jason&#x27;s products but this one irritates my gums.</li>
            <li> but it makes my already sensitive/irritated gums more irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this toothpase.</li>
            <li> I found my self going for the jasons most of the time, it tastes great and is really foamy.</li>
            <li> The taste is okay - minty, but unremarkable.</li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It keeps my mouth very clean</li>
            <li> , if you&#x27;re here and reading you&#x27;re also looking for a nice toothpaste that isn&#x27;t full chemicals and things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans the teeth and leaves a great feeling in the mouth not harsh, no additives, I love this product because so many toothpasts leave sores in my mouth</li>
            <li> far as the SeaFresh flavor goes - it&#x27;s quite pleasantly tasting, cleans well and leaves fresh feeling in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend doing your own research and looking at the ingredients before buying, just to decide whether they &#x27;feel or sound&#x27; good to you.&lt;br /&gt;Given</li>
            <li> Unless you have strong gums and a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great but something about it keeps me from being thrilled enough to give it a 5.  </li>
            <li> Feels good, teeth feel clean and fresh after using.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge improvement over any of Tom&#x27;s variety of toothpastes, and a thousand times better than Crest or Colgate.</li>
            <li> I love Jason&#x27;s toothpaste, and it&#x27;s practically everything free.</li>
            <li> Great natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love this sulfate free toothpaste</li>
            <li> Great alternative for toothpaste without SLS and fluoride, both of which I have developed sensitivity to over the years.</li>
            <li> I switched to Tom&#x27;s fluoride free about three-four months ago, it was okay.</li>
            <li> It is also a tartar control toothpaste, and it always leaves my teeth feeling very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Other than that this is the best!</li>
            <li> I love the flavor in your mouth and it makes your breath feel fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plump and easy to squeeze.</li>
            <li> I get canker sores really easily.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> My dentist strongly advised me to stop using the Tom&#x27;s brand of toothpaste I had been using for months because it contains both SLS and zinc.  </li>
            <li> It tasted better than I thought it would for a natural toothpaste and the size of the tube was also good.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothpaste and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t care for this at first</li>
            <li> All natural and leaves mouth refreshed and teeth remarkably</li>
            <li> This paste worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lathers nicely and leaves your mouth with cool, minty fresh breath after brushing.</li>
            <li> I wish it were more mild like the Toms.</li>
            <li> My husband has found it online for as little as $4.50 a tube on sale, which makes it a great deal, too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh Spearmint so great is its natural flavors--spearmint sweetened with a bit of Stevia.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and finally found toothpaste with no SLS!</li>
            <li> I am trying to switch all my products to healty, animal cruelty free choices.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone looking for a fluoride free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> Smooth texture.</li>
            <li> we ran out I filled in with some toothpaste from Trader Joe&#x27;s....</li>
            <li> I have been fluoride free for over a year now</li>
            <li> Cruelty free as well.</li>
            <li> free I will handle the peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is free of SLS and using it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> reason I wanted to try this toothpaste is because of the combination of it being SLS and fluoride free.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this toothpaste because it is fluoride free and SLS free.</li>
            <li> My primary reason for purchasing is that it is fluoride-free.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste and it makes me feel good that my family, especially my children are no longer going to be using harmful toothpaste products.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you this toothpaste feels like the regular stuff, I loved the texture and how it is refreshing.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth clean and white and tastes great.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling very fresh and my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> When I didn&#x27;t get that, it sort of felt that this toothpaste wasn&#x27;t as strong and subsequently wasn&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li> It has a really god after taste, is foamy like basic store brand crappy toothpastes (but so much better) and feels great.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, does not leave a film in my mouth and does not have a strange after taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always excited to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that by switching to this toothpaste I will reduce the frequency of my outbreaks significantly.</li>
            <li> the choices available, I feel like this would be preferable one to many other, more popular toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Fresh and minty!</li>
            <li> And its a pretty safe toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Best part is no flouride, not sure about that stuff.</li>
            <li> It cleans like any other toothpaste and it tastes good!</li>
            <li> I originally bought for my toddler who hasn&#x27;t figured out spitting yet (it does not include fluoride)</li>
            <li> Cleanliness - My teeth feel just as clean with this toothpaste as they did with the store brand toothpastes</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean afterward.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and my throat is no longer congested.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does make my teeth feel clean</li>
            <li> I want to clean up the toxins from my life.  </li>
            <li> you kind of can&#x27;t go back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; feeling toothpaste after using a more concentrated one like Auromere...</li>
            <li> I use this for many years, just love it and is so natural.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean, as well.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up, found the perfect natural product finally.</li>
            <li> Tingly Clean</li>
            <li> Mine is because I accidentally cut my gums with a plaque picker while trying to clean around the gums.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> If you want something natural, this has a good fresh taste.</li>
            <li> You know that we don&#x27;t need all the amounts of flouride we get right?!</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s very good, when before I was having a few blisters a week).</li>
            <li> I highly recommended it to anyone looking for a great tasting all natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> can use that extra boost of cleaning power to keep them bright.</li>

            <li> The color of the cap is also cool.</li>
            <li> ; or the opposite argument that its good for your teeth.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using about a pea size of this Jason Sea Fresh and notice a difference in my gum health and teeth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> We use it with the sea fresh mouthwash &amp; we enjoy both.</li>
            <li> Only good thing about this product is that now I know it is poisonous and will now make</li>
            <li> my own natural tooth paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stick with something more gentle on the gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes good, which I can&#x27;t say the same about Tom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems to get my teeth really clean and fresh</li>
            <li> No chemicals and my teeth always feel so fresh and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste and leaves you with a clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I love and swear by Jason toothpaste, so much better then Toms and about the same price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> (I use an electric toothbrush which aids tremendously</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways we enjoy a lot of coffee, a nice amount of red wine and our teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways we enjoy a lot of coffee, a nice amount of red wine and our teeth</li>
            <li> It has a good consistency, leaves a fresh taste, and foams well enough to make  you feel your teeth have been cleaned.</li>
            <li> It tastes yummy, but is super bubbly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural brands but like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to consistently use lip balm and gentle toothpaste to restore the damage.</li>
            <li> I really like how smooth the toothpaste makes my&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this toothpaste 5-stars because it fit my needs very well.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li> After switching to Jason Sea Fresh toothpastes, guess what?</li>
            <li> It was minty, but fresh minty...</li>
            <li> I guess we&#x27;ll know the true result when I go to the dentist  ;)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i guarrantee you&#x27;d sell alot more if you make it CLEAR</li>
            <li> Jason - Powersmile has no sodium laurel or laureth sulfates, no fluoride, no artificial colors, no preservatives, no artificial sweeteners, no saccharin, and no propylene glycol.</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m finished I look in the mirror and actually smile.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I get with Jason Sea Fresh.</li>
            <li> As a person who has never used natural or organic toothpaste, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I started using this toothpaste and rarely get them anymore.</li>
            <li> Parsley and spearmint make breath fresh.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the spearmint taste, but it cleans and freshens the teeth without aggravating my eczema.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the only kind I use.</li>
            <li> Minty and makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is definitely worth spending the money on, if you&#x27;re looking for all-natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got NO flouride, no SLS, no artificial colors or sweeteners, no saccharin, no propylene glycol.</li>
            <li> No Artificial Colors&lt;br</li>
            <li> No Artificial Sweeteners</li>
            <li> toothpaste version (Sea Fresh) is just that - - FRESH.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need for powerful detergents in toothpaste when absorption is at 90%.  </li>
            <li> mouth feel so fresh</li>
            <li> It gives you a fresh taste afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this toothpaste to replace the Tom&#x27;s of Main Fluoride Free Natural toothpaste that I was using.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes more like peppermint than the spearmint I expected and has a strong taste to it</li>
            <li> I buy in large quantities so that I never run out!</li>
            <li> toothpaste reminds me very much of the Auromere density and concentratedness (that&#x27;s gotta be a word).</li>
            <li> The flavor is great too; not like other natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because of the good reviews and I felt my teeth were just not clean feeling after brushing with Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> blindingly white, clean teeth look clean and bright and don&#x27;t glow in the dark (episode of Friends reference..</li>

            <li> Sea Fresh has really improved my mouth.</li>
            <li> Going Back - Okay, so after using this toothpaste twice a day for two weeks I accidentally grabbed one of my store brand tubes one morning</li>
            <li> This effectively makes it harder for the gland to regulate melatonin and seratonin levels.</li>
            <li> Love the simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> The first time I used [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> And so much foam, you almost choke on it!</li>
            <li> For healthy teeth one may also try food grade activated charcoal (AC) powder with a bit of coconut oil mixed in.</li>
            <li> but now I like it a lot more than the big brands.</li>
            <li> This recently became my favorite toothpaste of all the jason toothpaste i&#x27;ve yet tried, taste just like spearmint but not to over powering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, many companies (such as Jason, Nature&#x27;s Gate, Desert Essence, Kiss My Face etc.)</li>
            <li> .The end ;)))</li>
            <li> I will search ofr a better price the next time I purchase this.</li>
            <li> Sea Fresh Toothpaste is the only one I&#x27;ve found that for a reasonable cost will leave my teeth clean, my breath fresh, and never give me canker sores!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t contain flouride or any other chemicals that are added to more mainstream toothpastes, leaves my teeth feeling clean, and it freshens my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using store brand toothpaste for my entire life, I really wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> The flavor is not too strong and my teeth are still pretty white.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s was okay, but it has ingredients (like sodium lauryl sulfate) that are definitely not natural.</li>
            <li> The natural after a while does not do a great job in cleaning or feeling refreshed as much a crest 3rd white artic</li>
            <li> My lips have became better, moist and no longer dry that triggers my ocd tearing.</li>
            <li> Basically its a pure chalk powder + menthol ,kinda</li>
            <li> think if you&#x27;re looking for a healthier toothpaste option, a nice mint flavour, a concentrated formula where a little goes a long way and a really clean tooth feeling then this will work for you!lectric toothbrush which aids tremendously</li>

            <li> - I was actually surprised how fresh the toothpaste smelled.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how to compare it</li>
            <li> fast+</li>
            <li> B00012NIBK Jason Natural Cosmetics - Sea Fresh Spearmint Toothpaste, 6 oz toothpaste]], I was blown away.</li>
            <li> I really look forward to brushing each time with this stuff.</li>
            <li> really any need to go in to all of that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very minty</li>
            <li> IT CLEANS REALLY WELL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> JASON&#x27;S SEA FRESH toothpaste does not contain fluoride or sodium laurel sulfate, two ingredients I have found irritate  perioral dermatitis, a condition I seem to have developed.  </li>
            <li> I am now ready to buy the mouthwash to go with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really minty and it lasts.</li>
            <li> I want to brush my teeth as much as I can since I got this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s so much sugar nowadays</li>
            <li> if u brush daily ,coz it gonna remove tooth enamel, making your teeth more sensitive to cold/worm or sour/sweet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I do not buy any other cosmetics from any of these companies, both Jason&#x27;s and Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpastes have been made with relatively safe ingredients without any harsh chemicals and/or fluoride, and I have used and liked them over the years.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> So, we always come back to Jason Sea Fresh (never to stray again)!</li>
            <li> Now my lips look normal and are no longer torn!</li>
            <li> I already have Jason&#x27;s shampoo and other products and love them.</li>
            <li> I am glad to find this due to allergies.</li>
            <li> but I know I am getting as clean a brushing as regular over the counter types without all the additives.  </li>
            <li> Tastes like regular toothpaste without the fluoride, and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong taste in the mouth for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> a nice fresh taste, cleans teeth very well and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of bad ingredients like so many mainstream toothpastes do.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been sore free for a long time after switching.</li>
            <li> Even my husband likes it and he is not obsessed with natural products</li>
            <li> This toothpaste very quickly disappears in your mouth when wet, therefore a lot is required.  </li>
            <li> Bamboo and calcium are the main ingredients for polishing teeth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL</li>
            <li> It comes highly recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the price is a bit high for toothpast, but the product works will</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I brushed my teeth the first time I noticed they were brighter and had that silky surface feeling like after a dentist cleaning!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste does not do that at all, it is a more subtle naturally fresh tasting mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are really trying to clean yourself from fluoride and other toxins I highly recommended you give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Jason natural really whiten my teeth and remove plaque as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far it shows much promise!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to close my eyes to get it into my mouth, thinking that this would be another waste of my money and to my surprise it was refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like that it still acts like normal toothpaste with bubbles and minty flavor.</li>
            <li> brands and I feel it keeps my mouth feeling and smelling fresh when I also floss regularly.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is that this wasn&#x27;t the right flavor for me.</li>
            <li> I believe this is our new default toothpaste!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my new brand</li>
            <li> You may be more partial to it, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the lingering taste of it.</li>
            <li> Some of the store brands &amp;#34;mintiness&amp;#34; can be so strong it creates a slight burning sensation in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Be aware new buyers this product does not foam like the commercial brands you may be used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different mouth feel and taste to get used to at first</li>
            <li> After finding out the huge conspiracy and false science on fluoride, confirmed by my doctor, I immediately tossed my old crappy toothpaste and tap water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s better than usual toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Finally, I didn&#x27;t feel any lasting freshness or clean feeling after brushing with this.  </li>
            <li> I used Toms Floride Free natural paste for years in spearmint gel, but when Colgate bought Toms I did not want to give them my money nor did I trust them to take over a natural company due to my health issues.</li>
            <li> Having run out of the natural toothpastes, I decided to try something new and ordered a tube of JASON and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have a nervous/ocd disorder where I tear my lips apart at certain points, so deep</li>
            <li> It tastes good, not sickly sweet, and doesn&#x27;t affect the taste of what you eat later - a scary effect of many toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I brush 1-2 times daily and my teeth are much whiter and my gums are stronger.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste, not only because it&#x27;s Jason&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I really see no reason to use the commercial, chemical laden teeth cleaning products.</li>
            <li> They were always gritty or didn&#x27;t foam much.</li>
            <li> I recently developed some perioral dermatitis and was told that the flouride in toothpaste could be the culprit</li>
            <li> Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil Toothpaste Mint - 6.25</li>
            <li> it contains stevia, a natural sweetener made from leaves of the stevia plant.</li>
            <li> Just not too often as it can remove some of the enamel on your teeth if used too frequently.</li>
            <li> I changed to a natural toothpaste because all the others contain fluoride.  </li>
            <li> The bottle runs out much faster than your traditional tube.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I had frequent mouth sores while using this product.  </li>
            <li> I USED IT FOR MY 4 AND 8 YEAR OLD</li>
            <li> it was suggested I try something all natural.</li>
            <li> B003CTU27W Uncle Harry&#x27;s Natural Toothpaste - Peppermint (3 Oz Glass Jar)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I am absolutely WILD about Jason.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Company claims product to be natural but is not.  </li>
            <li> Since switching to Jason&#x27;s natural toothpaste my gums have stopped bleeding and my mouth is healthier and stays fresher longer than it has ever.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums or irritated gums already stear clear of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But not a deal breaker so far although I do plan to try something else when it starts to run out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had chronic canker sores ever since I was young.</li>
            <li> Finally I found the only SLS free toothpaste I could find locally, this toothpaste and boy</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Also, it lacks a peppery bite and doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling minty fresh like the Desert Essence does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became very aware after using this that Colgate and Crest would leave a sour taste in my mouth within an hour after brushing, and this does not.</li>
            <li> benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the lookout for new and better health products, but this is going to be tough to beat.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use much at a time and as long as it works</li>
            <li> My favorite is Sunstar Salt Toothpaste from Japan, but it&#x27;s hard to find except in specialty Asian stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a new toothpaste recently...</li>
            <li> I still barely floss, but have no bleeding.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t feel as sensitive as before either, which has been a big bonus.</li>
            <li> For this reason I&#x27;ll probably try another natural brand next time.</li>
            <li> is the only toothpaste I will use because almost all of them, including supposedly natural ones, have toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> leaves various all natural toothpastes without any chemicals to use.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me a tube awhile back, i had it in my rotation with toms natural toothpaste and aquafresh.</li>
            <li> so I tried a couple of different natural ones.</li>
            <li> which is kind of weird because I don&#x27;t know why I decide we should switch our toothpaste up every once in a while</li>
            <li> As usual this item was delivered to me quickly from the retailer.</li>
            <li> At first glance, it is off white and slightly brown.</li>
            <li> I grew up a Crest kid and never could get the hang of Tom&#x27;s or other natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It is pretty pricey, but a tube of tooth past will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m paying 5 or 6 dollars for a small tube of natural toothpaste, I expect it to be natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had maybe 2 minor blisters in the last 3 months</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original ingredients (from old ad found on web):&lt;br /&gt;Certified organic blue green algae, sea salts, trace minerals, sea kelp, sea parsley, aloe barbadensis (certified organic aloe vera gel), perilla frutescens japanica (perilla seed extract), citrus grandis (grapefruit seed extract), bambusa arundinacea (bamboo powder), calcium carbonate, silica, glycerin, aqua (purified sea water), cerfified organic stevioside, chondrum crispus (carrageenan), sodium bicarbonate, menta viridis (essential oil of spearmint), sodium cocoyl glutamate (replaces sodium lauryl sulfate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see how it got the name &amp;#34;Sea Fresh&amp;#34; from the ingredients it used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have quit using commercial toothpastes with fluoride long ago and appreciate the &#x27;fluoride-free&#x27; variety of choices</li>
            <li> a little cool and tingly but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> In addition to that, I love that it does not have a lot of the other unnecessary and chemical-laden ingredients that other toothpastes have, even fluoride-free pastes.</li>
            <li> I am trying to transition to a more holistic lifestyle which for me means cutting out fluoride.</li>
            <li> I found it pretty difficult to find a toothpaste that did not have it, even those who claimed natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> No strange aftertaste like other pastes.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Deep Sea Super Fresh Spearmint Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;+ get rid of duh UGLY white looks like biz or snow YUK &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I chose this product due to being low hazard on cosmetic database, a 2.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I am currently trying out Jason&#x27;s other toothpaste  . . .</li>
            <li> will update you later on what other use I have for Jason.&lt;br /&gt;Until then . . .</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time!  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick with this one for a very long time.</li>
            <li> For most of my life I have had painful mouth blisters on a daily basis and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
            <li> but after a few uses I barely even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The density means it clings to the brush and then your teeth, not slopping and glopping loosely like the Trader Joe&#x27;s stuffs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT I would not stop using it if I could go back to my other toothpaste!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this toothpaste, only a pea size portion required on your brush, to do a thorough cleaning job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a year of using it, I notice that my teeth aren&#x27;t as intensely white as they were before (I was using an extra whitening type in the past</li>
            <li> When I used to brush with other toothpaste my gums would occasionally bleed and would often get canker sores in my mouth, probably due to the chemicals they use to make them.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately, even this spearmint/mint taste is a little too strong</li>
            <li> I grew up on Crest and Colgate products--all of which are filled with dyes, artificial sweeteners, and harsh abrasives that actually damage teeth.</li>
            <li> I say once you get used to it because I of course expected the overpowering mint taste that the store brands had.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Elsewhere on the box it says it contains Blue Green Algae</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing they forgot to change those words when they changed the ingredients because blue green algae are not listed as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had deep bacterial pockets &amp; receding gum lines a few years ago.</li>
            <li> it can leave gaping pits, cuts and rough skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to tune out when someone tries to explain to me how mainstream products are giving us cancer, etc.</li>
            <li> But one blog post got me curious</li>
            <li> ...over 30 sec</li>
            <li> What I mean by that is it eliminates fluoride exposure in your mouth as far as brushing your teeth goes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for me.  </li>
            <li> Also, while doctors recommend fluoride for children to harden enamel and prevent cavities, the mineral can also have negative affects on your general health.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, and other flavors.</li>
            <li> It tastes just like any other brand name toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I only use a small amount smeared across the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from sensitivity to sulfates and some other things as well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find any other toothpaste to fill the bill.  </li>
            <li> JUST watch how other companies stop dropping fluoride from their list of inGREEDients over time once they realize what&#x27;s happening to their market as people wake up.</li>
            <li> claiming that their cosmetic line was organic, while still using synthetic ingredients (keep in mind that Jason is not any small mom and pop owned company, but was &#x27;acquired&#x27; in 2004 by Hain-Celestial Group controlled by HJ Heinz, the corporate giant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of the other organic toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have a taste, doesn&#x27;t make bubbles.</li>
            <li> Growing up with Colgate and other commercial toothpastes, I never realized how much junk was in them like colors and artificial sweeteners.</li>
            <li> Not many people know that fluoride, along with other chemicals that the average person is exposed to every day, actually calcifies, thereby damaging, the pineal gland.</li>
            <li> whether it is a good or bad thing against the store brand but in my mind it was probably all of the unnecessary chemicals in the store brand toothpaste that caused this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ingredients listed here are the same as on the Jason website except for a few plant seed extracts missing here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer conventional mint flavoring.</li>
            <li> At least I have to, until I find a dentist who can irrigate  deep in my gums where I cut it.</li>
            <li> After implementing serious dietary changes in my life, I decided it was time to start going about changing some other facets of my daily routines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Revised down.</li>
            <li> but with the previous toothpastes, the TJ&#x27;s etc I found my teeth did not get this</li>
            <li> but with the previous toothpastes, the TJ&#x27;s etc I found my teeth did not get this</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s less chemicals in my toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I tried all the other brands and they pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> This was pleasing to me because it means you just need a little wee pea sized dab on your tooth brush</li>
            <li> But I was actually a little wowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I was actually a little wowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes just a little.  </li>
            <li> GREEN  </li>
            <li> color box emerald green +</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to acclimate to the taste, not that it was bad-it just wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; as I what I had been using.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to waste the tube, I managed to get about 1/3 of the way through the tube before throwing it out.</li>
            <li> This one of the few tooth pastes that do not have ingredients known to be toxic.</li>
            <li> I found few studies on its toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> chose fluoride free toothpaste because fluoride toothpastes (generic store brand at least) make my teeth feel, kinda weird and unpleasant after brushing.</li>
            <li> The strange aftertaste got progressively worse and</li>
            <li> It can be incredibly painful when having to brush my teeth and after hearing so much about Fluoride being linked to cancer..</li>
            <li> But one thing it doesn&#x27;t do, is supply you with another nasty poison (a poison more toxic than lead) known as, Fluoride.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that means and</li>
            <li> No more bleeding gums when I floss, no fluoride, whiter teeth, etc.</li>
            <li> In the past year I have cut out all of the floride in the water and in the toothpaste</li>
            <li> and I horribly dislike peppermint, too strong.</li>
            <li> have been implicated in the past in &#x27;green washing&#x27;...  </li>
            <li> and I have had less problems with my teeth and less headaches!!!!</li>
            <li> Every time I try to branch out and use a different organic or natural toothpaste I&#x27;m always very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is so hard.  </li>
            <li> Overall - As I mentioned it took a bit to get used to since I was so accustomed to the artificial nastiness of the store brands.  </li>
            <li> I started purchasing this toothpaste about a year ago after after reading that Crest toothpastes could be causing my throat congestion and icky mouth feel.</li>
            <li> At least for me it is.</li>
            <li> No more burning toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I really mean that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a weird aftertaste like other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not surprising)</li>
            <li> not like the artificial mint smell in other toothpastes I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find!</li>
            <li> Once we learned all this, my husband and I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes, which taste really nasty, and several other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products before discovering this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other toothpastes though it doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth dry and unlike some nasty toothpastes, doesn&#x27;t cause skin cells in the mouth to die.</li>
            <li> I made the switch to all-natural toothpastes a few years ago with Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but hated their metal tube which was hard to use and messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of all the chemicals in products and I purchased your toothpaste to get away from the fluoride in store stuff.</li>
            <li> Now, whenever I&#x27;m stuck using Crest or some other chemically big-name toothpaste, I&#x27;m disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> So my next step was to find a toothpaste that didn&#x27;t have that nasty Chemical.</li>
            <li> Others are too grainy, or leave weird after-tastes.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch my toothpaste after having some skin problems around my mouth, and it was difficult to find toothpaste without both fluoride and SLS.</li>
            <li> our society has become obsessed with &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; teeth.</li>
            <li> our society has become obsessed with &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; teeth.</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> but the store brands foam seems very thin and is &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; when you spit it out.  </li>
            <li> Since this is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; I expected a nasty taste and a bit of grit.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it wasn&#x27;t nasty and it didn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> We have researched and checked the ingredients on almost every toothpaste brand out there, and Jason is the one brand that doent&#x27; have any bad ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> We used to use Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but it has sodium laurel sulfate (SLS), which is supposed to be bad for you.</li>
            <li> I also had a bad taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> I was getting sick sometimes from my fluoride toothpaste</li>
            <li> Your dentist may think you are crazy when you tell them to use this toothpaste, instead of there disgusting paste/polish; don&#x27;t let the peer pressure get to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t taste awful like some brands do!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This seems to get my teeth really clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Great product.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and finally found toothpaste with no SLS!</li>
            <li> I am trying to switch all my products to healty, animal cruelty free choices. This paste worked fine for me. My mouth feels fresh. I prefer conventional mint flavoring.</li>
            <li> I have to use a SLS-free toothpaste to prevent canker sores and I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a while now.  The taste is good and I&#x27;ve been sore free for a long time after switching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of all the chemicals in products and I purchased your toothpaste to get away from the fluoride in store stuff. Your&#x27;s tastes great and had fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Ok stuff with the price.</li>
            <li> This is a huge improvement over any of Tom&#x27;s variety of toothpastes, and a thousand times better than Crest or Colgate. For most of my life I have had painful mouth blisters on a daily basis and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why. After researching the Internet for answers, I found the culprit. It was a synthetic chemical they were putting in toothpaste known as Sodium Laureth Sulfate. I was told that most toothpastes have it, and it has been known to cause mouth blisters (in addition to Cancer!). So my next step was to find a toothpaste that didn&#x27;t have that nasty Chemical. Tom&#x27;s has it. Even Jason Powersmile has it. But this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t! After switching to Jason Sea Fresh toothpastes, guess what? I&#x27;ve had maybe 2 minor blisters in the last 3 months (that&#x27;s very good, when before I was having a few blisters a week). On top of that, this toothpaste dramatically whitens your teeth. But one thing it doesn&#x27;t do, is supply you with another nasty poison (a poison more toxic than lead) known as, Fluoride. I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I had to give this 5 stars. I had been looking for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste that I didn&#x27;t mind brushing with, and settled on this about 6 months ago. Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand seems to have compromised and given up trying to be chemical-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Sea Fresh has really improved my mouth. I brush 1-2 times daily and my teeth are much whiter and my gums are stronger. I don&#x27;t wake up with morning breath either which is an amazing benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the lookout for new and better health products, but this is going to be tough to beat. I recommend buying two or more at a time to save on shipping. Good luck with this toothpaste, I hope it works for you as well as it did for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, and other flavors. Others are too grainy, or leave weird after-tastes. So, we always come back to Jason Sea Fresh (never to stray again)! My husband, and kiddos all like it, too. I buy in large quantities so that I never run out!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great but something about it keeps me from being thrilled enough to give it a 5.  I&#x27;ll buy it again especially for the price.</li>
            <li> After using store brand toothpaste for my entire life, I really wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell - I was actually surprised how fresh the toothpaste smelled.  It was minty, but fresh minty... not like the artificial mint smell in other toothpastes I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Taste - It tastes great, once you get used to it.  I say once you get used to it because I of course expected the overpowering mint taste that the store brands had.  When I didn&#x27;t get that, it sort of felt that this toothpaste wasn&#x27;t as strong and subsequently wasn&#x27;t as good.  However, after a couple days I got used to its suitableness and I definitely prefer it now!  It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; tasting as the store brands.  Some of the store brands &amp;#34;mintiness&amp;#34; can be so strong it creates a slight burning sensation in your mouth.  This toothpaste does not do that at all, it is a more subtle naturally fresh tasting mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Feel - It has a similar dexterity as the store brands and goes on your toothbrush the same (looks the same).  The paste feels the same when you initially start brushing as well.  However it is a bit different feeling after you start brushing.  The foam it creates during brushing is a bit thicker feeling than the store brands.  I really don&#x27;t know how to compare it but the store brands foam seems very thin and is &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; when you spit it out.  This toothpaste&#x27;s foam is thicker and has a bit more texture.  Kind of like when you add some flour to a liquid, it is still liquid but a thicker consistency.  I honestly didn&#x27;t care for this at first but after a few uses I barely even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Cleanliness - My teeth feel just as clean with this toothpaste as they did with the store brand toothpastes so no qualms there... I guess we&#x27;ll know the true result when I go to the dentist  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Going Back - Okay, so after using this toothpaste twice a day for two weeks I accidentally grabbed one of my store brand tubes one morning (I have since thrown them all away to prevent this in the future).  After brushing my teeth with the store brand my gums actually burned.  The burning sensation lasted for quite a while and my gums felt a bit tender the majority of the day.  I&#x27;m not sure what that means and whether it is a good or bad thing against the store brand but in my mind it was probably all of the unnecessary chemicals in the store brand toothpaste that caused this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Overall - As I mentioned it took a bit to get used to since I was so accustomed to the artificial nastiness of the store brands.  However after getting over that I can definitely say that I will NOT be going back to a store brand toothpaste again!  I absolutely love this toothpaste and it makes me feel good that my family, especially my children are no longer going to be using harmful toothpaste products.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> got it in 4 DAYS  now thats fast+ it&#x27;s what i wanted - Thank you - its almost perfect !!&lt;br /&gt;i guarrantee you&#x27;d sell alot more if you make it CLEAR GREEN  + change name to&lt;br /&gt;Jason Deep Sea Super Fresh Spearmint Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;+ get rid of duh UGLY white looks like biz or snow YUK &#x3D; color box emerald green + royal ocean blue swirls with all words orange or yellow Oh YEAH</li>
            <li> I realize the dangers of fluoride so I avoid exposure at all costs. This toothpaste is a Pineal Gland saver. What I mean by that is it eliminates fluoride exposure in your mouth as far as brushing your teeth goes. Not many people know that fluoride, along with other chemicals that the average person is exposed to every day, actually calcifies, thereby damaging, the pineal gland. This effectively makes it harder for the gland to regulate melatonin and seratonin levels. Thank you JASON!</li>
            <li> We have researched and checked the ingredients on almost every toothpaste brand out there, and Jason is the one brand that doent&#x27; have any bad ingredients in it. We used to use Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but it has sodium laurel sulfate (SLS), which is supposed to be bad for you. Jason - Powersmile has no sodium laurel or laureth sulfates, no fluoride, no artificial colors, no preservatives, no artificial sweeteners, no saccharin, and no propylene glycol. We prefer the peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste, not only because it&#x27;s Jason&#x27;s but I know I am getting as clean a brushing as regular over the counter types without all the additives.  I&#x27;ve tried other natural brands but like this one the best.  I can put my mind at ease knowing I&#x27;m getting a healthy cleaning and when I&#x27;m finished I look in the mirror and actually smile.  I would recommend it everyone.</li>
            <li> Jason natural really whiten my teeth and remove plaque as well. I really like how smooth the toothpaste makes my&lt;br /&gt;teeth. I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone looking for a fluoride free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste! I love Jason&#x27;s toothpaste, and it&#x27;s practically everything free. So, thats a plus. Wish it were a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!  No chemicals and my teeth always feel so fresh and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> Great mint flavor!  Smooth texture.  I love not poisoning my family with toxic flouride!  This is the best one out there that I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> This tooth paste is the perfect amount of minty.  Does the job and there is no flouride in it.  You know that we don&#x27;t need all the amounts of flouride we get right?!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is what I have been looking for, no fluoride and no sulfates. I am very glad for this product!!!</li>
            <li> use it every day! Prefer the taste to the &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; tasting toothpastes like crest, colgate, etc.</li>
            <li> They totally changed the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original ingredients (from old ad found on web):&lt;br /&gt;Certified organic blue green algae, sea salts, trace minerals, sea kelp, sea parsley, aloe barbadensis (certified organic aloe vera gel), perilla frutescens japanica (perilla seed extract), citrus grandis (grapefruit seed extract), bambusa arundinacea (bamboo powder), calcium carbonate, silica, glycerin, aqua (purified sea water), cerfified organic stevioside, chondrum crispus (carrageenan), sodium bicarbonate, menta viridis (essential oil of spearmint), sodium cocoyl glutamate (replaces sodium lauryl sulfate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see how it got the name &amp;#34;Sea Fresh&amp;#34; from the ingredients it used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Calcium Carbonate, Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Mentha Viridis (Spearment) Leaf Oil, Carrageenan, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Gel, Aphanizomenon Flos-Aquae Powder, Bambusa Arundinacea Stem Powder, Carum Petroselinum (Parsley) Extract, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Stevia Rebaudiana Leaf/Stem Extract, Silica, Sodium Bicarbonate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsewhere on the box it says it contains Blue Green Algae but I&#x27;m guessing they forgot to change those words when they changed the ingredients because blue green algae are not listed as an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this means is that all the reviews that say things like &amp;#34;really whitened my teeth&amp;#34; may not apply to what you&#x27;re now getting. Why did they change to something totally different? Are the oceans too radioactive now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars after trying it once. It tastes great and leaves my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li> I chose this product due to being low hazard on cosmetic database, a 2. There is no fluoride and it seems lot safer than others. However, I would like to try arganant since they got 0 for being the safest and are known to brighten your teeth and do wonders on keeping your teeth and mouth healthy. I change my verdict on toothpaste.  The natural after a while does not do a great job in cleaning or feeling refreshed as much a crest 3rd white artic</li>
            <li> I have only been using this toothpaste for a week. So far so good. I have been looking for a fluoride free product and this one seems great. I really see no reason to use the commercial, chemical laden teeth cleaning products. Love the simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love and swear by Jason toothpaste, so much better then Toms and about the same price on Amazon. The only thing I would say is that this wasn&#x27;t the right flavor for me. It tasted and smelled like plastic but I think thats the deep sea. I switched to their peppermint variety and won&#x27;t go back EVER!</li>
            <li> I grew up a Crest kid and never could get the hang of Tom&#x27;s or other natural toothpastes. They were always gritty or didn&#x27;t foam much. Although I do love the taste of [[ASIN:B004M9AOXI Tom&#x27;s of Maine Antiplaque and Whitening Fluoride-free Toothpaste, Fennel, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]. The first time I used [[ASIN:B00012NIBK Jason Natural Cosmetics - Sea Fresh Spearmint Toothpaste, 6 oz toothpaste]], I was blown away. Nice and minty. Smooth texture. And so much foam, you almost choke on it! Now, whenever I&#x27;m stuck using Crest or some other chemically big-name toothpaste, I&#x27;m disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> Best tasting, best breath, and I do really think it does whiten teeth just a bit. Love, love, love this stuff. No strange aftertaste like other pastes.</li>
            <li> I recently developed some perioral dermatitis and was told that the flouride in toothpaste could be the culprit so I had to find an alternative to the regular store brands. As usual this item was delivered to me quickly from the retailer. It took me a few days to acclimate to the taste, not that it was bad-it just wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; as I what I had been using. After a week or so I didn&#x27;t even notice the difference. It works just as well as &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste and leaves you with a clean and fresh feeling. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Growing up with Colgate and other commercial toothpastes, I never realized how much junk was in them like colors and artificial sweeteners. I made the switch to all-natural toothpastes a few years ago with Tom&#x27;s of Maine, but hated their metal tube which was hard to use and messy. My favorite is Sunstar Salt Toothpaste from Japan, but it&#x27;s hard to find except in specialty Asian stores. Having run out of the natural toothpastes, I decided to try something new and ordered a tube of JASON and [[ASIN:B00C7OMGRW Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil Toothpaste Mint - 6.25 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel of the tube. It&#x27;s plump and easy to squeeze. The color of the cap is also cool. Like Smurf blue. I don&#x27;t love the taste of it however.. it contains stevia, a natural sweetener made from leaves of the stevia plant. You may be more partial to it, but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the lingering taste of it. Also, it lacks a peppery bite and doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling minty fresh like the Desert Essence does. I like the Desert Essence a lot more. Not wanting to waste the tube, I managed to get about 1/3 of the way through the tube before throwing it out. The strange aftertaste got progressively worse and worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is incredible! Eradicated my gingivitis &amp; periodontal disease. No more bleeding gums when I floss, no fluoride, whiter teeth, etc. I had deep bacterial pockets &amp; receding gum lines a few years ago. I still barely floss, but have no bleeding. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this toothpaste to replace the Tom&#x27;s of Main Fluoride Free Natural toothpaste that I was using. Tom&#x27;s was okay, but it has ingredients (like sodium lauryl sulfate) that are definitely not natural. If I&#x27;m paying 5 or 6 dollars for a small tube of natural toothpaste, I expect it to be natural. That&#x27;s what I get with Jason Sea Fresh. It feels and tastes great in my mouth. I think I&#x27;ll stick with this one for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Really, I really love this stuff. My teeth feel great after brushing, very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose fluoride free toothpaste because fluoride toothpastes (generic store brand at least) make my teeth feel, kinda weird and unpleasant after brushing. I&#x27;ve done research on it and I don&#x27;t care to hear people say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a neurotoxin that&#x27;s why!&amp;#34; or the opposite argument that its good for your teeth. but I may try their line of fluoride toothpastes. I may like them as well. I guess I&#x27;ll see. This paste does not include SLS which is not supposed to be good for us either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well, yeah, this stuff is awesome. It has a really god after taste, is foamy like basic store brand crappy toothpastes (but so much better) and feels great. I really look forward to brushing each time with this stuff. For healthy teeth one may also try food grade activated charcoal (AC) powder with a bit of coconut oil mixed in. AC absorbs a lot of bacteria and is great for teeth. Just not too often as it can remove some of the enamel on your teeth if used too frequently. Or so I have read.</li>
            <li> Not animal tested and perfect!</li>
            <li> I do not like this flavor at all.</li>
            <li> No more burning toothpaste! I have a nervous/ocd disorder where I tear my lips apart at certain points, so deep it can leave gaping pits, cuts and rough skin. It can be incredibly painful when having to brush my teeth and after hearing so much about Fluoride being linked to cancer..I didn&#x27;t even want to take the chance. My lips have became better, moist and no longer dry that triggers my ocd tearing. I have been able to consistently use lip balm and gentle toothpaste to restore the damage. Now my lips look normal and are no longer torn! I enjoy using about a pea size of this Jason Sea Fresh and notice a difference in my gum health and teeth sensitivity. Looking back at regular toothpaste, I will never pick up another tube of Fluoride again. Hope to get my bf to try it as well..</li>
            <li> I decided to switch my toothpaste after having some skin problems around my mouth, and it was difficult to find toothpaste without both fluoride and SLS. As a person who has never used natural or organic toothpaste, I love this stuff. The taste is great, and you don&#x27;t have to use much to get the job done. Hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I get canker sores really easily. I started using this toothpaste and rarely get them anymore. The toothpaste is yummy too. My teeth feel really clean afterward.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best I&#x27;ve found. I grew up on Crest and Colgate products--all of which are filled with dyes, artificial sweeteners, and harsh abrasives that actually damage teeth. Also, while doctors recommend fluoride for children to harden enamel and prevent cavities, the mineral can also have negative affects on your general health. Once we learned all this, my husband and I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes, which taste really nasty, and several other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products before discovering this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh Spearmint so great is its natural flavors--spearmint sweetened with a bit of Stevia. Bamboo and calcium are the main ingredients for polishing teeth. Parsley and spearmint make breath fresh. My husband has found it online for as little as $4.50 a tube on sale, which makes it a great deal, too!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothpaste! It has a great flavor and texture, and my mouth feels so clean after brushing. I bought this product instead of Tom&#x27;s because it was on sale, and now I will never switch back. Can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
            <li> I started purchasing this toothpaste about a year ago after after reading that Crest toothpastes could be causing my throat congestion and icky mouth feel. I went through Amazon reviews and settled on this Jason Deep Sea Spearmint one. It was a great purchase and I&#x27;ve ordered consistent refills since then. My teeth feel clean and my throat is no longer congested. It&#x27;s a different mouth feel and taste to get used to at first but now I like it a lot more than the big brands. After a year of using it, I notice that my teeth aren&#x27;t as intensely white as they were before (I was using an extra whitening type in the past so it&#x27;s not surprising) but they don&#x27;t feel as sensitive as before either, which has been a big bonus. I&#x27;ll keep buying this for the future and recommending it to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because of the good reviews and I felt my teeth were just not clean feeling after brushing with Sensodyne. This toothpaste does make my teeth feel clean and now I switch the 2 off .</li>
            <li> I really love this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something that did not contain fluoride and decided to try this. I already have Jason&#x27;s shampoo and other products and love them. This product smells great, does not leave a film in my mouth and does not have a strange after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became very aware after using this that Colgate and Crest would leave a sour taste in my mouth within an hour after brushing, and this does not. My mouth feels clean and healthy. I will be buying in bulk for college!</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste. Leaves your mouth fresh. We use it with the sea fresh mouthwash &amp; we enjoy both. Giving it 4 stars because it is not certified organic &amp; I wish it was. From what I read some of the ingredients have changed &amp; its no longer organic.</li>
            <li> I changed to a natural toothpaste because all the others contain fluoride.  It does the job - with a lot of foam though.</li>
            <li> I needed a toothpaste that would not aggravate my periodal dermatitis and this works great.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the spearmint taste, but it cleans and freshens the teeth without aggravating my eczema.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always excited to recommend this product. This toothpaste is the only kind I use. Every time I try to branch out and use a different organic or natural toothpaste I&#x27;m always very disappointed. JASON&#x27;s Sea Fresh toothpaste has a good consistency as well as taste. Be aware new buyers this product does not foam like the commercial brands you may be used to. This is because they don&#x27;t put in the harmful detergents (e.g. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate - a.k.a Yuck!). One of the best things about this product is that it prevent&#x27;s canker sores. This product is the best natural toothpaste around!</li>
            <li> This is a nice toothpaste and I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain SLS.  Feels good, teeth feel clean and fresh after using.  Only drawback is the after-taste.  It stays with me for awhile and I&#x27;m not a big fan.  For this reason I&#x27;ll probably try another natural brand next time.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! I had to buy it because of medical reasons BUT I would not stop using it if I could go back to my other toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I want to clean up the toxins from my life.  It is so hard.  I love Amazon but it often leaves out lots of information about what is in the products.  (I am learning that the FDA/Govenment doesn&#x27;t even require that they (the manufacture) list everything!)  So you can&#x27;t even trust a label.  However with all that said, I love the toothpaste.  It tastes just like any other brand name toothpaste.  It is pretty pricey, but a tube of tooth past will last me a long time.  I only use a small amount smeared across the bristles.  Seems to be plenty for me.  Now if I can teach my kids the same trick!  I will continue to buy this product.  Flouride free!</li>
            <li> My second order.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I suffer from sensitivity to sulfates and some other things as well.  That means just about any toothpaste will give me canker sores--even ones that claim not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JASON&#x27;s Sea Fresh Toothpaste is the only one I&#x27;ve found that for a reasonable cost will leave my teeth clean, my breath fresh, and never give me canker sores!</li>
            <li> I gave this toothpaste 5-stars because it fit my needs very well.  It didn&#x27;t contain flouride or any other chemicals that are added to more mainstream toothpastes, leaves my teeth feeling clean, and it freshens my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great all around toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I believe this is our new default toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a new toothpaste recently...which is kind of weird because I don&#x27;t know why I decide we should switch our toothpaste up every once in a while but that&#x27;s what happens...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were using, and happily so, Auromere, for ages and it was really good. The licorice flavour took getting used to but it worked well and had a good, quality ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;When we ran out I filled in with some toothpaste from Trader Joe&#x27;s....ugghh...you kind of can&#x27;t go back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; feeling toothpaste after using a more concentrated one like Auromere...also I felt like my teeth weren&#x27;t getting as bright with that one..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking for Auromere on here I ran across this toothpaste and was impressed by it&#x27;s ingredient list...or lack of ingredients as the case is with this sort of toothpaste. All the un-needed nasties are left out. Cool.&lt;br /&gt;Not really any need to go in to all of that, if you&#x27;re here and reading you&#x27;re also looking for a nice toothpaste that isn&#x27;t full chemicals and things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste reminds me very much of the Auromere density and concentratedness (that&#x27;s gotta be a word). This was pleasing to me because it means you just need a little wee pea sized dab on your tooth brush and you&#x27;re good to go. The density means it clings to the brush and then your teeth, not slopping and glopping loosely like the Trader Joe&#x27;s stuffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint is delightful!!! I really mean that. It&#x27;s very minty but it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth or lips, it&#x27;s more like a pleasant dinner mint sort of feel..a little cool and tingly but not overwhelming. Mind you that sort of thing is subjective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing and why I believe this is our default toothpaste for the forseeable future. IT CLEANS REALLY WELL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I brushed my teeth the first time I noticed they were brighter and had that silky surface feeling like after a dentist cleaning! (I use an electric toothbrush which aids tremendously but with the previous toothpastes, the TJ&#x27;s etc I found my teeth did not get this smooth, extra clean feel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear they look brighter and whiter too.&lt;br /&gt;NOT BLEACHED, yeesh our society has become obsessed with &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; teeth. Teeth don&#x27;t need to be blindingly white, clean teeth look clean and bright and don&#x27;t glow in the dark (episode of Friends reference..Ross..anyone?, haha)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways we enjoy a lot of coffee, a nice amount of red wine and our teeth can use that extra boost of cleaning power to keep them bright. Coffee tends to stain the teeth and needs that extra scrubbing power to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways very very pleased. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from the toothpaste. But I was actually a little wowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you&#x27;re looking for a healthier toothpaste option, a nice mint flavour, a concentrated formula where a little goes a long way and a really clean tooth feeling then this will work for you!lectric toothbrush which aids tremendously but with the previous toothpastes, the TJ&#x27;s etc I found my teeth did not get this smooth, extra clean feel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear they look brighter and whiter too.&lt;br /&gt;NOT BLEACHED, yeesh our society has become obsessed with &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; teeth.

            <li> I love the Jason Seafresh Toothpaste.  It tastes good, and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain any toxic fluoride, SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), or zinc.  My dentist strongly advised me to stop using the Tom&#x27;s brand of toothpaste I had been using for months because it contains both SLS and zinc.  I had heard about the cases of peripheral neuropathy that resulted from the zinc that is in many denture cream adhesives.  I have all of my teeth and therefore do not have to use denture cream adhesives, but just to be on  the safe side, I asked my dentist if the zinc in my Tom&#x27;s toothpaste might also be toxic.  He said it&#x27;s possible and told me to switch to another toothpaste without zinc for tartar control.  After researching different toothpaste brands, I discovered the Jason Seafresh Toothpaste and ordered it.  It is also a tartar control toothpaste, and it always leaves my teeth feeling very clean and smooth.  I can tell already that it is helping to prevent plaque build up--and without any toxic zinc.  Jason Seafresh Toothpaste is also good for strengthening and whitening teeth.  I am very pleased with this toothpaste and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this for many years, just love it and is so natural. I can only recommend this product .</li>
            <li> This toothpaste very quickly disappears in your mouth when wet, therefore a lot is required.  The bottle runs out much faster than your traditional tube.  Additionally, I had frequent mouth sores while using this product.  I wonder if it was some sort of allergic reaction.  Finally, I didn&#x27;t feel any lasting freshness or clean feeling after brushing with this.  To Jason&#x27;s credit, I&#x27;ve used the gel product in contrast to the paste here and had a better experience.</li>
            <li> Minty and makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers nicely and leaves your mouth with cool, minty fresh breath after brushing. Teeth feel clean, as well.</li>
            <li> I am trying to transition to a more holistic lifestyle which for me means cutting out fluoride. Since this is &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; I expected a nasty taste and a bit of grit. This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. My teeth feel amazing after brushing and the mint gives it a great natural flavor. They kinda cheat you out of a bit in the tube, but I suppose that&#x27;s a packaging flaw. Other than that this is the best!</li>
            <li> Tastes good, whitens, no fluoride. What else do you need? Even my husband likes it and he is not obsessed with natural products the I am.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste available today and NO fluoride!  Great taste, too.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you this toothpaste feels like the regular stuff, I loved the texture and how it is refreshing. Two thumbs up, found the perfect natural product finally.</li>
            <li> JASON&#x27;S SEA FRESH toothpaste does not contain fluoride or sodium laurel sulfate, two ingredients I have found irritate  perioral dermatitis, a condition I seem to have developed.  I didn&#x27;t find any other toothpaste to fill the bill.  This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling very fresh and my teeth clean.  I will continue to use it.  My husband likes it too!</li>
            <li> Jason&#x27;s toothpaste is a wonderful toothpaste.  It keeps my mouth very clean and I don&#x27;t have to use mouthwash.  It also has a great taste!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this toothpaste and loves it! It ain&#x27;t cheap, but it&#x27;s good stuff and it arrived in short order.</li>
            <li> Was nervous to try this but after reading a lot about it online thought I&#x27;d give it a shot and I&#x27;m in love. Tom&#x27;s has always been too strongly flavored for my linking but this product is a nice balance.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF I USED IT FOR MY 4 AND 8 YEAR OLD YOU CAN USED IT AS WELL</li>
            <li> Great taste! I have been using for by a year or two ! Fluoride free!</li>
            <li> Does an awesome job. Nice mellow mint flavor. Better then Toms of Maine, which I have been using. Love the click cap so much better then the screw cap. Does not make you hurl if you swallow some.</li>
            <li> After reading the comments about the ingredients in Tom&#x27;s toothpaste, I knew that I needed to switch. I am very happy so far. It has a great flavor and seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> has Carrageenan in it.. how can there be so many 5 stars for toothpaste with poison in it?</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for almost a year now. I love the flavor in your mouth and it makes your breath feel fresh! I love the &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; concept with no fluoride etc... I have been fluoride free for over a year now and I can feel the difference! Your dentist may think you are crazy when you tell them to use this toothpaste, instead of there disgusting paste/polish; don&#x27;t let the peer pressure get to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes this is overpriced, but would you rather use baking soda?</li>
            <li> Great natural toothpaste and very good flavor.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is definitely worth spending the money on, if you&#x27;re looking for all-natural toothpaste. It&#x27;s got NO flouride, no SLS, no artificial colors or sweeteners, no saccharin, no propylene glycol. It tastes good and doesn&#x27;t burn either.</li>
            <li> This recently became my favorite toothpaste of all the jason toothpaste i&#x27;ve yet tried, taste just like spearmint but not to over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Jason products over the years and this toothpaste is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice fresh taste, cleans teeth very well and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of bad ingredients like so many mainstream toothpastes do. A little goes a long way with this toothpaste, only a pea size portion required on your brush, to do a thorough cleaning job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go to toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Tastes great. Nice and foamy. Cruelty free as well. I highly recommended it to anyone looking for a great tasting all natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste taste great, works well. I tried all the other brands and they pale in comparison. If you are really trying to clean yourself from fluoride and other toxins I highly recommended you give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have perioral dermatitis and it was suggested I try something all natural. This toothpaste is very gritty and leaves your teeth feeling &amp;#34;dirty.&amp;#34;  I constantly felt like I needed to brush them again.  I also had a bad taste in my mouth. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great natural toothpaste. Tastes good and suds well.</li>
            <li> After finding out the huge conspiracy and false science on fluoride, confirmed by my doctor, I immediately tossed my old crappy toothpaste and tap water. Jason was the only thing in my city that didn&#x27;t have fluoride in it. It tastes great and won&#x27;t kill you, which is all that maters to me in a toothpaste. JUST watch how other companies stop dropping fluoride from their list of inGREEDients over time once they realize what&#x27;s happening to their market as people wake up.</li>
            <li> To start off, I&#x27;m a \\&quot;health snob\\&quot; skeptic. I tend to tune out when someone tries to explain to me how mainstream products are giving us cancer, etc. But one blog post got me curious and I took her leading to order this toothpaste. At first glance, it is off white and slightly brown. I had to close my eyes to get it into my mouth, thinking that this would be another waste of my money and to my surprise it was refreshing. It has a great mint flavor, smooth texture and no after taste. I also notice that my teeth feel and look cleaner than before. I haven&#x27;t gone back to fluoride toothpaste and my dentist hasn&#x27;t even noticed that I have switched.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Excellent product as described.  A bit pricey.  Otherwise would have been five stars.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! It&#x27;s good for you, and doesn&#x27;t contain all those additives and harmful chemicals :)&lt;br /&gt;I also like the taste and would recommend it to anyone...see the 5 stars lol</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writing reviews but I think this toothpaste is the way to go. I&#x27;m got perioral dermititis which is thought to be exacerbated by SLS and flouride. I&#x27;m hoping that by switching to this toothpaste I will reduce the frequency of my outbreaks significantly. I like that it still acts like normal toothpaste with bubbles and minty flavor. It&#x27;s got an off-white color which might bother some folks but I didn&#x27;t care. Get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li> Good taste. Lasts a long time. You only need a tiny bit</li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t taste awful like some brands do!</li>
            <li> Love this sulfate free toothpaste</li>
            <li> This one of the few tooth pastes that do not have ingredients known to be toxic. The Jason website has this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The J&#x27;S&amp;Ouml;N toothpastes promise:&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; No Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfates&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; No Preservatives&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; No Artificial Colors&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; No Artificial Sweeteners&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; No Saccharin&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; No Propylene Glycol&lt;br /&gt;&#x27; No Gluten&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients listed here are the same as on the Jason website except for a few plant seed extracts missing here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only toothpaste I will use because almost all of them, including supposedly natural ones, have toxic ingredients. If they go in your mouth, some of them are going to go in your body. It tastes good, not sickly sweet, and doesn&#x27;t affect the taste of what you eat later - a scary effect of many toothpastes. It has a good consistency, leaves a fresh taste, and foams well enough to make  you feel your teeth have been cleaned. The price is also reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised down. This ingredient &amp;#34;sodium cocoyl glutamate&amp;#34; is chemically similar to sodium lauryl sulfate which it replaces as a sudsing agent. It is also dubious and I have decided to avoid it. I found few studies on its toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.anbportal.com/absolutenm/templates/?a&#x3D;369&amp;z&#x3D;57&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves various all natural toothpastes without any chemicals to use. There are a number of them and they are ok to use. [[ASIN:B003CTU27W Uncle Harry&#x27;s Natural Toothpaste - Peppermint (3 Oz Glass Jar)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still of commercial toothpastes this is one of the safest.</li>
            <li> love it. will buy again</li>
            <li> It works awesome!!! I recommend to everyone to start using it!!! It smells great and the texture is great also.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes more like peppermint than the spearmint I expected and has a strong taste to it but I don&#x27;t use much at a time and as long as it works and I vegan and cruelty free I will handle the peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> No harmful chemicals and good taste and good price and excellent service. I would recommends it to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I have quit using commercial toothpastes with fluoride long ago and appreciate the &#x27;fluoride-free&#x27; variety of choices available.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, many companies (such as Jason, Nature&#x27;s Gate, Desert Essence, Kiss My Face etc.) have been implicated in the past in &#x27;green washing&#x27;...  claiming that their cosmetic line was organic, while still using synthetic ingredients (keep in mind that Jason is not any small mom and pop owned company, but was &#x27;acquired&#x27; in 2004 by Hain-Celestial Group controlled by HJ Heinz, the corporate giant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do not buy any other cosmetics from any of these companies, both Jason&#x27;s and Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpastes have been made with relatively safe ingredients without any harsh chemicals and/or fluoride, and I have used and liked them over the years.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the SeaFresh flavor goes - it&#x27;s quite pleasantly tasting, cleans well and leaves fresh feeling in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend doing your own research and looking at the ingredients before buying, just to decide whether they &#x27;feel or sound&#x27; good to you.&lt;br /&gt;Given the choices available, I feel like this would be preferable one to many other, more popular toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It tasted better than I thought it would for a natural toothpaste and the size of the tube was also good.</li>
            <li> It has a great mellow mint taste to it, and it whitens my teeth, too. I am now ready to buy the mouthwash to go with it. Very good product</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s so you know I have tried many tooth cleaners in my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;However, I am absolutely WILD about Jason.&lt;br /&gt;(I am currently trying out Jason&#x27;s other toothpaste  . . . the one with tea tree and cinnamon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste version (Sea Fresh) is just that - - FRESH.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves one&#x27;s mouth Tingly Clean (sounds like a commercial, I know!) - - LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also thrilled that I am using this great paste for something else for off use.&lt;br /&gt;So far it shows much promise!&lt;br /&gt;I will update you later on what other use I have for Jason.&lt;br /&gt;Until then . . . go on and order this product. It comes highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You For Listening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RG</li>
            <li> I have used this brand and type for along time now and still love it. Every one says the floride is good for you???? I dont think so... In the past year I have cut out all of the floride in the water and in the toothpaste and I have had less problems with my teeth and less headaches!!!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping it wasn&#x27;t nasty and it didn&#x27;t let me down. The flavor is as good as any mint tooth paste. Happy that it&#x27;s fluoride and gluten free.</li>
            <li> Product contains warning for accidental poisoning of children.  WTF? This applies to adults as well.  Company claims product to be natural but is not.  No need for powerful detergents in toothpaste when absorption is at 90%.  Only good thing about this product is that now I know it is poisonous and will now make my own natural tooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste ever.  When I used to brush with other toothpaste my gums would occasionally bleed and would often get canker sores in my mouth, probably due to the chemicals they use to make them.  Since switching to Jason&#x27;s natural toothpaste my gums have stopped bleeding and my mouth is healthier and stays fresher longer than it has ever.  The flavor is great too; not like other natural toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time!  Love it!  Fresh and minty!</li>
            <li> ...over 30 sec if u brush daily ,coz it gonna remove tooth enamel, making your teeth more sensitive to cold/worm or sour/sweet. Basically its a pure chalk powder + menthol ,kinda 1960&#x27;s paste .The end ;)))</li>
            <li> Cleans the teeth and leaves a great feeling in the mouth not harsh, no additives, I love this product because so many toothpasts leave sores in my mouth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really minty and it lasts. A little goes a long way for me.  And its a pretty safe toothpaste.  I think I&#x27;ve found the one to keep.</li>
            <li> Favorite toothpaste! I was nervous about not using fluoride anymore but honestly my teeth have never been healthier.</li>
            <li> Had some issues that appeared to be a sensitivity to SLS.  I found it pretty difficult to find a toothpaste that did not have it, even those who claimed natural ingredients.  This toothpaste is free of SLS and using it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Great alternative for toothpaste without SLS and fluoride, both of which I have developed sensitivity to over the years. It doesn&#x27;t have a weird aftertaste like other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands and I feel it keeps my mouth feeling and smelling fresh when I also floss regularly.</li>
            <li> So if you need it then yes, it works. I don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t seem to dissolve, not even under running water. Weird.</li>
            <li> I love Jason&#x27;s products but this one irritates my gums. If you have sensitive gums or irritated gums already stear clear of this toothpaste. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the mint in the toothpaste but it makes my already sensitive/irritated gums more irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s gums can be irritated for different reasons. Mine is because I accidentally cut my gums with a plaque picker while trying to clean around the gums. But when this toothpaste hits your gums, it&#x27;s very strong. At least for me it is. It&#x27;s a very strong toothpaste. Unless you have strong gums and a healthy mouth. This will only irritate it. Stick with something more gentle on the gums and teeth. At least I have to, until I find a dentist who can irrigate  deep in my gums where I cut it. Ahh.. It&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed anything, but my toothpaste and my teeth are getting whiter and whiter. It tastes yummy, but is super bubbly. My husband doesn&#x27;t like it because of how frothy it gets (makes him gag), but it is not a problem for me. Just an FYI.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again, great whitening, and good price, also heals gums, mouth feels very clean! Would tell friends to buy it!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpase. All natural and leaves mouth refreshed and teeth remarkably white!&lt;br /&gt;I am a believer in all JASON.</li>
            <li> Very nice spearmint taste!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! My sister gave me a tube awhile back, i had it in my rotation with toms natural toothpaste and aquafresh. I found my self going for the jasons most of the time, it tastes great and is really foamy. Best part is no flouride, not sure about that stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using Zout for stain removal, and wanted to switch to cruelty-free companies.  I am happy to report that this product works better than Zout, and am so happy that I made the switch. Will definatey buy again.</li>
            <li> The taste is okay - minty, but unremarkable. It gets my teeth really clean. I am glad to find this due to allergies. Pleasant to brush with.</li>
            <li> It is ok. I used Toms Floride Free natural paste for years in spearmint gel, but when Colgate bought Toms I did not want to give them my money nor did I trust them to take over a natural company due to my health issues. My issue is peppermint is more popular and I horribly dislike peppermint, too strong. This was the closest I could find to what I needed but unfortunately, even this spearmint/mint taste is a little too strong I wish it were more mild like the Toms. But not a deal breaker so far although I do plan to try something else when it starts to run out.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes good, which I can&#x27;t say the same about Tom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I wanted to try this toothpaste is because of the combination of it being SLS and fluoride free. I switched to Tom&#x27;s fluoride free about three-four months ago, it was okay. But, it did nothing for my canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had chronic canker sores ever since I was young. They would always occur in the same places and would heal and then come back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the solution with a simple google search. I tried taking vitamin b12, that did nothing. Finally I tried switching toothpaste. I went from Colgate to Tom&#x27;s, with still no luck. Finally I found the only SLS free toothpaste I could find locally, this toothpaste and boy does it work! It cleans like any other toothpaste and it tastes good! Unlike other toothpastes though it doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth dry and unlike some nasty toothpastes, doesn&#x27;t cause skin cells in the mouth to die. My mouth feels clean, refreshed and I feel great knowing there&#x27;s less chemicals in my toothpaste. I don&#x27;t rinse my mouth!</li>
            <li> I want to brush my teeth as much as I can since I got this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;My mouth feel so fresh and I like the smell also.</li>
            <li> After implementing serious dietary changes in my life, I decided it was time to start going about changing some other facets of my daily routines. I decided to try this toothpaste because it is fluoride free and SLS free. I love it! It tastes great and seems to be doing a great job on cleaning my teeth (along with flossing and oil pulling).</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste. I was getting sick sometimes from my fluoride toothpaste so I tried a couple of different natural ones. This one has been the best thus far. The flavor is not too strong and my teeth are still pretty white.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I originally bought for my toddler who hasn&#x27;t figured out spitting yet (it does not include fluoride) but I ran out and tried it and my  mouth is definitely cleaner feeling and the minty taste stays longer than &#x27;regular&#x27; toothpaste. This is my new brand and I won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> get the one with fluoride cause there&#x27;s so much sugar nowadays</li>
            <li> Very good toothpaste.  Takes just a little.  No chemicals which was just what we wanted with our child.</li>
            <li> If you want something natural, this has a good fresh taste.</li>
            <li> I love the flavor of this toothpaste! It gets my teeth clean and white and tastes great. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find!</li>
            <li> I think the price is a bit high for toothpast, but the product works will and I like the fact that it is all natural. I will search ofr a better price the next time I purchase this.</li>
            <li> It gives you a fresh taste afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;It feels natural.&lt;br /&gt;Many of the other organic toothpaste doesn&#x27;t have a taste, doesn&#x27;t make bubbles. It&#x27;s like washing my teeth with clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t affect your stomach.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than usual toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. My primary reason for purchasing is that it is fluoride-free. In addition to that, I love that it does not have a lot of the other unnecessary and chemical-laden ingredients that other toothpastes have, even fluoride-free pastes.</li>
            <li> Tastes like regular toothpaste without the fluoride, and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong taste in the mouth for more than a few minutes.</li>
