            <li>Really good product!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>And the best part--it smells like warm vanilla.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the effect this had on my hair and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, fruity fragrance that does not overwhelm.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant at all ... not on my hair, and not on hers.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a good price for the value.</li>
            <li>The one good thing I can say is that this product is not sticky.  </li>
            <li>Its nice to get a product that gives you a good value for the money and lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not any more!</li>
            <li>I love that!</li>
            <li>Just loving this.</li>
            <li>I do love it, it&#x27;s really good for my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling or looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is effective at taming the frizzies.</li>
            <li>and I had a nice sheen to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would buy this for a friend as a gift; it&#x27;s that nice.</li>
            <li>leaves a nice shine and helps to keep my curls defined throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Even if I liked the scent, I do not want to smell my hair products all day.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I really liked the smell -</li>
            <li>Smells good and your hair is smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>This product is quite good, affordable, and easy to find.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>The hold and frizz control are very light, but I need a medium hold for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, lightweight product that applies easily and reduces frizz in my curly hair.</li>
            <li>But this is so much more affordable.</li>
            <li>That probably stems from most formulations being silicone based.  </li>
            <li>More than the optimal amount and the hair tends to look &#x27;greasy,&#x27; to use her word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I can appreciate the shine, looks like what you see in many of the TV commercials when they are trying to promote how health a product makes your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is better than mousse, because it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of static electricity in me.</li>
            <li>One pump is definitely enough, I just use it on the ends of my hair, feels great!</li>
            <li>I even combed it through for a better application.</li>
            <li>It not only controlled my frizzies but gave my hair a beautiful shine!</li>
            <li>Either way, it took more than one or two pumps, more like four.</li>
            <li>My wife has loved argan oil since she first tried them, but this one was not a hit.</li>
            <li>Makes my fine, damaged, fizzy hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>however I did like the results once I figured out the best way to use it for my long curly fine</li>
            <li>She also says the oil doesn&#x27;t smooth out her hair the way most others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Pantene product is essentially a gentle hair tonic that will quickly apply moisture to your strands giving your hair a healthy sheen, pleasant fragrance and dampens any issues with frizz.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it really keeps my hair healthy!</li>
            <li>The product sprays easily without clogging.</li>
            <li>it was light, but really nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>noticed it has a moderately strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not too strong, but if you have a sensitivity to fragrances, you may want to look for something else.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and color treated and this product works well.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>If you have fine + frizzy hair don&#x27;t use this product unless you like the greasy look.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum With Argan Oil  is way too strong smelling for me</li>
            <li>My daughter has hair like a Jamaican war witch, and this has tamed it down to smooth, glossy and wonderfully manageable.</li>
            <li>She likes the smell of the pure argan oil, and has enjoyed most hair products infused with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When used in tandem with the Pantene Pro-V Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner, my hair looks, feels and acts like it&#x27;s been pampered at a high-class salon.</li>
            <li>it helps prevent heat damage from the blow dryer keeping hair frizz free, and, in my case, helps to curb unwanted curling.  </li>
            <li>Silky, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>She blow dries her hair Monday through Friday and has found that the oil helps to smooth the hair and imparts a light shine to it when applied sparingly (for her shoulder length,</li>
            <li>I prefer spray on oils to keep my hair moisturized and Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li>I need my hair to be shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Pantene Smooth serum.</li>
            <li>If you have used Moraccan Oil, you know what a light touch is required to achieve the desired results ...  </li>
            <li>I thought this serum made my hair shine and smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall, a perfectly usable hair product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Worked great in straight hair also has a nice smell to it that lingers a long time after you apply to your hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this with Pantene shampoo and conditioner and it has significantly reduced the amount of my hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing many folks have tried some of these and, truthfully, found many to be similar.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to trh the Pro-V Serum with Argan Oil via Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent is something I&#x27;d consider uniquely Pantene.</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>Plus it adds a clean and shiny look to it.  </li>
            <li>As it contains silicone occasional use of a good clarifying is in order.  </li>
            <li>I use this mostly when I style my hair straight</li>
            <li>It did add shine, but it didn&#x27;t really look better.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong, but it is noticeable at first.</li>
            <li>First, the spritzer didn&#x27;t apply it in a fine mist.</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>It gets super frizzy in the humidity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a constant struggle for me to balance getting more body into my hair vs. more frizz.</li>
            <li>but personally I like the clean, moisturized look that the oil on it&#x27;s own provides.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of adding shine and improving the feel of dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is fine, I don&#x27;t use product very often.  </li>
            <li>but luckily most products keep my hair from going wildly frizzy.</li>
            <li>put a couple of pumps worth of this Pantene Pro Serum in my hair</li>
            <li>I can brush my hair without the static wanting to make my hair stand on end, It left my hair feeling and looking soft and shiney, and the fragrance is nice too.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as it should and actually makes my damaged hair look healthy!</li>
            <li>I love Argan Oil to make my hair more lustrous and shiny and less frizzy - living in a very humid climate, that&#x27;s important for me.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t get it quite right.</li>
            <li>in all, this is effective for smoothing hair and seems to nourish it, but it&#x27;s a small bottle with a sprayer which needs to produce a better mist effect.</li>
            <li>Helps hair to be smooth and sleek even on high humidity days</li>
            <li>did take a bit of trial and error to figure out that for my hair it is best to use when wet and to just spritz a tiny bit onto my hand to use on the ends of my hair otherwise if when I  get too much on my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several and the only difference, besides great price variations,</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft with this product in it, and I can easily run my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, use very, very little and then add more if you feel you need a touch more.</li>
            <li>I think vigorous brushing might have done it faster, but brushing actually frizzes hair more and kills curls</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed quite readily the minute it hits your skin.</li>
            <li>This was a bit problematic for me as even after several times washing my hands, the product smell seemed sinked into my skin and it lingered more than I like.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li>I tried using it several times and every time it seemed to make my hair More frizzy.</li>
            <li>&quot; I do prefer the natural/organic ones (simply because they seem to do a slightly better job).</li>
            <li>This product has really helped me with my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>but this is very light but at the same time  very moisturizing and smoothing.  </li>
            <li>One thing I will say was that it did not leave an oily residue, which is nice compared to other products.</li>
            <li>It took away some frizz that had developed and helped it form back into some nice curls</li>
            <li>I was glad that it didn&#x27;t smell like perfume and that it did not linger overly long.</li>
            <li>She thought it smelled too overwhelming, too chemically, not the subtle spice scent of most argan oil products.</li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t have time to condition in the shower, so this serum is an amazing quick-fix for my mane.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome, I have baby fine and very curly hair, I have a real difficult time finding hair products that work for me.</li>
            <li>The Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum With Argan Oil joins the seemingly endless frizz eliminating products that the John Frieda original Frizz-Ease product seemed to spawn.  </li>
            <li>That meant it concentrated in certain areas rather than gave an even application.</li>
            <li>instructions tell you to pump a little gel on your hands, rub them together to warm it and spread it over your hands, then start with the ends of your hair and work your way up about halfway.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>With moderate to light use</li>
            <li>Too much and your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my wife likes the product, now that she knows just how much to use and how to apply it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it would pump too much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>And my desire is straight hair.</li>
            <li>and when I brush it it tends to want to stand on end due to the static electricity.</li>
            <li>I did not notice the greasy spots that some other reviewers have, but I made sure to mix it in my hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Nice product, I like the more expensive brand I have been using a little better.</li>
            <li>She also liked the smell but said that it took longer than usual with these products to wash out of her</li>
            <li>I was disappointed in the strong perfume added to this product, however, as the chemicals used in synthetic perfumes can cause dizziness, headaches, and many more symptoms both to the wearer and those nearby.</li>
            <li>Less is more when using this.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to carrying around the extra scent from your hands, you may want to consider using some cheap plastic gloves to apply the product.</li>
            <li>I like this serum better than some of the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair nice and soft and not at all stiff.  </li>
            <li>When I pet my cats I can feels little gaps under my hand and popping noises from the static electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many hair gels and spays hold too firm and people can tell that you have a hair product in your hair.  </li>
            <li>This worked well on straight, colored hair to smooth down some frizz.</li>
            <li>But, when you figure I have dry ends, and it is recommended that you only put 2 sprays in your hand, with my long hair, putting the balance of the product between my hands, rubbing, and smoothing the product into my ends, this works out quite good.  </li>
            <li>You use very little - too much and you&#x27;ll really get an oily look - but that is fine because it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling this is going to be hanging around in our bathroom as a full bottle for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It did tame most of my flyaway strands and gave my hairstyle a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair (well past my shoulders) which has a lot of natural curl - which ends up being frizzy a good part of the time.  </li>
            <li>The secret to using Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum hair oil is to lightly spray it on the brush rather than directly onto the hair.  </li>
            <li>She applies it wet, but you can do it dry as well, and it takes all the frizz out, and restores a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li>The Pantene serum worked well enough, adding an extra bit of shine, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it was super noticeable in a night-and-day difference.</li>
            <li>That naturally brings up the question</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m eager to see what it does with old gray manes like mine.</li>
            <li>The product blended in seamlessly so you wouldn&#x27;t know there was additional product added to the hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product in my hair that made it look natural.  </li>
            <li>This product allows your hair to lay naturally without getting frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, it looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Do not use this near your roots since your natural oils serve this function (and you do not want your hair to look oily).    </li>
            <li>(it didn&#x27;t make the curls but helped bring out my natural curls).</li>
            <li>I suggest using only a small amount of the product (one squirt) to begin with and then see if you needs more.</li>
            <li>First, I should say that I have very long, wavy, thick hair that has good body, but low shine (due to my age - 50).</li>
            <li>The base ingredient here is Moroccan Argan oil which easily nestles itself into your hair and provides a nice buttery finish that should last over the course of a day under normal conditions.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was the alcohol, but I thought it seemed a little harsh for my kind of hair.</li>
            <li>There is a noticeable fragrance upon initial application - a bit on the sweet side like most commercial commercials but it will gently dissipate in a hour or so to a very subtle level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply other styling products over the serum if needed</li>
            <li>From the feel of the product, the silicone is the major ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have barely put a dent in it!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I live in an area with pretty hard water, and even with the softener, it tends to leave hair a bit duller than normal.</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, wavy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to tuck in a bag or desk drawer insuring you have frizz free hair while on the go.</li>
            <li>It fades over time, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to such scents, that may be an issue.</li>
            <li>I have hair down past the middle of my back and the ends sometimes get dry and fly away, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly clean, salon smell, but I still prefer no smell if I had a choice - at least from my hands when I think the product should be washed off.</li>
            <li>Normally, she likes how the oil works out the tangles in her long, Asian hair.</li>
            <li>it really weighed my hair down and made it look/feel greasy.</li>
            <li>With a small amount of this Smooth Serum which I applied to wet hair, my frizz was under control</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got pretty thick and dark hair, generally pretty shiny by itself.</li>
            <li>This is a good alternative (and much less expensive) than the Josie Maran Argan Oil I always use (and still have).  </li>
            <li>Two pumps can be just a little too much for those who are complaining of a greasy look.  </li>

            <li> She also says the oil doesn&#x27;t smooth out her hair the way most others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Pantene product is essentially a gentle hair tonic that will quickly apply moisture to your strands giving your hair a healthy sheen, pleasant fragrance and dampens any issues with frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it really keeps my hair healthy!</li>
            <li> The product sprays easily without clogging.</li>
            <li> it was light, but really nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> noticed it has a moderately strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not too strong, but if you have a sensitivity to fragrances, you may want to look for something else.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and color treated and this product works well.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> If you have fine + frizzy hair don&#x27;t use this product unless you like the greasy look.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum With Argan Oil  is way too strong smelling for me</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair like a Jamaican war witch, and this has tamed it down to smooth, glossy and wonderfully manageable.</li>
            <li> She likes the smell of the pure argan oil, and has enjoyed most hair products infused with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When used in tandem with the Pantene Pro-V Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner, my hair looks, feels and acts like it&#x27;s been pampered at a high-class salon.</li>
            <li> it helps prevent heat damage from the blow dryer keeping hair frizz free, and, in my case, helps to curb unwanted curling.  </li>
            <li> Silky, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> She blow dries her hair Monday through Friday and has found that the oil helps to smooth the hair and imparts a light shine to it when applied sparingly (for her shoulder length,</li>
            <li> I prefer spray on oils to keep my hair moisturized and Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> I need my hair to be shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Pantene Smooth serum.</li>
            <li> If you have used Moraccan Oil, you know what a light touch is required to achieve the desired results ...  </li>
            <li> I thought this serum made my hair shine and smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall, a perfectly usable hair product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Worked great in straight hair also has a nice smell to it that lingers a long time after you apply to your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this with Pantene shampoo and conditioner and it has significantly reduced the amount of my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing many folks have tried some of these and, truthfully, found many to be similar.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to trh the Pro-V Serum with Argan Oil via Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent is something I&#x27;d consider uniquely Pantene.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> Plus it adds a clean and shiny look to it.  </li>
            <li> As it contains silicone occasional use of a good clarifying is in order.  </li>
            <li> I use this mostly when I style my hair straight</li>
            <li> It did add shine, but it didn&#x27;t really look better.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong, but it is noticeable at first.</li>
            <li> First, the spritzer didn&#x27;t apply it in a fine mist.</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> It gets super frizzy in the humidity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a constant struggle for me to balance getting more body into my hair vs. more frizz.</li>
            <li> but personally I like the clean, moisturized look that the oil on it&#x27;s own provides.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of adding shine and improving the feel of dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is fine, I don&#x27;t use product very often.  </li>
            <li> but luckily most products keep my hair from going wildly frizzy.</li>
            <li> put a couple of pumps worth of this Pantene Pro Serum in my hair</li>
            <li> I can brush my hair without the static wanting to make my hair stand on end, It left my hair feeling and looking soft and shiney, and the fragrance is nice too.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should and actually makes my damaged hair look healthy!</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil to make my hair more lustrous and shiny and less frizzy - living in a very humid climate, that&#x27;s important for me.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t get it quite right.</li>
            <li> in all, this is effective for smoothing hair and seems to nourish it, but it&#x27;s a small bottle with a sprayer which needs to produce a better mist effect.</li>
            <li> Helps hair to be smooth and sleek even on high humidity days</li>
            <li> did take a bit of trial and error to figure out that for my hair it is best to use when wet and to just spritz a tiny bit onto my hand to use on the ends of my hair otherwise if when I  get too much on my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and the only difference, besides great price variations,</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft with this product in it, and I can easily run my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, use very, very little and then add more if you feel you need a touch more.</li>
            <li> I think vigorous brushing might have done it faster, but brushing actually frizzes hair more and kills curls</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed quite readily the minute it hits your skin.</li>
            <li> This was a bit problematic for me as even after several times washing my hands, the product smell seemed sinked into my skin and it lingered more than I like.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> I tried using it several times and every time it seemed to make my hair More frizzy.</li>
            <li> &quot; I do prefer the natural/organic ones (simply because they seem to do a slightly better job).</li>
            <li> This product has really helped me with my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> but this is very light but at the same time  very moisturizing and smoothing.  </li>
            <li> One thing I will say was that it did not leave an oily residue, which is nice compared to other products.</li>
            <li> It took away some frizz that had developed and helped it form back into some nice curls</li>
            <li> I was glad that it didn&#x27;t smell like perfume and that it did not linger overly long.</li>
            <li> She thought it smelled too overwhelming, too chemically, not the subtle spice scent of most argan oil products.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t have time to condition in the shower, so this serum is an amazing quick-fix for my mane.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, I have baby fine and very curly hair, I have a real difficult time finding hair products that work for me.</li>
            <li> The Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum With Argan Oil joins the seemingly endless frizz eliminating products that the John Frieda original Frizz-Ease product seemed to spawn.  </li>
            <li> That meant it concentrated in certain areas rather than gave an even application.</li>
            <li> instructions tell you to pump a little gel on your hands, rub them together to warm it and spread it over your hands, then start with the ends of your hair and work your way up about halfway.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> With moderate to light use</li>
            <li> Too much and your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my wife likes the product, now that she knows just how much to use and how to apply it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it would pump too much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> And my desire is straight hair.</li>
            <li> and when I brush it it tends to want to stand on end due to the static electricity.</li>
            <li> I did not notice the greasy spots that some other reviewers have, but I made sure to mix it in my hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Nice product, I like the more expensive brand I have been using a little better.</li>
            <li> She also liked the smell but said that it took longer than usual with these products to wash out of her</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the strong perfume added to this product, however, as the chemicals used in synthetic perfumes can cause dizziness, headaches, and many more symptoms both to the wearer and those nearby.</li>
            <li> Less is more when using this.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to carrying around the extra scent from your hands, you may want to consider using some cheap plastic gloves to apply the product.</li>
            <li> I like this serum better than some of the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair nice and soft and not at all stiff.  </li>
            <li> When I pet my cats I can feels little gaps under my hand and popping noises from the static electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many hair gels and spays hold too firm and people can tell that you have a hair product in your hair.  </li>
            <li> This worked well on straight, colored hair to smooth down some frizz.</li>
            <li> But, when you figure I have dry ends, and it is recommended that you only put 2 sprays in your hand, with my long hair, putting the balance of the product between my hands, rubbing, and smoothing the product into my ends, this works out quite good.  </li>
            <li> You use very little - too much and you&#x27;ll really get an oily look - but that is fine because it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling this is going to be hanging around in our bathroom as a full bottle for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It did tame most of my flyaway strands and gave my hairstyle a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (well past my shoulders) which has a lot of natural curl - which ends up being frizzy a good part of the time.  </li>
            <li> The secret to using Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum hair oil is to lightly spray it on the brush rather than directly onto the hair.  </li>
            <li> She applies it wet, but you can do it dry as well, and it takes all the frizz out, and restores a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> The Pantene serum worked well enough, adding an extra bit of shine, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it was super noticeable in a night-and-day difference.</li>
            <li> That naturally brings up the question</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m eager to see what it does with old gray manes like mine.</li>
            <li> The product blended in seamlessly so you wouldn&#x27;t know there was additional product added to the hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product in my hair that made it look natural.  </li>
            <li> This product allows your hair to lay naturally without getting frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, it looks natural.  </li>
            <li> Do not use this near your roots since your natural oils serve this function (and you do not want your hair to look oily).    </li>
            <li> (it didn&#x27;t make the curls but helped bring out my natural curls).</li>
            <li> I suggest using only a small amount of the product (one squirt) to begin with and then see if you needs more.</li>
            <li> First, I should say that I have very long, wavy, thick hair that has good body, but low shine (due to my age - 50).</li>
            <li> The base ingredient here is Moroccan Argan oil which easily nestles itself into your hair and provides a nice buttery finish that should last over the course of a day under normal conditions.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was the alcohol, but I thought it seemed a little harsh for my kind of hair.</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable fragrance upon initial application - a bit on the sweet side like most commercial commercials but it will gently dissipate in a hour or so to a very subtle level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply other styling products over the serum if needed</li>
            <li> From the feel of the product, the silicone is the major ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have barely put a dent in it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I live in an area with pretty hard water, and even with the softener, it tends to leave hair a bit duller than normal.</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, wavy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to tuck in a bag or desk drawer insuring you have frizz free hair while on the go.</li>
            <li> It fades over time, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to such scents, that may be an issue.</li>
            <li> I have hair down past the middle of my back and the ends sometimes get dry and fly away, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly clean, salon smell, but I still prefer no smell if I had a choice - at least from my hands when I think the product should be washed off.</li>
            <li> Normally, she likes how the oil works out the tangles in her long, Asian hair.</li>
            <li> it really weighed my hair down and made it look/feel greasy.</li>
            <li> With a small amount of this Smooth Serum which I applied to wet hair, my frizz was under control</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got pretty thick and dark hair, generally pretty shiny by itself.</li>
            <li> This is a good alternative (and much less expensive) than the Josie Maran Argan Oil I always use (and still have).  </li>
            <li> Two pumps can be just a little too much for those who are complaining of a greasy look.  </li>
            <li> It definitely feels soft, silky, and was easier to comb than it is at other times.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair strands that get frizzy especially in dry air or with static electricity.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Pantine Smooth Serum to see if it helped me look less like a mad scientist since I live near the beach and humidity is very common</li>
            <li> My hair is long, blonde &amp; looked frizzy on the ends.</li>
            <li> Since folks tend to use these things in several ways I&#x27;ll say I wanted something that would allow me to blow dry my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t tend to curl.  </li>
            <li> Chances are I&#x27;ll only be using it on my wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely easier to apply the gel on wet hair than dry</li>
            <li> dry hair</li>
            <li> I applied it to dry hair and combed it through, but even then I had that look</li>
            <li> I used it when the hair was dry.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t unpleasant to me, but is strong enough that someone nearby might notice.</li>
            <li> When used sparingly this product imparts smoothness and shine to wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I tried varying amounts of the product, and even using less seemed to create the same problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it both with wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this three times--once dry, twice wet.</li>
            <li> So, while one can experiment with an endless variety of similar products, some expensive, it seems this one gets it right at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> Really does wonders on my fuzzy, thin hair.</li>
            <li> and there are some areas which look wet and clump together.</li>
            <li> When I used even the tiniest bit of the product with my conditioner on wet hair</li>
            <li> Some people like that look, but I don&#x27;t because it makes me look like a wet labradoodle.</li>
            <li> When applied to wet hair in moderate amounts (no reason to use this heavily I can think of)</li>
            <li> That means I can tolerate fairly heavy product in it (such as oil) without my hair flattening out or looking wet or oily.</li>
            <li> When I used even less on my dry hair it only helped with the frizz a little bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has fragrance--not unpleasant, but strong and I prefer unscented products.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little floral, a little chemical - a generic &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> I saw only a small improvement.  </li>
            <li> you get when you wet down your hair</li>
            <li> The smell was definitely less noticeable when I put it on wet (damp) hair vs</li>
            <li> used 2 pumps (plus a little) for my wet hair, then styled it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and you can avoid getting your hands oily when applying it.</li>
            <li> It did control frizz by way of just weighing down the hair a bit with oil.</li>
            <li> It used to take 25 minutes to brush and braid her hair, and this morning it took less than five.</li>
            <li> tried two combinations: (1) my volume shampoo + volume conditioner + Pantene Smooth serum and</li>
            <li> only real complaint was that it came in such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> This product &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;, but it does so imperfectly, at least on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it made it look a little shinier, but not too oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her recommendation is to err on the side of too little and add as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;P-)</li>
            <li> Either they are too heavy, my curls frizz, etc.</li>
            <li> this frizz product heavy and greasy?  </li>
            <li> It has a scent that is too heavy and lingers all day.  </li>
            <li> i used this argan oil on my hair that hadn&#x27;t been washed in a few days.</li>
            <li> There is no strong scent, another bonus for scent-sensitive me.  </li>
            <li> And I tried it two different ways, according to the serum&#x27;s instructions: (1) on dry hair and (2) on wet hair.</li>
            <li> It contains some perfume, but thankfully not an excessive amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this would affect people with finer, limper hair, but my guess is that it&#x27;d weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came out in fairly big drops and it seemed that the application mechanism was rather flawed.</li>
            <li> Consider the small bottle of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I bought a small (I mean really, really small) bottle two years ago ...</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I was going to go bald, but using these three products over the past 13 months has helped my hair to fill back in.</li>
            <li> I hardly recommend this product, the smell and the way your hair feels.</li>
            <li> thick hair this amounts to 2-3 pumps).</li>
            <li> This is based upon my wife&#x27;s comments and my observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through trial and error, my wife started with a very small amount of the oil and applied it to the ends of her hair and worked it in and up the length of the hair.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to control the amount of gel with the pump.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was born with this wavy, curly, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This did nothing but add unpleasant &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; to my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product, I like the more expensive brand I have been using a little better. But this is so much more affordable. Consider to change to this to save some $$</li>
            <li> Helps hair to be smooth and sleek even on high humidity days</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair but luckily most products keep my hair from going wildly frizzy. This did nothing but add unpleasant &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; to my hair</li>
            <li> I have used this with Pantene shampoo and conditioner and it has significantly reduced the amount of my hair loss.  I was afraid that I was going to go bald, but using these three products over the past 13 months has helped my hair to fill back in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, I have baby fine and very curly hair, I have a real difficult time finding hair products that work for me. Either they are too heavy, my curls frizz, etc., but this is very light but at the same time  very moisturizing and smoothing.  Just loving this.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in great conditions, on time and perfectly well wrapped. I hardly recommend this product, the smell and the way your hair feels. I think I would buy again to this person.</li>
            <li> I do love it, it&#x27;s really good for my hair. Shiny. Really does wonders on my fuzzy, thin hair. Super</li>
            <li> When used in tandem with the Pantene Pro-V Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner, my hair looks, feels and acts like it&#x27;s been pampered at a high-class salon.</li>
            <li> The Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum With Argan Oil joins the seemingly endless frizz eliminating products that the John Frieda original Frizz-Ease product seemed to spawn.  I&#x27;m guessing many folks have tried some of these and, truthfully, found many to be similar.  That probably stems from most formulations being silicone based.  I&#x27;ve tried several and the only difference, besides great price variations, is some can tend toward greasy while others noticeably lighter.  In keeping with differentiating products further some manufacturers are adding oils and such.  This Pantene product does just that in adding the hair care &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; additive of Argan Oil.  That naturally brings up the question is this frizz product heavy and greasy?  I have to say no as it seems to be balanced well.  Since folks tend to use these things in several ways I&#x27;ll say I wanted something that would allow me to blow dry my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t tend to curl.  When applied to wet hair in moderate amounts (no reason to use this heavily I can think of) it helps prevent heat damage from the blow dryer keeping hair frizz free, and, in my case, helps to curb unwanted curling.  With moderate to light use it&#x27;s effective and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling or looking greasy.  This product is quite good, affordable, and easy to find. So, while one can experiment with an endless variety of similar products, some expensive, it seems this one gets it right at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> I have hair down past the middle of my back and the ends sometimes get dry and fly away, especially in the summer. I was excited to trh the Pro-V Serum with Argan Oil via Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed it has a moderately strong fragrance. It wasn&#x27;t unpleasant to me, but is strong enough that someone nearby might notice. At my work, there is a person with chemical sensitivity, so this is a product I&#x27;d hesitate to wear if I was going to be working with her. The smell was definitely less noticeable when I put it on wet (damp) hair vs dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 2 pumps (plus a little) for my wet hair, then styled it. It definitely feels soft, silky, and was easier to comb than it is at other times. I thought it made it look a little shinier, but not too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dry hair, I couldn&#x27;t get it quite right. 1 pump wasn&#x27;t enough and 2 pumps made me feel like a greaser from the 50s. Chances are I&#x27;ll only be using it on my wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to argan oil, it also uses silicone. From the feel of the product, the silicone is the major ingredient. However, it&#x27;s a good price for the value.</li>
            <li> When used sparingly this product imparts smoothness and shine to wet or dry hair. It has a pleasant, fruity fragrance that does not overwhelm. Less is more when using this. Too much and your hair will look greasy. It is effective at taming the frizzies. As it contains silicone occasional use of a good clarifying is in order.  The product sprays easily without clogging. My hair is fine and color treated and this product works well. It is small enough to tuck in a bag or desk drawer insuring you have frizz free hair while on the go.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (well past my shoulders) which has a lot of natural curl - which ends up being frizzy a good part of the time.  With a small amount of this Smooth Serum which I applied to wet hair, my frizz was under control and I had a nice sheen to my hair.  I suggest using only a small amount of the product (one squirt) to begin with and then see if you needs more. Its nice to get a product that gives you a good value for the money and lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a noticeable scent, so if you are allergic to fragrance and/or don&#x27;t like to have a fragrance in your hair products, this may not be the hair product for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My daughter has hair like a Jamaican war witch, and this has tamed it down to smooth, glossy and wonderfully manageable. It doesn&#x27;t take much, either. She applies it wet, but you can do it dry as well, and it takes all the frizz out, and restores a healthy sheen. It used to take 25 minutes to brush and braid her hair, and this morning it took less than five. This is a miracle in a bottle. I&#x27;m eager to see what it does with old gray manes like mine. And the best part--it smells like warm vanilla.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, blonde &amp; looked frizzy on the ends. Not any more! I typically don&#x27;t have time to condition in the shower, so this serum is an amazing quick-fix for my mane. I apply it as directed to towel-dried hair. Makes it noticeably easier to get a comb through, too. Silky, smooth hair. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> This is based upon my wife&#x27;s comments and my observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through trial and error, my wife started with a very small amount of the oil and applied it to the ends of her hair and worked it in and up the length of the hair. She blow dries her hair Monday through Friday and has found that the oil helps to smooth the hair and imparts a light shine to it when applied sparingly (for her shoulder length, thick hair this amounts to 2-3 pumps). More than the optimal amount and the hair tends to look &#x27;greasy,&#x27; to use her word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I can appreciate the shine, looks like what you see in many of the TV commercials when they are trying to promote how health a product makes your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my wife likes the product, now that she knows just how much to use and how to apply it. Her recommendation is to err on the side of too little and add as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;P-)</li>
            <li> This is a good alternative (and much less expensive) than the Josie Maran Argan Oil I always use (and still have).  I would buy this for a friend as a gift; it&#x27;s that nice.</li>
            <li> I prefer spray on oils to keep my hair moisturized and Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and you can avoid getting your hands oily when applying it. It kept my hair glossy throughout the day and wasn&#x27;t greasy to touch.  Will definitely be purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum With Argan Oil  is way too strong smelling for me however I did like the results once I figured out the best way to use it for my long curly fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;It did take a bit of trial and error to figure out that for my hair it is best to use when wet and to just spritz a tiny bit onto my hand to use on the ends of my hair otherwise if when I  get too much on my hair it makes it feel just gunky.&lt;br /&gt;This leaves a nice shine and helps to keep my curls defined throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight product that applies easily and reduces frizz in my curly hair. It contains some perfume, but thankfully not an excessive amount. The container is portable and dispenses the product in neat pumps. Overall, a perfectly usable hair product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My wife has loved argan oil since she first tried them, but this one was not a hit. Normally, she likes how the oil works out the tangles in her long, Asian hair. She likes the smell of the pure argan oil, and has enjoyed most hair products infused with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pantene Pro-V, however, was a miss. She thought it smelled too overwhelming, too chemically, not the subtle spice scent of most argan oil products. She also says the oil doesn&#x27;t smooth out her hair the way most others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it myself as well, and I have to agree with her. The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant at all ... not on my hair, and not on hers. I have a feeling this is going to be hanging around in our bathroom as a full bottle for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil to make my hair more lustrous and shiny and less frizzy - living in a very humid climate, that&#x27;s important for me. I was disappointed in the strong perfume added to this product, however, as the chemicals used in synthetic perfumes can cause dizziness, headaches, and many more symptoms both to the wearer and those nearby.</li>
            <li> The one good thing I can say is that this product is not sticky.  The hold and frizz control are very light, but I need a medium hold for my curly hair.  It has a scent that is too heavy and lingers all day.  Even if I liked the scent, I do not want to smell my hair products all day.  Not buying this one.</li>
            <li> This product &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;, but it does so imperfectly, at least on dry hair. First, I should say that I have very long, wavy, thick hair that has good body, but low shine (due to my age - 50). That means I can tolerate fairly heavy product in it (such as oil) without my hair flattening out or looking wet or oily. I&#x27;m not sure how this would affect people with finer, limper hair, but my guess is that it&#x27;d weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied this, there were two issues. First, the spritzer didn&#x27;t apply it in a fine mist. It came out in fairly big drops and it seemed that the application mechanism was rather flawed. That meant it concentrated in certain areas rather than gave an even application. I applied it to dry hair and combed it through, but even then I had that look you get when you wet down your hair and there are some areas which look wet and clump together. Over time though, it evened out and produced smoother, shinier hair. I think vigorous brushing might have done it faster, but brushing actually frizzes hair more and kills curls so I usually only comb my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this is like a salon product. It isn&#x27;t too strong, but it is noticeable at first. It fades over time, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to such scents, that may be an issue. I was glad that it didn&#x27;t smell like perfume and that it did not linger overly long. However, after just applying it, or if someone is close to your head, it can be smelled and it smells like you just had your hair done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is effective for smoothing hair and seems to nourish it, but it&#x27;s a small bottle with a sprayer which needs to produce a better mist effect. The pump just doesn&#x27;t do the product justice.</li>
            <li> This worked well on straight, colored hair to smooth down some frizz. I used it when the hair was dry. There was no obvious shininess or weight. The product blended in seamlessly so you wouldn&#x27;t know there was additional product added to the hair. It&#x27;s not sticky or oily feeling in your hands. It gets absorbed quite readily the minute it hits your skin. This was a bit problematic for me as even after several times washing my hands, the product smell seemed sinked into my skin and it lingered more than I like. It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell. It&#x27;s a fairly clean, salon smell, but I still prefer no smell if I had a choice - at least from my hands when I think the product should be washed off. If you&#x27;re sensitive to carrying around the extra scent from your hands, you may want to consider using some cheap plastic gloves to apply the product.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is fine, I don&#x27;t use product very often.  This is better than mousse, because it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.  I need my hair to be shiny and smooth.  I&#x27;ve been recommended not to use oils.  This has a bit of argan oil.  But, when you figure I have dry ends, and it is recommended that you only put 2 sprays in your hand, with my long hair, putting the balance of the product between my hands, rubbing, and smoothing the product into my ends, this works out quite good.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for... I have thin hair strands that get frizzy especially in dry air or with static electricity.  I wanted a product in my hair that made it look natural.  Many hair gels and spays hold too firm and people can tell that you have a hair product in your hair.  This product allows your hair to lay naturally without getting frizzy.  Plus it adds a clean and shiny look to it.  My hair feels soft with this product in it, and I can easily run my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my short, male hair on my head, I am using 1 to 1.5 pumps.  Two pumps can be just a little too much for those who are complaining of a greasy look.  Even with two pumps, I don&#x27;t think it looks greasy.  Like I said, it looks natural.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and when I brush it it tends to want to stand on end due to the static electricity. I have a lot of static electricity in me. When I pet my cats I can feels little gaps under my hand and popping noises from the static electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a couple of pumps worth of this Pantene Pro Serum in my hair and I was amazed. I can brush my hair without the static wanting to make my hair stand on end, It left my hair feeling and looking soft and shiney, and the fragrance is nice too. The fragrance is not too strong, but if you have a sensitivity to fragrances, you may want to look for something else.</li>
            <li> The secret to using Pantene Pro-V Smooth Serum hair oil is to lightly spray it on the brush rather than directly onto the hair.  A little bit goes a long way.  It does a good job of adding shine and improving the feel of dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I like this serum better than some of the more expensive brands.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue on my hands, which is a bonus.  There is no strong scent, another bonus for scent-sensitive me.  It did tame most of my flyaway strands and gave my hairstyle a smoother appearance.  I use this mostly when I style my hair straight and it does help to hold that straightness throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I tried using it several times and every time it seemed to make my hair More frizzy. I have fine hair, that is medium-thick. When I used this my hair was similar to what it&#x27;s like when I don&#x27;t wash it, frizzy, oily, and unmanageable . I tried varying amounts of the product, and even using less seemed to create the same problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve no complaints.  Works for me</li>
            <li> Nice product. Makes the hair feel smoother.</li>
            <li> Makes my fine, damaged, fizzy hair nice and smooth. Use just ONE squirt otherwise you&#x27;ll look greasy. Works exactly as it should and actually makes my damaged hair look healthy! One bottle of the stuff will last you forever.</li>
            <li> One pump is definitely enough, I just use it on the ends of my hair, feels great!</li>
            <li> Excellent for my hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair. It gets super frizzy in the humidity. It&#x27;s a constant struggle for me to balance getting more body into my hair vs. more frizz. I was excited to try the Pantine Smooth Serum to see if it helped me look less like a mad scientist since I live near the beach and humidity is very common here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions tell you to pump a little gel on your hands, rub them together to warm it and spread it over your hands, then start with the ends of your hair and work your way up about halfway. It was a little difficult to control the amount of gel with the pump. Sometimes it would pump too much and I&#x27;d have to scrape it off my hands before using it. It&#x27;s definitely easier to apply the gel on wet hair than dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried two combinations: (1) my volume shampoo + volume conditioner + Pantene Smooth serum and (2) my volume shampoo alone + Pantene Smooth serum. And I tried it two different ways, according to the serum&#x27;s instructions: (1) on dry hair and (2) on wet hair. When I used even the tiniest bit of the product with my conditioner on wet hair it really weighed my hair down and made it look/feel greasy. Some people like that look, but I don&#x27;t because it makes me look like a wet labradoodle. When I used even less on my dry hair it only helped with the frizz a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: If you have fine + frizzy hair don&#x27;t use this product unless you like the greasy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got pretty thick and dark hair, generally pretty shiny by itself. Unfortunately I live in an area with pretty hard water, and even with the softener, it tends to leave hair a bit duller than normal. The Pantene serum worked well enough, adding an extra bit of shine, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it was super noticeable in a night-and-day difference. I&#x27;ve tried it both with wet and dry hair. It did control frizz by way of just weighing down the hair a bit with oil. The scent is something I&#x27;d consider uniquely Pantene. It&#x27;s a little floral, a little chemical - a generic &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent. I don&#x27;t mind it, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d seek out. I did not notice the greasy spots that some other reviewers have, but I made sure to mix it in my hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I was underwhelmed with this product.  I have curly and frizzy hair. I saw only a small improvement.  One thing I will say was that it did not leave an oily residue, which is nice compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I used this in tandem with Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo and Conditioner. Admittedly, it&#x27;s a bit of a tricky product. If you have used Moraccan Oil, you know what a light touch is required to achieve the desired results ...  ditto here. Therefore, use very, very little and then add more if you feel you need a touch more. We are talking about one or two drops rubbed into your hands and then start at the ends and move up. Do not use this near your roots since your natural oils serve this function (and you do not want your hair to look oily).    While the overall results were \\&quot;good,\\&quot; I do prefer the natural/organic ones (simply because they seem to do a slightly better job). Consider the small bottle of [[ASIN:B001RQOSBS Moroccanoil Hair Treatment (.85oz)]] (which is 100% argan oil). I bought a small (I mean really, really small) bottle two years ago ... I have barely put a dent in it! Something to think about ...</li>
            <li> Worked great in straight hair also has a nice smell to it that lingers a long time after you apply to your hair. My wife has kinky wavy hair and she said that it helped mold it into the shape that she wanted to. She also liked the smell but said that it took longer than usual with these products to wash out of her hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her only real complaint was that it came in such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> i used this argan oil on my hair that hadn&#x27;t been washed in a few days. I was very happy with it. It took away some frizz that had developed and helped it form back into some nice curls (it didn&#x27;t make the curls but helped bring out my natural curls). It made my hair nice and soft and not at all stiff.  I really liked the smell - it was light, but really nice and fresh. You use very little - too much and you&#x27;ll really get an oily look - but that is fine because it lasts longer. I was happy with the effect this had on my hair and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This Pantene product is essentially a gentle hair tonic that will quickly apply moisture to your strands giving your hair a healthy sheen, pleasant fragrance and dampens any issues with frizz. The base ingredient here is Moroccan Argan oil which easily nestles itself into your hair and provides a nice buttery finish that should last over the course of a day under normal conditions. There is a noticeable fragrance upon initial application - a bit on the sweet side like most commercial commercials but it will gently dissipate in a hour or so to a very subtle level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply other styling products over the serum if needed but personally I like the clean, moisturized look that the oil on it&#x27;s own provides.</li>
            <li> I thought this serum made my hair shine and smooth. It made my hair smell great! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Really good product! Smells good and your hair is smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> This product has really helped me with my frizzy hair! When the air goes humid outside, like today, I can actually feel my hair kinking up. It actually tightens up to form wavy hair. Unfortunately, I was born with this wavy, curly, and frizzy hair. Agh! And my desire is straight hair. Well, of course! We all want the opposite of what we have. This product actually works like a leave-in conditioner. You put the product in the balm of your hand, rub together, and then apply to hair. I even combed it through for a better application. It not only controlled my frizzies but gave my hair a beautiful shine! I love that!</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, wavy, color treated hair. I tried this three times--once dry, twice wet. Either way, it took more than one or two pumps, more like four. It has fragrance--not unpleasant, but strong and I prefer unscented products. It did add shine, but it didn&#x27;t really look better. Maybe it was the alcohol, but I thought it seemed a little harsh for my kind of hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it really keeps my hair healthy!</li>
