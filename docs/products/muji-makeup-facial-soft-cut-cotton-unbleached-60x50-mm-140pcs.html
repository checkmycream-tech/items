            <li>This stuff tastes amazing.</li>
            <li>Product looks nice, feels nice, maybe unbleached..</li>

            <li>Nice cotton.</li>
            <li>Very nice, clean cotton.</li>
            <li>first it seems great, has a great feel and is easy to cut into strips for wicking, and the outer layer comes off easily,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a taste and wicks better than cotton.</li>
            <li>Probably the best $.0x per pad ratio (about $.054 a pad, currently), especially if you have prime and factor in shipping costs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love them for this use, so glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>These are nothing like the others that I know are authentic muji.</li>
            <li>Love these cotton pads.</li>
            <li>Excellent for facial cleaning and wound care as well.</li>
            <li>All things considered, this is a great, natural product, and an amazing find for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to be using organic cotton.  </li>
            <li>more like ko jen</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so you better like them.</li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t need more for a while.</li>
            <li>Love these wipes.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff exactly what I wanted perfect fit vaping highly recommend</li>
            <li>Good fast delivery !</li>
            <li>girlfriend has been using them to remove her makeup, and she says these are great and very soft and absorbent</li>
            <li>My girlfriend also uses some on occasion for her facial toner, so they&#x27;re also good for that too!</li>
            <li>The easy to cut squares are icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I have no idea where to put this huge bag</li>
            <li>No, I did not receive these as a free sample nor receive any compensation for this review.</li>
            <li>The product has great reviews, am I the only one to notice this?</li>
            <li>Bought fit vape wick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very consistent and easy to work with, at a fraction of the price of ko jen do.  </li>
            <li>This is by far some of the best Japanese cotton I&#x27;ve used for vaping.</li>
            <li>fast delivery, love the cotton, using it for vaping.</li>
            <li>Will never order from this seller again until it can be verified that what I was sent is authentic muji which has always been super high quality cotton pads  </li>
            <li>This bag will last a long time, and at a great price!</li>
            <li>Awesome Product so much better than paying for the small portions at the local brick and mortar.</li>
            <li>This seller is very responsive, friendly, polite, and quick.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s good vaping cotton</li>
            <li>Works just right for my needs.</li>
            <li>Could be faster on delivery times other than that pretty good</li>
            <li>Looks good, but has some black spots on it.</li>
            <li>Most brands of cotton balls are also very poorly combed and vary greatly in width and/or density.</li>
            <li>These pads are very thick and cushy.</li>
            <li>No weird tastes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>More than likely, much more since the cotton is so thick, you would more realistically get 8 coils worth out of a pad instead of 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is so much of it too!</li>
            <li>Quantity for this price is stellar.</li>
            <li>First of all, they&#x27;re cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Second, there&#x27;s more cotton squares than the shiseido package.  </li>
            <li>Third, and most enticing</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase alot more from this seller for the price and quality of the cotton.</li>
            <li>Well be getting some more in the future.</li>
            <li>One of the better organic japanese cottons I have tried for vape wicking.</li>
            <li>one square last me for 4+ coils and this comes with soo many i wont have to buy any more for a long time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Free shipping to prime members, as an add-on item.&lt;br /&gt;- Authentic organic Japanese cotton (you can even see specs of the seeds in the cotton and Japanese writing on the package, see images).&lt;br /&gt;- Ridiculously large amount.</li>
            <li>This cotton is super soft.</li>
            <li>Additionally there is a large sticker on one side of package noting a suffocation warning for the package as per pictures.</li>
            <li>but that said, the Muji Japanese cotton is more obsorbant and makes a little better wick.</li>
            <li>GF uses them for make-up removal, says they are a huge improvement from regular cotton balls/pads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>these are just like the ones that came with my kanger sub tank mini and are sooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li>works just as well as shiseido but much thicker per square.</li>
            <li>I build coils every few days and change out my cotton every day so having a surplus like this is really handy.</li>
            <li>This is the same stuff that comes with the new Kanger Sub Tank and the vape is smooth and</li>
            <li>Because of the price, it will only encourage you to build more setups because you have extra materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, I will buy them again and highly recommend them to all fellow coil builders.</li>
            <li>The price is a bet to high</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, but price is little high.</li>
            <li>Was surprised at how much came in the bag.</li>
            <li>Buy some kanthal and some other stuff with it to nab the free shipping.</li>
            <li>I tried changing this cotton over 5 times with a new piece and every-time.</li>
            <li>Very soft to the face.</li>
            <li>English labeling and text on the back or something would be helpful, I&#x27;m sure it would demystify the claims of the amazon listing vs the actual manufacture claims, but they all seem to be legit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be awhile, but I would definitely buy more, and recommend it to other vapers.</li>
            <li>They are softer than traditional cotton balls, organic and unbleached, and much easier on my skin.</li>
            <li>It does have some chaff flakes in the natural cotton as it&#x27;s not bleached out.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for soft touch on face, this is not the one.  </li>
            <li>It is an off-white color and there was no weird taste upon the first few pulls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>About the size of a ziplock freezer bag full of roughly 2&amp;#34; x 2 1/2&amp;#34; sized squares, 1/4&amp;#34; thick.&lt;br /&gt;- Super fluffy and absorbent.</li>
            <li>Huge amount of cotton pads, Ive been using this for my vaping needs for about a little over a month and have barely made a dent in the stacks.</li>
            <li>Fantastic value especially compared to pricing for much less quantity of Koh Gen Do.</li>
            <li>This pack will hold you over for a long time, even for avid daily vapers.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s organic and unbleached, the product has a natural off white colour and some brown flecks.  </li>
            <li>They are very absorbent and sturdy when wet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I am certain this product is bleached, or processed with some other chemical.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;- Free shipping to prime members, as an add-on item.&lt;br /&gt;- Authentic organic Japanese cotton (you can even see specs of the seeds in the cotton and Japanese writing on the package, see images).&lt;br /&gt;- Ridiculously large amount.</li>
            <li> This cotton is super soft.</li>
            <li> Additionally there is a large sticker on one side of package noting a suffocation warning for the package as per pictures.</li>
            <li> but that said, the Muji Japanese cotton is more obsorbant and makes a little better wick.</li>
            <li> GF uses them for make-up removal, says they are a huge improvement from regular cotton balls/pads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> these are just like the ones that came with my kanger sub tank mini and are sooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li> works just as well as shiseido but much thicker per square.</li>
            <li> I build coils every few days and change out my cotton every day so having a surplus like this is really handy.</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff that comes with the new Kanger Sub Tank and the vape is smooth and</li>
            <li> Because of the price, it will only encourage you to build more setups because you have extra materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, I will buy them again and highly recommend them to all fellow coil builders.</li>
            <li> The price is a bet to high</li>
            <li> i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, but price is little high.</li>
            <li> Was surprised at how much came in the bag.</li>
            <li> Buy some kanthal and some other stuff with it to nab the free shipping.</li>
            <li> I tried changing this cotton over 5 times with a new piece and every-time.</li>
            <li> Very soft to the face.</li>
            <li> English labeling and text on the back or something would be helpful, I&#x27;m sure it would demystify the claims of the amazon listing vs the actual manufacture claims, but they all seem to be legit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be awhile, but I would definitely buy more, and recommend it to other vapers.</li>
            <li> They are softer than traditional cotton balls, organic and unbleached, and much easier on my skin.</li>
            <li> It does have some chaff flakes in the natural cotton as it&#x27;s not bleached out.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for soft touch on face, this is not the one.  </li>
            <li> It is an off-white color and there was no weird taste upon the first few pulls.&lt;br</li>
            <li> About the size of a ziplock freezer bag full of roughly 2&amp;#34; x 2 1/2&amp;#34; sized squares, 1/4&amp;#34; thick.&lt;br /&gt;- Super fluffy and absorbent.</li>
            <li> Huge amount of cotton pads, Ive been using this for my vaping needs for about a little over a month and have barely made a dent in the stacks.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value especially compared to pricing for much less quantity of Koh Gen Do.</li>
            <li> This pack will hold you over for a long time, even for avid daily vapers.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s organic and unbleached, the product has a natural off white colour and some brown flecks.  </li>
            <li> They are very absorbent and sturdy when wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am certain this product is bleached, or processed with some other chemical.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time Shiseido facial cotton user.  </li>
            <li> at first i though they where too soft as they would come apart when i pulled them through the coil but after taking a square and folding in four then un folding them and cutting and doing the normal</li>
            <li> first I thought I was going crazy with the bleach smell ( but after the 6th time, in different devices with different juices, I am certain now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are slightly less soft than Shiseido, however, it&#x27;s negligible.</li>
            <li> they go a long way</li>
            <li> I tried other organic cotton balls but they were still bleached and processed to be white.</li>
            <li> Both supposedly muji only difference was other</li>
            <li> so half the amount takes up same space as sheseido ones.</li>
            <li> I can see rough texture woody pieces within the cotton pads.</li>
            <li> They are fantastically plush and wide.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, i get a definite bleach smell and taste from my devices that I never had when I used sterile cotton balls from US</li>
            <li> It is thick enough that i can also use the back size.</li>
            <li> These shed like crazy, but the cotton is pretty soft... other than the black specks of sediment that is interwoven into the layers.</li>
            <li> I actually split one in half and use for morning, and the other half at night.</li>
            <li> It is very rough for face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny in my book (especially if you&#x27;ve ever been scratched by one of those awful pads, it had issues with lint).</li>
            <li> a lot of dark spots on the cotton, looks gross！！！i</li>
            <li> Dark colored pads are the ones I question authenticity</li>
            <li> but it ruins the flavor of my ejuice.</li>
            <li> That means even if you re-wicked dual coils twice a day you&#x27;d get nearly half a year of vaping from one package.</li>
            <li> You can even split them in half and use them just as well.</li>
            <li> These squares are slightly thicker as well, which I like.</li>
            <li> but does cost less.</li>
            <li> If you rub these against your nails or your face, then they shred away and leave fluffy bits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other unbleached cottons for my ejuice, but this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave a weird aftertaste.</li>
            <li> there are lot of dark spots on the cotton, and I cannot return it!!</li>
            <li> I wanted an alternative to the bleached cotton balls I&#x27;ve been buying in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the cotton rounds that are sort of sewn around the edges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This takes at least 3-5 days depending on use to happen for me.  </li>
            <li> These are quite thick and hold up well to applying toner and removing makeup.</li>
            <li> Cutting along the 6cm length provides me 6 long dual coil RDA wicks or halved for 12 RBA wicks.</li>
            <li> NOT good for face use.</li>
            <li> These have the small spects of black within the cotton pads and they break up terribly upon swiping a couple times on face with standard toner.</li>
            <li> That made coil builds inconsistent and caused poor wick flow.</li>
            <li> ONLY VAPOR crap</li>
            <li> The package seal was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get nasty dry hits like you would with other cottons!</li>
            <li> Not ideal.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong when this is paired with prime.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for vaping, specifically in drippers ( sub ohm but nothing crazy, between 1 and 0.5 Ohms ).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad it is not allowed to return.  </li>
            <li> Very bad experience.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> its fake!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product looks nice, feels nice, maybe unbleached.. But it tastes like ass if you use it for vaping. I tried changing this cotton over 5 times with a new piece and every-time. Cannot taste the flavor of my juice.</li>
            <li> Great deal, Use this for Vaping. Perfect for wicking, and cheap on the cost. Building your own coils saves you allot of money and also helps quite smoking cigarettes.</li>
            <li> Bought for rewicking my rebuildables wicks awesome! Great alternative to Kogindo or whatever it&#x27;s called.</li>
            <li> Great product very absorbent! Great addition to my vaping supplies. Will sure buy again, LOL if I ever run out of them!</li>
            <li> Works Great for wicking in ecigs!</li>
            <li> Great stuff to use as wicking in RDA or RTA atomizers</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Doesn&#x27;t have a taste and wicks better than cotton. Can&#x27;t go wrong when this is paired with prime.</li>
            <li> From a vaper&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Free shipping to prime members, as an add-on item.&lt;br /&gt;- Authentic organic Japanese cotton (you can even see specs of the seeds in the cotton and Japanese writing on the package, see images).&lt;br /&gt;- Ridiculously large amount. About the size of a ziplock freezer bag full of roughly 2&amp;#34; x 2 1/2&amp;#34; sized squares, 1/4&amp;#34; thick.&lt;br /&gt;- Super fluffy and absorbent. Wicked flawlessly. No weird tastes.&lt;br /&gt;- Probably the best $.0x per pad ratio (about $.054 a pad, currently), especially if you have prime and factor in shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not actually ship from Japan, or China. It&#x27;s a prime add-on item, so it is probably imported to Canada or the US. Got to me in 2 days with prime.&lt;br /&gt;- Unbleached. It is an off-white color and there was no weird taste upon the first few pulls.&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s 140 pads. That means even if you re-wicked dual coils twice a day you&#x27;d get nearly half a year of vaping from one package. More than likely, much more since the cotton is so thick, you would more realistically get 8 coils worth out of a pad instead of 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you have prime, but are only ordering this (or if you don&#x27;t have prime at all) you will pay some shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;- English labeling and text on the back or something would be helpful, I&#x27;m sure it would demystify the claims of the amazon listing vs the actual manufacture claims, but they all seem to be legit anyway.&lt;br /&gt;- I have no idea where to put this huge bag now.&lt;br /&gt;- Because of the price, it will only encourage you to build more setups because you have extra materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further for your cotton folks. This pack will hold you over for a long time, even for avid daily vapers. Buy some kanthal and some other stuff with it to nab the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Awesome wick material for my atomizers</li>
            <li> Love these cotton pads! I wanted an alternative to the bleached cotton balls I&#x27;ve been buying in the past. These are quite thick and hold up well to applying toner and removing makeup. You can even split them in half and use them just as well.</li>
            <li> I tried other organic cotton balls but they were still bleached and processed to be white. The resulting aftertaste took hours to dissipate from any RDA or RBA build just like standard non-organic cotton. Most brands of cotton balls are also very poorly combed and vary greatly in width and/or density. That made coil builds inconsistent and caused poor wick flow. An Amazon search for unbleached cotton and favorable reviews lead to a purchase of these Muji unbleached 5cm x 6cm Japanese cotton pads. What a difference! The Muji unbleached cotton simply does not taint the flavor in RBA/RDA builds from the word &amp;#34;Go!&amp;#34;. The Muji cotton pads also have meticulously combed fibers that wick like a dream. The easy to cut squares are icing on the cake. Cutting along the 6cm length provides me 6 long dual coil RDA wicks or halved for 12 RBA wicks. No, I did not receive these as a free sample nor receive any compensation for this review. Yes, I will buy them again and highly recommend them to all fellow coil builders.</li>
            <li> Huge amount of cotton pads, Ive been using this for my vaping needs for about a little over a month and have barely made a dent in the stacks. I build coils every few days and change out my cotton every day so having a surplus like this is really handy. would definitely recommend this to a fellow vaper. My girlfriend also uses some on occasion for her facial toner, so they&#x27;re also good for that too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for applying the toner and removing the makeup.</li>
            <li> Very nice, clean cotton. Great price!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff exactly what I wanted perfect fit vaping highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is great cotton for vaping! There is so much of it too! You don&#x27;t get nasty dry hits like you would with other cottons! More healthy than the bleached stuff as well! This cotton is great for taste as well, burn a puffs to break it in and its good to go!</li>
            <li> No break-in time for wicking. Tastes great immediately after dripping. Dump your cotton balls and buy these immediately.</li>
            <li> I use these for removing eye makeup in conjunction with micellar water. They are softer than traditional cotton balls, organic and unbleached, and much easier on my skin. Love them for this use, so glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> This cotton is super soft. Using it for vaping as a wick. It does have some chaff flakes in the natural cotton as it&#x27;s not bleached out.</li>
            <li> PERFECT for vaping. This is the same stuff that comes with the new Kanger Sub Tank and the vape is smooth and flavorful.&lt;br /&gt;Very inexpensive compared to buying it locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend has been using them to remove her makeup, and she says these are great and very soft and absorbent&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I will have to buy some just for her!</li>
            <li> Awesome wicking material for vaping! This bag will last a long time, and at a great price! It&#x27;ll be awhile, but I would definitely buy more, and recommend it to other vapers.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality. Create the perfect wick.Quantity for this price is stellar.</li>
            <li> If you order this from VALUES JAPAN it will take forever. Other than that it&#x27;s good vaping cotton</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It is very rough for face. It makes my eye lids feel hurt. It should be for nail use. I can see rough texture woody pieces within the cotton pads. Too bad it is not allowed to return.  If you are looking for soft touch on face, this is not the one.  I will stay with Shiseido cotton pad.</li>
            <li> a lot of dark spots on the cotton, looks gross！！！i can&#x27;t use it and Just found I cannot return it because it doesn&#x27;t accept return!!!&lt;br /&gt;just threw it away...</li>
            <li> This is by far some of the best Japanese cotton I&#x27;ve used for vaping. 100% on point.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes amazing. I use it for vaping.</li>
            <li> Always use this cotton for my atomizers!</li>
            <li> Great for vaping cotton.</li>
            <li> I inadvertently posted another sellers review initially regarding their muji for this one. Both supposedly muji only difference was other 65x50. These are nothing like the others that I know are authentic muji. These have the small spects of black within the cotton pads and they break up terribly upon swiping a couple times on face with standard toner. In no way does the package even say muji except for a sticker placed I am assuming by the seller. Additionally there is a large sticker on one side of package noting a suffocation warning for the package as per pictures. Will never order from this seller again until it can be verified that what I was sent is authentic muji which has always been super high quality cotton pads  Dark colored pads are the ones I question authenticity</li>
            <li> A boat load of cotton! If I ever run out, it&#x27;s my own fault. I use it for wicking my RDAs (vaping) and it&#x27;s great for that. I&#x27;ve used other unbleached cottons for my ejuice, but this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave a weird aftertaste.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, but price is little high.</li>
            <li> This is the best wicking material I have come across in my years of vaping.</li>
            <li> Used these for wicks in 1.5 ohm kanthal 28 coils. Work and taste great!</li>
            <li> Love these cotton pads. I use them for makeup removal, toner application, and nail care. They are a great quality and hold up even when split in two layers.</li>
            <li> Best for RTA&#x27;s no funky taste and thicker than Koh Gen Do</li>
            <li> its fake!!!!! there are lot of dark spots on the cotton, and I cannot return it!! I just threw it away....</li>
            <li> Could be faster on delivery times other than that pretty good</li>
            <li> Looks good, but has some black spots on it.</li>
            <li> wicks ejuice soooooo good.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product so much better than paying for the small portions at the local brick and mortar.</li>
            <li> These pads make the best vape wicks.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Works just right for my needs.</li>
            <li> Very soft to the face. I use it to remove makeup. It is thick enough that i can also use the back size.</li>
            <li> Great price for vape wicks, should be almost a lifetime supply!</li>
            <li> Using it for wicking, wicks great, vapes great (no weird taste). Fantastic value especially compared to pricing for much less quantity of Koh Gen Do. Excellent for facial cleaning and wound care as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent wicking on all my builds.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Shiseido facial cotton user.  When I came to Amazon a couple weeks ago looking to reorder my cotton and stumbled upon these.  First of all, they&#x27;re cheaper.  Second, there&#x27;s more cotton squares than the shiseido package.  Third, and most enticing, they&#x27;re organic (something the others are not).  I had to give them a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did! They are slightly less soft than Shiseido, however, it&#x27;s negligible. These squares are slightly thicker as well, which I like. Once you use Japanese facial cotton, no American cotton pads will do.  It&#x27;s more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny in my book (especially if you&#x27;ve ever been scratched by one of those awful pads, it had issues with lint). All things considered, this is a great, natural product, and an amazing find for me.  I&#x27;m glad to be using organic cotton.  Because it&#x27;s organic and unbleached, the product has a natural off white colour and some brown flecks.  This isn&#x27;t a defect.</li>
            <li> using as vaping wick.  works well.  it&#x27;s very consistent and easy to work with, at a fraction of the price of ko jen do.  more like ko jen don&#x27;t.  :)</li>
            <li> Great....I use it for Vaporing</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T RETURN IT!!! so you better like them. NOT good for face use. ONLY VAPOR crap</li>
            <li> The Best Cotton to use for wicking. This seller is very responsive, friendly, polite, and quick. Will definitely purchase alot more from this seller for the price and quality of the cotton.</li>
            <li> Great product. Excellent for vaping. Was surprised at how much came in the bag. Shouldn&#x27;t need more for a while.</li>
            <li> its good for vaping but it ruins the flavor of my ejuice. i even tried boiling it but it doesnt work well to bring back taste</li>
            <li> Nice cotton. Great for wicking. :)</li>
            <li> The price is a bet to high i think. You can get unbleached organic cotton balls at walgreens for about 3 bucks and works well rebuilding your RBA but that said, the Muji Japanese cotton is more obsorbant and makes a little better wick. Good fast delivery !</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as facial wipes for micellar water. Not using it for smoking devices (what does it do??) These pads are very thick and cushy. I actually split one in half and use for morning, and the other half at night. They are very absorbent and sturdy when wet. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These shed like crazy, but the cotton is pretty soft... other than the black specks of sediment that is interwoven into the layers. If you wanted to peel them apart, you can really only get two fuzzy layers. If you rub these against your nails or your face, then they shred away and leave fluffy bits. Not ideal. I usually buy the cotton rounds that are sort of sewn around the edges. I will go back to those next time.</li>
            <li> work good for rba coils. at first i though they where too soft as they would come apart when i pulled them through the coil but after taking a square and folding in four then un folding them and cutting and doing the normal they stopped falling apart and are working great! the taste is great. these are just like the ones that came with my kanger sub tank mini and are sooo much cheaper. one square last me for 4+ coils and this comes with soo many i wont have to buy any more for a long time! i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Purchased to use as wicking material for my RBAs. They are fantastically plush and wide. GF uses them for make-up removal, says they are a huge improvement from regular cotton balls/pads.</li>
            <li> Great cotton and at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Awsome product, it came when they said it would.</li>
            <li> The package seal was broken when I received it. Very bad experience.</li>
            <li> Love these wipes. they don&#x27;t absorb the product and leave enough to apply on your skin. Its good while wiping away face masks and cleansing creams. they go a long way</li>
            <li> I purchased this for vaping, specifically in drippers ( sub ohm but nothing crazy, between 1 and 0.5 Ohms ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it seems great, has a great feel and is easy to cut into strips for wicking, and the outer layer comes off easily,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am certain this product is bleached, or processed with some other chemical.  After a few days of use, i get a definite bleach smell and taste from my devices that I never had when I used sterile cotton balls from US pharmacies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought I was going crazy with the bleach smell ( but after the 6th time, in different devices with different juices, I am certain now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This takes at least 3-5 days depending on use to happen for me.  The product has great reviews, am I the only one to notice this?</li>
            <li> Bought fit vape wick. Easy to work with. Does have end sheets that need to be removed. Best deal I&#x27;ve found on Amazon. Great flavor, and wicks perfect. Will order again</li>
            <li> Use for vaping works perfect and shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> Man this is a lot of cotton!! This will keep me hooked up for a while!! And it&#x27;s great too!!!</li>
            <li> When I recieved this item I just know what does &amp;#34;unbleached&amp;#34; means.</li>
            <li> Super good for makeup removal</li>
            <li> fast delivery, love the cotton, using it for vaping. So good with wicking the juice. Awesome deal, couldn&#x27;t be any happier!!! Well be getting some more in the future.</li>
            <li> works just as well as shiseido but much thicker per square. so half the amount takes up same space as sheseido ones. but does cost less. if space is a concern, such as packing toiletries for a trip, then i wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> One of the better organic japanese cottons I have tried for vape wicking. I have this muji and a bag of the Labo. They are both excellent but the muji seems to wick a bit faster.</li>
            <li> Good price and quick shipping</li>
    </ol>
