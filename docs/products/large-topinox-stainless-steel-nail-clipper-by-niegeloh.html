            <li>These clippers remedied that problem, these sharp clippers are excellent for nails on both the hands and feet and feel like they actually cut the nail.  </li>
            <li>My old Trim-brand clippers require a noticeably greater amount of pressure to clip nails, with every clipping producing a very pronounced &#x27;click!&#x27;</li>

            <li> I purchased this nail clipper for a friend in a nursing home who needed a large toenail clipper.  He has been having trouble cutting his  thick toenails.  Your description as &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; was very misleading.  Even though the picture did not look large I took a chance. The clippers are very small and curved like fingernail clippers.  My friend tried them but he could not handle them because they were too small and did not cut his toenails.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª</li>
            <li> excellent materials and outstaying performance super sharp and gets the work done quickly and efficently</li>
            <li> German engineering...need I say more?  The clipper clips effortlessly, clean, and precise.  Perhaps they could have included a small file too but I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars!  Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained that this clipper is small. I ordered one only to find that I was sent a small, not a large. After reordering from a different vendor, I did, finally, get the large. If your clipper is less than three inches, it is not the large.&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of this clipper, it is top-notch. It is extremely sharp, and the cutting action is almost effortless. My old Trim-brand clippers require a noticeably greater amount of pressure to clip nails, with every clipping producing a very pronounced &#x27;click!&#x27; as the nail is cut away.&lt;br /&gt;Not so with the TopInox clippers. I can&#x27;t say that they are silent, but they are comparitively quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with these clippers.</li>
            <li> This is not a large clipper at all!! Not sure why they put this as a large when it&#x27;s not even a medium size. If you are an adult you don&#x27;t want to buy it in this size. Basically, you won&#x27;t be able to cut your nails. Regarding the quality of the product I can tell you it&#x27;s a great product but needs to be in the right size for an adult (even a small adult hand).&lt;br /&gt;Don\\&quot;t loose your time because I lost mine but I got it.</li>
            <li> Much better than others I&#x27;ve had (very Strong)</li>
            <li> I watched them build these by the thousands on How It&#x27;s Made and had to have the smaller one‚Ä¶only $9 or so.&lt;br /&gt;Then I wanted a larger one for ease‚Ä¶and boom‚Ä¶$46.&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s a beautiful piece of steel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and as a guy I&#x27;m not too terribly interested in &#x27;premium&#x27; beauty products.  That said, I&#x27;ve had problems in the past w/ poor quality clippers that just seem to crush the nail and tear it off, rather than &#x27;clip&#x27; it.  These clippers remedied that problem, these sharp clippers are excellent for nails on both the hands and feet and feel like they actually cut the nail.  I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are quality stainless steel toe nail clippers. They are large and will not rust and cause stains if left in a humid environment like a bathroom or shower. Much better than the cheap chrome clippers that are available at local drug stores.</li>
            <li> I wanted and ordered the Large TopInox Stainless Steel Nail Clipper #30828 by Niegeloh and what was sent was the small item #30818. What can you do? I went to Niegeloh&#x27;s web page and compared the product numbers any you definitely sent me the small ones.</li>
            <li> WOW - excellent! Can even cut through thick, strong nails easily!!! I received the large Topinox Clipper as described (was a bit concerned after reading some people received smaller size instead). Even though the package says &amp;#34;toe nail clippers&amp;#34; I bought it for an older relative who has large hands &amp; big thick fingernails. He couldn&#x27;t use regular scissors to cut his fingernails, tried various other store-bought toenail clippers which were not strong enough to safely/easily cut through his nails, and I felt the scissor like nippers were too dangerous unless someone had a very steady hand - which he does not. (He goes to podiatrist for his toenails!) Went through loads of reviews for various clippers and ordered these (plus 1 other which I am promptly returning). These Topinox clippers rock! They have a large opening to fit larger/thicker nails (unlike Seki Edge toenail clippers for example, which are great for thinner nails like mine). The Topinox is super precise/easy cutting - and so easy to operate. He is SO happy to be able to safely take care of his own fingernails (and so am I!)</li>
            <li> The cutting edges were not sharp enough to cut my hard toe nails. I thought that I would get a much improved product from those I can buy elsewhere. I am disappointed because the brand was a subject of a piece of &amp;#34;How do they make it&amp;#34; in one of the educational channels. The product is made in Germany at, apparently, by one of the best companies in the field. Consequently, I was willing to pay the premium price, when compared with those available elsewhere. Also, the package was extremely difficult to open. Only way to open was cutting the plastic encasement. This makes it impossible to return.  Also, there was nothing included in the UPS package, only the two clippers I bought.</li>
            <li> Quality construction.  I would recommend these nail clippers to everyone.  After years of tearing my nails with cheap clippers - these are precise, sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very well made product.</li>
            <li> Works great best price very happy</li>
            <li> german made quality stainless steel</li>
            <li> LOVE them. They are the perfect size for me. Bit bigger than normal fingernail clippers and a bit smaller that normal toenail. So they work great for both. They are super sharp and accurate. So worth the 30 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There could be better descriptions here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a tool nut. I love precision tools -- especially German tools. This nail clipper is indeed a German precision tool.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like? Precision cutting. Stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my wife -- who objected to the cost, until she used it once. Then she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Comment: I have many high-priced stainless steel  tools, Bosch or Snap-On, that I still have and have had since before most of you were born.)</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I have owned in my 43 years. I do have to admit the 1st time I bought they sent the wrong size (small version) but this time they were the 3.1 inch ones and they cut great!!! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pricy but high quality</li>
            <li> Great clippers, much better than drugstore varieties.  A little expensive, but worth it.  It is always good to have a few luxuries.</li>
            <li> High quality clippers. Very sharp.  Very pricey compared to regular chrome style clippers.  Only time will tell if they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> To me it was worth every cent I paid for these as I have had issues with having to use inferior clippers and then dealt with ingrown nails as a result.&lt;br /&gt;Paying for the best stainless steel really amkes a difference.</li>
            <li> The search continues. I had hopes of German steel. These are really Not Big Enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps toenails are getting thicker. I clip a relative&#x27;s, and these won&#x27;t do the.job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, they make a nice, but expensive, tool for fingernails.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s a large, i wonder what a small one looks like.  it measures about 6 centimeters long and 11/2 wide.  i would have preferred it a little bigger, length and width.  it cuts well, but a bit unwieldy to use due to its size.</li>
