            <li>This is my first time wearing a closure, but I am very familiar with how a proper one is meant to look.</li>

            <li>Too thick to part any of the 3ways you are suppose to be able to.</li>
            <li>Granted I live in the rural area.</li>
            <li>Half the hair at the top was so short it couldn lay down flat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, soft and no weird smells or anything.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The closure has way TOO many short hairs. Even though it&#x27;s free parting it&#x27;s way to hard to part hair without the shorter hairs sticking up. I used a light mouse and sat under the dryer and still had short hairs sticking up. Never buying again.poor quality.</li>
            <li> Took longer than I expected to get used to my closure. I guess at no fault to the vendor, except that they claimed it was a 1b but was a shade darker than my bundles ordered from them. It&#x27;s not as realistic as I would have hoped. You can see the lace and the knots. I bleached sooo many times..There are so many fly aways that got annoying! But overall it did its job! I ordered again cause I know I made some mistakes with this installation and I repost on how well the second closure did. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This closure does have little short hairs in it but I still found it valuable.&lt;br /&gt;I have changed the color twice. Took color well and minimum shedding.</li>
            <li> A great unit at an awesome price.  Fast shipping, nice texture, and very versatile.  I ordered a 10inch and it got the job done!</li>
            <li> Where to start . bad quality hair, its definitely not virgin. Half the hair at the top was so short it couldn lay down flat. Too thick to part any of the 3ways you are suppose to be able to. Very disappointed. The only reason it got one star is because it came on time.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this unit. Its everything I expected to order. This is truly a lace closer,  no wefts, can be parted anyway you please and the hair piece is surprisingly full. After cowashing the hair it became softer. For the price of the hair I&#x27;ll only purchase my  lace fronts from this vendor.</li>
            <li> This was a total disappointment, I was unable to style the hair at all.  It was frozen in one style.</li>
            <li> So Ordered This 6/8/14 &amp; Received It Today 6/10/13!!! It Got Here Super Fast.:-) It&#x27;s Very Thick, Smooth, &amp; No Smell. The Only Thing I Hate Is That It Came A Bit Lighter Than I Expected, But I&#x27;m Sure I Can Make It Work. I&#x27;ll Be Installing This In About A Week, After I&#x27;ll Be Giving Weekly Updates. For Now I&#x27;m Only Rating This A 4 Because I Haven&#x27;t Installed It Yet.</li>
            <li> The hair on the closure had good density, the knots bleached well and the hair took color well. Hair blended flawlessly with my Peruvian straight hair from a local vendor. The hair is definitely real virgin hair. the only complaint is the amount of fly aways. I could only imagine that they are there to give a more natural appearance however it&#x27;s entirely too many short pieces in the closure</li>
            <li> Good quality arrived as scheduled and the price is right,dont pay double at the beauty supply they dont get my money no more.</li>
            <li> I just received my closure and I&#x27;m so beyond surprised of the quality and everything. I&#x27;m about to get my first sew in and I was already nervous. But I can&#x27;t wait to get this closure installed !!! It&#x27;s thick, soft and no weird smells or anything. It&#x27;s gorgeous. Literally gorgeous. (:</li>
            <li> Good cheap closure nice and thick too it takes color and blends right in with my Brazilian hair def worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this on for a week now and I love it. It looks natural, blends great with my bundle hair. I&#x27;m planning on dyeing/ bleaching it. Let&#x27;s see how this works out</li>
            <li> Affordable closure. Can be parted anywhere. The hair is a good quality and can be color treated. My issue is there are a lot of short hairs in the unit about an inch long and makes the closure hard to blend.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this hair on the 22nd of February, I selected expedited shipping. It came to Atlanta Ga Usa on the 27th but they said my address was wrong which it wasn&#x27;t..long story short DHL messed me up with a bad address and I had to go meet the DHL deliverer cause he couldn&#x27;t find my address. Granted I live in the rural area. But this hair is great. I may bleach the knots to make it look more natural but I think it will last me for a while and I like it. It had a little lint in it but I am going to wash it anyway. Thanks to great customer service of Eayon I got my hair!</li>
            <li> Just installed it. So far so good. No shedding..very soft. I haven&#x27;t washed or dyed it so after I do that then I will update my review</li>
            <li> Really nice closure piece. No shedding... looks natural.</li>
            <li> ive seen people pay more than this at the store and doesn&#x27;t look hall as natural. It&#x27;s very similar to one I just bought for $100. It&#x27;s nice overall. No complaints</li>
            <li> This is beautiful. Full,thick, no smell. It mixed perfectly with my peruvian hair. Holds a curl. Bleached and dyed it. And it still soft and beautiful. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The hair is soo soft and of great quality. Please don&#x27;t ever change Eayon Hair.... Your hair is really great!</li>
            <li> The lace closure is great and the price is even better. This is my first time wearing a closure, but I am very familiar with how a proper one is meant to look. The hair was soft and healthy, and the lace was done very well. I have already installed and have had no issues thus far. Very good quality and I will be ordering again.</li>
