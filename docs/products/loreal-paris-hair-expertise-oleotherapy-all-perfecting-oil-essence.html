            <li>I found OleoTherapy to be a great addition to my hair routine, but it isn&#x27;t too strong on its own.  </li>
            <li>But the price is good and the oil can also make my hair smooth.</li>

            <li> I did not get what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It does bring out a lot of shine and brings the frizz factor down a small amount (but not nearly as much as I wanted).  </li>
            <li> so I am always looking for products to help tame frizz and volume.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> I bought a wrong oil when I smell it.</li>

            <li> After going through many other less expensive products it seems I&#x27;ve finally found something that leaves my hair feeling silky and allows my wave/curl to come though without friz.  And I like it&#x27;s fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it after shampooing to my towel dried/still damp hair.  I brush it through then finger toss my hair and let it dry. The results are soft silky curls that last without frizzing up over a few days.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife she loves it.  Works as advertised</li>
            <li> I love this hair serum I use it as a blowout oil or serum to protect my hair from heat, it&#x27;s thi and non greasy and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> Perfect to nourish damaged hair, especially those exposed to very cold weather</li>
            <li> Almost a dupe for Kerastase hair elixir. I love the Kerastase elixir just a smidge more, but for the price tag this will be my new go to. It is great at filling in and giving hair amazing shine. It absorbs really well and smells yummy. This comes in a glass bottle, which I love. Surprisingly my $60 bottle of Kerastase elixir came in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> Best Hair serum I have EVER used. And trust me...i&#x27;ve tried many ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> Good product!! My hears love this))</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair so I am always looking for products to help tame frizz and volume.  Especially when it starts getting humid outside.  I found OleoTherapy to be a great addition to my hair routine, but it isn&#x27;t too strong on its own.  It does bring out a lot of shine and brings the frizz factor down a small amount (but not nearly as much as I wanted).  I use this in conjunction with a clear gel frizz tamer and coconut milk cream for hair tips.  Still looking for better solutions though.</li>
            <li> I bought a wrong oil when I smell it. But the price is good and the oil can also make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is similar to the more expensive L&#x27;oreal Kerastasse. I absolutely love it. My hair is so smooth and not greasy. Their conditioner is great too--you use so little and it takes away tangles and leaves your hair shiny and NOT greasy. I am a loyal fan!</li>
            <li> Wife bought this first overseas and liked it, I was able to find here at AMAZON and purchased for her since hers was running low, she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I put it in my wet hair and then brush it w/ a Wet Brush every time I wash my hair. It makes having longer hair much easier to brush without breaking too many strands.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice so far, but I&#x27;m in love! I have fine but thick curly hair that tends to be dry and frizzy, but most moisturizing products are heavy and weigh my hair down. That was not the case with this oil. I put it on under my curl creme and gel and my hair is soft and frizz free but still curly...amazing!</li>
            <li> As a male here, this is my first time trying out this product , so im not sure how it will go, however i really like the mild smell of this product its not very strong but mild .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much improvement.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> My type of hair need oil, and though it infers there&lt;br /&gt;is oil I did not get what I expected.  It will probably&lt;br /&gt;work wonderful on a different type of hair.</li>
