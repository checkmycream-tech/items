            <li>All opinions are solely my own.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, I had looked everywhere for something that would help my dance and running shoes and this is the best ever.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant and it certainly did not &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have some Champion walking shoes that are very comfortable</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the the scent of this powder.</li>
            <li>I applied once more and now her shoes do not smell.  </li>
            <li>I tell you they smell fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li>I have already ordered more of this product so I never run out.  </li>
            <li>Once I started walking more for exercise, they got funky.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I gave it a try because the smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Ok, no miracle.</li>
            <li>Feet feel and smell better.  </li>
            <li>Shoes smell 60% better.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m so excited about foot powder!  </li>
            <li>She wore the shoes at school and when she came home it was smelly like her feet but not as strong.  </li>
            <li>It is so fine</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two weeks of use, my feet and shoes are odor free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and smells clean, not like medicine or a perfume.</li>
            <li>They were very supportive,  encouraged me to continue using the product and sent me more product so that I could continue to use it daily until I  achieved a cure.</li>
            <li>The powder has a really nice natural fragrance and is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Day two, full day.</li>
            <li>The first month they were fine.  </li>
            <li>We used it on the kids feet and sneakers, and they both actually smell pleasant for the first time.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best product I have tried and have already recommended it to other dancers.</li>
            <li>It is effective, soothing to my feet while in the shoes, reduces the odor, and required just a small amount of powder to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Gets pretty smelly!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!</li>
            <li>However, the cost was worth it</li>
            <li>It keeps my shoes fresh and lengthens the time I can use them repeatedly between washes.  </li>
            <li>so I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>right side up, tap on the side, etc.  </li>
            <li>Took very little to be effective, and it is safe for our pets.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with shoe/foot odors for a while and would just buy new shoes when it became overwhelming but now, with the aforementioned combination, I was able to almost eliminate the odors in my work shoes.  </li>
            <li>6 year old has some strong foot odor.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use very much powder, either.</li>
            <li>Which is good, because the bottle is a little on the smallish side.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much in my shoes that I now use it on all my hockey equipment (which Febreeze didn&#x27;t work nearly as well for) and even my garbage container when I don&#x27;t have the time to clean it properly.</li>
            <li>I washed the shoes first.  </li>
            <li>I leave enough powder to make sure it impacts  her feet and socks.  </li>
            <li>time just to make sure is not coming back soon</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference even after the first use.</li>
            <li>When it arrived the item was opened in a bag with powder everywhere; however, it seems to be working pretty well.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used this, I didn&#x27;t think it worked.</li>
            <li>First product that I&#x27;ve ever tried that really works.</li>
            <li>but it certainly hasn&#x27;t eliminated my son&#x27;s foot smell...yet.</li>
            <li>I had a pair of leather shoes that I paid much too much money for that</li>
            <li>It really  works&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a lightening deal just to try on my husbands work shoes (and stinky feet when he takes them off) which have a very acid like smell, almost like cat pee.</li>
            <li>Better than any other foot odor product we have tried.</li>
            <li>This really is a terrific product and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>Works very well to naturally keep the stinkies away.</li>
            <li>I use these on my Vibram Five-finger shoes which can quickly become smelly in between washes if no action is taken to prevent odor.  </li>
            <li>Where I live it&#x27;s sandals all the time and humidity.  </li>
            <li>I also live in tennis shoes.</li>
            <li>I am very very surprised.  </li>
            <li>I was sceptical at first, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s  All natural!</li>
            <li>I left the powder in the shoe (I used a very generous amount</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>As a professional dancer I feel as though I have tried every product on the market.</li>
            <li>and I am pleasantly surprised as to</li>
            <li>This powder does it all - you can rub in on your feet or sprinkle it directly inside shoes.  </li>
            <li>My tennis shoes are almost a year old, and I walk 2 to 5 miles a day, per fitbit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor</li>
            <li>That has provided a temporary fix (about 24hr) and then right back to the same old smelly shoes.  </li>
            <li>The next morning my shoes are dry and fresh.  </li>
            <li>She also bathes every night and I dry her feet very well.  </li>
            <li>This powder keeps my feet dry, and no oder the whole day.</li>
            <li>I live in a hot climate and frequently wear my shoes without socks and this keeps them dry with absolutely no odor.  </li>
            <li>The cost was average to a little bit more than I like to pay.  </li>
            <li>I was going to buy a different foot odor remover that I&#x27;d tried before, but decided to give this one a try since it is natural and</li>

            <li> I want to see how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Especially since I told them that I  really felt that I was the issue, or at least my shoes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to work, but after 1-2 uses, the odor is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I apply a little to my shoes after I wear them and then pop in some &amp;#34;Mini Moso Natural Air Purifying Bags&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and I think the bottle of powder will go a long way.</li>
            <li> eliminating foot powder has been a staple for a long time.</li>
            <li> Basically, no smell at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> It took two powderings to reduce the odor down to the bare minimum of smell.  </li>
            <li> the size is larger than the other brand for a comparable price.  </li>
            <li> when it comes to products, a little improvement is not enough for him, and he actually raves about this powder.</li>
            <li> It was fully dry when I applied the powder.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way &amp; I haven&#x27;t smelled any stinky shoes or feet since he has used it.</li>
            <li> For the price this product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Wipe down feet with alcohol after work.</li>
            <li> Only problem is bottle is very small for price.</li>
            <li> Even works on previously stinky shoes.</li>
            <li> The powder made a mess.  </li>
            <li> I also sprinkled it on my carpet to freshen it up a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1st use reduces the odor a little bit&lt;br /&gt;2nd</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it takes a little while to kill all the odor-causing bacteria in the shoe, or what,</li>
            <li> They have been so smelly that I have washed them a few times.  </li>
            <li> From flip flops to heavy work boots.</li>
            <li> 2 star for a messy delivery of product into the shoes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> The holes in the applicator is either too small for the product or</li>
            <li> the product is too thick for the holes.  </li>
            <li> And I use very little!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> He is a tough one to please</li>
            <li> so that was a sign of poor packaging already.  </li>
            <li> They truly stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I was a bit skeptical as to how it would work, but my feet/shoes stink</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this company.</li>

            <li> I like to wear slip on Skechers and without socks.  They have been so smelly that I have washed them a few times.  That has provided a temporary fix (about 24hr) and then right back to the same old smelly shoes.  I received the &amp;#34;Foot Sense&amp;#34; for smelly feet and shoes.  I have used it about 4 times and find it to be about 95% effective.  It took two powderings to reduce the odor down to the bare minimum of smell.  It is effective, soothing to my feet while in the shoes, reduces the odor, and required just a small amount of powder to be effective.  The cost was average to a little bit more than I like to pay.

            <li> Excellent product that really takes the smell away. From flip flops to heavy work boots. I also sprinkled it on my carpet to freshen it up a little.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  Works great and wished I would have known about this sooner.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Even works on previously stinky shoes. It takes a little while to work, but after 1-2 uses, the odor is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I love the the scent of this powder. It&#x27;s light and smells clean, not like medicine or a perfume. It comes out perfectly, doesn&#x27;t dump too much at a time. I did a test by sprinkling it in only the left shoe of several pairs of hubby&#x27;s work shoes, waited a week and did a sniff test. The powder did make a difference. It wasn&#x27;t glaringly different, but the left shoe did smell fresher. I can&#x27;t speak to the &amp;#34;lasts for 6 months&amp;#34; yet, so I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. I&#x27;ll update my review after several months and see how it does. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. All opinions are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I use these on my Vibram Five-finger shoes which can quickly become smelly in between washes if no action is taken to prevent odor.  It keeps my shoes fresh and lengthens the time I can use them repeatedly between washes.  The powder has a really nice natural fragrance and is not overpowering.  I use it immediately after my distance runs.</li>
            <li> 1.  I don&#x27;t like being pushed into writing a review when I buy a product.  I happen to be someone that writes reviews often.  I like to actually try a product before reviewing.  2.  I don&#x27;t like the packaging.  It was delivered in a zipped plastic bag and the powder was already all over the inside so that was a sign of poor packaging already.  3.  The holes in the applicator is either too small for the product or the product is too thick for the holes.  Either way I have to shake, tap, turn it upside down/right side up, tap on the side, etc.  to get the product to come out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 6 year old has some strong foot odor.  She is wearing skechers go walk 2 shoes.  I washed the shoes first.  It was fully dry when I applied the powder.  The powder made a mess.  It is so fine it got all over everything nearby but since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; I was not worried about it. I was, however, worried about  inhaling the stuff.  The smell is very pleasant and it certainly did not &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; the smell but I was of course not expecting it to. I left the powder in the shoe (I used a very generous amount and I even put some on the outside of the shoe.)  She wore the shoes at school and when she came home it was smelly like her feet but not as strong.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I reapplied and again left it overnight.  The smell was fainter but still obviously there.  I thought this was just not going to work.  She also bathes every night and I dry her feet very well.  I leave enough powder to make sure it impacts  her feet and socks.  I applied once more and now her shoes do not smell.  I want to see how long it will last. I am very very surprised.  So 4 stars for a product that works but takes several applications.  2 star for a messy delivery of product into the shoes.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of leather shoes that I paid much too much money for that I thought I would have to throw away... Believe me when I tell you it was BAADDDD... I took a shot and ordered this powder.  I sprinkled it in three of four times before wearing them.  I tell you they smell fantastic!  I haven&#x27;t even had to re-use the powder and have been wearing these shoes through the warmest of this California Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know HOW it works - but it WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> As a professional dancer I feel as though I have tried every product on the market. This stuff works great!! It is by far the best product I have tried and have already recommended it to other dancers.</li>
            <li> It really  works&lt;br /&gt;1st use reduces the odor a little bit&lt;br /&gt;2nd use you can feel the difference&lt;br /&gt;3rd time just to make sure is not coming back soon</li>
            <li> Seriously. You. Need. This. Stuff.</li>
            <li> Works well.  My son is in middle school, and he likes to wear sneakers every day, all day.  Gets pretty smelly!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I was sceptical at first, but it definitely works. I noticed a difference even after the first use. Only downside is that I wish it came in a bigger bottle. Will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> This powder is incredible! Where I live it&#x27;s sandals all the time and humidity.  This powder keeps my feet dry, and no oder the whole day. Love it. And I use very little! Thank you for such a great product! And it&#x27;s  All natural!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I had looked everywhere for something that would help my dance and running shoes and this is the best ever. I apply it on my feet as well and it helps a lot. Great product. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Two applications and my lengendarily smell feet are odor-free. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> When it arrived the item was opened in a bag with powder everywhere; however, it seems to be working pretty well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic! I expected a spray because I had simply searched for an all natural product, but the powder form seems to last forever. I liked it so much in my shoes that I now use it on all my hockey equipment (which Febreeze didn&#x27;t work nearly as well for) and even my garbage container when I don&#x27;t have the time to clean it properly. This really is a terrific product and very reasonably priced! Fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I was a bit skeptical as to how it would work, but my feet/shoes stink so I figured it was worth a try.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and I am pleasantly surprised as to how well this works.  I apply a little to my shoes after I wear them and then pop in some &amp;#34;Mini Moso Natural Air Purifying Bags&amp;#34;.  The next morning my shoes are dry and fresh.  I also apply liberally to my feet before putting my socks on.  I have had problems with shoe/foot odors for a while and would just buy new shoes when it became overwhelming but now, with the aforementioned combination, I was able to almost eliminate the odors in my work shoes.  I have already ordered more of this product so I never run out.  If you have foot odors that you want to get rid of, give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Great product. shipped and arrived on time. Good quality for the price. smells great. Works very well to naturally keep the stinkies away.</li>
            <li> I have some Champion walking shoes that are very comfortable and I wear them without socks.  The first month they were fine.  Once I started walking more for exercise, they got funky.  I washed them in the machine, hand washed them, Febreezed them, let baking soda sit in them, and still they were funky.  I was going to buy a different foot odor remover that I&#x27;d tried before, but decided to give this one a try since it is natural and the size is larger than the other brand for a comparable price.  I received the powder yesterday, let it sit in my shoes overnight, and voila!  Funk be gone!  I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Better than any other foot odor product we have tried. We used it on the kids feet and sneakers, and they both actually smell pleasant for the first time. Now we can finally let them back into the house (the sneakers not the kids). Took very little to be effective, and it is safe for our pets. Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Stuff seems to work after 4 applications in shoes. Has a pleasant smell. Only problem is bottle is very small for price.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but it certainly hasn&#x27;t eliminated my son&#x27;s foot smell...yet.</li>
            <li> First product that I&#x27;ve ever tried that really works.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a lightening deal just to try on my husbands work shoes (and stinky feet when he takes them off) which have a very acid like smell, almost like cat pee. We have tried a lot of different odor control products over the years and none of them have ever worked, but this one does! I am so glad I gave it a try because the smell is gone. He is a tough one to please when it comes to products, a little improvement is not enough for him, and he actually raves about this powder. A little bit goes a long way &amp; I haven&#x27;t smelled any stinky shoes or feet since he has used it. He just sprinkles it in his shoes every 2 weeks and it does the job. I will definitely be buying it again when we run out.</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievably good product.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m so excited about foot powder!  This powder does it all - you can rub in on your feet or sprinkle it directly inside shoes.  I live in a hot climate and frequently wear my shoes without socks and this keeps them dry with absolutely no odor.  Wish I&#x27;d found this years ago when we had teenaged boys at home! I used to spend a fortune on the supposedly odor-preventing shoe inserts that never worked, deodorant foot sprays, etc.  We tried everything and nothing worked.  But this does!</li>
            <li> For the price this product is not worth it. It doesn&#x27;t work as advertised for 6 weeks w one application is a lie. I gave two stars tho instead of zero because it does work a lil.</li>
            <li> Not just swamp feet, but creature from the blue lagoon swamp feet.  Since I&#x27;m a nurse,  I&#x27;m on my feet and booking it 12+ hours a day. I also live in tennis shoes. My tennis shoes are almost a year old, and I walk 2 to 5 miles a day, per fitbit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor eliminating foot powder has been a staple for a long time. Put in before work. Put in after work. Wipe down feet with alcohol after work. We joke at work about stinky feet. It&#x27;s part if life, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!  Not anymore! I bought this as part of the Amazon Day Sale (please,  stop applauding,  everyone knows it was awesome). And, as per reviews, I used it once, and, still a smell in the shoes. Ok, no miracle. Day two, full day. Feet feel and smell better.  Shoes smell 60% better. Sigh. And on it went. My feet smelled way, way better&lt;br /&gt; Basically, no smell at the end of a long day. My shoes had a drastic improvement, but, still the odor persisted. The company emailed me to ask about the product,  and I told them that it was working,  but, I was waiting on a cure. They were very supportive,  encouraged me to continue using the product and sent me more product so that I could continue to use it daily until I  achieved a cure. This really impressed me. Especially since I told them that I  really felt that I was the issue, or at least my shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks of use, my feet and shoes are odor free. I&#x27;m off to deodorize the rest of my family, which is moving along rapidly. Lol. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this company. They truly stand behind their product. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this, I didn&#x27;t think it worked. I don&#x27;t know if it takes a little while to kill all the odor-causing bacteria in the shoe, or what, but after that, I couldn&#x27;t detect any foot odor when removing my shoe. I didn&#x27;t have to use very much powder, either. Which is good, because the bottle is a little on the smallish side.</li>
