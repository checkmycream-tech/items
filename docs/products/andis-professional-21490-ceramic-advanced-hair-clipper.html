            <li>It works great, does the job, no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For my purposed anyway, this thing works great.</li>
            <li>I have owned this clipper for four months now and it is still in impeccable shape.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was good.</li>
            <li>The best detachable clipper I&#x27;ve ever used it runs cool</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Awesome, powerful clippers.  </li>
            <li>It works so good that I now use it to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist and I love these clippers!  </li>
            <li>Stay cool and work great.</li>
            <li>The ceramic blade broke very easily.</li>
            <li>These clippers are a very good investment, and also the power cable is very durable.</li>
            <li>Very light and fits in my hand</li>
            <li>The ceramic blade is very nice and doesn&#x27;t heat up very much at all.</li>
            <li>so it was very important that I had a product that could keep up.  </li>
            <li>Rotary motor is the most power you can get in a clipper.  </li>
            <li>The lower blade is steel because steel handles stresses a lot better than ceramic, the ceramic wold crack if you torqued those screws on there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better then the bgrv and the bgrv and even the mvp</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can change the metal blades and not deal with plastic one which tends to not cut as close as I like.</li>
            <li>and it cut thru my hair better than any I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>It costs a bit more than the ones you find at Chinamart, but the quality is sooooooo much better</li>
            <li>Having been using for about a year to replace a set of better grade clippers.  </li>
            <li>I still recommend using a cooling spray on the blade in addition to oil though :)</li>
            <li>The best party is they both use the same detachable heads.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s even better is you don&#x27;t have to put on guards because the blades are interchangeable.</li>
            <li>Andis was quick to send me a replacement blade, and I am very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This clipper is awsome, it runs very cool and cuts real fast, best I ever had so far.</li>
            <li>Be sure and buy the blades sizes you need as the plastic guards that come with it don&#x27;t give nearly as smooth of a cut.</li>
            <li>but it does the job very good,and it is a good price for it</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It makes cleaning the blades so easy.  </li>
            <li>The clippers work great, I would have liked an adjusting bar that some other clippers have</li>
            <li>Perhaps not as silent as I thought it would be and ceramic blades not as cool as I thought they would be, but still a very good clipper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite easy to clean everything.     </li>
            <li>This clipper cuts smooth and even.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean also.</li>
            <li>A world of difference from the cheap discount store clippers this replaced.</li>
            <li>The spring clips work well and fit securely.</li>
            <li>it all the time and my blades from oster fit it.</li>
            <li>I was using cheap clippers on my face and would cut myself once in awhile.</li>
            <li>Quiet and cuts great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on whether this would be good for a professional to cut 20 heads a day.  </li>
            <li>With these clippers you can actually give yourself a pretty good haircut, i use these to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>Blade removes easily for cleaning or quick interchanges to another blade set.  </li>
            <li>Good quality hair cuts, quiet, stays cool, easy to switch from size to size and light weight.</li>
            <li>Originally bought one of these for shearing a Lab/Chow mix with a #7 course cut.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are perfectly adjusted, I&#x27;m not sure I could cut myself with them.</li>
            <li>This clipper have no issues and worked so smoothly and cool.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t unscrew anything to clean the blades, read the instruction manual it shows how to remove the blade assembly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super light.</li>
            <li>For thick hair this is the best for your dollar.  </li>
            <li>This is true for any blade, scissor, chefs knife, hunting knife, etc.     </li>
            <li>It runs cool.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>The absolute best clippers ever for black balding men.  </li>
            <li>It cuts quick and easy.....and painless.</li>
            <li>The blades will get very hot after continued use though.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought this to use twice a year to cut off my &amp;#34;vacation&amp;#34; beard before that first return to work shave.</li>
            <li>High build quality and performance!!!</li>
            <li>The ceramic blade is a very nice addition in that it stays very sharp and runs cooler than steel blades-</li>
            <li>well, very quiet, easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet, and they also have the metal loop so that you can hang them up.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for a quick, easy and very professional looking trim.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>great but not as quiet as blue animal model</li>
            <li>,also some models overheat very fast but not this one.</li>
            <li>Everything about this product feels of quality, including the plastic clip-ons (1/16&amp;#34; up to 1&amp;#34;) which grip very securely and including the on/off switch which a previous reviewer said broke easily.  </li>
            <li>and they have not failed me one.</li>
            <li>I first bought the dog clippers with detachable blade.  </li>
            <li>Never gets hot.</li>
            <li>I feel this clippers will outlast several cheap clippers thereby saving you money in the long run and also you&#x27;d have a superior product the whole time.  </li>
            <li>Working as well as the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully these will last for many years to come.  </li>
            <li>however I&#x27;m glad it came with combs of different lengths.</li>
            <li>but this goes though like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>Much better power and very solid feeling.</li>
            <li>These clippers are faster,  lighter,  stronger,  smaller,  and better looking than the 76s.  </li>
            <li>The ceramic blades run cool and the grooming process is much quicker than with my Forfex Babyliss or my older Andis Master trimmers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot too fast, it cuts really well.</li>
            <li>The first thing i noticed is how smooth they cut compared to my last pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used cheap $30 clippers and this.  </li>
            <li>I can shave so fast now.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier because you don&#x27;t have to worry about the guard falling off.</li>
            <li>found this product complete garbage , my standard clippers remove bulk faster and better would be returning if not for the hassle</li>
            <li>great for tight fades where you have the stationary blade flat against the head and neck and need to avoid burns.</li>
            <li>Deep cleaning the thing and, if needed, changing the metal guard/blade is very easy (about 1 second to access) and toolless.  </li>
            <li>the actual clipper body stays cool and almost vibration during use .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more noisy</li>
            <li>Powerful, quiet, and will even slice through damp sweaty hair.</li>
            <li>So long as you are open to maintaining the blade with an oiling before each use and cleaning it once in awhile, this pair of ceramic trimmers hsould lost youa good long while.</li>
            <li>A softer non-tempered blade will not be brittle but will be more malleable and will dull much quicker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty simple</li>
            <li>A good working set of clippers which are powerful enough to get the job done yet not so big to make your hand tired by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>great cutting power , cuts even aswell .</li>
            <li>Andis is on point as far as this clipper goes</li>
            <li>AND PROBABLY WONT FOR AT LEAST 3 MORE WEEKS, (WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO CUT).</li>
            <li>These have worked very well and provide a cleaner cut on my very short hair.</li>
            <li>As a professional I needed a clipper that could withstand numerous male customers without pulling the hairs, getting hot, or becoming dull.  </li>
            <li>the only thing is the blade (NOT THE CLIPPER ITSELF) gets hot if ran constant .</li>
            <li>Overall I am ecstatic with this and HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can run this down my head quickly and there is a barely noticeable change in the motor&#x27;s tone.  </li>
            <li>Cost a whole 5 dollars more than the cheap crap out there.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and powerful motor.</li>
            <li>I have bought 2 of these clippers, my first set I sold to my coworker because she kept complaining how heavy and bulky her oster 76s were getting for get age.  </li>

            <li> the actual clipper body stays cool and almost vibration during use .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more noisy</li>
            <li> Powerful, quiet, and will even slice through damp sweaty hair.</li>
            <li> So long as you are open to maintaining the blade with an oiling before each use and cleaning it once in awhile, this pair of ceramic trimmers hsould lost youa good long while.</li>
            <li> A softer non-tempered blade will not be brittle but will be more malleable and will dull much quicker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty simple</li>
            <li> A good working set of clippers which are powerful enough to get the job done yet not so big to make your hand tired by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> great cutting power , cuts even aswell .</li>
            <li> Andis is on point as far as this clipper goes</li>
            <li> AND PROBABLY WONT FOR AT LEAST 3 MORE WEEKS, (WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO CUT).</li>
            <li> These have worked very well and provide a cleaner cut on my very short hair.</li>
            <li> As a professional I needed a clipper that could withstand numerous male customers without pulling the hairs, getting hot, or becoming dull.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is the blade (NOT THE CLIPPER ITSELF) gets hot if ran constant .</li>
            <li> Overall I am ecstatic with this and HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can run this down my head quickly and there is a barely noticeable change in the motor&#x27;s tone.  </li>
            <li> Cost a whole 5 dollars more than the cheap crap out there.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and powerful motor.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of these clippers, my first set I sold to my coworker because she kept complaining how heavy and bulky her oster 76s were getting for get age.  </li>
            <li> The only down side was that the clipper head comes completely off.</li>
            <li> And the clippers with ceramic blade cut my dogs long fur like butter.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how long they lasted me</li>
            <li> Work as described and cut close or further away without pulling (sharp blades).</li>
            <li> I find these clippers to be fairly quiet and they cut extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why you would want to completely disassemble the shaver blade, there&#x27;s no reason to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big for lines</li>
            <li> The blades are brittle because they are tempered, which makes them stay sharp for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the ceramic blade it can chip.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the blade.</li>
            <li> The ceramic blade along with the metal blade helps to keep friction minimal.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the comb set didn&#x27;t have the taper combs, but the ones from my old set fit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp, cuts both wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> it uses every other detachable blade</li>
            <li> It cuts the hair exactly as I&#x27;d hoped, without leaving rows of uncut hair, pulling, etc.  </li>
            <li> I expect the ceramic blades will stay sharp.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been just buzzing my hair 1/4 inch all over, then trimming up the back and edges.  </li>
            <li> The oscillating type clatter when I turn them up and do not cut when I turn them down.  </li>
            <li> and so they&#x27;re $15 to $20 less money.     </li>
            <li> There is some heat from friction but the coefficient of friction for ceramic on steel is less than for steel on steel.</li>
            <li> That means it takes much less time to clip my head.  </li>
            <li> I was elated to find this pivot motor clipper for less than $80.</li>
            <li> These stay cool while cutting &amp; they cut without binding up or getting stuck in thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use this in Jamaica where clippers build to be used on 60Hz lines usually gives problems with heavy vibration due to our 50Hz cycle.</li>
            <li> but this gave me a horrendously uneven cut - I returned it.</li>
            <li> My son and I keep a buzz year round.  </li>
            <li> mine came off and dropped a few feet.</li>
            <li> I would not have bought it if I had know how heavy it is</li>
            <li> We just needed a small one for trim.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy duty cutter.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about the interchangeable blades and not having to use the cruddy plastic attachments anymore</li>
            <li> There is always a trade-off with knifes between how hard the blade is vs how brittle.</li>
            <li> The attached metal guard seems to be the common length I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> The mix of oily thick hair couldn&#x27;t be cut with the $20 clippers.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so thick, every other clippers I have used get stuck and stop cutting.  </li>
            <li> have very thick hair</li>
            <li> so I was getting tired of paying $15 to have someone take 30 seconds to do it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just one man cutting one head every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I will update this if anything goes wrong or any problems develop.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to use, scratchy on ones scalp.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s cutting non stop</li>
            <li> I was always disappointed in the lack of power.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They are used for home and not commercial use. Stay cool and work great.</li>
            <li> great but not as quiet as blue animal model</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more noisy then the others but it does the job very good,and it is a good price for it,also some models overheat very fast but not this one.</li>
            <li> These clippers are a very good investment, and also the power cable is very durable. With these clippers you can actually give yourself a pretty good haircut, i use these to cut my own hair. I have every ceramic blade from 00000 to 3 1/2. I have had this clippers since December and they have not failed me one. Nice and quiet, and they also have the metal loop so that you can hang them up. Easy to use and easy to maintain. Every barber needs these clippers.</li>
            <li> For thick hair this is the best for your dollar.  Rotary motor is the most power you can get in a clipper.  Makes short work of haircuts on even the thickest mane.  One-piece ceramic blade set gives you the best cut with no need to adjust the blade.  Blade removes easily for cleaning or quick interchanges to another blade set.  Excellent for a demanding home user.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper. The ability to swap out the shaver head is genius. I shave my head bald and the Andis #00000 blade works great and does not cause irritation.    The Andis 21420 and the Andis 21485 are the same unit as this shaver, they&#x27;re just intended to be used as a pet shaver and so they&#x27;re $15 to $20 less money.     I&#x27;m not sure why you would want to completely disassemble the shaver blade, there&#x27;s no reason to. Don&#x27;t unscrew anything to clean the blades, read the instruction manual it shows how to remove the blade assembly. It&#x27;s quite easy to clean everything.     The blades are brittle because they are tempered, which makes them stay sharp for a very long time. A softer non-tempered blade will not be brittle but will be more malleable and will dull much quicker. There is always a trade-off with knifes between how hard the blade is vs how brittle. This is true for any blade, scissor, chefs knife, hunting knife, etc.     The reason that only one of the blades is ceramic is because only one of them has to be ceramic, it serves to reduce the friction of steel on steel. The lower blade is steel because steel handles stresses a lot better than ceramic, the ceramic wold crack if you torqued those screws on there. There is some heat from friction but the coefficient of friction for ceramic on steel is less than for steel on steel.</li>
            <li> The best detachable clipper I&#x27;ve ever used it runs cool it uses every other detachable blade and it&#x27;s super light. Andis is on point as far as this clipper goes I want to buy 2 extra ones just to have one day PS it&#x27;s better then the bgrv and the bgrv and even the mvp</li>
            <li> A good working set of clippers which are powerful enough to get the job done yet not so big to make your hand tired by the end of the day.  The dogs like them too.</li>
            <li> The absolute best clippers ever for black balding men.  I wish I got the cordless.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and I love these clippers!  They work great and are affordable. They also arrived within the week. So happy to have them!</li>
            <li> Cost a whole 5 dollars more than the cheap crap out there. These stay cool while cutting &amp; they cut without binding up or getting stuck in thick hair. Buy one of these &amp; it will be the last unit you will need to buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper for both beard and hair trimming.  I use a 63040 - 3-1/2 blade for hair, the 000 blade that came with the clipper for detailing and a 63055 - A1 for trimming my beard.  The ceramic blades run cool and the grooming process is much quicker than with my Forfex Babyliss or my older Andis Master trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for a quick, easy and very professional looking trim.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  I first bought the dog clippers with detachable blade.  It makes cleaning the blades so easy.  And the clippers with ceramic blade cut my dogs long fur like butter.  I wanted a set for me.  I was a little disappointed that the comb set didn&#x27;t have the taper combs, but the ones from my old set fit.  I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts smooth and even. Very light and fits in my hand just right. Never gets hot. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is this unit dual voltage, or only 120 volts?&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find in the description.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, but I don&#x27;t see voltage!!!</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Work as described and cut close or further away without pulling (sharp blades). Perhaps not as silent as I thought it would be and ceramic blades not as cool as I thought they would be, but still a very good clipper.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can change the metal blades and not deal with plastic one which tends to not cut as close as I like.</li>
            <li> Great pair of trimmers. So long as you are open to maintaining the blade with an oiling before each use and cleaning it once in awhile, this pair of ceramic trimmers hsould lost youa good long while. Whether you are beard trimming, grooming or using this to shape your hair it will not disappoint you</li>
            <li> Purchased the clipper for home use. It&#x27;s very sharp, cuts both wet and dry hair well, very quiet, easy to use, and easy to clean. Would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Good quality hair cuts, quiet, stays cool, easy to switch from size to size and light weight. Easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about the interchangeable blades and not having to use the cruddy plastic attachments anymore but this gave me a horrendously uneven cut - I returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about a year for clipping my hair to the scalp.  I&#x27;ve only used cheap $30 clippers and this.  Everything about this product feels of quality, including the plastic clip-ons (1/16&amp;#34; up to 1&amp;#34;) which grip very securely and including the on/off switch which a previous reviewer said broke easily.  It cuts the hair exactly as I&#x27;d hoped, without leaving rows of uncut hair, pulling, etc.  The motor is powerful.  I can run this down my head quickly and there is a barely noticeable change in the motor&#x27;s tone.  That means it takes much less time to clip my head.  Deep cleaning the thing and, if needed, changing the metal guard/blade is very easy (about 1 second to access) and toolless.  It runs cool.  The attached metal guard seems to be the common length I&#x27;m used to and you can buy additional lengths.  Also comes with a cleaning brush and oil.  I feel this clippers will outlast several cheap clippers thereby saving you money in the long run and also you&#x27;d have a superior product the whole time.  Overall I am ecstatic with this and HIGHLY recommend it. *UPDATE 2/2016* Still using it about once a week.  Working as well as the first time I used it.  Only maintenance is periodic oilings.</li>
            <li> AND PROBABLY WONT FOR AT LEAST 3 MORE WEEKS, (WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO CUT). AT THAT TIME I WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITH A REVIEW ON THE ANDIS PRO CLIPPERS AND THE A-I EXTRA BLADE I PURCHASED. I DID TURN IT N AND IT FEELS AND SOUNDS JUST LIKE MY OSTER.</li>
            <li> My son and I keep a buzz year round.  We have been using the &amp;#34;Peanut Clipper&amp;#34; for quite some time.  I used the #3 on him and a #2 on me.  Onto this clipper.  The details do not tell you that it includes the plastic guards.  I almost ordered some thinking that I had to purchase that separate.  I find these clippers to be fairly quiet and they cut extremely well.  I went from a Volkswagon (a beat up one at that) to a Cadilac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and it cut thru my hair better than any I have ever had.  Hopefully these will last for many years to come.  I will update this if anything goes wrong or any problems develop.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought this to use twice a year to cut off my &amp;#34;vacation&amp;#34; beard before that first return to work shave. It cuts quick and easy.....and painless. A world of difference from the cheap discount store clippers this replaced. It works so good that I now use it to cut my own hair. Still works just like it did the day I bought it. It will probably last forever if I don&#x27;t drop it and break the ceramic part of the blade.  It costs a bit more than the ones you find at Chinamart, but the quality is sooooooo much better</li>
            <li> This clipper is awsome, it runs very cool and cuts real fast, best I ever had so far. Highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for personal use, fades and beard. It doesn&#x27;t get hot too fast, it cuts really well. It&#x27;s a little big for lines but it can do the job. Shipping was good. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> The clippers work great, I would have liked an adjusting bar that some other clippers have however I&#x27;m glad it came with combs of different lengths. Be careful with the ceramic blade it can chip. Don&#x27;t know if it runs cooler, because it does get warm/hot after a while.</li>
            <li> Originally bought one of these for shearing a Lab/Chow mix with a #7 course cut.  The mix of oily thick hair couldn&#x27;t be cut with the $20 clippers.  The groomer at PetSmart said it was the toughest hair she&#x27;d ever cut.  I don&#x27;t know what clippers she was using but this goes though like a hot knife through butter.  I&#x27;ve since bought one for the family.  (My wife refused to let me cut the kids&#x27; hair with the dog&#x27;s clippers.)  Be sure and buy the blades sizes you need as the plastic guards that come with it don&#x27;t give nearly as smooth of a cut.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it! It feels solid to hold and works with ease and came with a variety of attachments! Made in the US!</li>
            <li> Having been using for about a year to replace a set of better grade clippers.  These have worked very well and provide a cleaner cut on my very short hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a magnetic clipper for awhile as a hairstylist. I was always disappointed in the lack of power. I was elated to find this pivot motor clipper for less than $80. Much better power and very solid feeling. The ceramic blade is a very nice addition in that it stays very sharp and runs cooler than steel blades- great for tight fades where you have the stationary blade flat against the head and neck and need to avoid burns. I still recommend using a cooling spray on the blade in addition to oil though :)</li>
            <li> These are great clippers. The spring clips work well and fit securely. The ceramic blade is very nice and doesn&#x27;t heat up very much at all. The only down side was that the clipper head comes completely off. mine came off and dropped a few feet. The ceramic blade broke very easily. Andis was quick to send me a replacement blade, and I am very satisfied with the purchase. Just be careful with the blade.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of these clippers, my first set I sold to my coworker because she kept complaining how heavy and bulky her oster 76s were getting for get age.  She had been using the same model for the last 25 yrs. After using mine for 2 weeks she refused to give them back.  These clippers are faster,  lighter,  stronger,  smaller,  and better looking than the 76s.  The best party is they both use the same detachable heads.</li>
            <li> Perfect clippers for a perfect cut every time.</li>
            <li> great cutting power , cuts even aswell . the only thing is the blade (NOT THE CLIPPER ITSELF) gets hot if ran constant . the actual clipper body stays cool and almost vibration during use .</li>
            <li> As a professional I needed a clipper that could withstand numerous male customers without pulling the hairs, getting hot, or becoming dull.  This product has proven to not do any of those things yet.  I have owned this clipper for four months now and it is still in impeccable shape.  I would do anywhere from 10-25 customers a day so it was very important that I had a product that could keep up.  The ceramic blade along with the metal blade helps to keep friction minimal. Another note: Oster metal blades cannot be used with this clipper only andis metal blades</li>
            <li> found this product complete garbage , my standard clippers remove bulk faster and better would be returning if not for the hassle</li>
            <li> Great product I would buy it again .&lt;br /&gt;Great for home or shop.&lt;br /&gt;Use it all the time and my blades from oster fit it.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to use, scratchy on ones scalp.</li>
            <li> Awesome, powerful clippers.  Best ones I&#x27;ve owned in 25 years of shaving my own head.  Powerful, quiet, and will even slice through damp sweaty hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick, every other clippers I have used get stuck and stop cutting.  I like the rotary motor in these.  The oscillating type clatter when I turn them up and do not cut when I turn them down.  I expect the ceramic blades will stay sharp.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. High build quality and performance!!!</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been just buzzing my hair 1/4 inch all over, then trimming up the back and edges.  It&#x27;s pretty simple so I was getting tired of paying $15 to have someone take 30 seconds to do it.  So I did my research and settled on this thing.  I have not been disappointed.  I&#x27;ve been using it several months.  It works great, does the job, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just one man cutting one head every few weeks.  I can&#x27;t comment on whether this would be good for a professional to cut 20 heads a day.  For my purposed anyway, this thing works great.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy duty cutter. I would not have bought it if I had know how heavy it is but on the flip side, you will use this for a lifetime. If you do a LOT of haircutting this cuts effortlessly. We just needed a small one for trim.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and it works perfect! I use the 00000 head. I can shave so fast now. It only takes a couple of minutes. I was using cheap clippers on my face and would cut myself once in awhile. These clippers are perfectly adjusted, I&#x27;m not sure I could cut myself with them.</li>
            <li> These clippers are so great! The first thing i noticed is how smooth they cut compared to my last pair of clippers. It&#x27;s like butter! And what&#x27;s even better is you don&#x27;t have to put on guards because the blades are interchangeable. So you can buy a blade that&#x27;s 3/4 or whatever and it&#x27;s the same as with having the blade on. Makes it so much easier because you don&#x27;t have to worry about the guard falling off. These are the last pair of clippers i&#x27;ll ever have to buy!</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers! Very sharp and powerful motor. The blades will get very hot after continued use though.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer for the money.  Quiet and cuts great.</li>
            <li> I use this in Jamaica where clippers build to be used on 60Hz lines usually gives problems with heavy vibration due to our 50Hz cycle. This clipper have no issues and worked so smoothly and cool. Highly recommended buy.</li>
            <li> This Clipper is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and affordable. I ride these till the wheels fell off 3yrs that&#x27;s how long they lasted me and that&#x27;s cutting non stop</li>
