            <li>I&#x27;d love a refund!!!</li>
            <li>These stickers are great.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer the sticker kind.</li>
            <li>The patterns were nice</li>
            <li>The designs are really nice, But they don&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to find a tutorial on YouTube.</li>
            <li>But OK for my daughter who changes colors often.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more like a temporary tattoo than a sticker.</li>
            <li>After many many trys I couldn&#x27;t get them to stick.</li>
            <li>I love these and am ordering more.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I LOVE water decals</li>
            <li>I had no trouble applying them, and the design is beautiful.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to place on to nails, and last a good 2 weeks if you have a good top coat.</li>
            <li>Went on really easily and look fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love the ease of water decals, and these are very pretty besides.</li>
            <li>Definitely a deal that was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I actually found several very good ones.</li>
            <li>I will buy these again worth it....</li>
            <li>First of all, it looks like the 43% of 1</li>
            <li>Other than that, I liked them very much and would recommend them.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but very hard to apply.  </li>
            <li>The directions are not included with the product, but are easy to find, either in the product description above, or on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these nail art stickers..</li>
            <li>I would recommend you to go to Nordstrom and get those real decals for $6 each</li>
            <li>So, I bought these a few weeks ago and was nervous to try them, but OMG were they easy!  </li>
            <li>I had a slight wrinkle as it adhered to the curve of my nail, but this is covered by the top coat.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very vivid and look just like the picture</li>
            <li>really once you&#x27;ve practiced and messed up a few times :P  but every time you get your hands wet they will come off  even if you put clear polish over them...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true you&#x27;ll have to google for instructions, but that is a minor issue.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable as well, compared to what one would pay locally.</li>
            <li>and I was super disappointed they didn&#x27;t work cause they have super cute prints.</li>
            <li>Plus they have a professional look to them.</li>
            <li>I will NOT waste money on this item  again.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE your money.</li>
            <li>this are not decals they are like those fake tattoes you get inside bubble gum :P you have to get them wet then peel the plastic off and put in your nails..</li>
            <li>I used a pair of sharp embroidery scissors to gently score the design</li>
            <li>You do need to work quickly, as once they start to dry they will stick down.</li>

            <li> You do need to work quickly, as once they start to dry they will stick down.</li>
            <li> Anyone that has complained about not liking them, can send them to me ;)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> so really they will last one day.. considering the ammount of time they take to put on and how little they last.. not worth it</li>
            <li> some of you mentioned the lack of instructions which is BAd because you need to know that after the decal is on your nail blot it dry with paper towel then put a clear top coat over it to keep it on.  </li>
            <li> So these were a bit strange.</li>
            <li> COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY.</li>
            <li> DID NOT COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS AND ARE VERY THIN CHEAPLY MADE.</li>
            <li> These were very fun designs; however, if you don&#x27;t have the patience, they can be very frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li> Which you then stick on your nail, let dry a bit and then put polish over.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of always waiting for them to dry, so this really solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money and hope no one else makes the same mistake!!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> never come off the paper not at all what was expected.</li>
            <li> they are not very pliable</li>
            <li> I tried for 30 minutes, I thought one stayed on, I was wrong touched it and it slide right off.  </li>
            <li> These nail art stickers are NOT worth buying.  </li>
            <li> You have to apply from the tip down and trim around the cuticle.</li>
            <li> They are not true to the color represented in the picture.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this,  WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> totaly wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Since I typically do my nails as a way to relax, these don&#x27;t always give me the relaxing experience I&#x27;m looking for!  </li>
            <li> Usually I do stamping, but when I am feeling stressed this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds in water to loosen the design, hold it with a pair of tweezers by the black strip at the base and slide off the paper.  </li>
            <li> then wait until it dries because the laminate keeps sliding around your finger when wet... not too complicated</li>
            <li> Falls off as soon as your hands get wet and nearly impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> And because they are so thin, if you try to use nail glue, it basically disintegrates the paper making these unusable.  </li>
            <li> They are so thin it is extremely difficult to get them off of the paper without tearing.  </li>
            <li> they are fake just printed paper you can not lift off the&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;nail sticker&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad</li>
            <li> These are a piece of crap!</li>
            <li> These are terrible.  </li>
            <li> AWFUL, DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this,  WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Its alright. Doesn&#x27;t last long. But OK for my daughter who changes colors often.</li>
            <li> These are a piece of crap! They&#x27;re not nail stickers they&#x27;re cardboard that look like nail stickers. I&#x27;m mad I wasted my money and hope no one else makes the same mistake!!!!</li>
            <li> They are so easy to place on to nails, and last a good 2 weeks if you have a good top coat.</li>
            <li> So these were a bit strange. They&#x27;re more like a temporary tattoo than a sticker. You soak them in water and the decal slides off. Which you then stick on your nail, let dry a bit and then put polish over. They worked but I prefer the sticker kind. The patterns were nice but overall I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these nail art stickers.. it doesn&#x27;t come w/instructions. I had to google it to learn how to put them on. After many many trys I couldn&#x27;t get them to stick.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.  The designs are really nice, But they don&#x27;t stay on.  I tried for 30 minutes, I thought one stayed on, I was wrong touched it and it slide right off.  This product should not be sold. Garbage!!!</li>
            <li> These stickers are great.  I had no trouble applying them, and the design is beautiful. The directions are not included with the product, but are easy to find, either in the product description above, or on YouTube.  It only takes a few seconds in water to loosen the design, hold it with a pair of tweezers by the black strip at the base and slide off the paper.  You have to apply from the tip down and trim around the cuticle. I used a pair of sharp embroidery scissors to gently score the design and it came off neatly.  I had a slight wrinkle as it adhered to the curve of my nail, but this is covered by the top coat.  You do need to work quickly, as once they start to dry they will stick down.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase again. These decals are faded.  They are not true to the color represented in the picture.</li>
            <li> this are not decals they are like those fake tattoes you get inside bubble gum :P you have to get them wet then peel the plastic off and put in your nails.. then wait until it dries because the laminate keeps sliding around your finger when wet... not too complicated really once you&#x27;ve practiced and messed up a few times :P  but every time you get your hands wet they will come off  even if you put clear polish over them... so really they will last one day.. considering the ammount of time they take to put on and how little they last.. not worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true you&#x27;ll have to google for instructions, but that is a minor issue. I love these and am ordering more.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stick to nails, just paper I would recommend you to go to Nordstrom and get those real decals for $6 each</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. They don&#x27;t stay on well alone. The colors are very vivid and look just like the picture but I don&#x27;t know how to get them to stay on my fingers.</li>
            <li> Falls off as soon as your hands get wet and nearly impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> doesnt work the way its supposed to, and there are no directions that come with it</li>
            <li> never come off the paper not at all what was expected.</li>
            <li> I will buy these again worth it....</li>
            <li> I love these!!! Went on really easily and look fantastic. I paint my nails all the time, every day I change my color out. I was getting tired of always waiting for them to dry, so this really solved the problem. Plus they have a professional look to them. Anyone that has complained about not liking them, can send them to me ;)</li>
            <li> DID NOT COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS AND ARE VERY THIN CHEAPLY MADE. DO NOT STICK OR WORK AT ALL I&#x27;M GOING TO THROW THEM AWAY. COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but very hard to apply.  I will NOT waste money on this item  again.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t understand how to use these but they would not stay on and I was super disappointed they didn&#x27;t work cause they have super cute prints.</li>
            <li> These nail art stickers are NOT worth buying.  They are so thin it is extremely difficult to get them off of the paper without tearing.  And then the adhesive on them doesn&#x27;t even stick.  And because they are so thin, if you try to use nail glue, it basically disintegrates the paper making these unusable.  Definitely a deal that was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> they are not very pliable</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE your money. i bought these and not one of them worked. they are fake just printed paper you can not lift off the&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;nail sticker&amp;#34; . totaly wasted my money. SO DISCUSTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of water decals, and these are very pretty besides. Usually I do stamping, but when I am feeling stressed this is the way to go. The price was very reasonable as well, compared to what one would pay locally.</li>
            <li> Came with no instructions I have used similar products before nothing I did would even get them off of the sheets! I&#x27;d love a refund!!! DO NOT NOT NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> AWFUL, DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!</li>
            <li> These were very fun designs; however, if you don&#x27;t have the patience, they can be very frustrating to use.  Since I typically do my nails as a way to relax, these don&#x27;t always give me the relaxing experience I&#x27;m looking for!  :)  Other than that, I liked them very much and would recommend them.</li>
            <li> First of all, it looks like the 43% of 1* ratings are for people who don&#x27;t know that they purchased WATER decals. These are NOT the cheapie stickers that you just stick on and trim. It is very easy to find a tutorial on YouTube. I actually found several very good ones. The instructions are also posted above.  So, I bought these a few weeks ago and was nervous to try them, but OMG were they easy!  It only took me about 15 minutes to set up, trim and apply them. And they are perfect!</li>
            <li> While I have not used this product I use water decals all the time.  some of you mentioned the lack of instructions which is BAd because you need to know that after the decal is on your nail blot it dry with paper towel then put a clear top coat over it to keep it on.  Try it agai if you still have some left.  I LOVE water decals</li>
