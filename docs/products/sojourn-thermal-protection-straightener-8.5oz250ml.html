    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product! It functions as a detangler and also helps hold my curls when I style my hair (my hair is VERY straight and thin and doesn&#x27;t like to hold curl).</li>
            <li> Instant rescue results for the bed head look. Just mist, scrunch and go. Perfect for wet or dry hair. Scent friendly - no harsh chemicals. I am sensitive to fragrance and this product is free of irritants. One of the few safe hair products I have found. A little goes a long way.  It is labeled as a straightener but I use for any style. Makes hair so manageable. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> The only reason I put 4 stars is because of the price. All around a good product, though.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product.  If your hair reacts to humidity, using Thermal Protection Straightener will give you a great hair day!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a week now but I&#x27;m pretty certain I&#x27;m a fan! It does its job as a heat protectant and leaves my hair extremely soft and shiny without the sticky feeling or greasy feeling. Totally happy I chose this one!</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes your hair really shiny. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this from my hair stylist anymore and was so happy to see that I could order it through Amazon! I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a great detangler and straightener and it makes my hair feel really soft. There is no heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and this is a big deal for me. The product seems to work well and my hair comes out silky smooth!!</li>

It&#x27;s very fresh and not perfume-like.</li>
            <li> Best thermal protector out there. I use it because I flat iron. Does not get greasy or weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Keeps my hair smooth &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> Love it. Will purchase it again. Wish my hairdresser carried it but she can&#x27;t get it form her supplier. Bummer</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product. I apply immediately following shampooing and conditioning my hair, blow dry and then re - apply prior to applying heat. My hair feels soft, moisturized and withstands humidity.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few straightening products that really works!  I live in the humid south, so there is rarely good hair weather. Sojourn has the formula that works best.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite straightener and detangler. For around $20 it&#x27;s a good deal because I know it&#x27;s not cheap but it lasts me about half a year! Although I do have shoulder length hair.  I def notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use this when styling with heat - hair feels more brittle and frizzes more without it.  Even when I&#x27;m air drying my hair to get waves and curls, I&#x27;ll wait to spritz this until my hair is almost all the way dry, then spritz my hair lightly all over and it will curl/wave in just the right way (this is also something that happens when my hair gets rained on, but with the Sojourn it&#x27;s less frizzy)</li>
            <li> I really want to give this product five stars. It does work well, but the fragrance is too much for me. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times now and each day I use it I get a migraine. I had to wash it out last time because it makes me feel too miserable. Other than that a small amount worked fine, and it did make my hair feel nice. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Sojourn products make your hair very soft.  If you have thick hair, it makes it so soft</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron to make my hair silky and straight. I have fine dry hair and the Sojurn thermal protector does the job well to protect my hair and leave it glossy and straight. It also dries quickly and so when I blow dry my hair, I add it to my wet hair first, dry my hair, and then spray it again into my hair and comb it through. Then I do the hair straightening. Great system and it works for me and I use very little because not a lot is needed to accomplish the end result.</li>
            <li> i use this product everytime i straighten my hair and it really makes my hair super soft, silky and awesome!!!! it&#x27;s really good and it helps my hair not be frizzy, even in high humidity (although i do have to reapply for it to defrizz my hair, whoch is why i took off a star)! this is definetely a must have if you straighten, curl or blow dry your hair a lot &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This product is great when blow drying/curling your hair.  Helps protect your hair against the heat.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, wavy hair.  I love this thermal protection spray.  Makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells like a vacation and gives my hair an extra boost of moisture after a shower.</li>
