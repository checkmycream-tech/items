            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and a standard part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I have been a patient of his for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin but every now</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Love these easy, quick pads.</li>
            <li>Great product, face is so much clearer, and healthier looking when I consistently use these peels.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with some fine lines, and I think they improve the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much, I just ordered another batch of them.</li>
            <li>The brown spots are gone and also some of the light wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous peel.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I see a difference using the extra strength version, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li>Keep me blemish free and improve the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>You can even go make up free with confidence.</li>
            <li>fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even able to get away with using them every other day, which is great, considering how pricey they are.</li>
            <li>As we remember, it takes two-three months to see a significant difference, but worth it, and it gets even better over time.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent to me!</li>
            <li>I bought 2 boxes worth too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut back to using them twice a week, just in the interest of cost saving, but they are safe and effective for every day use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying this is the same, but, a good in between method.</li>
            <li>:) I use the brightening serum after these, and follow with a very lite vitamin c enriched moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li>Really makes my skin look better.  </li>
            <li>Great price and product arrived as expected!</li>
            <li>quick n convenient.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clear and  healthy.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect to look 20 years younger; however, it does fade some age spots, decreases pore size and gives your complexion a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months, and being a product junkie, I would say this is probably the most effective skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It also gives my skin an overall brigher and more even complexion.</li>
            <li>Your skin truly glows after use - better than almost any facial I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>All of Dr. Gross&#x27; products are outstanding.</li>
            <li>I have used it for several years and I love the results</li>
            <li>and it said this version was for people who are trying the peel for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I broke out with hormonal acne for the first time about two years ago.</li>
            <li>First day I noticed a smoother appearance in my skin.</li>
            <li>Your skin will glow and feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery....thank you!  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores and blotchy skin, or I should say I did have.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t handle the regular salicylic pads he makes, but these do me just fine.</li>
            <li>They really do the trick at getting gunk out, without burning.</li>
            <li>highly recommended to add to your skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>I use the first pad on my whole face and the second pad to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I have moved to a new city and don&#x27;t have an esthetician.  </li>
            <li>and it looks brand new afterwards.  </li>
            <li>These are gentle enough even for my sensitive skin, and give you a nice golden glow after using them, not to mention, no more acne!!</li>
            <li>These pads literally wipe my dark spots and fine lines away.  </li>
            <li>and it clear it up a bit.</li>
            <li>and I need to clear them out.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old.  </li>
            <li>I was used to getting professional peels.  </li>
            <li>My skins feels wonderfully soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I ordered this back in October, but I only just realized that this shipper sent me the Original Formula instead of the Extra Strength Formula.</li>
            <li>The boxes look exactly the same except for the one line of RED TYPE in lower caps that says, &amp;#34;extra strength formula,&amp;#34</li>

            <li> I’m not a happy Amazon customer right now!</li>
            <li> Expensive, yes, but its worth it to have a radiantly glowing, clear complexion!</li>
            <li> If you have struggled with acne prone skin and tried many products, and spent a ton of money only to make the problem worse and your pocket empty, try these!!</li>
            <li> At the driest/coldest part of winter, I back of these, but other than that</li>
            <li> I was struggling with it until suddenly my entire forehead broke out in tiny little bumps all over.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t over dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> and then I will get a deep blemish that will leave a dark spot.</li>
            <li> My face is already looking less oily with smaller pores.</li>
            <li> Not much I can do about it now....</li>
            <li> I no longer go for facials or use any other masks.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t leave a film on your face, don&#x27;t cause a reaction (other than the intended exfoliation!)</li>
            <li> Less blocked pores.</li>
            <li> I CUT THEM IN HALF and store the halves I don&#x27;t use in ziploc bags so I could save a heap of money.</li>
            <li> Second day the little bumps had decreased in number and my face was looking brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> I am still a patient and commute from Pennsylvania a few times a year for my appointments.</li>
            <li> I started with the regular strength pads, and have now added these to my arsenal for crazy winter weeks where my skin is just looking extra dull.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 years or so</li>
            <li> I use this at least three times per week, and follow it with a retinol serum then a C serum.</li>
            <li> Anyone feeling alil dull n lifeless with your skin, try these out!</li>
            <li> They will take over a year to vanish and it&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
            <li> or you have small breakouts on your skin!!!!!</li>
            <li> It looked disgusting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t reviewed these before! They have saved my acne-prone, easily-congested skin. I started with the regular strength pads, and have now added these to my arsenal for crazy winter weeks where my skin is just looking extra dull. They really do the trick at getting gunk out, without burning. I can&#x27;t handle the regular salicylic pads he makes, but these do me just fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does as stated.  My skin looks clear and  healthy.  I am 49 years old.  These are great for air travel, can be carried on and light, easy to pack.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores and blotchy skin, or I should say I did have.  These have helped tighten my pores up, even my skin tone up and lesson my oily skin.  I have found I need to take a break from using them for a couple of days once in awhile so I don&#x27;t over dry my skin.  I liked them so much, I just ordered another batch of them.</li>
            <li> great price and love this product! You will love it if you have oil skin or you have small breakouts on your skin!!!!!</li>
            <li> A great product to revive your skin!  I use it once a week to prevent any breakouts and reveal fresher skin!</li>
            <li> Great price and product.</li>
            <li> Have been using faithfully and notice virtually no improvement in skin appearance or condition.no</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 years or so and I have noticed a huge change. It is not plastic surgery so don&#x27;t expect to look 20 years younger; however, it does fade some age spots, decreases pore size and gives your complexion a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Love!!!!!!!!!!!This product.It is the only product that has helped with my acne!</li>
            <li> I try the 30 days pack and love it had alot of break out around my chin area and it clear it up a bit. So I got the 60 days pack can&#x27;t wait to see results.</li>
            <li> I bought the EXTRA STRENGTH version...but Amazon sent me the regular strength. I just realized it today, a couple of months after receipt. Not much I can do about it now....except learn that I&#x27;ve got to be more vigilant about inspecting what Amazon sends me! I’m not a happy Amazon customer right now!</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin but every now and then I will get a deep blemish that will leave a dark spot. They will take over a year to vanish and it&#x27;s frustrating. These pads literally wipe my dark spots and fine lines away.  It&#x27;s pretty impressive. It also gives my skin an overall brigher and more even complexion. I no longer go for facials or use any other masks. I&#x27;m even able to get away with using them every other day, which is great, considering how pricey they are.</li>
            <li> individual packets are perfect for travel</li>
            <li> Great product, face is so much clearer, and healthier looking when I consistently use these peels. Kind of self indulgent because of the price, but it works.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for over a year, and my skin has gotten better. Less blocked pores.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I have moved to a new city and don&#x27;t have an esthetician.  I was used to getting professional peels.  I&#x27;m not saying this is the same, but, a good in between method.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used these regularly for years. The brown spots are gone and also some of the light wrinkles. The packets are perfect for travel. As we remember, it takes two-three months to see a significant difference, but worth it, and it gets even better over time.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous peel. My skins feels wonderfully soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months, and being a product junkie, I would say this is probably the most effective skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve cut back to using them twice a week, just in the interest of cost saving, but they are safe and effective for every day use.  Your skin truly glows after use - better than almost any facial I&#x27;ve ever had.  My skin looks even toned and radiant after every use.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin is a lot healthier, I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many anti-aging products and this is by far the best one! It polishes your skin, leaves it so smooth and flawless, it&#x27;s like when you polish your jewelry and it looks brand new afterwards.  Just give it a try, I promise you will NOT regret it! Worth every cent to me!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and a standard part of my skin care regimen. I use this at least three times per week, and follow it with a retinol serum then a C serum. I can&#x27;t say I see a difference using the extra strength version, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> Love these easy, quick pads. I have oily skin with some fine lines, and I think they improve the quality of my skin. Keep me blemish free and improve the texture of my skin. I use the first pad on my whole face and the second pad to remove eye makeup. I don&#x27;t notice the second pad doing anything for my facial skin and sometimes forget to use them without noticing a difference</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! Great price and product arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> This is the best peel ever!  All of Dr. Gross&#x27; products are outstanding. He is one of the best doctors in New York!  I have been a patient of his for many, many years.  I am still a patient and commute from Pennsylvania a few times a year for my appointments.</li>

            <li> Best peels I&#x27;ve found.  Tried the cheaper ones (different brands) and they just don&#x27;t work as well.  These don&#x27;t leave a film on your face, don&#x27;t cause a reaction (other than the intended exfoliation!) and do what they promise.  I use them weekly in conjunction with using Retin-A every night.  At the driest/coldest part of winter, I back of these, but other than that, I just keep them a part of my routine!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have used it for several years and I love the results</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I ordered this back in October, but I only just realized that this shipper sent me the Original Formula instead of the Extra Strength Formula. The boxes look exactly the same except for the one line of RED TYPE in lower caps that says, &amp;#34;extra strength formula,&amp;#34; which is why I didn&#x27;t notice all this time. And I only noticed because on a whim I decided to read the directions and it said this version was for people who are trying the peel for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They only give you a month for returns so you better double-check your order! I bought 2 boxes worth too! What a rip off! I&#x27;m so upset.</li>
            <li> I broke out with hormonal acne for the first time about two years ago. I was struggling with it until suddenly my entire forehead broke out in tiny little bumps all over. It looked disgusting. I went to sephora and the skin care lady said how my pores were congested and I need to clear them out. She gave me two packets of these as a sample to try.First day I noticed a smoother appearance in my skin. Second day the little bumps had decreased in number and my face was looking brighter and smoother. I bought the 15 pack(30day use the way I use them).  I CUT THEM IN HALF and store the halves I don&#x27;t use in ziploc bags so I could save a heap of money. I can&#x27;t wait to see my results after 30 days. My face is already looking less oily with smaller pores.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing!!!  It&#x27;s the only thing you will need besides a moisturizer and sunscreen.  It does every thing. Your skin will glow and feel soft and smooth. You can even go make up free with confidence. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> fantastic. I have used these for a year about 3 times per week. Keeps my skin clear and glowing. highly recommended to add to your skin care regimen.</li>
