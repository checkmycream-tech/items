            <li>Hey, this stuff is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This product however I stumbled upon at the pharmacy and it works very quickly and very cleanly.</li>
            <li>I buy this because when I have dental work, or any kind of problem inside my mouth, this heals it so fast.</li>
            <li>This is a Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Gly-Oxide is so easy to apply and keeps the gums in such good health.  </li>
            <li>However, this price was unbelievable, the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen for this and of course Amazon beats EVERYONE&#x27;S PRICE..........</li>
            <li>This product is excellent based on past experiences but this one was dated to use by March 2013 which is unsatisfactory.  </li>
            <li>This product seemed to accelerate the healing significantly.</li>
            <li>Just swish it around and let it clean out the gums, then spit it out and rinse mouth with water.  </li>
            <li>cvs stopped carrying this product, found it here, most dont even know what its for, so i will tell, it will help keep your teeth white and your gums healthy.</li>
            <li>A COUPLE OF DROPS MIXES WITH YOUR SALIVA AND FOAMS UP QUICKLY</li>
            <li>but it really takes the pain and the infection away very quickly.     </li>
            <li>worth every penny....</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>its fun to watch it start to froth on my tongue and the barbell (its oral peroxide) &lt;</li>
            <li>but I feel it is worth it.</li>
            <li>starts healing right away.</li>
            <li>On the first day, the pain went from severe to tolerable.</li>
            <li>Several years ago a skilled dental hygienist recommended this cleanser to soothe &amp; cleanse oral tissue after I had a dental procedure.  </li>
            <li>I do not like being told to use an exact number of words in my review</li>
            <li>AND REALLY GIVES A FRESH FEELING IN YOUR MOUTH.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with mouth ulcers or canker sores my whole life.</li>
            <li>I also dont drink much water...</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>Has always been very helpful with mouth problems</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE WHAT THIS PRODUCT DOES.  </li>
            <li>May burn at first, but worth the initial discomfortant.</li>
            <li>buy in bulk whenever I find a decent price.</li>
            <li>A gentle non irritating product that helps to keep gums of the mouth in good condition.</li>
            <li>so I will spit a little bit of it out but make sure there is some still coating the irritation.</li>
            <li>up, no icky morning breath.</li>
            <li>I was in serious pain and had tried lots of different home remedies without any good results.</li>
            <li>I recently found CANKER SORE COVERS which work very well</li>
            <li>Im like WOW</li>
            <li>I uses a syringe to get it between my teeth where an infected pocket had developed.</li>
            <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t have to use it but the service and product were completely as described.  </li>
            <li>This item being (dated) was old and unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li>It does foam up considerably</li>
            <li>I developed some blisters inside my mouth from the use of a dental snore guard.  </li>
            <li>Now, two weeks later, I find I can live a normal life, pain free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied this liquid directly to the site and then intermittently rinsed with several drops and it completely stopped the development.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Since you dont use much each time the 2.0 oz is probably enough for a month of constant 2x a day use.</li>
            <li>It clears up any mouth irritations and is great for controlling bad breath.  </li>
            <li>the sore is clearly healing and the pain hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>I put this on at night and by the next morning the pain had left completely!.</li>

            <li> and I highly recommend, but they get a bit messy.</li>
            <li> My dentist plans to do a root canal, post and cap, but in the mean time he put me on a strong antibiotic to heal the infected tooth, and then to place a temporary filling in the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temporary filling worked just a few weeks before sensitivity and pain returned.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no gum bleeding at my last check up either.  </li>
            <li> I lost a filling a while back, and this soon after led to pain, ear ache, and other complications associated with an exposed nerve.</li>
            <li> I know my mouth wqas DRY after my piercing.</li>
            <li> After a few times the infection left and has not come back.</li>
            <li> Despite 30 years experience, they are still as painful, although now I do tolerate them a lot more.</li>
            <li> It felt like it was past the point of no return and would definitely be forming.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years on check bites or any other mouth issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You know how sometimes after you brush in the morning, if you dont eat anything after that your mouth tastes and or smells a bit odd?</li>
            <li> The ingredient is cerbamide peroxide, it has a little sting upon application</li>
            <li> One application seems to destroy whatever is ailing my gums.  </li>
            <li> This has always been my secret defense from cavities, I use it as a supplement to my regular brushing and flossing, I have not had a cavity in years.  </li>
            <li> harsh on the tongue &amp; gets thick consistency while swishing it around</li>
            <li> Had a small cut on my gum, tried every rinse and it was still there.</li>
            <li> Generally when tired, run down, stressed or from biting or cutting my tongue, mouth or lips!</li>
            <li> Have serious dental issues.  </li>
            <li> When I had an inflammed and infected gum at the base of a molar,my dentist recommended glyoxide for antisepsis and debridement(in case of trapped food particle)combined with salt water soaks for swelling.</li>
            <li> Expensive,</li>
            <li> Quite expensive at Walgreens</li>
            <li> As soon as I start getting a cold sore, I start using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this for anyone who gets cold sores or mouth sores.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all, it does freshen my breath.</li>
            <li> Painful, too.  </li>
            <li> They were very painful.  </li>
            <li> I could feel it was going to develop in to a nasty sore and in a very painful area.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Have been using this product for years, works great.  I just can&#x27;t find the 2 oz. bottle locally.  It clears up any mouth irritations and is great for controlling bad breath.  Will purchase again and again.  THANK-YOU!</li>
            <li> Good value and good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with mouth ulcers or canker sores my whole life. Generally when tired, run down, stressed or from biting or cutting my tongue, mouth or lips! Despite 30 years experience, they are still as painful, although now I do tolerate them a lot more. I&#x27;ve recently had a bout of canker sores from doing double shifts at work and not getting enough R&amp;R! So I&#x27;ve been quite aggressive in trying to find a product. I recently found CANKER SORE COVERS which work very well and I highly recommend, but they get a bit messy. This product however I stumbled upon at the pharmacy and it works very quickly and very cleanly. The ingredient is cerbamide peroxide, it has a little sting upon application but it really takes the pain and the infection away very quickly.     I used it on a developing sore from biting the back of my tongue. I could feel it was going to develop in to a nasty sore and in a very painful area. It felt like it was past the point of no return and would definitely be forming. I applied this liquid directly to the site and then intermittently rinsed with several drops and it completely stopped the development. I applied it for two days and by the end of the second day there was no evidence or feeling of a sore!     Great! Buy this!</li>
            <li> I buy this because when I have dental work, or any kind of problem inside my mouth, this heals it so fast. This is a Fantastic product. However, this price was unbelievable, the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen for this and of course Amazon beats EVERYONE&#x27;S PRICE..........Thank You.</li>
            <li> Works so well, good size bottle, good value</li>
            <li> cvs stopped carrying this product, found it here, most dont even know what its for, so i will tell, it will help keep your teeth white and your gums healthy. worth every penny....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years.  It is the best antiseptic for any type of sore in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I got this after suffering for five days with a canker sore that just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I was in serious pain and had tried lots of different home remedies without any good results. I put this on at night and by the next morning the pain had left completely!. It is the night of day two and the sore is clearly healing and the pain hasn&#x27;t come back. Keep this in your dorm or house if you ever get canker sores. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Hey, this stuff is pretty good. &lt;br /&gt;I started using it because I just got a tongue piercing... &lt;br /&gt;:). It doesn&#x27;t taste bad at all, it does freshen my breath. &lt;br /&gt;AND! After putting a bit on the tooth brush, then adding toothpaste and brushing both my teeth AND my tongue with it, its amazing.  &lt;br /&gt;Wake up, no icky morning breath. &lt;br /&gt;You know how sometimes after you brush in the morning, if you dont eat anything after that your mouth tastes and or smells a bit odd? &lt;br /&gt;That doesnt happen while Im using this stuff. &lt;br /&gt;I paid 6$plus tax for mine in a riteaid type place. A friend of mine paid 4$ for hers in NYC. I see the price for it here, and Im like WOW thats alot. &lt;br /&gt;Since you dont use much each time the 2.0 oz is probably enough for a month of constant 2x a day use. &lt;br /&gt;Also..its fun to watch it start to froth on my tongue and the barbell (its oral peroxide) &lt;br /&gt;Oh, also try biotene if you like this product. I know my mouth wqas DRY after my piercing. I also dont drink much water...</li>
            <li> This product is great for any gum infections, have always used it.</li>
            <li> I uses a syringe to get it between my teeth where an infected pocket had developed. After a few times the infection left and has not come back.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for mouth sores or irritation.</li>
            <li> When I had an inflammed and infected gum at the base of a molar,my dentist recommended glyoxide for antisepsis and debridement(in case of trapped food particle)combined with salt water soaks for swelling.This combination resulted in a rapid cure.</li>
            <li> I lost a filling a while back, and this soon after led to pain, ear ache, and other complications associated with an exposed nerve. My dentist plans to do a root canal, post and cap, but in the mean time he put me on a strong antibiotic to heal the infected tooth, and then to place a temporary filling in the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temporary filling worked just a few weeks before sensitivity and pain returned. Which was when I tried Gly-Oxide. On the first day, the pain went from severe to tolerable. By day 2, the pain was gone. And since then, I have used Gly-Oxide once each night to help prevent another infected tooth/nerve. Now, two weeks later, I find I can live a normal life, pain free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A good product, which is very effective.</li>
            <li> Gly-Oxide is so easy to apply and keeps the gums in such good health.  I only use this whenever my gum feels irritated, puffy or sore around a tooth.  One application seems to destroy whatever is ailing my gums.  Just swish it around and let it clean out the gums, then spit it out and rinse mouth with water.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve put a couple of drops of this on my toothbrush before every brushing, and it seems to help me avoid cavities and gum problems, plus it tastes okay and freshens my breath. Terrific seller too!</li>
            <li> been using product for years--good price</li>
            <li> Gly-Oxide was suggested for my gum health.  Good value.  Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Several years ago a skilled dental hygienist recommended this cleanser to soothe &amp; cleanse oral tissue after I had a dental procedure.  I always keep it on hand &amp; use it when I experience any tissue irritation.  It works very well for me.  Users should not expect a minty aftertaste like a flavored mouthwash, but I don&#x27;t find the taste objectionable.</li>
            <li> harsh on the tongue &amp; gets thick consistency while swishing it around</li>
            <li> Has always been very helpful with mouth problems</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff when her mouth gets inflamed and it is the best price here.</li>
            <li> I have been using GlyOxide for thirty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And buy in bulk whenever I find a decent price.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t have to use it but the service and product were completely as described.  The price was fair.</li>
            <li> Great oral rinse.  Have serious dental issues.  This buys me time to see dentist.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent based on past experiences but this one was dated to use by March 2013 which is unsatisfactory.  This item being (dated) was old and unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really works. As soon as I start getting a cold sore, I start using this.&lt;br /&gt;It starts healing right away. This also works when you get a sore inside your mouth. I just&lt;br /&gt;put a dab of it on the sore, it helps heal it and also eliminates the pain. I found this product&lt;br /&gt;about 20 years again, I have to order it online now, no one seems to carry in stores now.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who gets cold sores or mouth sores.</li>
            <li> Works great on canker sores, if you bite your lip or cheek accidentally, or even sore, irritated gums. The taste is pleasant. Truly, within a day your mouth will feel better. It does foam up considerably so I will spit a little bit of it out but make sure there is some still coating the irritation. This does not contain a pain reliever.</li>
            <li> A gentle non irritating product that helps to keep gums of the mouth in good condition. Recommend for rinses as needed.</li>
            <li> This has always been my secret defense from cavities, I use it as a supplement to my regular brushing and flossing, I have not had a cavity in years.  Expensive, but I feel it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The product provided  the solution to a dental problem that I had and works well.  It was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I developed some blisters inside my mouth from the use of a dental snore guard.  They were very painful.  This product seemed to accelerate the healing significantly.</li>
            <li> I like it. It helps get rid of sores and freshens my mouth. Quite expensive at Walgreens so will have to try finding a better source.</li>
            <li> If you want to stop bleeding gums after flossing.  I do not like being told to use an exact number of words in my review</li>
            <li> Could nit find this must have renedy in my local drugstore. Was so happy to find on amazon.  Immediately provides comfort to sores inside the mouth. Swish around,  feel the healing as it soothes and eliminates the pain. May burn at first, but worth the initial discomfortant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years on check bites or any other mouth issue.  It works great.  Speeds up healing.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE WHAT THIS PRODUCT DOES.  WHEN YOUR GUMS ARE SORE AND INFLAMED OR YOU JUST WANT GOOD ORAL HYGIENE THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT TO DO THAT AND MORE FOR YOU MOUTH.  A COUPLE OF DROPS MIXES WITH YOUR SALIVA AND FOAMS UP QUICKLY AND REALLY GIVES A FRESH FEELING IN YOUR MOUTH.</li>
            <li> Had a small cut on my gum, tried every rinse and it was still there. Painful, too.  Found this and within 1 day, I was healed up. I now use it on my toothbrush every night - I had absolutely no gum bleeding at my last check up either.  I won&#x27;t be without this. Great product.</li>
