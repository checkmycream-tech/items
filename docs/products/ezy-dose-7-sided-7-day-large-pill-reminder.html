            <li>Suited my needs perfectly</li>

            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel.</li>
            <li>Great item, lots of room for pills and compact size.  </li>
            <li>This pill container is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great pill holder at a great price.</li>
            <li>Great design.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been working out very nicely for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, good product for good price.</li>
            <li>Good Deal</li>
            <li>Good Deal</li>
            <li>Good Deal</li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;m usually not home for my afternoon dose, so this was the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERVIEW</li>
            <li>I was able to get them all in the pill case and it made it very easy to take all my meds with me without having a ton of pill bottles in my purse.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a larger pill holder and this one fits my horse pills perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I would purchase more if I needed them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need an extensive pill reminder, so this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two more so as to set my meds up for 3 weeks at a time..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a pill reminder for myself and I absolutely love the size and shape.</li>
            <li>I bought four of these pill containers for my many medications.  </li>
            <li>Works okay, good space for pills, but one wonders when there is so much space on top/sides why they weren&#x27;t printed with Sat/Sun/Tue/Thur instead of S/S/T/T</li>
            <li>The plastic hinges on the covers would probably break off fairly easy if any force was applied, but since you&#x27;re probably not planning on taking this into war with you, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits my fish oil supplements, which are HUGE.</li>
            <li>I have 10 pills of varying sizes that I take per day, and this comfortably holds all of them.</li>
            <li>Seems sturdy, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it lasts me many more months.</li>
            <li>If you need a very large one, this is it!  </li>
            <li>Although it is big, it fits perfectly in my purse, which is also big.</li>
            <li>and she is able to easily determine which container we are asking about and whether the pills have been taken for the specific day.  </li>
            <li>This one is nice as you can set it up for the week and know whether or not you have taken your daily pills.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty big pill minder, and I love it!.</li>
            <li>This one is the right size for my needs.</li>
            <li>They are very good with careful handling and the size is very roomy for about 10 different sized pills, including the huge calcium pill.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the same size as a DVD, fits all my pills, vitamins and supplements and you can toss it in the air and nothing will fly open.  </li>
            <li>Fits many big pills.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with this pill container.</li>
            <li>I prefer the 7-Day, 7-Sided Pill Reminder because it is more compact and can be stored flat or on its side.</li>
            <li>It holds many pills of various sizes and the shape is very convenient.</li>
            <li>The thing I like most about these pill organizers is that the lid to each compartment shuts tightly, doesn&#x27;t pop open on its own, BUT it is easy to open.  </li>
            <li>As a diabetic I have to bring my kit with me pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>easy to open/close each day and seems that it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered two of the large size organizer.  </li>
            <li>The 7 day large pill reminder by Ezy Dose does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Ezy Dose 7 Sided, 7 Day Large Pill Reminder]] and the [[ASIN:B001C4521A</li>
            <li>so I need to take about 15 pills a day, some of which are quite large.</li>
            <li>and I would imagine if you put too much wear and tear on the lid openings that they might eventually break.  </li>
            <li>While trying to get away from the straight cases, this case does the job and fits in places that the others dont..</li>
            <li>the whole lot begs for a pill reminder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really, both pill reminders work as advertised.</li>
            <li>7 Day Classic Pill Reminder Xtra Large]].</li>
            <li>If I needed both of them they would stack easily on top of each other.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is thick and sturdy, it opens easily and snaps shut securely.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, thick plastic not flimsy, tight close on each letter of the week.  </li>
            <li>I was specifically looking for a pill organizer that would fit large pills and vitamins and the compartments would stay closed</li>
            <li>I take several medications three times a day, and most mill minders only have up to two times a day.</li>
            <li>Decent, not too brittle (for what it is) plastic.</li>
            <li>I paid $6.54 for the Ezy Dose model (4 1/2\\&quot; diameter) and $4.82 for the 7 Day Classic model (7 1/4\\&quot; L X 1 1/2\\</li>
            <li>wife uses the 7 Day Classic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although each individual compartment is larger, the circular arrangement means that the overall box still isn&#x27;t that huge and I can easily fit it into a travel kit.</li>
            <li>It is large enough to fit several &#x27;horse-pill&#x27; vitamins, along with any normal sized meds, etc.</li>
            <li>I came right back to Amazon and bought it again.  </li>
            <li>But as I fine-tuned my daily vitamin and supplement regimen, I quickly outgrew what would fit into the little compartments.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted, but it was GIANT.  </li>
            <li>This pill case fills that need for someone who takes a lot of pills to stay alive.</li>
            <li>Bigger than I thought but totally useful if you have big vitamins to dispense daily.  </li>
            <li>individual compartments are large enough to handle pills of every size I take, including my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I had been needing a larger pill organizer forever, but all of the ones that have big enough compartments were so long they wouldn&#x27;t fit in my kit.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in my purse or on the vanity.  </li>
            <li>I will try not to bend these back too far.  </li>
            <li>Had it for a few weeks, and what was advertised was exactly what I&#x27;ve received.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are the perfect size for all my mother&#x27;s pills.  The shape is different than the other one she uses for night pills. We call her to see if she has taken her pills and she is able to easily determine which container we are asking about and whether the pills have been taken for the specific day.  Her short term memory is failing.</li>
            <li> When you get to the point that you have to take multiple pills each day, you need an organizer. This one is nice as you can set it up for the week and know whether or not you have taken your daily pills. They come in different sizes. This one is the right size for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a larger pill holder and this one fits my horse pills perfectly.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Perfect size, thick plastic not flimsy, tight close on each letter of the week.  I would purchase more if I needed them.</li>
            <li> Fits many big pills. No problem with the lids. Great for travel.</li>
            <li> Great item, lots of room for pills and compact size.  The last container I purchased from a different vendor was too big and hard to store.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty big pill minder, and I love it!. Although it is big, it fits perfectly in my purse, which is also big. It fits my fish oil supplements, which are HUGE. I take several medications three times a day, and most mill minders only have up to two times a day. Plus, I&#x27;m usually not home for my afternoon dose, so this was the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Convenient&lt;br /&gt;Great size&lt;br /&gt;Attractive purple/blue color&lt;br /&gt;Stays closed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;None that I can think of</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a pill reminder I bought from Target where &#x27;Thursday&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t say closed.  I was specifically looking for a pill organizer that would fit large pills and vitamins and the compartments would stay closed and this one is it.  It&#x27;s about the same size as a DVD, fits all my pills, vitamins and supplements and you can toss it in the air and nothing will fly open.  The compartments snap tightly shut and I would imagine if you put too much wear and tear on the lid openings that they might eventually break.  I will try not to bend these back too far.  Otherwise this is just what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: My nephew was at my apartment and lost this pill reminder.  I came right back to Amazon and bought it again.  It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a daily pill box with a generous amount of room for each day, then look no further - this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well built, easy to open/close each day and seems that it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d purchased an initial daily pill box a few months ago that seemed to be the standard size (it had all days of the week in a horizontal line).  But as I fine-tuned my daily vitamin and supplement regimen, I quickly outgrew what would fit into the little compartments.  It was hard to tell from the picture and reviews, but this one looked larger - and I was pleasantly surprised to see just how much larger each compartment is.  I can probably hold at least twice, and possibly triple, the number of pills in this than I could in my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although each individual compartment is larger, the circular arrangement means that the overall box still isn&#x27;t that huge and I can easily fit it into a travel kit.</li>
            <li> This pill container is great. I have 10 pills of varying sizes that I take per day, and this comfortably holds all of them. The plastic is thick and sturdy, it opens easily and snaps shut securely. I like the shape, and having it be in the purple color is fun -- no more boring clear or white pill containers, huzzah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great pill holder at a great price.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few weeks, and what was advertised was exactly what I&#x27;ve received. Seems sturdy, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it lasts me many more months.</li>
            <li> I had been needing a larger pill organizer forever, but all of the ones that have big enough compartments were so long they wouldn&#x27;t fit in my kit. As a diabetic I have to bring my kit with me pretty much everywhere I go so mobility is key. This pill case fills that need for someone who takes a lot of pills to stay alive.</li>
            <li> A review from Mrs. L . . .  There comes a day in everyone&#x27;s life when you think . . .did I remember to take my vitamen today?  Or that headache is still there. I thought I took a tylenol, but did I?  I didn&#x27;t need an extensive pill reminder, so this is perfect.  Now, that being said, if I needed an extensive pill reminder, I would order two or three of these and label the different times on the side of the pill box.  I ordered two of the large size organizer.  One to use and another as a backup. If I needed both of them they would stack easily on top of each other.  They also store upright on their side.  Small enough to fit in my purse or on the vanity.  The thing I like most about these pill organizers is that the lid to each compartment shuts tightly, doesn&#x27;t pop open on its own, BUT it is easy to open.  Using something like a permanent Sharpie marker, notes, dates, your name and dosages could be written on the bottom, side or inside lid of the seven compartments.  I would imagine that this would be helpful to know if someone was assisting apatient or elderly parent or neighbor organize their medications.</li>
            <li> The 7 day large pill reminder by Ezy Dose does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It is large enough to fit several &#x27;horse-pill&#x27; vitamins, along with any normal sized meds, etc. The plastic hinges on the covers would probably break off fairly easy if any force was applied, but since you&#x27;re probably not planning on taking this into war with you, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good product for good price.</li>
            <li> Works okay, good space for pills, but one wonders when there is so much space on top/sides why they weren&#x27;t printed with Sat/Sun/Tue/Thur instead of S/S/T/T</li>
            <li> Suited my needs perfectly</li>
            <li> Decent, not too brittle (for what it is) plastic. It&#x27;s almost 5 inches across, the long side of each compartment is 1 7/8&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, . While trying to get away from the straight cases, this case does the job and fits in places that the others dont.. I ordered two more so as to set my meds up for 3 weeks at a time..</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace a pill reminder that I had that looked like this, so I ordered.  It is exactly what I wanted, but it was GIANT.  I returned and ordered the medium size, which is ample for the several pills that I use.  If you need a very large one, this is it!  Great design.</li>
            <li> Good Deal and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. Good Deal and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. Good Deal and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Compact, but larger than necessary. Would prefer if it was slightly smaller, especially for traveling. Overall, I am satisfied with this pill container.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a pill reminder for myself and I absolutely love the size and shape. It holds many pills of various sizes and the shape is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I take a larger sized vitamin and it fits with the other 5-6 supplements I take. I had the medium size and it just wasn&#x27;t big enough. I looked at several but for refilling it, I like the circle shape.</li>
            <li> I bought four of these pill containers for my many medications.  Every four weeks I refill and it&#x27;s been working out very nicely for me.  They are inexpensive and the covers snap tight enough to keep level although I would not trust the seal if the container was jostled upside down.  They are very good with careful handling and the size is very roomy for about 10 different sized pills, including the huge calcium pill.  A very good purchase which I use every day without any problems.</li>
            <li> Age has its milestones: driver&#x27;s license at 16; a round at the bar at 21; a colonoscopy at 40. Sometime thereafter comes the age when taking a multivitamin, a supplement, another red, another blue...the whole lot begs for a pill reminder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two. The [[ASIN:B001THT4AK Ezy Dose 7 Sided, 7 Day Large Pill Reminder]] and the [[ASIN:B001C4521A 7 Day Classic Pill Reminder Xtra Large]]. I paid $6.54 for the Ezy Dose model (4 1/2\\&quot; diameter) and $4.82 for the 7 Day Classic model (7 1/4\\&quot; L X 1 1/2\\&quot; W X 5/8\\&quot; deep).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both pill reminders come with a letter atop each tight-fitting lid that designates a day of the week. The 7-Day, 7-Sided Pill Reminder also comes with braille markings for the vision impaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The individual compartments are large enough to handle pills of every size I take, including my [[ASIN:B009HEZ03W Eklund Essential Omega - Norwegian Fish Oil]] and [[ASIN:B0009U84Z4 NOW Foods Folic Acid]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses the 7 Day Classic. I prefer the 7-Day, 7-Sided Pill Reminder because it is more compact and can be stored flat or on its side. Really, both pill reminders work as advertised. Cost and storage size are the only two differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Five stars</li>
            <li> I have Crohn&#x27;s Disease and severe vitamin deficiencies so I need to take about 15 pills a day, some of which are quite large. I was able to get them all in the pill case and it made it very easy to take all my meds with me without having a ton of pill bottles in my purse.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought but totally useful if you have big vitamins to dispense daily.  I like it well enough.</li>
