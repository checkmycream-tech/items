            <li> Love the product, as usual.  It took a while to receive, but got it nonetheless. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Great consistency. I was a little worried when I first got it, but it works perfectly. I use it over lip balm (burts bees ultrasensitive) with a lipliner.</li>
            <li> This is great lipstick!  It stays well and doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  I love this color too!  I can pull it off for evening but it works well for day wear too since it&#x27;s not too flashy.</li>
