            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Truly amazing product!</li>
            <li>Additionally,  you can mix up a lovely mask which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love my serums and this is a wonderful addition.</li>
            <li>scent is pleasant</li>
            <li>This is the best serum, i liked it, it makes my skin so smooth and supple!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nourishing and feels really good when you put it on your skin</li>
            <li>but as we enter our 30s, we thought it would be a good idea to begin using serums (hyaluronic and vitamin C) as part of our regimen (glycolic acid peels) to take care of our skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re seeking Vitamin C serum, this is a good one to get.</li>
            <li>Good for anti-aging.</li>
            <li>and I know it will be superior.  </li>
            <li>For me, I have to apply a good moisturizer after I apply the serum.</li>
            <li>But the price is good here.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s that good).</li>
            <li>Abiding Youth Best Organic 20% Vitamin C Serum is a wonderful, light, yet powerful serum with anti-aging properties.</li>

            <li>At first I was hesitate to purchase this.</li>
            <li>First time using a serum</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown in photos.</li>
            <li>Be aware though -</li>
            <li>or I put the serum on first and my cream after.</li>
            <li>I have only been using for about 2 weeks and my skin feels and looks a bit better.</li>
            <li>Yay this exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and it was not a maybe, they definitely were looking better.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>but this just sinks into your skin so nicely</li>
            <li>First impressions&lt;</li>
            <li>My face is already looking more youthful after only 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It is not gritty and goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>it does a particularly good job on the back of your hands at turning back the clock.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite serum I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>After trying so many different kinds and spending so much money, it still didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum is a really important step in any skincare routine because it will help fade fine lines &amp; wrinkles, age spots, sun spots and other skin pigmentations, including pesky Melasma.  </li>
            <li>My face is so soft and smooth and by morning it feels nice and tight.  </li>
            <li>so I am sure it will also a long time.</li>
            <li>Very thorough help and very prompt replies!</li>
            <li>I must say my skin looks much brighter and the texture of my skin much smoother!</li>
            <li>knew this stuff was the real deal when I first got it, bc</li>
            <li>Easy way to take an essential vitamin</li>
            <li>; I wanted to love this product but the lack of results and the strange smell are just too much for me.</li>
            <li>have (Combo acne prone aging skin with large clogged pores) for reference.</li>
            <li>This is so hydrating and really brightens my face.</li>
            <li>This is so hydrating and really brightens my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this serum my skin absorbs this very well.</li>
            <li>i really dont see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Gives me a 24 hour glow &amp; really boosts my makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like it combined with my rosehip seed oil for added moisture.</li>
            <li>I apply it twice a day and my skin instantly feels smooth and sofe.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is just really thirsty &amp; this is what it needs.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Its very light-weight.</li>
            <li>and they really do stand by their product.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>I keep a supply ready</li>
            <li>very liquid formula that works very well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>choosing a Vitamin C Serum just make sure you check the ingredients and that it only contains all natural and/or organic ingredients like this one from Abiding Youth.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>Love it, my dark circle are looking lighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I have sensitive skin, I used it at night first then went to twice a day on day 3.</li>
            <li>was surprised to see the advertised  sale price was very reasonable for this high quality serum.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of using this particular serum, I have to say...</li>
            <li>I love oily skin and it seems kinda weird that I love to add oil to my skin</li>
            <li>I was glad I got to review this product for a small discount because I really like it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly unpleasant but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;good.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Product is high quality.</li>
            <li>but my face feels so much better, soft, not dry, starting to see some balance.  </li>
            <li>Slight tightening of skin while serum dries is to be expected &amp; is rather pleasant.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed much</li>
            <li>I really like this serum so far.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda watery, but absorbs fast and leaves my face feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved vitamin C serums, but they were always so insanely expensive and generally only available from dermatologists or boutique/spa brands.</li>
            <li>I have just not been using this long enough to know if I love it, but I do think it is working.  </li>
            <li>Sinks right in, non irritating, a great layer under moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Only put a little on and it will do it&#x27;s Magic!</li>
            <li>so far I give this produce a high, high remark.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin, and very very sensitive (I am prone to welting up when using some products).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little early to see any results but after about 1 week of use, our complexion appears more even and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>I am also thrilled with the fact that you only need a little bit of the product.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try out something new and bought this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Smear this on your face, and live forever~</li>
            <li>Also, the serum has a very strong odor which is hard to describe.</li>
            <li>I do have adult acne (nothing major), and the serum doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it, which I love because I used this other vitamin C serum before</li>
            <li>It has helped me with acne, discoloration and pigmentation, and highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really wish it felt exceptional, but it absorbs really quick and does not feel bad at all....</li>
            <li>Pretty simple routine</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m here buying my second bottle, and I&#x27;m not even out of my first bottle yet.</li>
            <li>I have used several anti aging products in the past and I must say that the Vitamin C Serum is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and bouts with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>It has made my face so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>This serum was on the watery side, so I found it easier to drop directly onto my face.  </li>
            <li>After about two weeks of using it once a day in the morning after showering, my skin looks brighter, sun spots are lighter and my skin texture has smoothed out considerably.  </li>
            <li>This was a personal touch that was appreciated.</li>
            <li>My wife gave it a try absolutely loves it, made her skin look younger</li>
            <li>Product as far as I had</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been trying to preemptively tackle wrinkles before they start.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to give it a few weeks of daily use before expecting to see results.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up the giant zit (you know, the kind that lasts at least a week) was gone.</li>
            <li>Allow skin to air dry first.</li>
            <li>I see less apparent fine lines, especially around my eye area.</li>
            <li>and just started using the product, its consistency is different from others I have used, looking forward to this new product.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t wear any make up and clean and moisturize my facial and neck skin with organic unrefined coconut oil or almond oil; but have really noticed my age on my face lately, sun spots, ruddiness, etc...  </li>
            <li>My skin is already very soft with only two weeks using it.</li>
            <li>I also have combination skin and need major moisture in my cheeks but need oil control in my forehead.  </li>
            <li>and I believe, has helped with with my occasional adult acne.</li>
            <li>So far, after 4 weeks of use, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is brighter, clearer and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>It came with fast shipping as expected.</li>
            <li>Ferulic acid is the ingredient that helps fade dark spots, but it also gives serums a fragrance that reminds some people of bacon or hot dogs.  </li>
            <li>I am in my mid thirties and like any other woman, I am very concerned about my skin.</li>
            <li>As the years creep up (i&#x27;m 37 yrs old), I have been noticing that my skin is starting to look more dull and uneven.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of this blend as well, you get not only a high level of vitamin C, but a ton of other wonder ingredients to boost it&#x27;s efficacy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle and will last forever, you only need a few drops.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Truly amazing product!</li>
            <li> Additionally,  you can mix up a lovely mask which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love my serums and this is a wonderful addition.</li>
            <li> scent is pleasant</li>
            <li> This is the best serum, i liked it, it makes my skin so smooth and supple!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nourishing and feels really good when you put it on your skin</li>
            <li> but as we enter our 30s, we thought it would be a good idea to begin using serums (hyaluronic and vitamin C) as part of our regimen (glycolic acid peels) to take care of our skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re seeking Vitamin C serum, this is a good one to get.</li>
            <li> Good for anti-aging.</li>
            <li> and I know it will be superior.  </li>
            <li> For me, I have to apply a good moisturizer after I apply the serum.</li>
            <li> But the price is good here.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s that good).</li>
            <li> Abiding Youth Best Organic 20% Vitamin C Serum is a wonderful, light, yet powerful serum with anti-aging properties.</li>

            <li> so your makeup goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that the serum is Organic, (Organic Vitamin C, Organic Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Jojoba Oil).  </li>
            <li> This serum is really nice.</li>

            <li> I mostly just felt like my forehead ones, and across the top of my nose between my eyes when I first woke up, were the ones that bothered me most</li>
            <li> No burning, not greasy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It easy to apply day &amp; night.</li>

            <li> When I returned home and had time to email them, they replaced the bottle right away AND refunded me my money.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> my skin is loving me back since the first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slight more viscous than water,  so it slides on easily and dries quickly.  </li>

            <li> I would recommend this product to my friends and family because it really works!  </li>
            <li> At first I was hesitate to purchase this.</li>
            <li> First time using a serum</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown in photos.</li>
            <li> Be aware though -</li>
            <li> or I put the serum on first and my cream after.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for about 2 weeks and my skin feels and looks a bit better.</li>
            <li> Yay this exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> and it was not a maybe, they definitely were looking better.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> but this just sinks into your skin so nicely</li>
            <li> First impressions&lt;</li>
            <li> My face is already looking more youthful after only 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It is not gritty and goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> it does a particularly good job on the back of your hands at turning back the clock.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite serum I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> After trying so many different kinds and spending so much money, it still didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum is a really important step in any skincare routine because it will help fade fine lines &amp; wrinkles, age spots, sun spots and other skin pigmentations, including pesky Melasma.  </li>
            <li> My face is so soft and smooth and by morning it feels nice and tight.  </li>
            <li> so I am sure it will also a long time.</li>
            <li> Very thorough help and very prompt replies!</li>
            <li> I must say my skin looks much brighter and the texture of my skin much smoother!</li>
            <li> knew this stuff was the real deal when I first got it, bc</li>
            <li> Easy way to take an essential vitamin</li>
            <li> ; I wanted to love this product but the lack of results and the strange smell are just too much for me.</li>
            <li> have (Combo acne prone aging skin with large clogged pores) for reference.</li>
            <li> This is so hydrating and really brightens my face.</li>
            <li> This is so hydrating and really brightens my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this serum my skin absorbs this very well.</li>
            <li> i really dont see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Gives me a 24 hour glow &amp; really boosts my makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like it combined with my rosehip seed oil for added moisture.</li>
            <li> I apply it twice a day and my skin instantly feels smooth and sofe.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just really thirsty &amp; this is what it needs.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Its very light-weight.</li>
            <li> and they really do stand by their product.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I keep a supply ready</li>
            <li> very liquid formula that works very well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> choosing a Vitamin C Serum just make sure you check the ingredients and that it only contains all natural and/or organic ingredients like this one from Abiding Youth.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> Love it, my dark circle are looking lighter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I have sensitive skin, I used it at night first then went to twice a day on day 3.</li>
            <li> was surprised to see the advertised  sale price was very reasonable for this high quality serum.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using this particular serum, I have to say...</li>
            <li> I love oily skin and it seems kinda weird that I love to add oil to my skin</li>
            <li> I was glad I got to review this product for a small discount because I really like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly unpleasant but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;good.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product is high quality.</li>
            <li> but my face feels so much better, soft, not dry, starting to see some balance.  </li>
            <li> Slight tightening of skin while serum dries is to be expected &amp; is rather pleasant.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed much</li>
            <li> I really like this serum so far.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda watery, but absorbs fast and leaves my face feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved vitamin C serums, but they were always so insanely expensive and generally only available from dermatologists or boutique/spa brands.</li>
            <li> I have just not been using this long enough to know if I love it, but I do think it is working.  </li>
            <li> Sinks right in, non irritating, a great layer under moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Only put a little on and it will do it&#x27;s Magic!</li>
            <li> so far I give this produce a high, high remark.  </li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin, and very very sensitive (I am prone to welting up when using some products).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little early to see any results but after about 1 week of use, our complexion appears more even and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I am also thrilled with the fact that you only need a little bit of the product.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try out something new and bought this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Smear this on your face, and live forever~</li>
            <li> Also, the serum has a very strong odor which is hard to describe.</li>
            <li> I do have adult acne (nothing major), and the serum doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it, which I love because I used this other vitamin C serum before</li>
            <li> It has helped me with acne, discoloration and pigmentation, and highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really wish it felt exceptional, but it absorbs really quick and does not feel bad at all....</li>
            <li> Pretty simple routine</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m here buying my second bottle, and I&#x27;m not even out of my first bottle yet.</li>
            <li> I have used several anti aging products in the past and I must say that the Vitamin C Serum is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and bouts with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> It has made my face so soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> This serum was on the watery side, so I found it easier to drop directly onto my face.  </li>
            <li> After about two weeks of using it once a day in the morning after showering, my skin looks brighter, sun spots are lighter and my skin texture has smoothed out considerably.  </li>
            <li> This was a personal touch that was appreciated.</li>
            <li> My wife gave it a try absolutely loves it, made her skin look younger</li>
            <li> Product as far as I had</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been trying to preemptively tackle wrinkles before they start.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to give it a few weeks of daily use before expecting to see results.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up the giant zit (you know, the kind that lasts at least a week) was gone.</li>
            <li> Allow skin to air dry first.</li>
            <li> I see less apparent fine lines, especially around my eye area.</li>
            <li> and just started using the product, its consistency is different from others I have used, looking forward to this new product.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t wear any make up and clean and moisturize my facial and neck skin with organic unrefined coconut oil or almond oil; but have really noticed my age on my face lately, sun spots, ruddiness, etc...  </li>
            <li> My skin is already very soft with only two weeks using it.</li>
            <li> I also have combination skin and need major moisture in my cheeks but need oil control in my forehead.  </li>
            <li> and I believe, has helped with with my occasional adult acne.</li>
            <li> So far, after 4 weeks of use, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is brighter, clearer and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> It came with fast shipping as expected.</li>
            <li> Ferulic acid is the ingredient that helps fade dark spots, but it also gives serums a fragrance that reminds some people of bacon or hot dogs.  </li>
            <li> I am in my mid thirties and like any other woman, I am very concerned about my skin.</li>
            <li> As the years creep up (i&#x27;m 37 yrs old), I have been noticing that my skin is starting to look more dull and uneven.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this blend as well, you get not only a high level of vitamin C, but a ton of other wonder ingredients to boost it&#x27;s efficacy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bottle and will last forever, you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had much compliments lately on my complexion, so I&#x27;m going to attribute it to the fact of this serum, only because it&#x27;s the only thing I have changed up in my facial routine.</li>
            <li> Also helped me troubleshoot a minor issue I had (made my face a bit red).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know if it truly works, but it does leave my skin feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> so I was thinking average, then I put off leaving a review and started noticing that my facial lines really were looking less severe.</li>
            <li> hands were wrinkled and a few drops later the lines were near gone!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is light weight, not greasy and smells of faint citrus.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been leery of the viewers comments never really believe their regular people as myself but that the comments are rigged.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use a lot at each application so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and my face became extremely dry, not to mention my history of rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I apply the serum and wait for it to dry, then apply my tinted moisturizer (for day) or apply my maracuja oil (at night) .</li>
            <li> If I can just be real for a minute: I&#x27;m shallow and clinging by a thread to my youth.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to jump up and down</li>
            <li> I noticed a tightening of my skin &amp; slight reduction of melasma after only a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I did go with a different seller this time, but it&#x27;s Prime shipping and same exact product, slightly less expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in Florida, my skin is very dry and sun damaged.</li>
            <li> did make me a little red</li>
            <li> My hands look younger and smoother and the skin is tighter while some of my heavy freckling is fading.</li>
            <li> It take only a few drops</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing what happens in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin seems brighter and some of my darker sun spots have lightened and old faint scars and sun spots are barely visible now!</li>
            <li> This bottle should last at least that long.  </li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My pores are tighter and less visible as well as any faint laugh lines around mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted, I have been using these serums in place of branded serums that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted, I have been using these serums in place of branded serums that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> , i am black and so very often products are developed for white skin, so let&#x27;s see how this one works, i also have dark spots which i hate,</li>
            <li> I have only been using it two weeks so hard to say, I did notice it has brightened my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> After applying it my face feels tighter, dark spots are lighter.</li>
            <li> Decreases dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Unlike other Vitamin C serums, it does not lose its potency after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks i can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Knocked over the bottle and spilled half of it,  </li>
            <li> It will not screw on tight, so over half of the product leaked out when I was traveling.</li>
            <li> I have dry and dull skin and was hoping for this serum to work miracles.</li>
            <li> This serum is silky (not as thick and gloppy) and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I bought it specifically for the little brown age spots on my cheeksand hands.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little tingling, but nothing distrancting.  </li>
            <li> serum is watery (not like other serums I have used which usually has a thicker consistency).</li>
            <li> I have tired countless products for my dry/oily face.  </li>
            <li> I however ended up with a few bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> I am 45 and battling wrinkles and uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin since using the product I have to say though the scent is unpleasant  !</li>
            <li> it brighter and less dull.</li>
            <li> and she sat down and ordered a bottle!!</li>
            <li> I have made Vitamin C serum in the past and it had always turned out grainy and stung my skin after applying.</li>
            <li> I have not had any breakouts from this product and it has helped with fading some of melasma caused by past acne.  </li>
            <li> I was a sun girl in my youth and thats hard to undo without a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Suspended in a concentrated base of pure vegan hyaluronic acid to plump skin cells and protect and restore.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> And my skin feels so firm!!</li>
            <li> Nothing-- and I mean nothing-- has worked at brightening my face, smoothing wrinkles, toning + tightening pores, exorcising face demons (hormonal acne), and evening out my skintone like this Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I seriously lovvvve this stuff.</li>
            <li> Seriously guys, this stuff is like the blood of virgins.</li>
            <li> She stands behind her product and emailed helpful tips on maximizing the results.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical about it</li>
            <li> The serum is very thin and watery (must serums I have used are thicker).</li>
            <li> did not look as bad....</li>
            <li> To say I was upset and disappointed is an understatement since I was traveling for over a week and didn&#x27;t have any Vitamin C serum to use!</li>
            <li> This product drys out your skin and makes your skin look worst.</li>
            <li> Protects you from the worst effects of aging.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My face is smooth and glowing.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading fantastic reviews. I bought it specifically for the little brown age spots on my cheeksand hands. I have to say,4days later,I see significant lightening  The fact that this serum also works on wrinkles is just bonus! I  love this. I use it 2x a day.In the morning after my shower and again at night after I remove the day from my face. Love it.  Will definitely be re ordering.</li>
            <li> Works well. You can even add your moisturizer with it. No burning, not greasy and easy to apply. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this  prooduct, until I started to use  but i think that is effective</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant improvement in my skin since using the product I have to say though the scent is unpleasant  ! It almost smells like campfire . It disappears quickly so I live with it because the benefit is worth it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved vitamin C serums, but they were always so insanely expensive and generally only available from dermatologists or boutique/spa brands. To be able to find a serum of this quality at such a low price is incredible. It&#x27;s a large bottle and will last forever, you only need a few drops. It&#x27;s nourishing and feels really good when you put it on your skin and I saw results almost immediately. Discolorations fade and the skin tightens- it does a particularly good job on the back of your hands at turning back the clock. My hands look younger and smoother and the skin is tighter while some of my heavy freckling is fading. I&#x27;m a big fan of this blend as well, you get not only a high level of vitamin C, but a ton of other wonder ingredients to boost it&#x27;s efficacy. This is a good serum to use in the mornings under your makeup to boost sun protection and the prevention of free radicals!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Just started using it, so no &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; yet - it absorbs quickly into the skin.  i hope it works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum is a really important step in any skincare routine because it will help fade fine lines &amp; wrinkles, age spots, sun spots and other skin pigmentations, including pesky Melasma.  It will also give you a more even skin tone and help provide a natural glow!&lt;br /&gt;When choosing a Vitamin C Serum just make sure you check the ingredients and that it only contains all natural and/or organic ingredients like this one from Abiding Youth.  The Vitamin C Serum from Abiding Youth contains 98% Natural and 72% Organic ingredients, is cruelty free and does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates.  That makes for the perfect Vitamin C Serum!&lt;br /&gt;The serum is really lightweight and absorbs quickly so you can use it in both your morning and evening skincare routines without worrying about it being to heavy under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my skin will look in the future.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite serum I have tried so far. And I have tried many. Makes my skin feel amazing and really brightens my completion.  I will keep this on hand</li>
            <li> I have rosacea. This product has been soothing and has helped in the fading of spots.Additionally,  you can mix up a lovely mask which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love the way it penetrates my skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!  My skin looks so much better!!</li>
            <li> Love it! This is so hydrating and really brightens my face. I&#x27;m addicted, I have been using these serums in place of branded serums that are much more expensive. Another great aspect is that this serum is made of a large percentage of natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> yes it does work it hasn&#x27;t brighten my face from blemishes yet but it did help on making my face soft and feels great after I put it on maybe I need to be persistence I&#x27;m not I forget most of the time to put it on my face will see if I keeping up with it and see if my blemishes gone will see!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  My face is so soft and smooth and by morning it feels nice and tight.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and has a nice soft scent.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family because it really works!  I&#x27;m so excited to have found something that really does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I think maybe I&#x27;m seeing a gradual improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks i can see a difference in my skin. It take only a few drops so I am sure it will also a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it! This is so hydrating and really brightens my face. I&#x27;m addicted, I have been using these serums in place of branded serums that are much more expensive. Another great aspect is that this serum is made of a large percentage of natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitate to purchase this. I&#x27;ve always been leery of the viewers comments never really believe their regular people as myself but that the comments are rigged.I have to say this serum is indeed wonderful , its everything positive.I seriously lovvvve this stuff.</li>
            <li> So far soooo good. I&#x27;m really liking this serum my skin absorbs this very well.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell a difference, but I only used it for a week....</li>
            <li> After just 2 weeks of using this product my complexion is more even, my skin is firmer, age spots are fading and my skin has a certain healthy glow. I have already reordered so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> First time using a serum but as we enter our 30s, we thought it would be a good idea to begin using serums (hyaluronic and vitamin C) as part of our regimen (glycolic acid peels) to take care of our skin. This vitamin C serum is nourishing and I believe, has helped with with my occasional adult acne. We use this vitamin C serum once per day before using hyaluronic acid - I like that it can be applied prior to makeup. It&#x27;s easy to apply, quickly absorbs into skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little early to see any results but after about 1 week of use, our complexion appears more even and feels healthier. We&#x27;ll see how it effects lines, age and sun spots. So far my husband and are very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, goes on very well.&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to fade lines...did make me a little red/break out a bit.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum, i liked it, it makes my skin so smooth and supple! Its very light observe in the skin quickly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have uneven skin tone, this makes my skin look perfect, bright and radiant!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a week i started finding diffrence, but for better result use twice a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** i got this product at discount price to review, but the opinion is my own, nothing to do with the promotion***</li>
            <li> Love it, my dark circle are looking lighter.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my grandmother who loves Vitamin C. She loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It makes my skin feel great. It easy to apply day &amp; night. My skin is looking Healthy !</li>
            <li> I have  just started to use this product and I can already see a difference in my skin. It is more  vibrant and youthful. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tired countless products for my dry/oily face.  about 4 months ago my thyroid took a trip somewhere and my face became extremely dry, not to mention my history of rosacea.  I&#x27;ve tried the most expensive products but nothing helped.  I have been using this product for only a week but my face feels so much better, soft, not dry, starting to see some balance.  so far I give this produce a high, high remark.  thank you.</li>
            <li> I like this product it goes on well and is not drying.</li>
            <li> i really dont see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!!!! I love this. It absorbs quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great seeing the changes in my skin, less fine lines and softer smoothness makes me smile every morning.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and the seller very nice, they sent the info about their product what helps a lot. My skin is already very soft with only two weeks using it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; great product. Exactly as shown in photos.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two weeks and have noticed a big difference in the appearance of my wrinkles.  Love It!</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference</li>
            <li> Nice, medium-sized bottle. Comes well packaged in bubble wrap. Comes with dropper. If you&#x27;re seeking Vitamin C serum, this is a good one to get. Good for anti-aging.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product for the price. It contains all the essential ingredients for optimal skin care. My wife sees a huge change in the skin on my face!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It needs a light moisturizer with it but it has helped with some sun spots. I don&#x27;t expect a miracle in a bottle anymore. I was a sun girl in my youth and thats hard to undo without a dermatologist. Still, it&#x27;s helped.</li>
            <li> This has made a difference in my skin&#x27;s clarity. Happy with this product and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be working well,  it absorbs quickly and my skins surface appears smother. I have not been using it long enough to jump up and down but I&#x27;m optimistic that it will improve the texture of my skin, i am black and so very often products are developed for white skin, so let&#x27;s see how this one works, i also have dark spots which i hate, I&#x27;m hoping the preoduct will deminish them over time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in LOVE with this product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Right after the first use, you can see a difference. And my skin feels so firm!! Also, the company is so nice and quick service!!    Update: This company is amazing!! Very thorough help and very prompt replies! Also helped me troubleshoot a minor issue I had (made my face a bit red). Best customer service!</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  It has made my face so soft and supple.  I would purchase it again because of this. I have tried many products and this rates right up at the top!  I am going to mix it with some cocoa butters to make my own facial cream and I know it will be superior.  I purchased this product to review and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my skin. I got this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This one is amazing product. Since i bought i used for 1 week applying over night. The result was amazing.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed much but I do love the way it helps my skin feel.  Knocked over the bottle and spilled half of it,  will be ordering again soon!  I like it.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin. Not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I put it on all over my face, once a day. Be sure to use a gentle cleanser before appliction of serum. Allow skin to air dry first. Does not sting skin &amp; light citrus fragrance doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. Slight tightening of skin while serum dries is to be expected &amp; is rather pleasant. Gives me a 24 hour glow &amp; really boosts my makeup. Smoothing &amp; hydrating.</li>
            <li> Great serum... Great price.</li>
            <li> This feels great on the skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it or cause acne flair ups.</li>
            <li> Made my face flare up and break out</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and have seen a lot of improvements. After applying it my face feels tighter, dark spots are lighter. I use it day and night after exfoliating and cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face look and feel great</li>
            <li> The serum seems to brighten skin overall and lighten age spots some.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum so far.  If I had more time to try it, the rating may well be a 5 star.  So far, after 4 weeks of use, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is brighter, clearer and younger looking.  I really like it combined with my rosehip seed oil for added moisture.</li>
            <li> Love product!!! Received promo code for a review!!</li>
            <li> Love it; just ordered three (3) more bottles</li>
            <li> Abiding Youth Best Organic 20% Vitamin C Serum is a wonderful, light, yet powerful serum with anti-aging properties. I have been using it for a couple weeks now and it has really made my skin look and feel better. The serum has tightened up my skin and made it firmer and more vibrant. This is an excellent product with great results. I am super impressed and will continue to use this on a regular basis. I am also thrilled with the fact that you only need a little bit of the product. It really goes a long way, making this a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Living in Florida, my skin is very dry and sun damaged. This antioxidant filled serum has improved my dryness and restored my skin&#x27;s glow and radiance. I have been applying it daily and it has helped a lot. I see less apparent fine lines, especially around my eye area. Plus my skin is much more hydrated and healthy looking. It has taken away the dullness and truly brightened up my skin. This is an amazing blend of ingredients that do the trick when it comes to helping and healing damaged skin. I love it and I am really happy with it. I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
            <li> I have made Vitamin C serum in the past and it had always turned out grainy and stung my skin after applying. So I decided to try out something new and bought this Vitamin C serum. I have been using this product for about a week now and it goes on smooth and and blends nicely into my skin. I apply it on my face and neck after cleaning my face at night. I must say my skin looks much brighter and the texture of my skin much smoother! Within days I have seen a difference...I can only imagine what my skin will look like in 2 to 3 weeks! Truly amazing product!</li>
            <li> Received my 20% vitamin C organic serum oil. I will be continuing to use this for many things. We all know vitamin c is a needed vitamin along with others. Organic vitamin c is used on my face and neck under makeup. This can be used morning and night if need be or wanted to. It came with fast shipping as expected. I did however receive a promo for my unbiased opinion. This isn&#x27;t all over serum. Great for helping tone and brighten the skin and help keep it youthful. I love my serums and this is a wonderful addition.</li>
            <li> I retraced my steps and searched the packaging from The Box containing the larger item, The Ashley Throw, and I have the Abiding Youth vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;serum, and just started using the product, its consistency is different from others I have used, looking forward to this new product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Has helped clarity for my skin. Tightens skin and has relaxed fine lines.</li>
            <li> My friend saids all vitamin C have weird/awful smell but I don&#x27;t find it with this brand. It has very light smell that I somehow like it.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Best to use with moisturizer, removes dead skin and clarifies skin!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it goes on non-greasy and works well under make up</li>
            <li> Great company. The serum works great.</li>
            <li> Love love love the serum. I apply it twice a day and my skin instantly feels smooth and sofe. I even notice more brightness. Well def purchase again</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know if it truly works, but it does leave my skin feeling refreshed.  I use it before bed along with my night cream.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell but it is tolerable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. My skin feels amazing after applying this to my skin, extremely smooth. I have been having skin dis colorization on my face. This product seems to be reversing that. Haven&#x27;t had any acne problems as well after i began using this product. Can&#x27;t lose with this big winner in your cabinet .</li>
            <li> Ferulic acid is the ingredient that helps fade dark spots, but it also gives serums a fragrance that reminds some people of bacon or hot dogs.  Thank fully, the smell fades after you put it on.  This serum was on the watery side, so I found it easier to drop directly onto my face.  I noticed a little tingling, but nothing distrancting.  Be sure to give it a few weeks of daily use before expecting to see results.  This bottle should last at least that long.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This product drys out your skin and makes your skin look worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this. I noticed a tightening of my skin &amp; slight reduction of melasma after only a couple weeks of use. Be aware though - your skin will just suck this up if you&#x27;re dehydrated &amp; I end up using 2 droppers a night. That&#x27;s ok - it works &amp; is priced well but I wouldn&#x27;t say a little goes a long way. Maybe my skin is just really thirsty &amp; this is what it needs. We are, after all, in a drought here in Cali &amp; I wonder if that impacts our skin health. Probably does.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality product</li>
            <li> Jadyn Natalia Vitamin C Serum is VERY effective !! Right away I can see the results!! Only put a little on and it will do it&#x27;s Magic!</li>
            <li> Bought it as recommended by a friend.  So far, it is okay, but too soon to tell results.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few days, so I can&#x27;t say much for the product. However, the bottle leaks. It will not screw on tight, so over half of the product leaked out when I was traveling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my ex wife and she loves it... she even asked for the info to get more when it runs out...</li>
            <li> I have only been using it two weeks so hard to say, I did notice it has brightened my skin a bit. I look forward to seeing what happens in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a nice serum that is very easy to use. I add this serum to my night cream or I put the serum on first and my cream after. I like that the cream is organic and 20% Vitamin C. Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say that the company is awesome! The dispense top of the original bottle I received was defected after I first opened and used it and ended up spilling and emptying into my travel bag. To say I was upset and disappointed is an understatement since I was traveling for over a week and didn&#x27;t have any Vitamin C serum to use! When I returned home and had time to email them, they replaced the bottle right away AND refunded me my money. I thought that was very thoughtful of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the product itself. After 3 weeks of using this particular serum, I have to say... I LOVE it! I definitely see the difference in my complexion. I&#x27;m at the cusp of my 40s, so skin care is a big deal for me. Especially since I&#x27;ve always and still am an outdoorsy person (I just have to remember to bring a hat!) My skin seems brighter and some of my darker sun spots have lightened and old faint scars and sun spots are barely visible now! My pores are tighter and less visible as well as any faint laugh lines around mouth and eyes. I do have adult acne (nothing major), and the serum doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it, which I love because I used this other vitamin C serum before and it seemed to inflame my acne when I had it. Happy to say, this serum doesn&#x27;t so I can continue to use it despite the occasional acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is watery (not like other serums I have used which usually has a thicker consistency). But it doesn&#x27;t bother me. And the serum has a light citrus scent. I like it, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had much compliments lately on my complexion, so I&#x27;m going to attribute it to the fact of this serum, only because it&#x27;s the only thing I have changed up in my facial routine. I haven&#x27;t added or taken out anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it any time after I fully wash my face. I apply the serum and wait for it to dry, then apply my tinted moisturizer (for day) or apply my maracuja oil (at night) . Pretty simple routine, right? Well, this is what I do and so far...compliments galore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any significant change in my complexion.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this serum.  I am 46 and have never used anything like this, I don&#x27;t wear any make up and clean and moisturize my facial and neck skin with organic unrefined coconut oil or almond oil; but have really noticed my age on my face lately, sun spots, ruddiness, etc...  I have rosacea and eczema that I mostly manage through diet, but my skin is super sensitive, this serum does not irritate or sting at all. After about two weeks of using it once a day in the morning after showering, my skin looks brighter, sun spots are lighter and my skin texture has smoothed out considerably.  A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> I have only been using for about 2 weeks and my skin feels and looks a bit better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great but it doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy or sticky</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product. Its very light-weight. I applied it to my face after washing/exfoliating and before applying a moisturizer. I apply needed a drop or two on each side of my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Since the human body can not store Vitamin C this product is a good way to get your daily dose.</li>
            <li> Worked great. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Entire bottle was used over two months. It was applied at night but it made no difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Was skeptical about it but once I used it I was amazed. I will be continuing to use it for sure!!!</li>
            <li> A lovely, light serum.  Sinks right in, non irritating, a great layer under moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If I can just be real for a minute: I&#x27;m shallow and clinging by a thread to my youth. I slather my face day and night in all sorts of retinols and coconut voodoo potions. Nothing-- and I mean nothing-- has worked at brightening my face, smoothing wrinkles, toning + tightening pores, exorcising face demons (hormonal acne), and evening out my skintone like this Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m here buying my second bottle, and I&#x27;m not even out of my first bottle yet. Seriously guys, this stuff is like the blood of virgins. I noticed results right away, too, but I also have very fair and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew this stuff was the real deal when I first got it, bc I happened to have an enormous, cyst-like, throbbing zit on my forehead-- I thought Id put this stuff to the test. I put it on in the daytime, and then again at night. When I woke up the giant zit (you know, the kind that lasts at least a week) was gone. GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. I&#x27;m done. Smear this on your face, and live forever~ ♡♡♡&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, the seller shipped very quickly. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This serum is great, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly and i could see a difference in my skin tone within a week.  This is great for evening out the tone and keeping skin clear and vibrant!</li>
            <li> Yay this exactly what I needed. Product is high quality.</li>
            <li> I got this product to review. I can see a different in my skin it brighter and less dull. I didn&#x27;t have a reaction to the serum. I was happy about that.</li>
            <li> I have just not been using this long enough to know if I love it, but I do think it is working.  I wish I loved something like the smell or appearance, but it really has no smell to me and the appearance of the packaging is nothing special. I really wish it felt exceptional, but it absorbs really quick and does not feel bad at all....so I was thinking average, then I put off leaving a review and started noticing that my facial lines really were looking less severe. I mostly just felt like my forehead ones, and across the top of my nose between my eyes when I first woke up, were the ones that bothered me most and I started noticing those did not look as bad....and it was not a maybe, they definitely were looking better. So I could actually end up loving this product in the end, it has only been a couple weeks. Oh and no stinging, burning, smell, or irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> Great product makes your wrinkles so soft they dissappear!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product.  Seems to be great.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My skin feels hydrated and smooth after using this serum.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot at each application so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use daily already seeing the toning and firming effects</li>
            <li> I have read about the great benefits of topical Vitamin C on skin so I had to try this product. I have normal to oily skin, and very very sensitive (I am prone to welting up when using some products).  As the years creep up (i&#x27;m 37 yrs old), I have been noticing that my skin is starting to look more dull and uneven. I never had to use foundation and I felt like i needed to start using it. After trying so many different kinds and spending so much money, it still didn&#x27;t help. I needed to help the skin and not cover it up. This product helped my skin tremendously.  After a week of use, my skin looks brighter , feels super soft, and my skin tone looks more even. The product glides on smooth and it SMELLS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have sensitive skin, I used it at night first then went to twice a day on day 3. It works great under makeup.  Because it leaves your skin so smooth, it acts as a primer so your makeup goes on nicely.  A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s worth every penny. I will definitely buy more. The product was also packaged well and arrived on time. STRONGLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I have dry and dull skin and was hoping for this serum to work miracles. I however ended up with a few bumps on my face. The customer service was fabulous and offered me a refund ( I was contacted through email) without me even asking for it. Great service, and they really do stand by their product.</li>
            <li> I love vitamin c when it comes to my face... it makes my skin feel amazing... I love oily skin and it seems kinda weird that I love to add oil to my skin but this just sinks into your skin so nicely and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily after...</li>
            <li> This really makes your skin look nice and refreshed. I was glad I got to review this product for a small discount because I really like it!</li>
            <li> I had my friend order some today!  It is great and I love it. I can see a difference in my skin. when she asked me what I was using I told her and she sat down and ordered a bottle!! For me, I have to apply a good moisturizer after I apply the serum.</li>
            <li> Love it---with all the serums that i combine daily---I look so much better---and this is with all the products I combine everyday-twice a day.  These work great making the skin&#x27;s texture improve greatly!!!!  i have tons of sun damage--and am a redhead that tans---but in the winter with these serums you wouldn&#x27;t know it (I don;t wear my glasses to look in the mirror--bahahahaha :-0)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my dry skin. I can use it with glycolic acid or hyaluranoc acid. I use vit daily.</li>
            <li> The best Vitamin C Serum I have ever used. It makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> Not bad. I&#x27;ve been using another brand of vitamin C serum and like the texture more than this one. But the price is good here.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a week and I can say that it has improved the look of my skin.  It returns a softer healthier glow almost immediately.  I am 45 and battling wrinkles and uneven skin tone and this will stay part of my routine.  It is not gritty and goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  She stands behind her product and emailed helpful tips on maximizing the results.  This was a personal touch that was appreciated.</li>
            <li> First impressions&lt;br /&gt;They should call this &amp;#34;youth with every drop!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could order this in gallon bottles I would use it on every INCH of my body.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant the texture is great and not over processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features&lt;br /&gt;THE ONE FORMULA ON THE MARKET THAT WON&#x27;T OXIDIZE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Firmer, Brighter, Younger-looking Skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Specially formulated for longer-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves your skin looking brighter, firmer and younger.&lt;br /&gt;- Protects you from the worst effects of aging.&lt;br /&gt;- Stimulates collagen production to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT MAKES THIS SERUM SO MUCH BETTER?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Helps fight hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;- Decreases dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;- Glides on smooth with quick absorption.&lt;br /&gt;- Refines skin texture and reduces wrinkle formation while minimizing existing wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;- Suspended in a concentrated base of pure vegan hyaluronic acid to plump skin cells and protect and restore.&lt;br /&gt;- Unlike other Vitamin C serums, it does not lose its potency after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;- The only serum to contain key ingredients Organic Vitamin C, Organic Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Jojoba Oil among other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best is that you see results pretty fast.. my skin is loving me back since the first drop!&lt;br /&gt;My hands were wrinkled and a few drops later the lines were near gone!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who needs the time turned back!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite anti aging serum, as it delivers the results that it promises to give. I am in my mid thirties and like any other woman, I am very concerned about my skin. I have used several anti aging products in the past and I must say that the Vitamin C Serum is by far my favorite! It works well in retaining moisture in my skin and it amplifies the effects of the moisturizers and repair creams that I use on top of this serum. It is well priced and I must say that you truly get your money&#x27;s worth on this brand! Very impressive results for such a reasonable price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C serum for some time.  We purchased the serum in a promotion for testing and review.  I liked the fact that the serum is Organic, (Organic Vitamin C, Organic Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Jojoba Oil).  This serum is silky (not as thick and gloppy) and a little goes a long way.  I have a healthy glow after application, and feel my skin is smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see the advertised  sale price was very reasonable for this high quality serum.</li>
            <li> My wife gave it a try absolutely loves it, made her skin look younger feel better and look like she&#x27;s glowing! !!</li>
            <li> This is awesome ! Not sticky , goes on well under make-up ! Only used for 2 days , but so far a very nice product !</li>
            <li> Easy way to take an essential vitamin</li>
            <li> Product as far as I had it has done a wonderful job on my skin, and I have very sensitive skin I actually didn&#x27;t know what else to use. It has helped me with acne, discoloration and pigmentation, and highly recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and delivery was as promised. Excellent!</li>
            <li> I love it!!  I did go with a different seller this time, but it&#x27;s Prime shipping and same exact product, slightly less expensive.  I just won&#x27;t be without this serum any longer.  I keep a supply ready so I don&#x27;t run out (it&#x27;s that good).</li>
            <li> My face loves this serum!  It is thirsty for it and soaks it up so I use more than I thought I would.  My face is already looking more youthful after only 2 weeks.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> very liquid formula that works very well</li>
            <li> I have been looking for Vitamin C serum for a while and this was perfect.  So far, I like this product the best.  I use is after washing my face in the evenings and let it do it&#x27;s work while I sleep.  So far so good.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have been trying to preemptively tackle wrinkles before they start.  I also have combination skin and need major moisture in my cheeks but need oil control in my forehead.  This serum is great!  I have been using it now fore over two weeks and I can already tell there is an improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture.  It is light weight, not greasy and smells of faint citrus.  I use several drops twice a day all over my face.  I also have very sensitive skin and bouts with adult acne.  I have not had any breakouts from this product and it has helped with fading some of melasma caused by past acne.  All in all I think this is a great product and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this vitamin C serum.  It&#x27;s easy to apply,  doesn&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin,  and doesn&#x27;t have any strong smells.  It&#x27;s slight more viscous than water,  so it slides on easily and dries quickly.  The hyaluronic acid in it helps smooth out my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very high quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum and not noticed any changes in my skin. The serum is very thin and watery (must serums I have used are thicker). Also, the serum has a very strong odor which is hard to describe. It&#x27;s not terribly unpleasant but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;good.&amp;#34; I wanted to love this product but the lack of results and the strange smell are just too much for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin so soft !!</li>
            <li> This serum is really nice. I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different ones over the years and this is one of my favorites.  It&#x27;s kinda watery, but absorbs fast and leaves my face feeling baby soft. I think it is helping with my pores and acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;No more combo skin.. it has done a decent job of evening things out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have (Combo acne prone aging skin with large clogged pores) for reference.</li>
            <li> This item is excellent and has helped my skin improve w dermarolling I use the serum as a process after rolling and every morning it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> Great product!  I love the way this makes my skin feel.  Fast shipping, great transaction</li>
