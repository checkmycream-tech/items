            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more of those.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE more for HAIR.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would work to save myself from getting braces to create more space before an implant</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t feel like spending more money on more braces that I will then forget to wear the retainer to...</li>
            <li>I bought these bands twice because I noticed that my space was not closing at the top.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s better then nothing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was super fast; included a nice informational sheet; seller was great but the bands aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>bands can and will temporarily work but these are not the right kind.</li>
            <li>I can finally smile in pictures! :)</li>
            <li>Gives you extra boost of confidence when you smile in photos to me that is priceless.</li>
            <li>and it has worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they ship these bands so quickly.</li>
            <li>I received my orthobands quite quickly which was a plus!</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Its a cheap option for my issue.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super strong and close the gap(s)</li>
            <li>I am so excited that my gap is gone.</li>
            <li>I might not get a retainer for a few more months because these bands are doing a great job.</li>
            <li>I love these bands I am using them very conservatively</li>
            <li>I have purchases these for other places before and although this is a great price, they break after a couple of hours</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;d be best to look into alternatives such as actually bonding the gap.</li>
            <li>and I end up going through them really quickly.</li>
            <li>As long as you stick with it and don&#x27;t be discouraged by the initial pain of the bands, I believe you will be very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I would take some Advil first!</li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews but this one was important!</li>
            <li>The seller is VERY fast at shipping and I love that because I dont have to wait long at all for my package to arrive :-).</li>
            <li>The gaps disappear in a few hours after using,  so happy</li>
            <li>cause it wuld cause another 2 gaps on the sides and ruin my smile.</li>
            <li>and if you roll it to the top near the gum no one will notice.</li>
            <li>I went from being emberassed to showing my teeth to always smiling and getting compliments on my smile.</li>
            <li>and then it will work its way to the root and effectively extract the central incisors.</li>
            <li>The shipping was SUPER fast!</li>
            <li>Slide right off, and didn&#x27;t even help my teeth.</li>
            <li>They do as they are advertised and as long as you can take a little discomfort work great!</li>
            <li>The first 2 days was hell</li>
            <li>These really work!</li>
            <li>so I cant jugde acurately cause havent been consistent.</li>
            <li>I first heard about a product called orthofill, look around and on amazon the bands were a 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li>I kept mine on all day first two days.</li>
            <li>They really work!</li>
            <li>but it looks like I will have to go the braces route first.  </li>
            <li>and I got a splitting headache the first time I wore them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also found it really funny that in the instructions that were included, it was recommended that you see a dentist about bonding after your gap is gone.  </li>
            <li>The first day I put them on</li>
            <li>these rubber bands were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It works if the gap between your teeth runs from top to bottom, but if you have the gap only at the bottom (think like a triangle where the top part of your teeth touch eachother and the bottom are separated) they won&#x27;t work since there is not way to &amp;#34;attach&amp;#34; them to the middle or bottom of the teeth.</li>
            <li>I wish I knew the exact one that she had.  </li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t shift back, I was able to go about a year without binding because I literally had the bands on 24/7 for about two years.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise these really work!</li>
            <li>I completely dry off my teeth the bands did stay a little longer; but no longer than an hour at best.</li>
            <li>&quot; but found the exact bands right here for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Its great for closing the gap between your two front teeth and also if a gap happens to appear on the sides of your two front teeth once the middle gap is closed, which more than likely it WILL happen</li>
            <li>and my smile looks balancedNeedless to say my overall look improves tremendously.</li>
            <li>very amazing, WAY better than a previous more expensive product i bought , i can swear the other one i bought was rubber bands, these feel like the real thing and are comfortable!</li>
            <li>I only wear it at night and has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Really helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Much progress after 1 night of wearing them</li>
            <li>Well they shipped fast haven&#x27;t quite started using them yet though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing the bands practically nonstop for about 3 weeks and the gap is very close to being gone altogether.</li>
            <li>Thanks, GapFix.</li>
            <li>These bands are VERY stretchy.  </li>
            <li>You really have to moniter the results.</li>
            <li>thanks to their bands</li>
            <li>this thing really works.</li>
            <li>Very coorperative with the issue and will do business again.</li>
            <li>Also, once your teeth are straighten you will need to explore other option to keep them straight like bonding, retainer, and many others.</li>
            <li>Ive tried 2 bands and results come quicker but teeth seem to return to their original position too faster than wearing only one.</li>
            <li>Small price to pay to be able to finally smile again.</li>
            <li>but I think this will do fine if you have teeth that aren&#x27;t narrowing towards the gums, just dry off your teeth before placing.</li>
            <li>Staying true to my last post in reference to a lifetime commitment with Gap Fix.</li>
            <li>Most people complain about the new gap it can create between your other teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 17 year old female and these bands really changed my smile, and boosted my confidence tenfold.</li>
            <li>At first nothing my teeth hurt big didn&#x27;t move and I was really up set</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because, despite the poor quality of usps service, GapFix is interested in timely and courteous service.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few more days</li>
            <li>My teeth tend to be more narrow towards the gum and wider towards the ends.</li>
            <li>However you see a short term difference right away.</li>
            <li>What I also found that pleasantly surprised me was that I had quite a few more than 100 in the package.</li>
            <li>They hurt at first and aren&#x27;t a permanent solution to a gap, but if you have something important planned in a few days and want less of a gap then you just pop these in and over night they close significantly.</li>
            <li>huge waste of money</li>
            <li>So people dont go for the complete closing.</li>
            <li>really isn&#x27;t that big</li>
            <li>So far they are performing as advertised.</li>
            <li>my teeth were fixed within a month.</li>
            <li>my teeth were fixed.</li>
            <li>Um...the whole point of these is NOT going to the dentist, because bonding and similar procedures are expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that teeth, don&#x27;t move to fast and crooked</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve consistently ordered these bands which have closed my gap and maintained it.  </li>
            <li>My gap would have closed if it were not for the piece of my gum that caused my gap not to close, but when my gap first attempted to close</li>
            <li>I did find that 1 band does last between 4 to 6 days before having to put a new one one.</li>
            <li>They take some getting use to, but if you use them long enough they really begin to work and the soreness in your gums goes away eventually</li>
            <li>It moved my teeth closer together but never really closed the gap, and I noticed that it was creating gaps in between the teeth I was trying to fix and their adjacent ones.</li>
            <li>The product works very well closed gap in 2 days</li>
            <li>I dont think these will fix your teeth permanent but will definately work if you wear them for 1 or 2 days prior a big event.wedding photoshoot new eyar or whatever.</li>
            <li>They close up my gap within hours and as long as I wear the rubber bands pretty regularly (at night is plenty), it stays closed.</li>
            <li>My gums were irritated at first, but I got used to it after a few days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to those who have small gaps in their teeth and are trying to avoid a high dental bill.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it was far less expensive than giving my orthodontist more money for a new mold made.</li>

            <li> I chose this rating because, despite the poor quality of usps service, GapFix is interested in timely and courteous service.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few more days</li>
            <li> My teeth tend to be more narrow towards the gum and wider towards the ends.</li>
            <li> However you see a short term difference right away.</li>
            <li> What I also found that pleasantly surprised me was that I had quite a few more than 100 in the package.</li>
            <li> They hurt at first and aren&#x27;t a permanent solution to a gap, but if you have something important planned in a few days and want less of a gap then you just pop these in and over night they close significantly.</li>
            <li> huge waste of money</li>
            <li> So people dont go for the complete closing.</li>
            <li> really isn&#x27;t that big</li>
            <li> So far they are performing as advertised.</li>
            <li> my teeth were fixed within a month.</li>
            <li> my teeth were fixed.</li>
            <li> Um...the whole point of these is NOT going to the dentist, because bonding and similar procedures are expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so that teeth, don&#x27;t move to fast and crooked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve consistently ordered these bands which have closed my gap and maintained it.  </li>
            <li> My gap would have closed if it were not for the piece of my gum that caused my gap not to close, but when my gap first attempted to close</li>
            <li> I did find that 1 band does last between 4 to 6 days before having to put a new one one.</li>
            <li> They take some getting use to, but if you use them long enough they really begin to work and the soreness in your gums goes away eventually</li>
            <li> It moved my teeth closer together but never really closed the gap, and I noticed that it was creating gaps in between the teeth I was trying to fix and their adjacent ones.</li>
            <li> The product works very well closed gap in 2 days</li>
            <li> I dont think these will fix your teeth permanent but will definately work if you wear them for 1 or 2 days prior a big event.wedding photoshoot new eyar or whatever.</li>
            <li> They close up my gap within hours and as long as I wear the rubber bands pretty regularly (at night is plenty), it stays closed.</li>
            <li> My gums were irritated at first, but I got used to it after a few days.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to those who have small gaps in their teeth and are trying to avoid a high dental bill.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it was far less expensive than giving my orthodontist more money for a new mold made.</li>
            <li> Do be warned, the first week is painful and I strongly suggest only wearing the bands at night.</li>
            <li> I also tried keeping my teeth dry by keeping my mouth open for long periods, but this also meant always dabbing my teeth with a paper towel to help keep them dry - a loosing battle since mouths are naturally always trying to keep itself moist.</li>
            <li> I plan to wear it during the day for a few weeks until I get a new retainer</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase for as long as they are in business.</li>
            <li> I complete waste of time I have cockteeth</li>
            <li> They work for eliminating the space between teeth..as long as youre wearing them.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say here, except that they totally work to close gaps.</li>
            <li> and it takes way to long</li>
            <li> and I quit doing it because my teeth didn&#x27;t shift back, but after a year with no binding my little gaps are back</li>
            <li> The gap goes back to how it was in a few hours, its pretty frustrating actually.</li>
            <li> I even used a single band for two or three teeth at a time.</li>
            <li> They slip off the teeth and will not stay on, they are simply clear small rubber bands.</li>
            <li> Since the rest of my teeth are all together Im just reducing the gap size to half and even though it still creates the gap on the sides those gaps are the same size of the reduced front gap</li>
            <li> Once I actually followed the directions my gap was gone in less than a month.</li>
            <li> They are super uncomfortable also.</li>
            <li> I tried to ignore it, but my gums ended up turning super white from the band digging in and cutting off circulation.</li>
            <li> I do put the bands on for about 8 hours a day and since they are clear it&#x27;s hard for people to notice them unless they are up close.  </li>
            <li> I did loads of research and heard a lot of bad things about it - mostly written by people who would make money off of</li>
            <li> After a few hours, my teeth seem to regain their open space.</li>
            <li> but if you look on youtube there are a few people that give you different ways to use the.  </li>
            <li> I ordered them a few times and didnt stay on track initially.</li>
            <li> My space is closed so now</li>
            <li> My gap was closed in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Definitely will not buy again, iv closed my gaps with bands a few years ago</li>
            <li> My gap was not large at all</li>
            <li> I have been using them now for two weeks, and my (very small) gap will go away when I am wearing them and for a short time after removing them, but it comes back within hours.  </li>
            <li> After careful reading from other reviewer&#x27;s, a phone call to to a dentist friend, and dentist post online</li>
            <li> teeth move back a little after you stop but otherwise did the trick in s month or less.</li>
            <li> I wear them every other night when sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I only have a small gap in th emiddle1mm</li>
            <li> I have a small gap in my 2 front teeth and can already tell a big difference.</li>
            <li> So I bought them looked at other reviews</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first with trying the bands.</li>
            <li> and I thought I would try again since it did actually work for me in the past.  </li>
            <li> , they are EXTREMELY flimsy and snapped every time.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the bands caused two other gaps to form in my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This was a rip off because it caused tons of pain and its not worth any purchase of using, please don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I broke my retainers years ago and my gap has come back slowly.</li>
            <li> It turned out that it was not closing because a part of my gums hung down in between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The band made my tooth begin to overlap slightly.</li>
            <li> though out might my gap is half way close</li>
            <li> The closer your teeth get the less the bands slip up.  </li>
            <li> My gum, lips and/or cheek also didn&#x27;t appreciate the sting when popping off from a tight fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s heavy, but not true.</li>
            <li> within a few hours.</li>
            <li> Saved my teeth when i misplaced my retainer.</li>
            <li> At first it was painful, soon you get use to the teeth moving.</li>
            <li> Due to bad retainer habits, the gap slowly and insidiously reappears in time, much to my dismay.</li>
            <li> I had a small gap and continued putting off trying the bands.  </li>
            <li> If you got a small gap orde NOW.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had braces in the past and a retainer I lost 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have wore braces in the past and my gap keep opening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what you could use these on...</li>
            <li> Plus, after I stopped using them, I found that it actually made the gap worse, because my teeth had now twisted a bit due to the pull.</li>
            <li> I really wanted these to work and am disappointed they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Also, I was told by a few dentists that this is not a good way to close a gap</li>
            <li> My dentist approved them, advised me to position them on the lower part of the teeth to keep from damaging the root,  and to wear them at least a 1/2 hr.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m not too fond of sitting there with my mouth gaping open looking crazy.</li>
            <li> slowly they started to move.</li>
            <li> but slowly it is.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t like to stay on after a while and stretch out, but they are holding the teeth in place and the gap is slowly closing.</li>
            <li> these are to thick</li>
            <li> Seriously for the price verses braces just to close our gap.</li>
            <li> The first two days are terrible you will need pain meds.</li>
            <li> If you want to use bands you need tough bands that can with stand the tension.  </li>
            <li> my teeth will become worse since I&#x27;m not 16.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s been less than a month!!!!</li>
            <li> If your insecure about any gaps you have</li>
            <li> Works but is not permanent and can dig into your gums causing a dangerous situation</li>
            <li> Because of this the bands like to &#x27;slide&#x27; all the way into my gums which is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I wanted badly for the product to work.</li>
            <li> This is a very dangerous method of closing a space between your two front teeth...</li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible product.</li>
            <li> I NO LONGER HAVE THAT HORRIBLE GAP!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Post 2:  Staying true to my last post in reference to a lifetime commitment with Gap Fix. I will continue to purchase for as long as they are in business.</li>
            <li> These were not the best.  They slip off the teeth and will not stay on, they are simply clear small rubber bands.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I actually needed.</li>
            <li> The bands seem to have just a temporary effect. After a few hours, my teeth seem to regain their open space.</li>
            <li> Love them! They&#x27;re super strong and close the gap(s) within a few hours. I would take some Advil first! The shipping was SUPER fast! Very happy with my results.</li>
            <li> I had a retainer that broke and never replaced it in years.  I had a small gap and continued putting off trying the bands.  After some research I gave it a try.  The bands came a day before scheuled delivery.  There are no instuction but if you look on youtube there are a few people that give you different ways to use the.  The first 2 days was hell and I would tell you to invest in advil or something like that.  As for closing the gap it is gone now.  I do put the bands on for about 8 hours a day and since they are clear it&#x27;s hard for people to notice them unless they are up close.  Oh and do not sleep with these on.  I did find that 1 band does last between 4 to 6 days before having to put a new one one.</li>
            <li> My front teeth had begun to separate years after wearing braces, so I was looking for an inexpensive way to help with this problem when I came across this product.  I&#x27;ve consistently ordered these bands which have closed my gap and maintained it.  I wear them every other night when sleeping.  Service has been good and I will continue to order these moving forward.</li>
            <li> Really helped a lot. Much progress after 1 night of wearing them</li>
            <li> Pain all day, and the teeth only hold for like an hour. Plus, after I stopped using them, I found that it actually made the gap worse, because my teeth had now twisted a bit due to the pull. Terrible, terrible product.</li>
            <li> These really work! They take some getting use to, but if you use them long enough they really begin to work and the soreness in your gums goes away eventually</li>
            <li> Slide right off, and didn&#x27;t even help my teeth. huge waste of money</li>
            <li> My bf asked me to order these for him. He seems happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Well they shipped fast haven&#x27;t quite started using them yet though. My one issue is the &amp;#34;what if&amp;#34; I have been reading a ton of things online and they all say don&#x27;t use the bands under the age 16 which I am under that age so I&#x27;m nervous to use them. I feel as if I use them my teeth will become worse since I&#x27;m not 16.</li>
            <li> I only have a small gap in th emiddle1mm aprox. I wear them only at night and I skip some nights so I cant jugde acurately cause havent been consistent.I dont think these will fix your teeth permanent but will definately work if you wear them for 1 or 2 days prior a big event.wedding photoshoot new eyar or whatever.Ive tried 2 bands and results come quicker but teeth seem to return to their original position too faster than wearing only one.Anyway Im not aiming for completly close the gap cause it wuld cause another 2 gaps on the sides and ruin my smile.Since the rest of my teeth are all together Im just reducing the gap size to half and even though it still creates the gap on the sides those gaps are the same size of the reduced front gap and my smile looks balancedNeedless to say my overall look improves tremendously.So people dont go for the complete closing.I dont give 5 stars cause I dont think its a permanent fix but Im very satisfied.FAST delivery good price and effective product&lt;br /&gt;Note. I even leave the band on for pictures,its not uncorfotable at all and if you roll it to the top near the gum no one will notice.If you got a small gap orde NOW.&lt;br /&gt;If you got an event use 2 bands the days before at night,then  rest about 8 hours and wear 1 band during the event as a retainer</li>
            <li> I complete waste of time I have cockteeth and it doesn&#x27;t works. It sticks to you&#x27;re teeth and irritated My gums</li>
            <li> These amazingly do work! I have a small gap in my 2 front teeth and can already tell a big difference. My gums were irritated at first, but I got used to it after a few days.</li>
            <li> I wanted badly for the product to work. I could not keep the bands from riding up into my gums and ended up stop using them on day three.</li>
            <li> The gaps disappear in a few hours after using,  so happy</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews but this one was important! So I have a gap in the middle of my two front teeth. I first heard about a product called orthofill, look around and on amazon the bands were a 1/3 of the price. So I bought them looked at other reviews watched some videos and finally tried the bandz. At first nothing my teeth hurt big didn&#x27;t move and I was really up set but supper slowly they started to move. But I had to have the band loop it twice and place it over my teeth. I was hopping it&#x27;d be gone considering my gap really isn&#x27;t that big but slowly it is. Also I wear them 24/7 with the exception of eating. With these bands it will take a while but don&#x27;t get discouraged</li>
            <li> helps to close gaps between teeths</li>
            <li> I am so excited that my gap is gone. I love the fact that they ship these bands so quickly. I ordered them a few times and didnt stay on track initially. Once I actually followed the directions my gap was gone in less than a month. I do still wear the bands because my gap started to form when I stopped. Small price to pay to be able to finally smile again. I am so happy right now. I would recommend this to everyone. Thank you gap fix.</li>
            <li> I CANT BELIEVE I NO LONGER HAVE THAT HORRIBLE GAP!!!! And it&#x27;s been less than a month!!!! I can finally smile in pictures! :)</li>
            <li> amazing feel so comfortable. came on time. very amazing, WAY better than a previous more expensive product i bought , i can swear the other one i bought was rubber bands, these feel like the real thing and are comfortable! will stick to this brand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Natalie  R</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first with trying the bands. I did loads of research and heard a lot of bad things about it - mostly written by people who would make money off of you going for a more expensive option like braces- I can&#x27;t afford braces on the budget my family has and a part time waitress job. I&#x27;m a 17 year old female and these bands really changed my smile, and boosted my confidence tenfold. I&#x27;ve been wearing the bands practically nonstop for about 3 weeks and the gap is very close to being gone altogether. Do be warned, the first week is painful and I strongly suggest only wearing the bands at night. What I also found that pleasantly surprised me was that I had quite a few more than 100 in the package. I counted the bands this morning and I had 103 left after 3 weeks of use. As long as you stick with it and don&#x27;t be discouraged by the initial pain of the bands, I believe you will be very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Stop doubting and order this product!! I still can&#x27;t believe my gap is gone, it works so perfect and the price is great, besides great delivery service and a very friendly letter and instructions!! I am so very pleased and would defenitely order again if I had too!!</li>
            <li> Pros: Works very quickly and effectively. Cheap. Practically invisible.  Cons: Has not worked for every person I&#x27;ve recommended them too</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because, despite the poor quality of usps service, GapFix is interested in timely and courteous service. I appreciate all they are doing to get the product to me. I chose this product because it makes since for the alignment of my teeth. I just have a gap and I believe it can offer closure before or without the cost of braces. Thanks, GapFix.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m still working on it every night. Not for people who have gum disease, because it makes it bleeding time to time.</li>
            <li> Works but is not permanent and can dig into your gums causing a dangerous situation</li>
            <li> I broke my retainers years ago and my gap has come back slowly. I thought I would give it a try. At first it was painful, soon you get use to the teeth moving. I only wear it at night and has made a huge difference. Seriously for the price verses braces just to close our gap. Gives you extra boost of confidence when you smile in photos to me that is priceless.</li>
            <li> They work for eliminating the space between teeth..as long as youre wearing them.  As soon as you take the band off, the teeth go back where they were before:/  (this is why you have to continue to wear a retainer after you get your braces off).  My dentist approved them, advised me to position them on the lower part of the teeth to keep from damaging the root,  and to wear them at least a 1/2 hr. a day.  Also advised me to band 3 teeth to keep from moving the anchor tooth.  These bands are VERY stretchy.  You can easily double loop them around 2 teeth.</li>
            <li> I received my orthobands quite quickly which was a plus! I had braces in the past and a retainer I lost 2 years ago. I have noticed my two front teeth shifting more and more each year. After careful reading from other reviewer&#x27;s, a phone call to to a dentist friend, and dentist post online I decided to try it. The first two days are terrible you will need pain meds. However you see a short term difference right away. I kept mine on all day first two days. My gap was not large at all but it is visible and these bands  definitely took it away. I plan to wear it during the day for a few weeks until I get a new retainer made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: Although I had a gap my teeth were not crooked. The band made my tooth begin to overlap slightly. You really have to moniter the results. Most people complain about the new gap it can create between your other teeth but my concern is the overlapping. Just be weary and know that these may fix one thing and alter another. Teeth do move! Especially after cosmetic treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was far less expensive than giving my orthodontist more money for a new mold made. I recommend grabbing something that keeps your teeth in place afterwards for maintaining the results.</li>
            <li> So far they are performing as advertised. They don&#x27;t like to stay on after a while and stretch out, but they are holding the teeth in place and the gap is slowly closing. I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter after she started seeing the gap between her teeth , that went away when she was wearing braces. She likes this product and it did help to close the gap. I am going to order more of those. They do work</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results... When I have the bands on. The gap goes back to how it was in a few hours, its pretty frustrating actually. So I&#x27;ll just wear them all the time &amp; be happy.</li>
            <li> these are to thick THEY ARE more for HAIR. A ORTHO WOULD NEVER EVER GIVE YOU THIS</li>
            <li> Great shipping time..good quality</li>
            <li> I love these. These bands have changed my life. i started wearing these about 2 years ago and it was the best decision i&#x27;ve ever made. I went from being emberassed to showing my teeth to always smiling and getting compliments on my smile. my teeth were fixed within a month. thanks to their bands my teeth were fixed. i recommend a 100%</li>
            <li> The seller is VERY fast at shipping and I love that because I dont have to wait long at all for my package to arrive :-). I will keep purchasing from this seller. I have no problems with these bands. I used to order from \\&quot;Teeth Gap\\&quot; but found the exact bands right here for much cheaper. Yes they do indeed close gaps. Its great for closing the gap between your two front teeth and also if a gap happens to appear on the sides of your two front teeth once the middle gap is closed, which more than likely it WILL happen, I just put a band over those four teeth where the space has formed....sometimes I would double the bands to get a stronger pull on my teeth and it has worked fine for me. My space is closed so now Im using it just to keep my teeth in place until I get a retainer....I might not get a retainer for a few more months because these bands are doing a great job.</li>
            <li> They really work! I even used a single band for two or three teeth at a time. Great product and also very good customer service for shipping issues.</li>
            <li> I have a big gap between my canine and front tooth.  I was hoping this would work to save myself from getting braces to create more space before an implant but it looks like I will have to go the braces route first.  Just saving them for any day I plan on creating mini braids for myself!</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, I think it&#x27;d be best to look into alternatives such as actually bonding the gap. Without a retainer, it&#x27;ll just revert back.</li>
            <li> It moved my teeth closer together but never really closed the gap, and I noticed that it was creating gaps in between the teeth I was trying to fix and their adjacent ones. So, I stopped wearing them after three weeks.</li>
            <li> They work, go on youtube to see others use the product and their results. This is a great option if done right. This process like braces takes time, the best results happen gradually. Also, once your teeth are straighten you will need to explore other option to keep them straight like bonding, retainer, and many others.</li>
            <li> These only work to fix gaps temporarily.  I have been using them now for two weeks, and my (very small) gap will go away when I am wearing them and for a short time after removing them, but it comes back within hours.  Aside from that, these HURT your teeth and I got a splitting headache the first time I wore them.&lt;br /&gt;I also found it really funny that in the instructions that were included, it was recommended that you see a dentist about bonding after your gap is gone.  Um...the whole point of these is NOT going to the dentist, because bonding and similar procedures are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;So I also recommend going to a dentist, and save yourself the ten bucks you would spend on these.  I really wanted these to work and am disappointed they didn&#x27;t.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!</li>
            <li> As I have said b4 those bands help me a lot... I have wore braces in the past and my gap keep opening. the bands shelps me to keep it close. Its a cheap option for my issue.</li>
            <li> They work but its not a drastic change. They are super uncomfortable also. The first day I put them on I took them back off but the instructions said that would happen.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here, except that they totally work to close gaps. I have a natural space between my two front teeth that has been twice closed by braces. Due to bad retainer habits, the gap slowly and insidiously reappears in time, much to my dismay. Since I don&#x27;t feel like spending more money on more braces that I will then forget to wear the retainer to...these rubber bands were exactly what I needed. They close up my gap within hours and as long as I wear the rubber bands pretty regularly (at night is plenty), it stays closed. I wear two rubber bands, one around my two front teeth and then another one around my front four teeth. Keeps the side gaps from happening. Get these, they do the job and they are a LOT cheaper than braces.</li>
            <li> Does it close permanently?</li>
            <li> just like the orthodontic bands I remember from braces - very strong</li>
            <li> Delivered in good condition.</li>
            <li> It works if the gap between your teeth runs from top to bottom, but if you have the gap only at the bottom (think like a triangle where the top part of your teeth touch eachother and the bottom are separated) they won&#x27;t work since there is not way to &amp;#34;attach&amp;#34; them to the middle or bottom of the teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a very dangerous method of closing a space between your two front teeth...the elastic can slide up under the gingival tissue and you will not feel it because it causes pressure anesthesia..and then it will work its way to the root and effectively extract the central incisors.</li>
            <li> This was a rip off because it caused tons of pain and its not worth any purchase of using, please don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and in just one day you could see a difference. She and I were amazed! Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few more days</li>
            <li> I was surprise ..... this thing really works. Save me a bunch on dentist visit, lol.</li>
            <li> Very coorperative with the issue and will do business again. The product works very well closed gap in 2 days</li>
            <li> I love these bands I am using them very conservatively so that teeth, don&#x27;t move to fast and crooked, I wear then though out might my gap is half way close</li>
            <li> My gap was closed in a couple of days. I wear now for maintenance.  The closer your teeth get the less the bands slip up.  To reduce slippage wind them in a figure 8 around your teeth.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use them because they are tiny. I&#x27;m really not sure what you could use these on...maybe baby teeth?</li>
            <li> Scam!!!! The ortho bands do not stay on your front teeth, In my opinion this is a scam</li>
            <li> Definitely will not buy again, iv closed my gaps with bands a few years ago and I quit doing it because my teeth didn&#x27;t shift back, but after a year with no binding my little gaps are back and I thought I would try again since it did actually work for me in the past.  My gaps are pretty small and these would not even fix that, they are EXTREMELY flimsy and snapped every time.  If you want to use bands you need tough bands that can with stand the tension.  I used my friends braces bands years ago and that&#x27;s what did it,  I wish I knew the exact one that she had.  If your insecure about any gaps you have it is best to do it the right way, look into invisalign or braces.  I decided to just get invisalign because binding your teeth is temporary and it takes way to long and you literally need to wear these bands 23/7 so they don&#x27;t shift back, I was able to go about a year without binding because I literally had the bands on 24/7 for about two years.  Its too stressful.  If you don&#x27;t have the money for braces ect. bands can and will temporarily work but these are not the right kind.</li>
            <li> They hurt at first and aren&#x27;t a permanent solution to a gap, but if you have something important planned in a few days and want less of a gap then you just pop these in and over night they close significantly. They do as they are advertised and as long as you can take a little discomfort work great!</li>
            <li> I have purchases these for other places before and although this is a great price, they break after a couple of hours and I end up going through them really quickly.</li>
            <li> teeth move back a little after you stop but otherwise did the trick in s month or less. thank you</li>
            <li> They say it&#x27;s heavy, but not true.</li>
            <li> To my surprise these really work! I highly recommend this product to those who have small gaps in their teeth and are trying to avoid a high dental bill.</li>
            <li> Saved my teeth when i misplaced my retainer.</li>
            <li> My teeth tend to be more narrow towards the gum and wider towards the ends. Because of this the bands like to &#x27;slide&#x27; all the way into my gums which is very uncomfortable. I tried to ignore it, but my gums ended up turning super white from the band digging in and cutting off circulation. My gum, lips and/or cheek also didn&#x27;t appreciate the sting when popping off from a tight fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I completely dry off my teeth the bands did stay a little longer; but no longer than an hour at best. I also tried keeping my teeth dry by keeping my mouth open for long periods, but this also meant always dabbing my teeth with a paper towel to help keep them dry - a loosing battle since mouths are naturally always trying to keep itself moist. Still, I&#x27;m not too fond of sitting there with my mouth gaping open looking crazy. After 10 days of constantly adjusting, replacing, I finally gave up. This didn&#x27;t work for me but I think this will do fine if you have teeth that aren&#x27;t narrowing towards the gums, just dry off your teeth before placing. 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was super fast; included a nice informational sheet; seller was great but the bands aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> USE FOR Barbie PONYTAILS</li>
            <li> I bought these bands twice because I noticed that my space was not closing at the top.  It turned out that it was not closing because a part of my gums hung down in between my teeth.  My gap would have closed if it were not for the piece of my gum that caused my gap not to close, but when my gap first attempted to close I noticed that the bands caused two other gaps to form in my teeth.  Also, I was told by a few dentists that this is not a good way to close a gap</li>
            <li> They kind of do the job! I guess it&#x27;s better then nothing... I can&#x27;t afford the expensive sophisticated gadgets they advertise.</li>
