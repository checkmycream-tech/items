            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years as a detangler for myself and for the kids. I recently discovered wet brushes though.... so the two of them together work even better.</li>
            <li> Great product!  One spray &amp; hair is way to comb through and all without leaving a heavy \\&quot;product\\&quot; on your hair!  Strongly recommend to others who want tangle free hair!</li>
            <li> great buy, works great,  -- Thanks</li>
            <li> I used to spend hours looking for this product then I searched the net.  I have now purchased this 2x via Amazon and will again.  Great price, arrives quickly and always just what I ordered.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in this size.  I have been using this for 15+ yrs.  Great quality conditioner and I trust Joico.</li>
            <li> Light scented.  Large size is good for refilling my smaller bottle.  It works great for de-tangling and does not feel sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair detangler for a long time and this product does an excellent job. If you are looking for a hair detangler then look no farther. This product is great for all hair types</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve used in my hair since I bought. I ran through it and served a liter to refill. Only thing it doesn&#x27;t do for me is give me more shine.</li>
            <li> Repeat customer,will be back.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have used it for years and am excited that they still make it, even if they have changed the name.</li>

            <li> I have used this product so long the bottle has changed and so has the name. It used to be called Integrity. Fortunately the ingredients are the same and the product works wonders!! My daughter and I both have pretty long hair and we both use flat irons on a regular basis. This leave in detangler is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I never review products, but feel strongly enough about this one to do it. The best part is it really detangles but there is no heavy \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feel when you dry your hair. I strongly reccommedn this for long hair.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Put in hair and knots comb out easily! This product is a little expense for the average family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a GREAT product but hard to find locally.  Takes care of tangles and leaves your hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, great product and a great price! Thank you</li>
            <li> Still have problems with tangles.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years  Works well on detangling hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel very very soft and nice to touch. Every time I use this, I am always satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  I wash my hair daily.  I can spray Joico&#x27;s detangler in daily and it doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair down.  My hair styles perfectly.</li>
            <li> Super product.  Only way I can get my fine hair combed out after shampooing.  Have even used it on my puppy&#x27;s long hair on his tail and feathers.  works great!</li>
            <li> I have African American hair that is med coarse and relaxed so I need a good detangler that is not going to dry out my hair but make it soft and manageable. My Beautician recommended this product to me and now I am hooked. I have no problems at all</li>
            <li> I was going to cut my hair if I couldn&#x27;t find a detangler that would help me manage it.  This one does the trick without weighing it down a bit!  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.  The bottle is gigantic!  Looks like it is packaged for a salon-size use.</li>
            <li> Yes love this oroduct.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing.  People raved about this product.  It has not worked so well for me.  I can&#x27;t recommend it.  The worst part is now I have a ton of the stuff!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  It keeps his have manageable and soft without looking frizzy.</li>
