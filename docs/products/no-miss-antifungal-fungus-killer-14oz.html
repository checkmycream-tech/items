            <li>This is the best product out there I found for ungly fungal growth under toe nails.</li>
            <li>Very impressed.</li>
            <li>These nails had gotten to the point that they were crumbling at the ends, and what is impressive about a liquid like No Miss is that when you apply a drop or two to the crumbling end of the nail, the nail soaks it up.</li>

            <li>and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>OK this stuff works.</li>
            <li>I paid 40.00.I needed more, but was reluctant to repurchase.</li>
            <li>They just sit on top.</li>
            <li>maybe others might have better luck.</li>
            <li>this stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li>This product works wonderfully for those whose have minor fungus problems on their nails.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work as advertised, after many solutions that don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and dries quickly</li>
            <li>a lot of progresses from the first use will recommend very highly i love</li>
            <li>Several millimeters of good quality nail are now already visible at the cuticle end.</li>
            <li>the product is great however, if u have a persistent ring worm u might need to use other things too</li>
            <li>I had quick results with this.</li>
            <li>For the price its worth to try it.</li>
            <li>I have used No Miss for about 2 months and the results are very positive.  </li>
            <li>I had a fungal infection that I contracted from the nail spa on my right thumb.  </li>
            <li>I have had fungus on my big toes many times but this product when used as directed provides results almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pharmacist and I tried many products and found this product actually works to kill fungus.  </li>
            <li>Before purchasing this product be absolutely sure that you do have a fungus problem and use it for fungus only</li>
            <li>I first purchased the NoMiss at my nail Solon.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what i ordered</li>
            <li>The product wasn&#x27;t strong enough to kill my toenail fungus.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Research demonstrates that naturally occurring biocides such as thymol and carvacrol reduce bacterial resistance to antibiotics through a synergistic effect, and thymol has been shown to be an effective fungicide, particularly against fluconazole-resistant strains.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Product arrived fine and only took two days, thank you!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years because it works very well.  </li>
            <li>But it was cheap enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li>and it got to me fast</li>
            <li>I still use this daily even though i am now fungus free.</li>
            <li>This fungus killer works very well; you have to put it on twice a day in order for it to work.  </li>
            <li>Finished the whole bottle and no improvement.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, what I like about this product is that it is using an effective anti-fungal which is Miconazole Nitrate in combination with some well known natural substances which may help potentiate the effect such as clear iodine and thymol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product, just doesn&#x27;t last long enough</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product as well as the Seller.  </li>
            <li>No Miss is HIGHLY variable.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend NO MISS</li>
            <li>I review this product based on the fact that I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months now which in my case is too early to notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that I find I have to review based on ingredients and cost factor more than on results since when it comes to fungal infections, specially such as toenail fungus that is underneath the nail bed, you are talking a very long term issue which may take up to several years of continuous use to notice a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One is completely clear.</li>
            <li>I like to use in conjuction with Dr. G Clear Nail.</li>
            <li>My dad had a toe nail that wouldn&#x27;t grow after an injury, he carried it for 30 years and after this fungus killer he saw his toe nail grow completely.</li>
            <li>It obviously will take a lot of time for the new nail to grow out and replace the fungus-damaged parts, but I am encouraged about what I see so far.</li>
            <li>After fairly steady daily use, and 2 bottles later, the fungus cleared.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of this product, however my knowledge of natural supplements has allowed me to adjust this by adding clove oil and orange oil to this product which effectively addressed the unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li>At present they are almost completely grown out.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> where near what other products are.</li>
            <li> At such a low cost per bottle, no residual smell or greasiness, I think it is well worth trying for anyone who is skeptical, as I once was.</li>
            <li> This works, but you have to use it every single day twice a day for a minimum of 3 months.</li>
            <li> This small bottle of No Miss was given to me by the girl who does my nails, and later I purchased a 2nd bottle.  </li>
            <li> I used the product for toe nail fungus, two times each day, just used the dropper and put a little on each big toe.  </li>
            <li> I am in the process of using No Miss on two nails that I have had trouble with for several years.  </li>
            <li> This product exceeds my expectations as I expected nothing and after two weeks, my toenails are (already) showing signs of improvement.</li>
            <li> Now I am trying it on the one toe nail that has been resistant to any other treatment, to see if it will cure that, too.</li>
            <li> Price was less then half, including shipping,  </li>
            <li> and no success!</li>
            <li> (use tool to get out the dead gunk out under your nails, or it can hinder the medicine).</li>
            <li> Waste of time &amp; money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money, does not work.</li>
            <li> I reccomend it I&#x27;m seeing results after a few weeks of using it!</li>
            <li> I cannot say it&#x27;s not good product</li>
            <li> A nail salon let out the secret to this stuff.</li>
            <li> We then bought it for a friend who had been unable to grow his toe nail in 25 years, also after an injury.</li>
            <li> It arrive on time, is not an expensive product, doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything</li>
            <li> It was a bit painful, but mostly ugly and embarrassing to look at.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Worked well on my mom&#x27;s feet. When she doesn&#x27;t use it, a difference is noticed.</li>
            <li> Jury still out. Just started using it.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I have purchased it from this Seller as well and I am completely satisfied. I have had fungus on my big toes many times but this product when used as directed provides results almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as advertised, after many solutions that don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;easy to use and dries quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting on clothing&lt;br /&gt;After using for a while I had liver problems, so check with your Dr.</li>
            <li> a lot of progresses from the first use will recommend very highly i love it will keep buying it till done</li>
            <li> Works for me to get rid of toe fungus.</li>
            <li> I had a fungal infection that I contracted from the nail spa on my right thumb.  It was a bit painful, but mostly ugly and embarrassing to look at.

            <li> This is the best non-prescription product I&#x27;ve seen for nail fungus when used faithfully.  I highly recommend the product as well as the Seller.  Fairly priced.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by the nail salon where I get my pedicure. I have used it and it might be working, although I do not use it twice a day as instructions say. I have used it over a month and when I got my last pedicure I still saw signs of fungus under my big toenails with some improvement. The price was not so much that I feel I wasted my money if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and works</li>
            <li> Works Great. Just remember to use it twice a day</li>
            <li> I used it 6 months 2x a day on toe nail fungus.  Doesn&#x27;t work...But it was cheap enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pharmacist and I tried many products and found this product actually works to kill fungus.  You have to start using it as soon as it starts. I&#x27;m using it under my fingernail twice a day. It takes about 3 weeks. My manicurist cuts the nail very short so the liquid will penetrate .</li>
            <li> My dad had a toe nail that wouldn&#x27;t grow after an injury, he carried it for 30 years and after this fungus killer he saw his toe nail grow completely. We then bought it for a friend who had been unable to grow his toe nail in 25 years, also after an injury. It worked on him too! This stuff diminishes toe nail fungus! it works!</li>
            <li> OK this stuff works. A nail technician recommended it. I cannot believe the results. My nail looks flawless!! For the price its worth to try it.</li>
            <li> I have not seen very good results from this product at all. I tried it for about 3 months and byt that time I should have seen something happen.</li>
            <li> I reccomend it I&#x27;m seeing results after a few weeks of using it! Must use the suggested 2 times daily!</li>
            <li> I cannot say it&#x27;s not good product it probably is but is just not working for my problem. It may be I am using a fungus killer to deal witha problem that is not actually a fungus. Before purchasing this product be absolutely sure that you do have a fungus problem and use it for fungus only</li>
            <li> this was great it works sooo good and it got to me fast</li>
            <li> This is the best product out there I found for ungly fungal growth under toe nails. Just debride before you put it on and later as you go. (use tool to get out the dead gunk out under your nails, or it can hinder the medicine). A nail salon let out the secret to this stuff. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> This did not cure my toenail fungus. it also states in the directions &amp;#34;Do not use on nails&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fine and only took two days, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I used this religiously as recommended and it did nothing.  Now I am using tea tree oil with fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t strong enough to kill my toenail fungus.  I have also tried eucalyptus tree oil, and it didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> This is misleading! the product does not work. I gave it one year! and no success! One year should have been well enough time to do what this product said it would do as it takes one year for your toe nails to grow out. DONT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I first purchased the NoMiss at my nail Solon. I paid 40.00.I needed more, but was reluctant to repurchase. My neice tells me she always check Amazon. And there it was, for a fraction of the price&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s working wonders. One is completely clear. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am in the process of using No Miss on two nails that I have had trouble with for several years.  I have been to the dermatologist for over 2 years with no results.  I have used No Miss for about 2 months and the results are very positive.  My nails looks like they will be well within two months.  The nail fungus that I have is not the one with nail discoloration.  My nails disconnects from the nail bed and continues to recede.  At present they are almost completely grown out.  I will continue to work with No Miss and my nails.</li>
            <li> I tried this Antifungal and honesty my toes still remain the same.  I was hoping for a clearer toe nail but it didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I have been using No Miss on two fungus-infested fingernails for a month. It obviously will take a lot of time for the new nail to grow out and replace the fungus-damaged parts, but I am encouraged about what I see so far. I apply twice a day. Once in the morning, and once in the evening.  Several millimeters of good quality nail are now already visible at the cuticle end. These nails had gotten to the point that they were crumbling at the ends, and what is impressive about a liquid like No Miss is that when you apply a drop or two to the crumbling end of the nail, the nail soaks it up. You can watch it disappear under the nail. The fluid ends up under the nail where the fungus is. That&#x27;s why creams don&#x27;t work. They just sit on top. I should note that the price for 1/4 oz No Miss is HIGHLY variable. Shop around to avoid being cheated.</li>
            <li> my second order from this company . excellent service would reccomend to anyone Iwill order again</li>
            <li> the product is great however, if u have a persistent ring worm u might need to use other things too ( garlic works wonders)</li>
            <li> This works, but you have to use it every single day twice a day for a minimum of 3 months. My acrylic nails were cured, but it took months and i had to stay faithful to the treatment. I still use this daily even though i am now fungus free. I like to use in conjuction with Dr. G Clear Nail. Great to be fungus free!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Drug Facts&amp;#34; on the Fungus Killer box, specifically says &amp;#34;DO NOT USE On nails or scalp&amp;#34;. The product description (Amazon&#x27;s) doesn&#x27;t mention this, while some reviewers tout it&#x27;s effectiveness on nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t apply Fungus Killer since my purchase was intended for nails and I&#x27;m not inclined to experiment in this way. Waste of time &amp; money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t use the product, my one star rating is based on the misleading &amp;#34;For hands and feet&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what i ordered</li>
            <li> This fungus killer works very well; you have to put it on twice a day in order for it to work.  However, over time it works well.</li>
            <li> I been using for a month now and i can already see a big difference!</li>
            <li> Awesome fungus killer at a reasonable price.  Works well on feet and nails.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that I find I have to review based on ingredients and cost factor more than on results since when it comes to fungal infections, specially such as toenail fungus that is underneath the nail bed, you are talking a very long term issue which may take up to several years of continuous use to notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I review this product based on the fact that I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months now which in my case is too early to notice much of a difference. Additionally, in my case I may been oblation on one of the affected nails for this product to work properly since the affected area is below the nail itself.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, what I like about this product is that it is using an effective anti-fungal which is Miconazole Nitrate in combination with some well known natural substances which may help potentiate the effect such as clear iodine and thymol.&lt;br /&gt;Research demonstrates that naturally occurring biocides such as thymol and carvacrol reduce bacterial resistance to antibiotics through a synergistic effect, and thymol has been shown to be an effective fungicide, particularly against fluconazole-resistant strains.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent of this product, however my knowledge of natural supplements has allowed me to adjust this by adding clove oil and orange oil to this product which effectively addressed the unpleasant scent. Clove and orange oil my also help make the product more effective.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, does not work. I tried it for over a week and no improvement. Finished the whole bottle and no improvement. Look elsewhere if you want to see results.</li>
            <li> took 4 bottles but my nails are almost all grown out, and even though there is an odor, it is NOOO where near what other products are.</li>
            <li> This product exceeds my expectations as I expected nothing and after two weeks, my toenails are (already) showing signs of improvement. I have battled toenail fungus over a year and refuse to take oral meds prescribed by my doctor.</li>
            <li> It arrive on time, is not an expensive product, doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything so,I will recomended it , it works...</li>
            <li> I had been buying this at my nail salon. Thia is the best price that I have found yet. Works well for me.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed. I had quick results with this. Thanks</li>
            <li> I used the product for toe nail fungus, two times each day, just used the dropper and put a little on each big toe.  Cleared up after a month of use, very happy with this product.  Price was less then half, including shipping,  then retail stores in my area.</li>
            <li> I had tried a gambit of anti fungal products and this is the only one that worked for a big toe nail fungus I had for over a year.</li>
            <li> I tried everything and  to no avail. I would highly recommend NO MISS</li>
            <li> Did not work for me maybe others might have better luck.</li>
            <li> I just start using but I don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s gonna fix my problem...let see...</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully for those whose have minor fungus problems on their nails.  I have used this product in the past and I am very pleased with the results.  It takes a while to do the job but it does work.</li>
