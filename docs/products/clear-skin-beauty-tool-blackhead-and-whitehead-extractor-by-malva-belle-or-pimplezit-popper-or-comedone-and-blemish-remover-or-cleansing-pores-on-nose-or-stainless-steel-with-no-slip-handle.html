            <li>did work great the one time I tried it on a whitehead, but that&#x27;s not what I want it for.</li>
            <li>This tool is great.</li>
            <li>My daughter was happy to get it.</li>
            <li>Very nicely made.</li>

            <li>Once it got a good coating of gunk, I just wiped it on a tissue and kept going.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this product is good.</li>
            <li>In a perfect world, we would all have flawless skin that would never break out and have tiny pores that never get blocked.</li>
            <li>Really love this product works great</li>
            <li>We love this!</li>
            <li>But once I figured it out I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and she can not get over how good it works,great item and a super great seller.</li>
            <li>After searching for it in vain, I decided to try this one because of the great reviews (even though mine had worked just fine).</li>
            <li>This thing works amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing thank</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I use this tool after the shower, I&#x27;ll place warm water on my face, and let it soak for a minute.</li>
            <li>I will take breaks every 3 minutes or so to re-dampen my face with warm water.</li>
            <li>was given a chance to review this product as part of a promotion, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Well to be honest.</li>
            <li>This popped up on as a promotional item to review for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice quality product.</li>
            <li>but kind of felt like it was one of those things that I shouldn&#x27;t spend money on...</li>
            <li>Seriously, it is so handy to have.  </li>
            <li>Everything I wrote here is my honest opinion on this product</li>
            <li>When you’re all done, just give it a rinse with warm water –</li>
            <li>RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>and it kind of hurts when you apply pressure with it to your skin.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and works great!  </li>
            <li>This tool was exactly what i was looking for :&#x3D;) Wonderful product !!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad that I was able to order this at a promotional discount in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to sanitize.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, but doesn&#x27;t work 2 good on the blackheads on your nose.</li>
            <li>Painless, easy!</li>
            <li>You do need to exert some pressure, though—a very light touch won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>This was easy to use, had a nice grip on it</li>
            <li>OMG so glad I have this.</li>
            <li>Love the item.</li>
            <li>and like better is the Tweezerman brand, not for sure.</li>
            <li>I started to use this tool and I am able to get the blackheads out without a struggle.</li>
            <li>This is such a great tool!  </li>
            <li>It can fit in my purse or make-up bag at work, it&#x27;s just amazing.  </li>
            <li>Much better than using fingertips which can just spread bacteria around.</li>
            <li>I did not expect much from this Blackhead and Whitehead Extractor but Malva Belle did a great job designing it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to do it or not.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>Love love love it..</li>
            <li>it seems from the reviews that this works well for most people.</li>
            <li>I feels that my fingernails do better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I was able to get info.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t work great on my blackheads at all</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to share it with you...</li>
            <li>I hope it helps. :)</li>
            <li>but I would like something that was more sturdy</li>
            <li>Also make sure you sterilize this before and after EVERY use.</li>
            <li>Seems to do the trick :)</li>
            <li>Much better meathod than using your fingers to pinch all the stuff out.</li>
            <li>Over all, I was pleased with this tool</li>
            <li>Love this tool</li>
            <li>I am pleased, fully satisfied</li>
            <li>Most reviews were 5 stars</li>
            <li>They contact me and offered a refound, just because I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>its an aswome thing i love it</li>
            <li>I was given a refund, I just want to thank them for such wonderful customer service.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to review this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you get even the occasional break out this tool is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>It is durable and is really able to extract any pus or debris in the pores.</li>
            <li>The thing that really impressed me about this product was that there were two different sides, which I had never seen before.</li>
            <li>tool is very easy to use, and easy to sanitize after using on my skin.</li>
            <li>The plus side besides the fact that it works is the packaging design; It&#x27;s super cute and durable!</li>
            <li>Very effective and highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>Love the Clear Skin Beauty Tool - durable, great quality.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove completely, but still works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>very cheap, Overall a great product for its price.</li>
            <li>This tool makes it so easy to remove the blackheads.</li>
            <li>this one bend easily.</li>
            <li>The handle has grooves making it easy to grasp and handle.</li>
            <li>Easily glides across the skin, removing all the yucky bits that were clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>It has easily popped some that I can never get because of where it is on my face</li>
            <li>The tool can be (and should be) sanitized easily in between uses.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to sanitize and extremely easy to clean after using – just clean with a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is effective whether you steam your face first or not.</li>
            <li>I know, you are supposed to put a warm compress on it and let it come to a head first,</li>
            <li>For me it works best after a hot shower to open my pores.</li>
            <li>This little tool is great!</li>
            <li>its the best little thing ever..</li>
            <li>I was squeezing all the time with my fingers, and I got scars by nail and made huge holes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Its gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Cheap metal.</li>
            <li>very helpful and effective</li>
            <li>I was offered to review it for free and I debated on it for a while.</li>
            <li>Great to see it removing the gunk from your face, leaving you with a clear and fresh face.</li>
            <li>The removal tool of the head is easy to use and it is not painful at all.</li>
            <li>A very useful tool to have on hand in the event you have one of these pop up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very simple tool but very effective.</li>
            <li>THIS LITTLE TOOL IS AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>but I have noticed blackheads appearing more consistently I needed to find something to help get these blackheads out of my pores.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I thought for sure I was hurting myself</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had blackheads on my nose, and was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Kind of upsetting since it&#x27;s brand new and was $11,</li>
            <li>I use this comedone extrctor to clean my pores.</li>
            <li>and bam you got clean pores without the nail marks &amp; bleeding going on.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, its great for those hard to get ones.</li>
            <li>and I was super excited to receive this just in time before I started to use my fingers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: still a great tool but found the exact same one sold at walmart for under $2</li>
            <li>Overall, product is good.</li>
            <li>I must say this tool actually does a really good job of removing blackheads from the nose and forehead area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very helpful for others</li>
            <li>A good solid product.</li>
            <li>Be careful pimple poppers, this will be your new best friend..</li>
            <li>It is really useful and convenience to clean pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of similar to cheap jewelry when the silver paint chips.</li>
            <li>By using this extractor tool, I can easily extract them all gently at home with no pain, or damaging the skin around the problem area.</li>
            <li>This tool is made from quality stainless steel, and has a no-slip grip, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as easily as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Such Cute Packaging!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with quality materials, I have had it for 2 months and it has yet to be bent out of shape (unlike the cheap ones that bent if you apply too much pressure) and its not rusty when I cleaned it with water.</li>
            <li>The tool nearly identical to this one in the different set I purchased is far more effective and much more sturdy.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to and you will see that you have to use a lot of pressure but it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m addicted, this tool is awesome once I figured out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li>The textured handle is great and it really does prevent it from slipping in your hand.</li>
            <li>: Their customer service is worth 5 stars so, i bumped up my rating.</li>
            <li>(Better for blackheads than whiteheads, in my experience so far.)</li>
            <li>All the above statements are solely my own</li>
            <li>but I decided if it works, it is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt that packing is super cute, too, I mean, who doesn&#x27;t love stuff like that!?</li>
            <li>When used right</li>
            <li>if you want to make sure it’s super clean, it’s all stainless steel, so you can use rubbing alcohol to get it totally disinfected without any fear of damaging the product.  </li>
            <li>Comparing with the Clear Skin one, I like the Clear Skin one so much better!</li>
            <li>Thankfully I now have this Malva Belle Clear Skin Beauty Tool in my bathroom, and extractions are easy</li>
            <li>You have to be super gentle</li>
            <li>was really intrigued to see this different style of extractor, so when I had a chance to try this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I jumped at the chance.  </li>
            <li>Wow wow wow.&lt;br /&gt;Very effective.</li>
            <li>Was very excited to try this with all the great reviews, but I must be doing something wrong because it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>, a good friend told me to stop tearing my face up and try this nifty little tool.</li>
            <li>I ordered this more on a whim than anything, I&#x27;d tried tools like this before that never worked, but this actually works!  </li>
            <li>I could not figure out how to use this thing at first..</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it :-)</li>
            <li>and it was ok on my husband&#x27;s white</li>
            <li>(if you can&#x27;t get it out don&#x27;t go nazi on it, just try the next day) and MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday after showering (it&#x27;s easier to use at that time) and it seemed to work.</li>
            <li>make sure your pores are open.</li>
            <li>I think for better results, i need to do this regularly.</li>
            <li>The product itself is made good not cheap.</li>
            <li>The steel is fine and there are no sharp edges.</li>
            <li>Trying this tool on the hard to reach area after a hot shower was amazing!  </li>
            <li>I recently started hearing about these removers and I was so excited to try one out!</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin clear of those issues and clean.</li>
            <li>Now I have to order a few more!</li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to really like this product, it doesn&#x27;t tend to be of any use unless I make sure to steam my face for fifteen minutes or so before, and even then its effectiveness seems to be limited for me.</li>
            <li>Nice little tool.</li>
            <li>The tool seems better suited for boils and cysts or very large black heads.</li>
            <li>The very day this arrived</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>My skin is really prone to acne of all kinds and I looked like a pizza all the times.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t really extract anything.</li>
            <li>not as I expected but ok</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>one does not have to apply much pressure.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>Helps pop pimples without doing as much damage as if you use your fingers to pop.</li>
            <li>/&gt;With only light pressure, the Blackhead Extractor can help unclog those stubborn pores.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I am very greatfull for that.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I find myself using it very often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of stainless steal</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super easy to remove black heads.</li>
            <li>but there were no marks left on my skin or anything (unlike marks that I have left with my own hands before).</li>
            <li>let you get a nice firm grip.  </li>
            <li>My other tool worked just fine, you press it against the skin and voila!</li>
            <li>Easy to use-wish I&#x27;d had one long ago.</li>
            <li>It is made of durable stainless steel with a textured no slip handle and comes with a full, no questions asked money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a hard time using this for black heads or &amp;#34;ready to pop&amp;#34; pimples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars because of the superb customer service.</li>
            <li>This is a stainless steal tool and would always recommend to spend a little more and get stainless steal.</li>
            <li>decided I would give this thing the benefit of the doubt and tried it after a hot shower - wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>When used after a hot shower to scrape lightly on skin, you can evidently get rid of some dead skin.</li>
            <li>GETTING RID OF BLACK AND WHITE HEADS EASY PEASY!!</li>
            <li>how quickly and easily little gobs of dirt and oil came right out of my pores and stuck to the metal tool!  </li>
            <li>I love that I can get those with a lot less pain and without tearing up my skin in the process.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this particular model</li>
            <li>One side features the classic wire loop, and the other side features a metal blade-like loop that offers greater precision and control over the area where you&#x27;re attempting to extract.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love that I don’t necessarily need to line it up right with a problem area – you can just run it back and forth over a larger area and it will get everything!  </li>
            <li>One end works well for whiteheads, and the other makes it easy to get those stubborn blackheads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to my results after a few more uses.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t leave dark marks for long and best of all, bare minimal to no scarring!</li>
            <li>Effectively and painlessly removes black and white heads.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from the ever popular &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; breakout, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>they kind they have at the drugstore where the ends have little tiny holes that you’re supposed to line up with the blackhead and push.  </li>
            <li>Wish I contacted them before I wrote a review (but I am new to online shopping).</li>
            <li>Good for deep and hard to reach problematic areas.</li>
            <li>I set out to try this out on my son and I was pleased with how well this worked, with very little effort on my part.</li>
            <li>My sons ears are finally clear!</li>
            <li>I really wish I had not spent ~12$ on this tool based solely on reviews written by incentive-fueled Amazon reviewers....</li>
            <li>Then I started giving it a try, and WOW!  </li>
            <li>I would just suggest to keep skin soft by steaming or putting warm towel prior to use because despite having safe and unsharp edges, the smooth loop can slice on a thick or previously sun-exposed skin or previously treated skin.</li>
            <li>This one is better quality (the metal feels more solid and heavy) and a lower price although the other one had multiple pieces.</li>
            <li>Based on the light frame, I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li>It was pain less and really worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I think the key here is to open your pores first!  </li>
            <li>White heads must be ready to be removed, when i tried too early, it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I will not be going back to the old style – this is SO much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not work on me no matter what i did including very steamy showers, different stength and angles of pressing; nothing worked at all.</li>
            <li>and I tried it, I found my old tool, thank goodness.</li>
            <li>Works OK, but leaves scars if you have delicate skin.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Redmond Facial Mud for a couple years and really like how it cleanses my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made, has a nice firm grip to it, so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hand even if they&#x27;re wet.</li>
            <li>The first thing that struck me when I unwrapped this is that it is clearly well made – the metal is very sturdy and ridges down the handle</li>
            <li>One side is easy to use (rounded) the other side (flat) doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>YOUR PORES ARE OPEN FIRST (steam/right after shower), also using a little oil (I prefer jojoba) over your skin before going into this breaks down the oil/dirt in your pores and helps prevent breaking capillaries from accidentally using too much pressure for this (which is easy to do).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many of these during the past several years.</li>
            <li>Not as useful as I hoped, but it is a better alternative than using your dirty hands to remove a blemish.</li>
            <li>This little tool is now in my make up bag with all my other favorite things.</li>
            <li>All my pores are clear and the little acne that I still have quickly clears up with regular use of my face washing and the extractor.  </li>
            <li>Over time I can see how this will definitely help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>For me personally, my pimples clear out after a week of using this tool and applying some pimple cream.  </li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t know if my skin is ultra sensitive or what, but it hurts and leaves red marks on my face.  </li>
            <li>It’s something I constantly struggle to keep up with – being a busy Mom</li>
            <li>so I expected this product to remove blackheads really well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; the tool itself works great, as will any other tool that has a similar design as this one.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how easy it was to use and how quickly it eliminated those stubborn blackheads that you get on the crease of your nose that are virtually impossible to get to with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Not sure why, I may not have as many black gead as I thought.</li>
            <li>I started with the thinner loop and just ran it with gentle pressure down my cheeks, nose, and chin.  </li>
            <li>I was a little timid at first, because I couldn&#x27;t imagine how something so simple could get rid of my pimples</li>
            <li>it helps squeeze pimples and blackheads without having to use a ton of force and since you don&#x27;t have to squeeze super hard, you won&#x27;t leave any marks.</li>
            <li>helps but doesn&#x27;t get down deep into really extracting the blackheads.</li>
            <li>It helps you get any bumps or blackheads that are in those hard to reach places like on the sides of your nose or forehead (since there&#x27;s not much skin there for leverage) and it is easy to sanitize after every use.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this tool to others who need a little help removing blackheads at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also is great for ones in difficult areas that I have a hard time popping.</li>

            <li> Once it got a good coating of gunk, I just wiped it on a tissue and kept going.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this product is good.</li>
            <li> In a perfect world, we would all have flawless skin that would never break out and have tiny pores that never get blocked.</li>

            <li> We love this!</li>
            <li> But once I figured it out I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> and she can not get over how good it works,great item and a super great seller.</li>
            <li> After searching for it in vain, I decided to try this one because of the great reviews (even though mine had worked just fine).</li>
            <li> This thing works amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing thank</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I use this tool after the shower, I&#x27;ll place warm water on my face, and let it soak for a minute.</li>
            <li> I will take breaks every 3 minutes or so to re-dampen my face with warm water.</li>
            <li> was given a chance to review this product as part of a promotion, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Well to be honest.</li>
            <li> This popped up on as a promotional item to review for an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice quality product.</li>
            <li> but kind of felt like it was one of those things that I shouldn&#x27;t spend money on...</li>
            <li> Seriously, it is so handy to have.  </li>
            <li> Everything I wrote here is my honest opinion on this product</li>
            <li> When you’re all done, just give it a rinse with warm water –</li>
            <li> RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> and it kind of hurts when you apply pressure with it to your skin.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and works great!  </li>
            <li> This tool was exactly what i was looking for :&#x3D;) Wonderful product !!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad that I was able to order this at a promotional discount in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to sanitize.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but doesn&#x27;t work 2 good on the blackheads on your nose.</li>
            <li> Painless, easy!</li>
            <li> You do need to exert some pressure, though—a very light touch won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> This was easy to use, had a nice grip on it</li>
            <li> OMG so glad I have this.</li>
            <li> Love the item.</li>
            <li> and like better is the Tweezerman brand, not for sure.</li>
            <li> I started to use this tool and I am able to get the blackheads out without a struggle.</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool!  </li>
            <li> It can fit in my purse or make-up bag at work, it&#x27;s just amazing.  </li>
            <li> Much better than using fingertips which can just spread bacteria around.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much from this Blackhead and Whitehead Extractor but Malva Belle did a great job designing it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to do it or not.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> okay..</li>
            <li> Love love love it..</li>
            <li> it seems from the reviews that this works well for most people.</li>
            <li> I feels that my fingernails do better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I was able to get info.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t work great on my blackheads at all</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to share it with you...</li>
            <li> I hope it helps. :)</li>
            <li> but I would like something that was more sturdy</li>
            <li> Also make sure you sterilize this before and after EVERY use.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick :)</li>
            <li> Much better meathod than using your fingers to pinch all the stuff out.</li>
            <li> Over all, I was pleased with this tool</li>
            <li> Love this tool</li>
            <li> I am pleased, fully satisfied</li>
            <li> Most reviews were 5 stars</li>
            <li> They contact me and offered a refound, just because I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> its an aswome thing i love it</li>
            <li> I was given a refund, I just want to thank them for such wonderful customer service.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to review this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you get even the occasional break out this tool is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> It is durable and is really able to extract any pus or debris in the pores.</li>
            <li> The thing that really impressed me about this product was that there were two different sides, which I had never seen before.</li>
            <li> tool is very easy to use, and easy to sanitize after using on my skin.</li>
            <li> The plus side besides the fact that it works is the packaging design; It&#x27;s super cute and durable!</li>
            <li> Very effective and highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> Love the Clear Skin Beauty Tool - durable, great quality.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove completely, but still works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> very cheap, Overall a great product for its price.</li>
            <li> This tool makes it so easy to remove the blackheads.</li>
            <li> this one bend easily.</li>
            <li> The handle has grooves making it easy to grasp and handle.</li>
            <li> Easily glides across the skin, removing all the yucky bits that were clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> It has easily popped some that I can never get because of where it is on my face</li>
            <li> The tool can be (and should be) sanitized easily in between uses.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to sanitize and extremely easy to clean after using – just clean with a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is effective whether you steam your face first or not.</li>
            <li> I know, you are supposed to put a warm compress on it and let it come to a head first,</li>
            <li> For me it works best after a hot shower to open my pores.</li>
            <li> This little tool is great!</li>
            <li> its the best little thing ever..</li>
            <li> I was squeezing all the time with my fingers, and I got scars by nail and made huge holes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Its gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Cheap metal.</li>
            <li> very helpful and effective</li>
            <li> I was offered to review it for free and I debated on it for a while.</li>
            <li> Great to see it removing the gunk from your face, leaving you with a clear and fresh face.</li>
            <li> The removal tool of the head is easy to use and it is not painful at all.</li>
            <li> A very useful tool to have on hand in the event you have one of these pop up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very simple tool but very effective.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE TOOL IS AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> but I have noticed blackheads appearing more consistently I needed to find something to help get these blackheads out of my pores.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I thought for sure I was hurting myself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had blackheads on my nose, and was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> Kind of upsetting since it&#x27;s brand new and was $11,</li>
            <li> I use this comedone extrctor to clean my pores.</li>
            <li> and bam you got clean pores without the nail marks &amp; bleeding going on.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, its great for those hard to get ones.</li>
            <li> and I was super excited to receive this just in time before I started to use my fingers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: still a great tool but found the exact same one sold at walmart for under $2</li>
            <li> Overall, product is good.</li>
            <li> I must say this tool actually does a really good job of removing blackheads from the nose and forehead area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very helpful for others</li>
            <li> A good solid product.</li>
            <li> Be careful pimple poppers, this will be your new best friend..</li>
            <li> It is really useful and convenience to clean pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of similar to cheap jewelry when the silver paint chips.</li>
            <li> By using this extractor tool, I can easily extract them all gently at home with no pain, or damaging the skin around the problem area.</li>
            <li> This tool is made from quality stainless steel, and has a no-slip grip, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as easily as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Such Cute Packaging!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with quality materials, I have had it for 2 months and it has yet to be bent out of shape (unlike the cheap ones that bent if you apply too much pressure) and its not rusty when I cleaned it with water.</li>
            <li> The tool nearly identical to this one in the different set I purchased is far more effective and much more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to and you will see that you have to use a lot of pressure but it is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted, this tool is awesome once I figured out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li> The textured handle is great and it really does prevent it from slipping in your hand.</li>
            <li> : Their customer service is worth 5 stars so, i bumped up my rating.</li>
            <li> (Better for blackheads than whiteheads, in my experience so far.)</li>
            <li> All the above statements are solely my own</li>
            <li> but I decided if it works, it is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt that packing is super cute, too, I mean, who doesn&#x27;t love stuff like that!?</li>
            <li> When used right</li>
            <li> if you want to make sure it’s super clean, it’s all stainless steel, so you can use rubbing alcohol to get it totally disinfected without any fear of damaging the product.  </li>
            <li> Comparing with the Clear Skin one, I like the Clear Skin one so much better!</li>
            <li> Thankfully I now have this Malva Belle Clear Skin Beauty Tool in my bathroom, and extractions are easy</li>
            <li> You have to be super gentle</li>
            <li> was really intrigued to see this different style of extractor, so when I had a chance to try this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I jumped at the chance.  </li>
            <li> Wow wow wow.&lt;br /&gt;Very effective.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to try this with all the great reviews, but I must be doing something wrong because it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> , a good friend told me to stop tearing my face up and try this nifty little tool.</li>
            <li> I ordered this more on a whim than anything, I&#x27;d tried tools like this before that never worked, but this actually works!  </li>
            <li> I could not figure out how to use this thing at first..</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it :-)</li>
            <li> and it was ok on my husband&#x27;s white</li>
            <li> (if you can&#x27;t get it out don&#x27;t go nazi on it, just try the next day) and MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday after showering (it&#x27;s easier to use at that time) and it seemed to work.</li>
            <li> make sure your pores are open.</li>
            <li> I think for better results, i need to do this regularly.</li>
            <li> The product itself is made good not cheap.</li>
            <li> The steel is fine and there are no sharp edges.</li>
            <li> Trying this tool on the hard to reach area after a hot shower was amazing!  </li>
            <li> I recently started hearing about these removers and I was so excited to try one out!</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin clear of those issues and clean.</li>
            <li> Now I have to order a few more!</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to really like this product, it doesn&#x27;t tend to be of any use unless I make sure to steam my face for fifteen minutes or so before, and even then its effectiveness seems to be limited for me.</li>
            <li> Nice little tool.</li>
            <li> The tool seems better suited for boils and cysts or very large black heads.</li>
            <li> The very day this arrived</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> My skin is really prone to acne of all kinds and I looked like a pizza all the times.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t really extract anything.</li>
            <li> not as I expected but ok</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> one does not have to apply much pressure.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> Helps pop pimples without doing as much damage as if you use your fingers to pop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;With only light pressure, the Blackhead Extractor can help unclog those stubborn pores.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> I am very greatfull for that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I find myself using it very often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of stainless steal</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super easy to remove black heads.</li>
            <li> but there were no marks left on my skin or anything (unlike marks that I have left with my own hands before).</li>
            <li> let you get a nice firm grip.  </li>
            <li> My other tool worked just fine, you press it against the skin and voila!</li>
            <li> Easy to use-wish I&#x27;d had one long ago.</li>
            <li> It is made of durable stainless steel with a textured no slip handle and comes with a full, no questions asked money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using this for black heads or &amp;#34;ready to pop&amp;#34; pimples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars because of the superb customer service.</li>
            <li> This is a stainless steal tool and would always recommend to spend a little more and get stainless steal.</li>
            <li> decided I would give this thing the benefit of the doubt and tried it after a hot shower - wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> When used after a hot shower to scrape lightly on skin, you can evidently get rid of some dead skin.</li>
            <li> GETTING RID OF BLACK AND WHITE HEADS EASY PEASY!!</li>
            <li> how quickly and easily little gobs of dirt and oil came right out of my pores and stuck to the metal tool!  </li>
            <li> I love that I can get those with a lot less pain and without tearing up my skin in the process.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this particular model</li>
            <li> One side features the classic wire loop, and the other side features a metal blade-like loop that offers greater precision and control over the area where you&#x27;re attempting to extract.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love that I don’t necessarily need to line it up right with a problem area – you can just run it back and forth over a larger area and it will get everything!  </li>
            <li> One end works well for whiteheads, and the other makes it easy to get those stubborn blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to my results after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t leave dark marks for long and best of all, bare minimal to no scarring!</li>
            <li> Effectively and painlessly removes black and white heads.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from the ever popular &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; breakout, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> they kind they have at the drugstore where the ends have little tiny holes that you’re supposed to line up with the blackhead and push.  </li>
            <li> Wish I contacted them before I wrote a review (but I am new to online shopping).</li>
            <li> Good for deep and hard to reach problematic areas.</li>
            <li> I set out to try this out on my son and I was pleased with how well this worked, with very little effort on my part.</li>
            <li> My sons ears are finally clear!</li>
            <li> I really wish I had not spent ~12$ on this tool based solely on reviews written by incentive-fueled Amazon reviewers....</li>
            <li> Then I started giving it a try, and WOW!  </li>
            <li> I would just suggest to keep skin soft by steaming or putting warm towel prior to use because despite having safe and unsharp edges, the smooth loop can slice on a thick or previously sun-exposed skin or previously treated skin.</li>
            <li> This one is better quality (the metal feels more solid and heavy) and a lower price although the other one had multiple pieces.</li>
            <li> Based on the light frame, I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li> It was pain less and really worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I think the key here is to open your pores first!  </li>
            <li> White heads must be ready to be removed, when i tried too early, it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I will not be going back to the old style – this is SO much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not work on me no matter what i did including very steamy showers, different stength and angles of pressing; nothing worked at all.</li>
            <li> and I tried it, I found my old tool, thank goodness.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but leaves scars if you have delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redmond Facial Mud for a couple years and really like how it cleanses my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, has a nice firm grip to it, so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hand even if they&#x27;re wet.</li>
            <li> The first thing that struck me when I unwrapped this is that it is clearly well made – the metal is very sturdy and ridges down the handle</li>
            <li> One side is easy to use (rounded) the other side (flat) doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> YOUR PORES ARE OPEN FIRST (steam/right after shower), also using a little oil (I prefer jojoba) over your skin before going into this breaks down the oil/dirt in your pores and helps prevent breaking capillaries from accidentally using too much pressure for this (which is easy to do).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many of these during the past several years.</li>
            <li> Not as useful as I hoped, but it is a better alternative than using your dirty hands to remove a blemish.</li>
            <li> This little tool is now in my make up bag with all my other favorite things.</li>
            <li> All my pores are clear and the little acne that I still have quickly clears up with regular use of my face washing and the extractor.  </li>
            <li> Over time I can see how this will definitely help keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> For me personally, my pimples clear out after a week of using this tool and applying some pimple cream.  </li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t know if my skin is ultra sensitive or what, but it hurts and leaves red marks on my face.  </li>
            <li> It’s something I constantly struggle to keep up with – being a busy Mom</li>
            <li> so I expected this product to remove blackheads really well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong; the tool itself works great, as will any other tool that has a similar design as this one.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how easy it was to use and how quickly it eliminated those stubborn blackheads that you get on the crease of your nose that are virtually impossible to get to with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, I may not have as many black gead as I thought.</li>
            <li> I started with the thinner loop and just ran it with gentle pressure down my cheeks, nose, and chin.  </li>
            <li> I was a little timid at first, because I couldn&#x27;t imagine how something so simple could get rid of my pimples</li>
            <li> it helps squeeze pimples and blackheads without having to use a ton of force and since you don&#x27;t have to squeeze super hard, you won&#x27;t leave any marks.</li>
            <li> helps but doesn&#x27;t get down deep into really extracting the blackheads.</li>
            <li> It helps you get any bumps or blackheads that are in those hard to reach places like on the sides of your nose or forehead (since there&#x27;s not much skin there for leverage) and it is easy to sanitize after every use.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this tool to others who need a little help removing blackheads at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also is great for ones in difficult areas that I have a hard time popping.</li>
            <li> This does not help in removing black heads or white heads that are normal.</li>
            <li> The tool is easier to hold and it works like other clear skin beauty tool.</li>
            <li> The only problem was the flat side doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Must have if you are looking for a tool to clear white or black heads.</li>
            <li> I tried it out, but the flat end for blackheads did not work on me at all.</li>
            <li> I prefer the flat end.</li>
            <li> This tool has a wire loop end to get rid of pimples and a flat loop to get rid of blackheads.</li>
            <li> But using this tool to extract them instead of dirty fingers will make sure they don&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> There is no pain or and it really does get into the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It helped me clear a lot of my blackheads without damaging my skin as well as a few whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Go slow and remember to be gentle.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my skin... but can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;ll be the same on other peoples&#x27; skins.</li>
            <li> People who have bad experiences with these are most likely not doing it correctly..</li>
            <li> Works on some but not all black heads and white heads</li>
            <li> The wire end was a little painful being sharp while the flat end only felt like pressure which enable me to apply more pressure and work the spot longer.</li>
            <li> Thankful that the company gave me my money back because this was not worth it!</li>
            <li> (I ordered this one because the extractor I previously ordered at a drugstore nearby was lost)  and there was scratches in the metal (the flat headed side).</li>
            <li> I already owned a tool like this, different brand, but I misplaced it.</li>
            <li> It works about 60% of the time, it&#x27;s not really a miracle tool.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts since all of my life I&#x27;ve had trouble with blackheads on my nose area -- ever since I was a child; nothing worked such as creams, and  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  </li>
            <li> Works as described but be careful.</li>
            <li> You simply place the loop around the pimple/blackhead and push down slightly.</li>
            <li> I think this item is pointless, it doesn&#x27;t really work at least not for me</li>
            <li> However, it is not much effective on white heads (even when I press and/or glide over with force)  and does not work at all on black heads, especially deep set ones.</li>
            <li> it did its job extremely well...</li>
            <li> tool i have seen for other facials i have used.</li>
            <li> Other models were slippery and would hit me in the eye.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me, even after steaming, hot showers...</li>
            <li> and I just applied a very minimal amount of pressure versus getting in there with my fingernails &amp; squeezing the heck out of it.</li>
            <li> Now I have 2 whiteheads unfortunately that I was able to get this in time to pull out!Yuck!I am tired of making myself bleed from using my fingernails</li>
            <li> Which lets be real here guys, that can get dangerous and gross.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I went so long without this little gadget in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> so it made it hard for the wire loop to do its job properly.</li>
            <li> Small, tiny little enlarged pores that may contain blackheads, probably not.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone that gets a lot of acne and has a hard time not just leaving them there.</li>
            <li> Was not worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d return it, but it&#x27;s not worth paying the postage the do so.</li>
            <li> This tool aids in the extraction of black and whiteheads the correct way.</li>
            <li> It took about 10 minutes and the black heads on my nose were gone.</li>
            <li> I had this product less than a day when it broke.</li>
            <li> We are always picking and messing at them with little to no success.</li>
            <li> Even my husband gets on to me about how I shouldn&#x27;t mess with them, but I do anyway.</li>
            <li> It gets into the tightest little spots by your nose and gets all those black heads..</li>
            <li> Some are made to withstand a little pressure and others made like</li>
            <li> Sorry to have to leave a negative comment after all of the positive ones.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble with the pimple tool; I think my face is a little too plump</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a blackhead extractor tool, but some how lost it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self is well constructed, not cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> but mine tends to bend after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I seem to be one of the few ones who did not receive any discount/incentive for purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> The round side is on the money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleaned out quite a few of my whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I have to press harshly</li>
            <li> This seems like it is very sturdy and well made, unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> not sure</li>
            <li> My only issue was difficultly using it on my nose</li>
            <li> Very few whiteheads/blackheads  were popped...</li>
            <li> Not a very good product.</li>
            <li> Other than being slightly painful and leaving a red spot, the device did not removed anything.</li>
            <li> It could be just me pressing too hard</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I found this tool not nearly as effective as tools in a set I bought afterward.</li>
            <li> So sorry I spent the money.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I do not think it&#x27;s performance lives up to the reviews&#x27; claims.</li>
            <li> This is cheap and horrible</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out horribly even after sanitizing the tool as directed, and the grip is not great, it slips out of your hand easily.</li>
            <li> It does pinch, just a bit, but is a lot less uncomfortable than trying to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Maybe my blackhead is much serious.</li>
            <li> I got this product and was a little skeptical because I have never used anything like this before.</li>
            <li> This tool actually helps push the pimples out, and seems to not be as painful!  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it causes hickey like marks, even with moderate pressure.</li>
            <li> Those ones can work, but I’ve found that they are difficult to line up on some parts of my face and boy with a stubborn blackhead, they hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have another blackhead remover that I bought from cvs randomly.</li>
            <li> It looked scary because I didn&#x27;t understand how to use it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is miserable because I keep finding black heads to pop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extracting blackheads is a dirty job, but someone has to do it.</li>
            <li> somewhat painful......</li>
            <li> I do not fell painful when I use this comedone extractor.</li>
            <li> As you probably know, trying to pop whiteheads and blackheads can be painful and can damage the skin.</li>
            <li> Useless product very disappointed</li>
            <li> Did nothing to my pimples :(</li>
            <li> Stupid  </li>
            <li> Does not work at all, hate, it</li>
            <li> This thing is a flimsy piece of crap.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use caution, this thing can be brutal to your skin.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I get horrible acne that I can&#x27;t help but try to get rid of.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as useful as I hoped, but it is a better alternative than using your dirty hands to remove a blemish.</li>
            <li> My item was delivered on time, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s described in the post I recommend it &amp; seller</li>
            <li> OMG so glad I have this. Made it easier to pop pimples.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all, hate, it</li>
            <li> I had one of these when I was a teen (not this brand), and was amazed at how well it worked back then. I would slide it over and watch the blackheads come out. This one doesn&#x27;t work on me at all. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this particular model or if it&#x27;s that my skin is different than it was in my teens (I&#x27;m 26 and didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d still have skin issues at this age...) Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> did not work on me no matter what i did including very steamy showers, different stength and angles of pressing; nothing worked at all.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love the item.</li>
            <li> I already owned a tool like this, different brand, but I misplaced it. After searching for it in vain, I decided to try this one because of the great reviews (even though mine had worked just fine). I tried it out, but the flat end for blackheads did not work on me at all. My other tool worked just fine, you press it against the skin and voila! Blackhead removed. The very day this arrived and I tried it, I found my old tool, thank goodness. The loop end of this tool does work fairly well, so I&#x27;m not too upset about spending money on it. I think the tool I have and like better is the Tweezerman brand, not for sure.</li>
            <li> The steel is fine and there are no sharp edges. I would just suggest to keep skin soft by steaming or putting warm towel prior to use because despite having safe and unsharp edges, the smooth loop can slice on a thick or previously sun-exposed skin or previously treated skin. So watch out! Overall, product is good.</li>
            <li> One side is easy to use (rounded) the other side (flat) doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> This little tool is great! My boyfriend has alot of blackheads, especially on the nose. We are always picking and messing at them with little to no success. Often he ends up with a red nose and nail marks and we still can&#x27;t the blackheads out. This tool makes it so easy to remove the blackheads. It works perfectly. It&#x27;s easy to clean. I am happy to recieve this item to review. We love this! What a great product!</li>
            <li> Did not work. Useless. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Works great! Awesome quality product as well!</li>
            <li> this tool works great...it did its job extremely well...thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on cheek whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Very effective and highly recommended product. There are two different styles of tips. I prefer the flat end. The wire end was a little painful being sharp while the flat end only felt like pressure which enable me to apply more pressure and work the spot longer. This is an ingenius product well-suited to the task.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to my pimples :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many of these during the past several years. I have a teenage son that uses it daily.  Some are made to withstand a little pressure and others made like this one bend easily. Based on the light frame, I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this on whiteheads and blackheads. Steamed the face (to open the pores). Then used the instrument as instructed. Other than being slightly painful and leaving a red spot, the device did not removed anything.</li>
            <li> works very well, I would recommend this item to my friends.</li>
            <li> The best extractor I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s made with quality materials, I have had it for 2 months and it has yet to be bent out of shape (unlike the cheap ones that bent if you apply too much pressure) and its not rusty when I cleaned it with water. Great buy!</li>
            <li> somewhat painful...... but beauty hurts.......&lt;br /&gt;Same tool i have seen for other facials i have used. White heads must be ready to be removed, when i tried too early, it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I have a lot of comedone on my nose. I use this comedone extrctor to clean my pores. It is really useful and convenience to clean pores. I do not fell painful when I use this comedone extractor. When I discover I have Zit popper, I use this comedone extract to remover it.</li>
            <li> This is a stainless steal tool and would always recommend to spend a little more and get stainless steal. It works good.</li>
            <li> This does not help in removing black heads or white heads that are normal. The tool seems better suited for boils and cysts or very large black heads. Worst of all, it causes hickey like marks, even with moderate pressure.</li>
            <li> This is one must have beauty tool. I have never thought I would need one but I have noticed blackheads appearing more consistently I needed to find something to help get these blackheads out of my pores. I started to use this tool and I am able to get the blackheads out without a struggle. The handle has grooves making it easy to grasp and handle. The removal tool of the head is easy to use and it is not painful at all. For those who have blackhead/whitehead issues should have one of these in their beauty kit.</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool!  My skin is really prone to acne of all kinds and I looked like a pizza all the times.  I ordered this more on a whim than anything, I&#x27;d tried tools like this before that never worked, but this actually works!  All my pores are clear and the little acne that I still have quickly clears up with regular use of my face washing and the extractor.  It fits in my hand and doesn&#x27;t slip.  Other models were slippery and would hit me in the eye.  This is truly a great product and is a must-have for those who suffer from acne!  It can fit in my purse or make-up bag at work, it&#x27;s just amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt that packing is super cute, too, I mean, who doesn&#x27;t love stuff like that!?</li>
            <li> Works OK, but leaves scars if you have delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne. I have blackheads all over my nose and cheeks. I got this product and was a little skeptical because I have never used anything like this before. What a difference! There is no pain or and it really does get into the hard to reach places. Over time I can see how this will definitely help keep my skin clear. I wish I would have found this sooner and saved myself some time and effort getting clearer skin.</li>
            <li> Rigid and sturdy, for what it is it works well.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a blackhead extractor tool, but some how lost it. I have been meaning to find another one, but it always slipped my mind. That is until I would be in front of the mirror trying to do at home extractions. I&#x27;d resort to using tweezers, which didn&#x27;t always do the best job. Thankfully I now have this Malva Belle Clear Skin Beauty Tool in my bathroom, and extractions are easy peasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t suffer from acne, I just get the occasional whitehead, and blackhead. I also suffer from clogged pores around my nose area. By using this extractor tool, I can easily extract them all gently at home with no pain, or damaging the skin around the problem area. I use this tool after the shower, I&#x27;ll place warm water on my face, and let it soak for a minute. Then I will start the extractions. One end works well for whiteheads, and the other makes it easy to get those stubborn blackheads. Easily glides across the skin, removing all the yucky bits that were clogging my pores. I will take breaks every 3 minutes or so to re-dampen my face with warm water. I find that the easiest way to do extractions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool is very easy to use, and easy to sanitize after using on my skin. Rubbing alcohol is all it takes! Much better than using fingertips which can just spread bacteria around. This is a great tool to have for your at home extractions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, but my son confiscated it.  He loves it.  Now I have to order a few more!</li>
            <li> Not a very good product. Works on some but not all black heads and white heads</li>
            <li> I did not expect much from this Blackhead and Whitehead Extractor but Malva Belle did a great job designing it. This tool has a wire loop end to get rid of pimples and a flat loop to get rid of blackheads. I must say this tool actually does a really good job of removing blackheads from the nose and forehead area. I had a bit of trouble with the pimple tool; I think my face is a little too plump so it made it hard for the wire loop to do its job properly. It is very easy to sanitize and extremely easy to clean after using – just clean with a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this a score of 4 out of 5 stars because the pimple end did not work for me, it will probably work great for others who do not have as plump of a face. It did a great job clearing up blackheads around my nose. I do recommend this tool to others who need a little help removing blackheads at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a chance to review this product as part of a promotion, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Great tool. Now as some people mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t work on EVERYTHING. Small, tiny little enlarged pores that may contain blackheads, probably not. If you have a pimple or blackhead that is visible, it does work. Yes, it does leave a mark on your skin, but that goes away. It&#x27;s just from pressure. It still hurts using this, because remember, you are still breaking your skin! There are two ends that are slightly different.</li>
            <li> Well to be honest. I could not figure out how to use this thing at first.. But once I figured it out I LOVE IT! its the best little thing ever.. It gets into the tightest little spots by your nose and gets all those black heads.. Even the ones you didn&#x27;t know was there! This popped up on as a promotional item to review for an honest opinion. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to do it or not. I am glad I did. There are 2 different tips on the ends. I tend to use the smaller end not sure why but that&#x27;s the one I prefer. I used to use the end of a pen and it worked okay.. this tool works perfect. I will never go back to a pen! Love love love it.. I highly recommend this tool. you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Nice quality product. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> When used right it&#x27;s super easy to remove black heads. It&#x27;s really easy to keep clean. It&#x27;s well made, has a nice firm grip to it, so it won&#x27;t slip out of your hand even if they&#x27;re wet.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for cleaning whiteheads  without leaving bruised areas.</li>
            <li> Quality product, it looks sturdy and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to really like this product, it doesn&#x27;t tend to be of any use unless I make sure to steam my face for fifteen minutes or so before, and even then its effectiveness seems to be limited for me. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very helpful for others but I think maybe I would benefit from a different shaped head or something.</li>
            <li> This seems like it is very sturdy and well made, unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t work for me! I&#x27;ve tried varying techniques and I&#x27;m not getting any results. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my skin type- it seems from the reviews that this works well for most people.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t make it work like in the YouTube video.</li>
            <li> This tool was exactly what i was looking for :&#x3D;) Wonderful product !!! I definitely recommend it :-)</li>
            <li> Works like a dream definitely a great skin care tool to have and great quality def reccomend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Redmond Facial Mud for a couple years and really like how it cleanses my skin. Good product.</li>
            <li> This is not for me. The overall product it&#x27;s self is well constructed, not cheap at all.  Although I don&#x27;t know if my skin is ultra sensitive or what, but it hurts and leaves red marks on my face.  It also doesn&#x27;t really extract anything.</li>
            <li> helps but doesn&#x27;t get down deep into really extracting the blackheads. I feels that my fingernails do better.</li>
            <li> This tool actually helps push the pimples out, and seems to not be as painful!  Great addition to our bathroom.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use this -- yet, but I can tell the product is of a good quality. Very nicely made.</li>
            <li> I found this tool not nearly as effective as tools in a set I bought afterward. The tool nearly identical to this one in the different set I purchased is far more effective and much more sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Works for some things but not others. Definitely is not a miracle tool and doesn&#x27;t get all the blackheads out. For me it works best after a hot shower to open my pores.</li>
            <li> This tool aids in the extraction of black and whiteheads the correct way. Good for deep and hard to reach problematic areas. When performed properly this tool helps reduces scarring. Simple to use and gets the job done. Be careful pimple poppers, this will be your new best friend..lol</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s a very simple tool, I had not used anything like it before. I was able to get info. online, it didn&#x27;t seem to benefit my personal needs. Would have sent it back, but I had been experimenting with it. So sorry I spent the money.</li>
            <li> Works great after a steamy shower.  Especially on the sides of my nose.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but doesn&#x27;t work 2 good on the blackheads on your nose. I bought this for my teens. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life? This thing works amazing. It took about 10 minutes and the black heads on my nose were gone. This is a basic necessity tool along with my tweezer and nail clipper. Must have if you are looking for a tool to clear white or black heads.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing! Like another reviewer wrote the directions were covered by a label but all you do is run it over your skin after a shower and it works!! Whiteheads gone! Painless, easy!</li>
            <li> not as I expected but ok</li>
            <li> This does the job. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. It helped me clear a lot of my blackheads without damaging my skin as well as a few whiteheads. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think the key here is to open your pores first!  I initially tried this tool on my skin before doing anything to it and I had mixed results.  It really didn&#x27;t work great on my blackheads at all and it was ok on my husband&#x27;s white head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I would give this thing the benefit of the doubt and tried it after a hot shower - wow, what a difference.  Once I did that, it was like using a biore pore strip.  I have had these clogged pores between my nose and cheeks that were forever clogged, and I didn&#x27;t think anything would remove them.  Trying this tool on the hard to reach area after a hot shower was amazing!  It really made a difference.  It was gross but I don&#x27;t have those clogged pores anymore - finally!  Now I know how to get them out.  Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great tool to add to the regimen!</li>
            <li> I use this daily on white heads. Its gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> A good solid product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on blackheads. Leaves marks in the skin.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try one of these but kind of felt like it was one of those things that I shouldn&#x27;t spend money on...so when I was given the chance to purchase one through a promotion I jumped at the chance.  I should have purchased one of these years ago.  Seriously, it is so handy to have.  Everyone needs one of these.  I know we are not supposed to pick at our faces but since we all do we might as well use a sanitary tool to do it with.  This is what you need.  It helps you get any bumps or blackheads that are in those hard to reach places like on the sides of your nose or forehead (since there&#x27;s not much skin there for leverage) and it is easy to sanitize after every use.  It takes some getting used to and you will see that you have to use a lot of pressure but it is definitely worth it.  The first time I used it I thought for sure I was hurting myself but there were no marks left on my skin or anything (unlike marks that I have left with my own hands before). Everything I wrote here is my honest opinion on this product and I&#x27;m glad to share it with you...I hope it helps. :)</li>
            <li> This tool is made from quality stainless steel, and has a no-slip grip, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as easily as I thought it would. I researched this tool online, and it looked like a great solution for blackhead removal, with minimum skin damage. It works about 60% of the time, it&#x27;s not really a miracle tool. It&#x27;s alright, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it knowing what I know now. Shrug.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use a bobby pin.</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
            <li> Useless product very disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted, this tool is awesome once I figured out one does not have to apply much pressure.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service.</li>
            <li> It does the job well but mine tends to bend after a few uses. It could be just me pressing too hard but I would like something that was more sturdy, maybe one solid unit like my dermatologist uses so there&#x27;s no chance of the material bending. I like that white heads and cysts popped using this tool don&#x27;t leave dark marks for long and best of all, bare minimal to no scarring! My skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all. Made my skin break out horribly even after sanitizing the tool as directed, and the grip is not great, it slips out of your hand easily. Was not worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> I seem to be one of the few ones who did not receive any discount/incentive for purchasing this item. My decision to buy this tool was based solely on the reviews here that others had left. Honestly, I do not think it&#x27;s performance lives up to the reviews&#x27; claims. When used after a hot shower to scrape lightly on skin, you can evidently get rid of some dead skin. However, it is not much effective on white heads (even when I press and/or glide over with force)  and does not work at all on black heads, especially deep set ones. I really wish I had not spent ~12$ on this tool based solely on reviews written by incentive-fueled Amazon reviewers....</li>
            <li> Such Cute Packaging! Works wonderful! Great grip!</li>
            <li> It was gross seeing the stuff come out but it works. You have to be super gentle (if you can&#x27;t get it out don&#x27;t go nazi on it, just try the next day) and MAKE SURE YOUR PORES ARE OPEN FIRST (steam/right after shower), also using a little oil (I prefer jojoba) over your skin before going into this breaks down the oil/dirt in your pores and helps prevent breaking capillaries from accidentally using too much pressure for this (which is easy to do). Also make sure you sterilize this before and after EVERY use. People who have bad experiences with these are most likely not doing it correctly..</li>
            <li> This is cheap and horrible</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick :)</li>
            <li> After multiple uses, I could not get this to work at all at removing zits.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using this for black heads or &amp;#34;ready to pop&amp;#34; pimples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars because of the superb customer service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I recently bought another set of dermatology/beauty instruments. This one is better quality (the metal feels more solid and heavy) and a lower price although the other one had multiple pieces. The only problem was the flat side doesn&#x27;t do anything. The round side is on the money though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product so far. I used it for the first time yesterday after showering (it&#x27;s easier to use at that time) and it seemed to work. It cleaned out quite a few of my whiteheads. My skin felt softer afterwards. You&#x27;ll will see some redness afterwards but it goes away. I&#x27;m looking forward to my results after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> I had this product less than a day when it broke. Cheap metal. Thankful that the company gave me my money back because this was not worth it!</li>
            <li> very cheap, Overall a great product for its price.</li>
            <li> Helps pop pimples without doing as much damage as if you use your fingers to pop. It has easily popped some that I can never get because of where it is on my face but it doesn&#x27;t always work. This is still a must have if you have problems with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: still a great tool but found the exact same one sold at walmart for under $2</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, its great for those hard to get ones. make sure your pores are open.</li>
            <li> This tool has became part of my routine for clearing out pimples.  For me personally, my pimples clear out after a week of using this tool and applying some pimple cream.  Much better meathod than using your fingers to pinch all the stuff out.</li>
            <li> Love the Clear Skin Beauty Tool - durable, great quality.  Effectively and painlessly removes black and white heads.  Great to see it removing the gunk from your face, leaving you with a clear and fresh face.</li>
            <li> In a perfect world, we would all have flawless skin that would never break out and have tiny pores that never get blocked. However, neither our world nor our skin are perfect. My skin has been problematic since I was a teenager and my son has been having a lot of problems with blackheads as he is approaching puberty.  As you probably know, trying to pop whiteheads and blackheads can be painful and can damage the skin. So, I was looking forward to trying a Blackhead Extractor from Malva Belle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With only light pressure, the Blackhead Extractor can help unclog those stubborn pores. The tool can be (and should be) sanitized easily in between uses. It is made of durable stainless steel with a textured no slip handle and comes with a full, no questions asked money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extracting blackheads is a dirty job, but someone has to do it. I set out to try this out on my son and I was pleased with how well this worked, with very little effort on my part. You simply place the loop around the pimple/blackhead and push down slightly. The actual popping/extraction is done instantaneously.  It does pinch, just a bit, but is a lot less uncomfortable than trying to squeeze. Plus, there was no skin damage with this tool. The textured handle is great and it really does prevent it from slipping in your hand. Over all, I was pleased with this tool and since I can&#x27;t buy flawless skin, this is a nice gadget to have on hand!</li>
            <li> I have been dying to get one of these and I finally did! We all have them and I know we have all tried to deal with it with our fingernails, fingers, or whatever you tried to do to get rid of them. I am talking about BLACKHEADS &amp; WHITEHEADS!!! Can&#x27;t forget those ZITS &amp; PIMPLES!! Now I have 2 whiteheads unfortunately that I was able to get this in time to pull out!Yuck!I am tired of making myself bleed from using my fingernails and then I end up with an inflamed pore!! This tool eliminates that problem for me and I was super excited to receive this just in time before I started to use my fingers.Which lets be real here guys, that can get dangerous and gross. This beauty tool has 2 loops at the end of each side that helps pull those whiteheads,blackheads out and bam you got clean pores without the nail marks &amp; bleeding going on. You can also use this tool to pop your pimples as well and get the puss out of there. A very useful tool to have on hand in the event you have one of these pop up. Keeps your skin clear of those issues and clean.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is miserable because I keep finding black heads to pop. Love this tool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a month, and have tried it several times with no results.  My daughter has also tried it, and it didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;d return it, but it&#x27;s not worth paying the postage the do so.</li>
            <li> I am pleased, fully satisfied</li>
            <li> Ever since my teenage years, I’ve suffered from clogged pores and blackheads on my face.  It’s something I constantly struggle to keep up with – being a busy Mom I just don’t have a ton of time to pamper myself with fancy masks and such to get all that dirt out.  I’ve used a different style of blackhead extractor before – they kind they have at the drugstore where the ends have little tiny holes that you’re supposed to line up with the blackhead and push.  Those ones can work, but I’ve found that they are difficult to line up on some parts of my face and boy with a stubborn blackhead, they hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really intrigued to see this different style of extractor, so when I had a chance to try this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I jumped at the chance.  The first thing that struck me when I unwrapped this is that it is clearly well made – the metal is very sturdy and ridges down the handle let you get a nice firm grip.  Then I started giving it a try, and WOW!  I started with the thinner loop and just ran it with gentle pressure down my cheeks, nose, and chin.  I am amazed at how quickly and easily little gobs of dirt and oil came right out of my pores and stuck to the metal tool!  Once it got a good coating of gunk, I just wiped it on a tissue and kept going.  I love that I don’t necessarily need to line it up right with a problem area – you can just run it back and forth over a larger area and it will get everything!  When you’re all done, just give it a rinse with warm water – if you want to make sure it’s super clean, it’s all stainless steel, so you can use rubbing alcohol to get it totally disinfected without any fear of damaging the product.  I will not be going back to the old style – this is SO much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad that I was able to order this at a promotional discount in order to evaluate and provide my honest review.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is good. I guess I just need to learn how to use these. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m properly using them. The product itself is made good not cheap.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to try this with all the great reviews, but I must be doing something wrong because it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Left a hole in my face that&#x27;s going on 3 weeks to heal so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Most reviews were 5 stars so I expected this product to remove blackheads really well. It was not the case for me. I had to use a lot of strength to start popping my pores. The end result was redness &amp; pain on my nose and marks from the removal tool all over. Very few whiteheads/blackheads  were popped... I&#x27;d take these 5 star reviews with a pinch of salt...  Update: Their customer service is worth 5 stars so, i bumped up my rating. If you&#x27;re already on the fence, try it. If this works for you, great; otherwise they stand by their 100% guarantee.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews on the website and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product.  I had my doubts since all of my life I&#x27;ve had trouble with blackheads on my nose area -- ever since I was a child; nothing worked such as creams, and  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I bought this, followed the instructions to the letter,  and it didn&#x27;t work -- not at all.  Sorry to have to leave a negative comment after all of the positive ones.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm,it was a gift and she can not get over how good it works,great item and a super great seller.</li>
            <li> very helpful and effective</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how well this works! (Better for blackheads than whiteheads, in my experience so far.) You do need to exert some pressure, though—a very light touch won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Very well made. My only issue was difficultly using it on my nose but it worked well on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> The tool is easier to hold and it works like other clear skin beauty tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had blackheads on my nose, and was really excited to try this product. Sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me, even after steaming, hot showers...you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did work great the one time I tried it on a whitehead, but that&#x27;s not what I want it for.</li>
            <li> A sturdy sleek design. Works great!</li>
            <li> I have another blackhead remover that I bought from cvs randomly. Comparing with the Clear Skin one, I like the Clear Skin one so much better! the ring edge is smoother so it doesn&#x27;t hurt when glides over my skin. I&#x27;m very happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing is a flimsy piece of crap. The second you use ANY tiny amount of pressure against your skin, it bends like rubber. DONT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Not sure why, I may not have as many black gead as I thought. Is a very good quality tool, though.&lt;br /&gt;This company has an excellent costumer service.They contact me and offered a refound, just because I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied. I am very greatfull for that. I will def will purchase again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE TOOL IS AMAZING!! MAKES GETTING RID OF BLACK AND WHITE HEADS EASY PEASY!! RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> its an aswome thing i love it</li>
            <li> My sons ears are finally clear!</li>
            <li> I think this item is pointless, it doesn&#x27;t really work at least not for me and it kind of hurts when you apply pressure with it to your skin.</li>
            <li> Wow wow wow.&lt;br /&gt;Very effective. It doesn&#x27;t remove completely, but still works great. I was squeezing all the time with my fingers, and I got scars by nail and made huge holes. But this thing doesn&#x27;t give me any scar, or holes either. I think for better results, i need to do this regularly.</li>
            <li> Edit: I was given a refund, I just want to thank them for such wonderful customer service. Wish I contacted them before I wrote a review (but I am new to online shopping). Thank you!! Changed to 5 stars from 3, hopefully the change shows up. (:&lt;br /&gt;Original: Don&#x27;t get me wrong; the tool itself works great, as will any other tool that has a similar design as this one. It is effective whether you steam your face first or not. However, the product is way overpriced... I got it in the mail today (I ordered this one because the extractor I previously ordered at a drugstore nearby was lost)  and there was scratches in the metal (the flat headed side). It&#x27;s kind of similar to cheap jewelry when the silver paint chips. Kind of upsetting since it&#x27;s brand new and was $11, but I guess it will have to do. Hopefully it will last a while. The plus side besides the fact that it works is the packaging design; It&#x27;s super cute and durable!</li>
            <li> It is amazing thank u</li>
            <li> I will admit i was terrified to try this. I was offered to review it for free and I debated on it for a while. It looked scary because I didn&#x27;t understand how to use it. Stupid  me, I never thought to look up instructions but I decided to give it a chance. Once it got it I had no choice but to look up the instructions and I&#x27;m so glad I decided to review this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is awesome it helps squeeze pimples and blackheads without having to use a ton of force and since you don&#x27;t have to squeeze super hard, you won&#x27;t leave any marks. It&#x27;s a very simple tool but very effective. I find myself using it very often. If you get even the occasional break out this tool is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I suffer from the ever popular &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; breakout, if you know what I mean. For years I have squeezed, pinched and even used a needle to get rid of pimples and blackheads. Well all that did was leave me with scars. I know, you are supposed to put a warm compress on it and let it come to a head first, well I&#x27;m impatient and also very stubborn when it comes to something on my face. I want it gone IMMEDIATELY!&lt;br /&gt;Well, a good friend told me to stop tearing my face up and try this nifty little tool. I could not believe how easy it was to use and how quickly it eliminated those stubborn blackheads that you get on the crease of your nose that are virtually impossible to get to with your fingers. This little tool is now in my make up bag with all my other favorite things. This was easy to use, had a nice grip on it and I just applied a very minimal amount of pressure versus getting in there with my fingernails &amp; squeezing the heck out of it. It was pain less and really worked better than I expected. It&#x27;s made of stainless steal so I know it will last and it is very easy to sanitize. I cannot believe I went so long without this little gadget in my makeup bag! It&#x27;s amazing. I highly recommend it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. All the above statements are solely my own and I maintain that this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I get horrible acne that I can&#x27;t help but try to get rid of. Even my husband gets on to me about how I shouldn&#x27;t mess with them, but I do anyway. I recently started hearing about these removers and I was so excited to try one out! I was a little timid at first, because I couldn&#x27;t imagine how something so simple could get rid of my pimples but I decided if it works, it is definitely worth a shot. It actually works! I couldn&#x27;t believe how simple it was either. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to make a crater where the blackhead was, which is something that gets me every time I pop them by hand. It also is great for ones in difficult areas that I have a hard time popping. Like ones in the creases on my nose. I love that I can get those with a lot less pain and without tearing up my skin in the process. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that gets a lot of acne and has a hard time not just leaving them there.</li>
            <li> This tool is great. It is durable and is really able to extract any pus or debris in the pores. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My nose and chin are blackhead and whitehead central. Gross. But using this tool to extract them instead of dirty fingers will make sure they don&#x27;t come back. The thing that really impressed me about this product was that there were two different sides, which I had never seen before. One side features the classic wire loop, and the other side features a metal blade-like loop that offers greater precision and control over the area where you&#x27;re attempting to extract. If you have blackheads or whiteheads and you&#x27;ve never had one of these, you should definitely try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and works great!  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something like this.</li>
            <li> Maybe my blackhead is much serious. I have to press harshly and it causes pain.</li>
            <li> Nice little tool. My daughter was happy to get it.</li>
            <li> Works as described but be careful. If you don&#x27;t use caution, this thing can be brutal to your skin. Go slow and remember to be gentle. That&#x27;s what she said. My esthetician.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my skin... but can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;ll be the same on other peoples&#x27; skins.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was hesitant. But it works. It does take the dirt out.</li>
            <li> Easy to use-wish I&#x27;d had one long ago.</li>
    </ol>
