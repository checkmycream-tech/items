            <li> I have purchased this cologne before from the same supplier. They are very quick with delivery and the packaging was done well. Of course my wife loves this cologne. Great way to put a smile on her face without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Was here early!  Light, fresh scent!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because I remembered smelling it  when I last visited Hawaii.  Plimerias are my favorite flower and this perfume smells just like them!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these not knowing what it smells like.  I just trusted the buyer comments, and I have to say I am very pleased.  I gave one to my mother in law for Christmas, and by sheer luck, this was the scent she has been searching for all over Hawaii.  I also have Gardenia which introduced me to this brand.  One time, one of the ladies at work approached me and said she was asked to find out what cologne I have on because i smell so amazing. You think I will share this with my co-workers?  Hell no.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a wonderful memory of a hawaiian vacation and a delightful scent...flowerly but not overwhelming.  The service was very personal - even a note from Sheilyn!  thank you</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice but it does not linger long at all.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, ever! It smells just like the real plumeria. I will order it again!</li>
            <li> Scent is good, just doesn&#x27;t last very long.  No eau de parfum offered?</li>
            <li> Wonderful! This is the only product worth buying.</li>
            <li> doesnt even smell like plumerias</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cologne ever since our last visit to Hawaii.  It is found elsewhere but we like to support the company directly.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I will buy!</li>
            <li> This purchase was a gift for a friend, the scent reminded her of her mama. When I gave it to her she about cried. Absolutely one of my best purchases. Sale was smooth, shipping was prompt, and her expression was PRICELESS!</li>
            <li> I bought this a gift for my mom.  Her favorite memories of Hawaii are all wrapped around the scent of the Plumeria flower.  I will buy for her again!</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  Will be reordering soon!</li>
            <li> AWESOME product! Had a minor mix up with the delivery due to being on a military base, but other than that everything was great!Bought it as a bday gift, for my sister, and she LOVED it! It totally exceeded my expectations and brought back memories of our Pacific Island home.&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts really long, major plus so you&#x27;re not having to reapply like other perfumes/colognes, and isnt at all overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> Too light of fragrance and has no staying power.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a sweet smelling perfume.. IT IS FOR A MORE MATURE CROWD! NOT FOR YOUNGER LADIES! I haven&#x27;t used this one time since I got it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom and she loves it!  She first found it at Disney when we were staying at the Polynesian and was very disappointed when they stopped carrying it.  I was so glad to find it here!  The product was exactly as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try because of the positive feedbacks from other buyers. And this product doesn&#x27;t disappoint me! It smells just like plumeria! There is no other stinky alcohol smell or synthetic scent at all, simply plumeria. I love to spread it on my bed before I go to sleep. Feel like I am immersing in the ocean of plumeria. I hope Royal Hawaiian will never stop producing this cologne!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance, I just love it, and wear it everyday. Will buy again. Prompt delivery.Thx.</li>
