            <li>Honestly these will rock your world-</li>
            <li>Cannot complain, Great price, received quickly and they do the job</li>
            <li>If you take good care of it, clean it well, disinfect them well ...</li>
            <li>This out works the more inexpensive types.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s pricey</li>
            <li>I gravitate towards this more than any of my brushes.</li>
            <li>and I have better control over it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it would work</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>Works better than a brush.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>thank u :)</li>
            <li>was debating on buying this, but glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I whip out my beauty blender and it blends it right in beautifully and really sets</li>
            <li>, it gives a seamless look, very nice applicator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best when you wet it!</li>
            <li>These are great, work lots better then the generic ones that I bought else where.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best tool ever.</li>
            <li>Super soft and blend makeup perfectly without absorbing the product into the sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>So quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>However when I tried to clean it, it ripped.</li>
            <li>These sponges really are better than the dupes I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I started contouring and it makes me look dewy and perfectly blended despite my clumsy hands.</li>
            <li>You can rewash it and use it as many times as you want, so you really get you money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spend this kind of money on them again, however, as I don&#x27;t think that they work THAT MUCH better than other methods of applying foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure these aren&#x27;t authentic beauty blenders, they have a different shape and feel than beauty blenders I have purchased before.</li>
            <li>They apply makeup just as good as the cheap, old style wedge puffs you find at your local drug store for just couple bucks for a full bag.</li>
            <li>Love my beauty blender so soft .</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the price....</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The material in this is worth pennies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new go to applicator, and it leaves a perfect finish and if you use it correctly you don&#x27;t waste product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not totally unsatisfied with the product as they work ok, but I would have preferred original beauty blenders.</li>
            <li>I bought the original Beauty Blenders cheaper than here at Camera Ready Cosmetics website</li>
            <li>Got it right on time...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I was able to save a few bucks in this wasteful purchase.</li>
            <li>I like them very much, but I like the white ones better.  </li>
            <li>You do get a wonderful finish and it reaches into all the difficult places.  </li>
            <li>first use my foundation brush to apply my liquid foundation all over</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most definitely never buy them again and post a video on my YouTube recommending them not.</li>
            <li>You notice no one is advertising the exact material these are made of</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be that amazing versus the millions of other latex blenders</li>
            <li>Gives a semi-dewy finish that&#x27;s pretty much like a airbrush finish.</li>
            <li>They do live up to the hype and are well worth the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blends my make up so fast and even.</li>
            <li>The product shipped fast and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>It really blends the makeup in.</li>
            <li>but these are lighter and SO much easier to blend with.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t see a difference on my face from when I use this or a brush.</li>
            <li>Applies much faster and smoother than my MAC/Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very durable as I&#x27;ve had mine for months</li>
            <li>The other brand was actually better.</li>
            <li>You need to purchase the cleaner too because they do not come clean with regular soap.</li>
            <li>The pink dye runs out on these when you clean them the first dozen or so times, so you wonder how much of that is on your face.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it !</li>
            <li>I find them much easier (and fun) to use than a regular brush or my fingertips.</li>
            <li>If you blend it in really well, it looks very natural with bobby brown foundation and shu uemura primer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This product is highly over rated</li>
            <li>and then I apply a little more using my beauty blender</li>
            <li>It is VERY soft and easy to apply foundation with (I always use it wet for this).</li>
            <li>Years ago there was a trend using real sea sponges and those were not any where near what they are charging for these.</li>
            <li>Worth the hype, I&#x27;d pay double the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal shape and size.</li>
            <li>I have a foundation brush (stippling brush) and there are certain areas where the blender is the only thing that really gives me the coverage and blending</li>
            <li>The beauty blender is usually soft but this felt cheap and rough.</li>
            <li>Plenty of less expensive alternatives that are as good or better.</li>
            <li>In addition, they consistently discharge pink ink every time you wet them, no matter how many times you wash they still discharge pink dye, which is totally gross.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean using antibacterial hand soap or sponge cleaner- don&#x27;t be afraid if all the color of foundation doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>out any product that you apply too much of (blush, bronzer)&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t clean, it&#x27;s just stained.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth the money or if a cheaper product would work as well.</li>

            <li> these babies will last you a VERY VERY long</li>
            <li> I could not live with out my Beauty Blender!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this due to the price and worry that it might not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> When you wash it, it fades - water is pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very great at make up application but this beautyblender makes my face look like it&#x27;s professionally done.</li>
            <li> I can also pass the other one on as a gift if I wanted to.  </li>
            <li> Did a test on one side of my face with this one and then another brand on the other side.</li>
            <li> It was a little larger and a little firmer.</li>
            <li> Not much but a little.</li>
            <li> Seriously, makes a big difference when applying foundation with this versus a typical sponge.</li>
            <li> They use less make then the generics as well.</li>
            <li> These Beauty Blenders ripped after just 5 usages and they are definitely not worth the price!</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> When you try with a brush or your finger it doesn&#x27;t blend and looks harsh.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money if you already have a brush.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday to apply my foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> I bought this one too and then bought a few others.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this helps all types of foundations,</li>
            <li> Be careful when taking them out of the thin plastic holder inside, it could cut into them.</li>
            <li> They should cost no more than couple bucks a piece.</li>
            <li> I am completely obsessed with this product.</li>
            <li> These felt fake to me.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Now I see why it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This out works the more inexpensive types. I will repurchase this item again. Blends my make up so fast and even.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a difference.  Use every day.</li>
            <li> When you wash it, it fades - water is pink.</li>
            <li> I could not live with out my Beauty Blender! This is the best blender and makeup applicator that I have ever used in my 42 years of life! I just wish I would have known about them sooner! Only been using them about 4 months now! So glad I was told about them!</li>
            <li> Been wanting to use these blenders since they came out in the market. The one I&#x27;m using does swell up when applied to water.  Handy to buy 2 at a time!  Not sure if this helps all types of foundations, but I noticed it makes a difference with those that tend to be streaky when applied with a brush.  I can also pass the other one on as a gift if I wanted to.  NOTE: Be careful when taking them out of the thin plastic holder inside, it could cut into them.</li>
            <li> I am completely obsessed with this product. Sure, it&#x27;s pricey but if you want your foundation to have a flawless finish then you need this in your makeup bag. You can rewash it and use it as many times as you want, so you really get you money&#x27;s worth. The product shipped fast and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> So quick and easy to use. Leaves face looking flawless!</li>
            <li> Works as great as promised! !</li>
            <li> I like using this. It really blends the makeup in. However when I tried to clean it, it ripped. Not much but a little. Good thing two came in the pack.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t put on foundation without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure these aren&#x27;t authentic beauty blenders, they have a different shape and feel than beauty blenders I have purchased before. I&#x27;m not totally unsatisfied with the product as they work ok, but I would have preferred original beauty blenders.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people like this but I just don&#x27;t get it. It didn&#x27;t make a difference with my make up.</li>
            <li> Hands down! This is my holy grail! I gravitate towards this more than any of my brushes. It&#x27;s light weight and I have better control over it. Now I see why it&#x27;s so expensive!</li>
            <li> I like them very much, but I like the white ones better.  The pink dye runs out on these when you clean them the first dozen or so times, so you wonder how much of that is on your face.  You do get a wonderful finish and it reaches into all the difficult places.  I keep buying them!  (They last for a couple months...)</li>
            <li> These felt fake to me. The beauty blender is usually soft but this felt cheap and rough. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great for make-up application and blending.  I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth the money or if a cheaper product would work as well.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this due to the price and worry that it might not live up to the hype. I purchased anyways and I am so happy I did! They do live up to the hype and are well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to disagree with the reviewer who says a brush works just as well. I have a foundation brush (stippling brush) and there are certain areas where the blender is the only thing that really gives me the coverage and blending I need. I especially use it for applying highlighter under my eyes. When you try with a brush or your finger it doesn&#x27;t blend and looks harsh. I whip out my beauty blender and it blends it right in beautifully and really sets it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first use my foundation brush to apply my liquid foundation all over and then I apply a little more using my beauty blender and it makes my face look airbrushed and flawless with even coverage. I highly recommend this product. You will notice a difference when compared to only using a brush.</li>
            <li> Cannot complain, Great price, received quickly and they do the job</li>
            <li> I purchased based on the reviews. However, I do not notice any difference in my makeup application. Would never purchase again. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Seriously, makes a big difference when applying foundation with this versus a typical sponge.</li>
            <li> The beauty blender is AMAZING! I&#x27;ll never use anything else to apply foundation but these things!</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Honestly these will rock your world- I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be that amazing versus the millions of other latex blenders but these are lighter and SO much easier to blend with. I get asked all the time now which foundation I use and I haven&#x27;t changed anything except using a damp beauty blender to apply! Worth the hype, I&#x27;d pay double the price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product!... I have like 6 of them already for my kit. But 2 were in need to replacement since it&#x27;s been used a million times already. If you take good care of it, clean it well, disinfect them well ... these babies will last you a VERY VERY long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side of my purchase... I received a defect. 1 of the 2 was in it&#x27;s normal shape and size. The 2nd one... I don&#x27;t know what happened. I think Wayne Szalinski went at it w/ his electromagnetic shrink ray or something. It was significantly smaller and thinner. I know It would expand when I put it in water and I&#x27;m sure it would work ok but when it dries up it&#x27;ll go back to that miniature size. But seller is helping w/ getting a good one. So not the seller&#x27;s fault!</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t see a difference on my face from when I use this or a brush. It all comes out the same. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money if you already have a brush.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best tool ever. Applies much faster and smoother than my MAC/Sigma brushes. Gives a semi-dewy finish that&#x27;s pretty much like a airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product and couldn&#x27;t beat this price for a duo</li>
            <li> These sponges really are better than the dupes I&#x27;ve purchased. Super soft and blend makeup perfectly without absorbing the product into the sponge.</li>
            <li> Love my beauty blender so soft .</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!! I use them everyday to apply my foundation and concealer. It&#x27;s so fast and I always get a flawless finish!</li>
            <li> my daughter already took one - she flipped out when she saw that I bought them.  They are great</li>
            <li> These are a great tool for foundation! I find them much easier (and fun) to use than a regular brush or my fingertips. They&#x27;re very durable as I&#x27;ve had mine for months and it&#x27;s working like a charm!</li>
            <li> Must have beauty product.</li>
            <li> The best for application of liquid make up</li>
            <li> wonderful product. I would recommend it to every one.</li>
            <li> These are great, work lots better then the generic ones that I bought else where.  They use less make then the generics as well.</li>
            <li> wonderful item&lt;br /&gt;Thank Seller</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money. I&#x27;m not very great at make up application but this beautyblender makes my face look like it&#x27;s professionally done. I started contouring and it makes me look dewy and perfectly blended despite my clumsy hands. LOVE THIS. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone and everyone. It&#x27;s best when you wet it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new go to applicator, and it leaves a perfect finish and if you use it correctly you don&#x27;t waste product!</li>
            <li> This tool is a beauty must-have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses:&lt;br /&gt;Apply liquid foundation&lt;br /&gt;Apply powder (even when damp)&lt;br /&gt;Blend out concealer&lt;br /&gt;Blend out any product that you apply too much of (blush, bronzer)&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pricey, but it is unlike any sponge you will use. It is VERY soft and easy to apply foundation with (I always use it wet for this). It is easy to clean using antibacterial hand soap or sponge cleaner- don&#x27;t be afraid if all the color of foundation doesn&#x27;t come out. That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t clean, it&#x27;s just stained.</li>
            <li> I bought the original Beauty Blenders cheaper than here at Camera Ready Cosmetics website and I&#x27;m glad I was able to save a few bucks in this wasteful purchase. This product is highly over rated and I don&#x27;t understand all the fuss about them. They apply makeup just as good as the cheap, old style wedge puffs you find at your local drug store for just couple bucks for a full bag. These Beauty Blenders ripped after just 5 usages and they are definitely not worth the price! In addition, they consistently discharge pink ink every time you wet them, no matter how many times you wash they still discharge pink dye, which is totally gross. I&#x27;ll most definitely never buy them again and post a video on my YouTube recommending them not. They should cost no more than couple bucks a piece.</li>
            <li> If you blend it in really well, it looks very natural with bobby brown foundation and shu uemura primer. Works better than a brush.</li>
            <li> Love. You need to purchase the cleaner too because they do not come clean with regular soap.</li>
            <li> I am using this beautyblender in conjunction with my Sigma Kabuki brush.  I am using the tip for smoothing out concealer, it gives a seamless look, very nice applicator.</li>
            <li> I like these. A lot. I wouldn&#x27;t spend this kind of money on them again, however, as I don&#x27;t think that they work THAT MUCH better than other methods of applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Got it right on time...thank u :)</li>
            <li> was debating on buying this, but glad I did.  Makeup is well blended.  I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Love my beauty blenders!</li>
            <li> Luv it..... I recommend this product to anyone... A little pricey but it was worth the price.... Can&#x27;t say it enough luv this product</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever bought! It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth the money. If you use as directed it works beautifully! I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Very nice addition to my beauty routine. Leaves an airbrushed look that I love!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it !</li>
            <li> Plenty of less expensive alternatives that are as good or better. I bought this one too and then bought a few others. Did a test on one side of my face with this one and then another brand on the other side. The other brand was actually better. It was a little larger and a little firmer. You notice no one is advertising the exact material these are made of so you can compare apples to apples. Sponge is sponge, its all hype. Save your money. Years ago there was a trend using real sea sponges and those were not any where near what they are charging for these. The material in this is worth pennies.</li>
