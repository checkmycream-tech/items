            <li>Good product, advertised correctly.</li>
            <li>Good deal...</li>
            <li>good product. ..</li>
            <li>I love this because it gives a good coverage without making your skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I have now bought my own.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer and light creamy feeling cream.</li>
            <li>I had the original prime time and loved it.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be fair and on the pink side but the medium shade blends perfectly with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This goes on wonderful and hides my pores for applying my bare minerals make up!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It also gives you more sunscreen</li>
            <li>Having tried many products of this type, always to be left wanting in terms of either coverage or color, this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Glad I made a mistake and got this bottle.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from a local merchant, and I think it is excellent.</li>
            <li>I Love bareMinerals products and I especially love the original clear primer</li>
            <li>Still trying to find a light weight, allergy free, blemish covering Sunscreen for my face and neck.</li>

            <li>I will stick with the original primer</li>
            <li>so I really was expecting to love this BB</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed especially with all the rave and especially the price!</li>
            <li>I went back to the store to buy more of the original</li>
            <li>bareMinerals products especially the primer always go on so smooth and easy, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>It works better with a sponge, and I use a shade that is much darker than my natural complexion, because that is all the merchant had for one thing, and also because the darker shade helps neutralize the redness I have.</li>
            <li>My teen daughters love this as well.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, however it is expensive.</li>
            <li>The consistency is a little more liquid like compared to the original.</li>
            <li>so much.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel heavy and greasy, which is not at all nice.</li>
            <li>I do really like it so far</li>
            <li>It did not feel like a primer at all, more like a heavy cream foundation.</li>
            <li>but they had this new tinted one.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but I do no feel it does what they show &amp; talk about completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy coverage and doesn&#x27;t change color after all day wear.</li>
            <li>I wear this under my bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li>My skin is mature and tends to the dry side.</li>

            <li> I love this product. I had the original prime time and loved it. I went back to the store to buy more of the original but they had this new tinted one. I decided to try this one. The consistency is a little more liquid like compared to the original. I love this because it gives a good coverage without making your skin feel greasy. My teen daughters love this as well.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed especially with all the rave and especially the price!</li>
            <li> I Love bareMinerals products and I especially love the original clear primer so I really was expecting to love this BB Primer.&lt;br /&gt;Not so much.  bareMinerals products especially the primer always go on so smooth and easy, but not this one. It did not feel like a primer at all, more like a heavy cream foundation. I will stick with the original primer</li>
            <li> I really hate this product. Makes my face feel heavy and caked</li>
            <li> This was not as helpful as i thought it wld be</li>
            <li> Purchased this on recommendations from Sophora. It was cheaper on Amazon than at Sophora. It’s supposed to be oil-free. It’s not. It makes my skin feel heavy and greasy, which is not at all nice. Worse yet, it oxidized to a sick looking orange within an hour. This one is going back. Still trying to find a light weight, allergy free, blemish covering Sunscreen for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I received this tinted primer way before I expected it to arrive.  The product is amazing (as one would expect from bareMinerals)!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I do no feel it does what they show &amp; talk about completely. It doesn&#x27;t blend the redness &amp; blotchy spots as shown &amp; I even bought both shades.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer and light creamy feeling cream. I wear this under my bare minerals powder. It also gives you more sunscreen</li>
            <li> This goes on wonderful and hides my pores for applying my bare minerals make up! Would not go without it, make up turns out flawless with this primer!</li>
            <li> Having tried many products of this type, always to be left wanting in terms of either coverage or color, this is perfect for me. I stayed at my daughter&#x27;s house recently and she left me this to try. I have now bought my own. My skin tends to be fair and on the pink side but the medium shade blends perfectly with my skin tone. It&#x27;s not heavy coverage and doesn&#x27;t change color after all day wear. My skin is mature and tends to the dry side. I don&#x27;t use this product as a primer. It&#x27;s my all-in-one foundation. A little moisturizer after cleansing, then on goes the Prime Time. I like the fact that it&#x27;s SPF30. No worries about sunburn. No extra products.</li>
            <li> Good deal... good product. ..</li>
            <li> Light and smooth.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I do really like it so far but it has a weird smell that my original Prime Time didn&#x27;t have. I would purchase again though. I probably should have gotten the light but that&#x27;s my fault.</li>
            <li> Glad I made a mistake and got this bottle.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, however it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a local merchant, and I think it is excellent. I think the reviewer who complained about the color and consistency probably used too much, and did not blend it in enough.
