            <li> On time I receive the item in Colombia, without damage, and good quality</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed that I ordered this product from Amazon.  I ordered a bottle for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and ordered a bottle for my self as well.  I ordered the product on February 7th and still had not received the product or any notification from Amazon on March 1st.  I finally had to track down a customer service person (which was not easy) and they didn&#x27;t know where the product was either.  They said that they would credit my account and that was about the end of it.  No real apology for having missed my daughter&#x27;s birthday or what happened.  I don&#x27;t think I will use amazon again.[[ASIN:B000P22ZX8 Delices De Cartier By Cartier For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz]]</li>
            <li> This was sent very fast to me. The price was AWESOME. I wear it all the time and all my friends were jealous. Everything about this purchase was a success. Please I totally recommend this to anyone. The smell of the perfume is intoxicating and Sexy!&lt;br /&gt; Thanks!</li>
            <li> This perfume is very elegant I first smelled it on my doctor and she smells amazing in it,  this is all she wears</li>
            <li> Awesome deal!  Classy fresh notes. You&#x27;ll get many compliments</li>
            <li> This perfume has a light and fresh scent. I used it on a daily basis and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> i went ahead and bought this even after reading the bad reviews and i learned my lesson.&lt;br /&gt;its watery and doesnt last at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;think twice about buying this cologne. if it has oe star means something must be wrong.</li>
            <li> For a men&#x27;s scent, this would be okay, but it&#x27;s a bit too masculine for a woman, in my opinion. My husband asked me why I felt compelled to wear men&#x27;s cologne. Not good. Ladies, pass this one up. Guys, it&#x27;s all on you.</li>
            <li> I bobught this for a friend as a christmas gift bought I was unhappy when I found out that the product came in without the cover and the package was damaged. Well, at least the content was intact.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite fragrance. It is a unisex scent, so some women may not LOVE it but I absolutely adore it. It smells fresh and clean and can be worn in winter and in the summertime. I always receive compliments when I wear it. The fragrance lasts and when it does fade it&#x27;s a bit sweeter. As with any fragrance, some love it, some don&#x27;t.. but this is always something I must have. If you like fresh, clean fragrances you would like this (other clean fragrances: clean warm cottom, clean by dlish, ck1, ckb.. I can go on and on. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product; awesome price! I&#x27;ve purchased this product before at a much higher price, and it was difficult to find.  This made it easy.</li>
            <li> I have worn the Cartier fragrances for many many years. You can&#x27;t possibly go wrong with this line of intoxicating fragrances. I wore the Cartier Mens Fragrances, too, before they were called UNISEX. What&#x27;s not to love!?! ;o)</li>
            <li> excellent very goog, thank you</li>
            <li> Great perfume! Love this scent!&lt;br /&gt;The product is the original! I wonder why some other reviewers implied it is fake.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d say this about Cartier but I got this bottle tonight and it smells like nothing!  It smells like salt water.&lt;br /&gt;I probably just got a bad bottle, b/c Cartier is usually great, but this is tap water!&lt;br /&gt;I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is great b/c they refunded my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon!  And I usually have very good luck buying fragrances on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It is lot less than stores.  Werher it is real or not, I don&#x27;t see any difference.  It smells good as the ones in the stores.  I buy this all the time</li>
            <li> Wonder scent for women--have worn for 10+ years. Young and old continue to want name. Clear color scent is floral. Perfect for women.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but because it is an outdated product the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> Is the best!!! I have tryed a lot of perfumes and thiis is the best!! And the price here is bettet tjan dutys free shopps!!</li>
            <li> I did not get what I asked for. I was supposed to get the eau de parfum. That is what the picture described. The description amazon provided was lousy and when I got the package  I called customer service right away because this is not the product I wanted. They told me they could not take the product back and gave me a lousy $15. I was extremely upset because this was a gift for my boyfriend and it was obviously the wrong product. BEWARE of the picture and read the description before buying.</li>
            <li> This is the best light scented spray ever made. It smells really good and I would recommend the unisex spray to everyone</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it&#x27;s classic and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the perfume will shop again</li>
