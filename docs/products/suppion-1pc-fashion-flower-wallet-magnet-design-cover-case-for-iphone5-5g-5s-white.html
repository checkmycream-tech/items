            <li> Admittedly this case is quite beautiful, but it literally cannot hold anything. It can maybe hold one or two cards, but not all the cards I need it to hold.&lt;br /&gt;And the plastic case that the phone clips into breaks easily.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, it&#x27;s just not worth it unless you just want to protect the screen in your pocket book.</li>
            <li> Wow very pleased with product and delivery was fast, even coming all the way from China. Very satisfied with thiscompany</li>
            <li> delicate &amp; feminine...really like thias case</li>

            <li> It was what my wife wanted</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was plastic not cloth</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; get many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Product is good condition looks nice&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how durable it will be after opening and closing many times...time will tell. Seems nice product especially for money paid.  Does take quite some time to get mailed to you about 2 to 3 weeks so don&#x27;t be in a rush!</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend, she loved it.</li>
            <li> I love my case! It got here in the allotted time.</li>
            <li> Cute cute cute love it&lt;br /&gt;Looks like a little wallet&lt;br /&gt;My iPhone fits perfectly</li>
            <li> happy with the product , she love it</li>
            <li> My phone looks extra pretty in this case. Fits perfect</li>
            <li> Fits perfect in the iPhone 5, and looks just like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;The material doesn&#x27;t sees cheap, and I can take pictures with the case put.</li>
            <li> This was not the case I ordered but as so many have pointed out, it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost of returning it. That being said, if it was the right case, I would have gotten what I paid for quality wise. They only last a few months under normal wear and tear but hey...what can you expect at this price point? I just wish I could have received the item I did pay for.</li>
            <li> Not too well made but is holding up for 2 months now - for Under $3.00 can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> It really don&#x27;t hold the phone in</li>
            <li> Pretty little case. It can hold up to 2 credit cards and couple dollar bills in the pocket. Not too shabby for the price!</li>
            <li> For the price I paid for this case it&#x27;s worth. Not the highest quality but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Arrived very late, didn&#x27;t fit my iPhone, very plasticy, have to throw in trash cause it would be over $6 in shipping to return.  Not happy.&lt;br /&gt;Kiran A.</li>
