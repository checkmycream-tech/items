            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I did not buy it for the mascara but ended up loving it!</li>
            <li>Love the formula and the applicator, they go hand in have to give the perfect volume and separation.</li>
            <li>liked the mascara and the primer a lot!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try many of Too Faced products, and this was the best way to do it.</li>
            <li>So, Too Faced&#x27;s primed and poreless does make your face appear flawless, which I love.</li>
            <li>All in all, it is a good purchase in order to sample the products.</li>
            <li>Because I loved the concealer by this brand, I decided to buy this sample beauty kit.</li>
            <li>but the costmore sirvies was really good</li>
            <li>The primer is good quality and I will use -</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved the packaging and the size of it</li>
            <li>I loved the Lipgloss and Lashgasm mascara, will probably get the full-sizes.</li>
            <li>Love these products!</li>
            <li>That is for sure!</li>
            <li>These shades are super sexy, bringing out your best features like magic!</li>
            <li>I was using Mary Kay primer before and while it did its job &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice amount of product to get a feel for them.</li>
            <li>The lip gloss is a nice color and isn&#x27;t too sticky, I&#x27;d wear it and that&#x27;s saying something since I&#x27;m not a gloss girl.</li>
            <li>it nice</li>
            <li>Ive discovered I liked them</li>
            <li>I think is particularly good for my T zone, cause it will make my foundation and powder look better for longer&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great way to sample the products before you invest in a full size.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great products and worth trying</li>
            <li>I love their products and own many of them.  </li>
            <li>and Poreless, again a major awesome primer.</li>
            <li>I have used MANY shaow primers and Too Faced and Tarte Amazonian clay</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t to sure about trying this brand sight unseen.</li>
            <li>I knew most of these products, but some</li>
            <li>The face primer, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the constant search for the perfect Mascara.</li>
            <li>I love the eye and face primers.</li>
            <li>And I wish there was more in the bottles.</li>
            <li>i love the eye primer</li>
            <li>I love the face primer.</li>
            <li>The shadow primer isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>I love the eyelid and face primers in this set -</li>
            <li>I have to say my favorite part of this box is the mascara (Lashgasm)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>The travel size is nice because it allows you to sample the products instead of buying the full size.</li>
            <li>My husband and I are bikers and this is perfect for packing for a limited space.</li>
            <li>I really liked the price first of all.</li>
            <li>These little products are perfect for your purse or weekend out of town trips.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my eyeshadow crease free.</li>
            <li>The face primers make my skin so smooth and</li>
            <li>I think that it was supposed to be those free samples u get after any purchase at sephora</li>
            <li>everything else is fantastic</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the lip insurance because I don&#x27;t wear lipstick that often that tends to bleed - but it&#x27;s nice to have on the event that I do.</li>
            <li>The shadow insurance works great, though it doesn&#x27;t really last all day.</li>
            <li>very worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Lashgasm mascara is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>Love this whole kit!</li>
            <li>I love them all so much!</li>
            <li>- it goes on cleanly and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all on my lower eye.</li>
            <li>The lip gloss and poreless primer were nothing special.</li>
            <li>I probably would have been better off to just buy a full size of the eyelid primer, which is really what i wanted to try.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really makes sure that your makeup sticks.</li>
            <li>So whether I purchase a full size or not is up in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Glamor</li>
            <li>I can notwait to purchase a full size of this.</li>
            <li>Loved it, especially the shadow insurance!!</li>
            <li>Considering you get five products, it&#x27;s not a bad kit.</li>
            <li>All in all, not a bad kit.</li>
            <li>A great way to test out the various cosmetic aids without spending a ton of money on a large bottle of something you will never use up.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear off so quickly.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing extraordinary about it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the mascara the most; I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the lip gloss; it was a little too light for my comfort.</li>
            <li>I bought these for an xmas gift for my sister, and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;The size of the items are actually pretty generous, considering it&#x27;s essentially a sample</li>
            <li>Buy this adorable little sample kit and you too will say that Too Faced is one of your favorite cosmetics!</li>
            <li>The other products were all pretty good, nothing super special but not bad.</li>
            <li>loved every single product!</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the money however.</li>
            <li>I know now its all worth it, If you have a doubt that you may not like it</li>
            <li>wedding- well worth it.</li>
            <li>That being said, I only liked three of these products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, though, the price of the kit was worth it for just the eyelid and face primer.</li>
            <li>The lip primer dried up very quickly in the tube but was pretty good and considering it was a sample size I suppose it served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>About 2 years ago I purchased a Too Faced Concealer and absolutely loved it, however never bought any other products from the brand as I already was stocked pretty full on makeup.</li>
            <li>The whole set is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I received it right before her birthday</li>
            <li>The only items I really love in this are the lip gloss &amp; the mascara.</li>
            <li>the eye primer really makes my shadow stay well!</li>
            <li>and I wish they were larger samples :).</li>
            <li>the primer is exactly as is says poreless.</li>
            <li>i love trying new  make up but hate paying full price and then not liking them this sample pack is great because now i know that i love the poreless and the lip primer</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful in a light pink with slight sparkle.</li>
            <li>Considering I have many other lip glosses this won&#x27;t be purchased as a full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had I liked the other two, I would have given the kit five.</li>
            <li>This kit was smaller than I expected for a five-piece collection,But I think the price on this is great.</li>
            <li>These items are just small samples, but it was nice to try each of them before considering splurging on the full size versions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my lipstick featuring ever and most my lipstick is long wear anyway.</li>
            <li>What a great little kit, I love to try before I commit to a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s tingly when it goes on, a pretty pink color, and it does feel like it makes your lips fuller :)</li>
            <li>Seller shipped them fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the primer and the mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the lip primer too often.</li>
            <li>Two of these products really WOWED me, the shadow insurance eyelid primer and the Lashgasm mascara.</li>
            <li>The lip insurance I can&#x27;t tell if it works really.</li>
            <li>and it really separates my lashes.</li>
            <li>, it is VERY sticky.</li>
            <li>The eye primer really didn&#x27;t hold up to its end of the bargain.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much of anything on my face, except when I&#x27;m going out with my hubby.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t give much volume</li>
            <li>The sizes are slightly smaller than I originally thought</li>
            <li>with many of my other lip sticks/glosses</li>
            <li>I bought this for my friend who was pretty new to high end makeup, I figured it would be a food variation of products for her to try.</li>
            <li>The reason is that there&#x27;s a super close up picture on the page, really exaggerating what size it actually is.</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing full sized products in the future.</li>
            <li>This kit was smaller than I expected but Too Faced has an amazing product line</li>
            <li>My second favorite is definitely the gloss -</li>
            <li>face primer, mascara...multifaceted personality in a cute little box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even after eating, running around with three kids, I&#x27;d say my gloss stayed on for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>Then I came across this kit and it&#x27;s priced just right and prefect timing too because I have a trip next month</li>
            <li>All of these products are my new favorites.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work well &amp; is nearly identical to the primer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard mixed reviews on various Too Faced products - this is a really good intro to a few things.</li>
            <li>The package is a bit smaller than I expected, but still totally worth it!!</li>
            <li>least favorite is the lip plumper cause</li>
            <li>I generally use Maybelline New York Expert Wear or NYX Pigments.</li>
            <li>I love them all, and they are small enough for travel which is a bonus!</li>
            <li>On the second coat they seem thicker and it doesn&#x27;t really clump if you wait for it to dry between coats.</li>
            <li>It works wonders with my Be A Bombshell (in Hot Mess) but</li>
            <li>I am a bit picky when it comes down to things with mint, and I think this one has too much mint on it sort of speak.</li>

            <li> So whether I purchase a full size or not is up in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Glamor</li>
            <li> I can notwait to purchase a full size of this.</li>
            <li> Loved it, especially the shadow insurance!!</li>
            <li> Considering you get five products, it&#x27;s not a bad kit.</li>
            <li> All in all, not a bad kit.</li>
            <li> A great way to test out the various cosmetic aids without spending a ton of money on a large bottle of something you will never use up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wear off so quickly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing extraordinary about it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the mascara the most; I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the lip gloss; it was a little too light for my comfort.</li>
            <li> I bought these for an xmas gift for my sister, and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;The size of the items are actually pretty generous, considering it&#x27;s essentially a sample</li>
            <li> Buy this adorable little sample kit and you too will say that Too Faced is one of your favorite cosmetics!</li>
            <li> The other products were all pretty good, nothing super special but not bad.</li>
            <li> loved every single product!</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the money however.</li>
            <li> I know now its all worth it, If you have a doubt that you may not like it</li>
            <li> wedding- well worth it.</li>
            <li> That being said, I only liked three of these products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, though, the price of the kit was worth it for just the eyelid and face primer.</li>
            <li> The lip primer dried up very quickly in the tube but was pretty good and considering it was a sample size I suppose it served it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago I purchased a Too Faced Concealer and absolutely loved it, however never bought any other products from the brand as I already was stocked pretty full on makeup.</li>
            <li> The whole set is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I received it right before her birthday</li>
            <li> The only items I really love in this are the lip gloss &amp; the mascara.</li>
            <li> the eye primer really makes my shadow stay well!</li>
            <li> and I wish they were larger samples :).</li>
            <li> the primer is exactly as is says poreless.</li>
            <li> i love trying new  make up but hate paying full price and then not liking them this sample pack is great because now i know that i love the poreless and the lip primer</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful in a light pink with slight sparkle.</li>
            <li> Considering I have many other lip glosses this won&#x27;t be purchased as a full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had I liked the other two, I would have given the kit five.</li>
            <li> This kit was smaller than I expected for a five-piece collection,But I think the price on this is great.</li>
            <li> These items are just small samples, but it was nice to try each of them before considering splurging on the full size versions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my lipstick featuring ever and most my lipstick is long wear anyway.</li>
            <li> What a great little kit, I love to try before I commit to a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tingly when it goes on, a pretty pink color, and it does feel like it makes your lips fuller :)</li>
            <li> Seller shipped them fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the primer and the mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the lip primer too often.</li>
            <li> Two of these products really WOWED me, the shadow insurance eyelid primer and the Lashgasm mascara.</li>
            <li> The lip insurance I can&#x27;t tell if it works really.</li>
            <li> and it really separates my lashes.</li>
            <li> , it is VERY sticky.</li>
            <li> The eye primer really didn&#x27;t hold up to its end of the bargain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much of anything on my face, except when I&#x27;m going out with my hubby.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t give much volume</li>
            <li> The sizes are slightly smaller than I originally thought</li>
            <li> with many of my other lip sticks/glosses</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who was pretty new to high end makeup, I figured it would be a food variation of products for her to try.</li>
            <li> The reason is that there&#x27;s a super close up picture on the page, really exaggerating what size it actually is.</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing full sized products in the future.</li>
            <li> This kit was smaller than I expected but Too Faced has an amazing product line</li>
            <li> My second favorite is definitely the gloss -</li>
            <li> face primer, mascara...multifaceted personality in a cute little box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after eating, running around with three kids, I&#x27;d say my gloss stayed on for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> Then I came across this kit and it&#x27;s priced just right and prefect timing too because I have a trip next month</li>
            <li> All of these products are my new favorites.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well &amp; is nearly identical to the primer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard mixed reviews on various Too Faced products - this is a really good intro to a few things.</li>
            <li> The package is a bit smaller than I expected, but still totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> least favorite is the lip plumper cause</li>
            <li> I generally use Maybelline New York Expert Wear or NYX Pigments.</li>
            <li> I love them all, and they are small enough for travel which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> On the second coat they seem thicker and it doesn&#x27;t really clump if you wait for it to dry between coats.</li>
            <li> It works wonders with my Be A Bombshell (in Hot Mess) but</li>
            <li> I am a bit picky when it comes down to things with mint, and I think this one has too much mint on it sort of speak.</li>
            <li> Especially because the price is very high for such a small amount of makeup.</li>
            <li> The other three were pretty mediocre for a higher end product.</li>
            <li> I was VERY worried that after reading some reviews these products were really small, however I&#x27;ve been consistently using them for the past month (with the exception of the face primer as I switch on and off with my usual</li>
            <li> I have never had a primer hold my makeup in place all day long, but these do!</li>
            <li> You will find that these little gems last a long time!</li>
            <li> set.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the price for the set is much less expensive that purchasing each item individually!&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up! :)</li>
            <li> The items are small but they last a long time i would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like the tiny mascara, but I&#x27;m not huge into mascara either.</li>
            <li> I will be repurchasing the shadow insurance, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the only problem is the tubes r too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other items.</li>
            <li> Def not worth paying anything for it</li>
            <li> The primer was outstanding, except it seemed to make be break out badly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little iffy on.</li>
            <li> The lip primer works a little bit, but my lipstick still needs to be reapplied</li>
            <li> it was missing</li>
            <li> The small size does not overshadow the product.</li>
            <li> When my usual face primer runs out I will be switching to this primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received this package in the mail, I thought these would be too small.</li>
            <li> Way way waaaay too small sample.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> but my one complaint Is the mascara&#x27;s brush -</li>
            <li> and I hated the Lip Insurance (totally irritated my mouth!)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very expensive but small!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These little products are perfect for your purse or weekend out of town trips. My husband and I are bikers and this is perfect for packing for a limited space. Love these products!</li>
            <li> As described/pictured. A collection of some of the best Too Faced items! I have used MANY shaow primers and Too Faced and Tarte Amazonian clay are my 2 all time faves. Mascara in this kit is great too! Great intro kit to familiarize oneself with Too Faced!</li>
            <li> the only problem is the tubes r too small. The lip primer helps my lip color, lipstick last longer. It doesn&#x27;t wear off so quickly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure about trying this brand sight unseen. Then I came across this kit and it&#x27;s priced just right and prefect timing too because I have a trip next month and I don&#x27;t want to back a lot of big bottles! I look froward to using this kit!</li>
            <li> I knew most of these products, but some I didn&#x27;t.  So I went for the buy,  either way I love them all, and they are small enough for travel which is a bonus! Seller shipped them fast. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The small size does not overshadow the product. I really like the primer and the mascara. They work perfectly with the eyeshadow.  I don&#x27;t really use the lip primer too often. I&#x27;m a lip gloss girl. All in all, it is a good purchase in order to sample the products.</li>
            <li> Some of the products did cause irritation, but not all of them. I enjoyed the mascara the most; I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the lip gloss; it was a little too light for my comfort.</li>
            <li> This set of products worked well for me because I wanted to try the primers out before purchasing a larger sized tube. I did not buy it for the mascara but ended up loving it! All in all these products worked well and were great.</li>
            <li> The seller made this product appear larger than it actually is, despite posting specs on it in text. The reason is that there&#x27;s a super close up picture on the page, really exaggerating what size it actually is. Especially because the price is very high for such a small amount of makeup. The eyeshadow/lip gloss/blush packs are all this way too, fyi! They&#x27;re very expensive but small! However, the shades are perfect! makeup bought in stores has shades that often make you look like a hooker. These shades are super sexy, bringing out your best features like magic! The eyeshadow insurance is a joke though. It doesn&#x27;t work well &amp; is nearly identical to the primer! The only items I really love in this are the lip gloss &amp; the mascara. The primer was outstanding, except it seemed to make be break out badly!</li>
            <li> A great way to test out the various cosmetic aids without spending a ton of money on a large bottle of something you will never use up.</li>
            <li> Two of these products really WOWED me, the shadow insurance eyelid primer and the Lashgasm mascara. The other three were pretty mediocre for a higher end product. The lip primer dried up very quickly in the tube but was pretty good and considering it was a sample size I suppose it served it&#x27;s purpose. The lip gloss and poreless primer were nothing special. I have seen drugstore makeup do the same thing. It was definitely worth the money however. I will be repurchasing the shadow insurance, a little goes a long way so it&#x27;s a great investment. The Lashgasm mascara is my new favorite! Love the formula and the applicator, they go hand in have to give the perfect volume and separation.</li>
            <li> These items are just small samples, but it was nice to try each of them before considering splurging on the full size versions. Great products!</li>
            <li> These samples are a great size and you can get a lot a lot out of them. They&#x27;re great products and worth trying</li>
            <li> The sizes are slightly smaller than I originally thought but it&#x27;s still a nice amount of product to get a feel for them. The eyeshadow insurance is great. A little goes a long way. It helps keep my eyeshadow crease free. The face primer, it&#x27;s okay. I can&#x27;t tell that it makes my pores smaller but it helps my foundation blend well over my acne scars. The lip insurance I can&#x27;t tell if it works really. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with my lipstick featuring ever and most my lipstick is long wear anyway. The lip gloss is a nice color and isn&#x27;t too sticky, I&#x27;d wear it and that&#x27;s saying something since I&#x27;m not a gloss girl. Can&#x27;t tell that it makes my lips bigger though. And the mascara is awesome. It&#x27;s a tiny bristle brush and it really separates my lashes. On the second coat they seem thicker and it doesn&#x27;t really clump if you wait for it to dry between coats. I just wish it was waterproof. I&#x27;d give this mini set a B -.</li>
            <li> i love trying new  make up but hate paying full price and then not liking them this sample pack is great because now i know that i love the poreless and the lip primer</li>
            <li> What a great little kit, I love to try before I commit to a more expensive brand. I know now its all worth it, If you have a doubt that you may not like it this kit is what your looking for!</li>
            <li> These are real small samples of the original products. Just for one or two uses. Rather buy the full-size versions.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago I purchased a Too Faced Concealer and absolutely loved it, however never bought any other products from the brand as I already was stocked pretty full on makeup. I FINALLY ran out of eye primer and was close to running out of mascara and decided I wanted to try a &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; product. Because I loved the concealer by this brand, I decided to buy this sample beauty kit. I am absolutely in love. All of these products are my new favorites. I was VERY worried that after reading some reviews these products were really small, however I&#x27;ve been consistently using them for the past month (with the exception of the face primer as I switch on and off with my usual primer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Too Faced Shadow insurance will now forever be my go to shadow primer. This stuff really makes sure that your makeup sticks. I was using Mary Kay primer before and while it did its job &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; this stuff is amazing. I generally use Maybelline New York Expert Wear or NYX Pigments. It is PERFECT for my NYX pigment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Primed and Poreless, again a major awesome primer. When my usual face primer runs out I will be switching to this primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Lip Insurance- I&#x27;m still a little iffy on. It works wonders with my Be A Bombshell (in Hot Mess) but with many of my other lip sticks/glosses it&#x27;s drying and doesn&#x27;t work all that well. So whether I purchase a full size or not is up in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Glamor Gloss- I like this. It smells like Vanilla Frosting but has a tingle sensation when you put it on. I like those aspects however, it is VERY sticky. Which I&#x27;m not a fan of. The color is beautiful in a light pink with slight sparkle. Considering I have many other lip glosses this won&#x27;t be purchased as a full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Lashgasm Mascara- I don&#x27;t even know where to start with this product. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. I&#x27;m on the constant search for the perfect Mascara. All the time. I think I have several tubes of mascara in my makeup bag now. I can notwait to purchase a full size of this. This works with my lashes both uncurled and curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all Too Faced has made me a lover of their products and this kit was perfect to get a feel for all of their primers.</li>
            <li> Amazing products! That is for sure! The package is a bit smaller than I expected, but still totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> I WANTED TO TRY things from too face but dont want to buy the big ones. it nice i didn&#x27;t get to try the face primer it was missing but the costmore sirvies was really good but know i know what to get</li>
            <li> I really liked the price first of all. When I received this package in the mail, I thought these would be too small. But a little bit goes a long way. I love the eye and face primers. The face primers make my skin so smooth and the eye primer really makes my shadow stay well! Love this whole kit! I would totally buy it again!</li>
            <li> This kit was smaller than I expected but Too Faced has an amazing product line and I will be purchasing full sized products in the future.</li>
            <li> Perfect way to try out all of the products and it is great for travel. I love them all so much!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to sample the products before you invest in a full size.  Each one is the best.  The eye-shadow primer is awesome.  It does not change the way your shadow goes on or blends, yet it does make your shadow last till bedtime.</li>
            <li> loved every single product! very worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I liked the mascara and the primer a lot! I will buy them again!</li>
            <li> I bought these for an xmas gift for my sister, and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;The size of the items are actually pretty generous, considering it&#x27;s essentially a sample set.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the price for the set is much less expensive that purchasing each item individually!&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up! :)</li>
            <li> I am.  Wearing there products as I type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here it is 10 pm here in Hawaii and I applied mine at 7 am this morning.  It&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye primer, lip primer, face primer, mascara...multifaceted personality in a cute little box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great way to test each product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than anywhere else I have seen.</li>
            <li> Way way waaaay too small sample. Def not worth paying anything for it it&#x27;s so small I think that it was supposed to be those free samples u get after any purchase at sephora</li>
            <li> I bought it because Ive been wanted to test out these products. Ive discovered I liked them and I wish they were larger samples :).</li>
            <li> awesome! great products and price</li>
            <li> I probably would have been better off to just buy a full size of the eyelid primer, which is really what i wanted to try.  The other products were all pretty good, nothing super special but not bad.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all items but I did try the lip and was impressed. It actually worked. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the other items.</li>
            <li> Buy this adorable little sample kit and you too will say that Too Faced is one of your favorite cosmetics! There is not a product in there that I haven&#x27;t continued to buy in the larger sizes. You will find that these little gems last a long time! Once you are hooked, I suggest that you continue to buy this as I do for your on the go purse make up bag! You won&#x27;t be sorry-you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
            <li> This kit was smaller than I expected for a five-piece collection,But I think the price on this is great. And I wish there was more in the bottles.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing i love the eye primer it keeps your eye shadow on from am to pm and the lip primer is awesome. The items are small but they last a long time i would buy this again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing!!! the primer is exactly as is says poreless. not a big fan of the lip color but everything else is fantastic</li>
            <li> Loved it, especially the shadow insurance!! My eyeshadow stayed on for the entire wedding- well worth it. I did not notice a difference with the lip primer. The travel size is nice because it allows you to sample the products instead of buying the full size.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try many of Too Faced products, and this was the best way to do it. I love the face primer. One of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The shadow primer isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Considering you get five products, it&#x27;s not a bad kit. That being said, I only liked three of these products. The mascara is a bit on the clumpy side. There&#x27;s nothing extraordinary about it. The lip primer definitely kept the gloss on for awhile. Even after eating, running around with three kids, I&#x27;d say my gloss stayed on for more than a few hours. The eye primer really didn&#x27;t hold up to its end of the bargain. It didn&#x27;t make my eye shadow color pop, nor did it stay. I&#x27;d say after an hour or two, my eye shadow started to fade. The primed and poreless is actually comparable to Clinique&#x27;s instant perfector with minimizing the size of your pore&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t wear much of anything on my face, except when I&#x27;m going out with my hubby. So, Too Faced&#x27;s primed and poreless does make your face appear flawless, which I love. All in all, not a bad kit. I gave it three stars only because it was one star for each product. Had I liked the other two, I would have given the kit five.</li>
            <li> The mascara is amazing! makes your eyelashes look awesome and it will stay in place for hours.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow primer will make your eyeshadow last for hours, and it will look like you just put your makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;The lip primer is really great too, it will make the increases on your lips dissapear and will make the lipstick stay on longer&lt;br /&gt;The poreless face primer I think is particularly good for my T zone, cause it will make my foundation and powder look better for longer&lt;br /&gt;My least favorite is the lip plumper cause I am a bit picky when it comes down to things with mint, and I think this one has too much mint on it sort of speak. But if you like mint you won&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> I love the eyelid and face primers in this set - I have never had a primer hold my makeup in place all day long, but these do! And they go on great. I&#x27;m not into lip gloss, and this one doesn&#x27;t impress me. I like the tiny mascara, but I&#x27;m not huge into mascara either. The lip primer works a little bit, but my lipstick still needs to be reapplied occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, though, the price of the kit was worth it for just the eyelid and face primer. When I run out, I&#x27;m definitely getting the full-size versions.</li>
            <li> For a five-piece collection, I think the price on this is great. I have to say my favorite part of this box is the mascara (Lashgasm) - it goes on cleanly and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all on my lower eye. I don&#x27;t really use the lip insurance because I don&#x27;t wear lipstick that often that tends to bleed - but it&#x27;s nice to have on the event that I do. The shadow insurance works great, though it doesn&#x27;t really last all day. The primer is good quality and I will use - I think I prefer Porefessional overall however. My second favorite is definitely the gloss - it&#x27;s tingly when it goes on, a pretty pink color, and it does feel like it makes your lips fuller :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who was pretty new to high end makeup, I figured it would be a food variation of products for her to try. I received it right before her birthday and she loved it. The whole set is worth the money! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I love their products and own many of them.  This is a great starter trier kit.  Always buy their items.</li>
            <li> I loved the packaging and the size of it I haven&#x27;t used all the items yet but my one complaint Is the mascara&#x27;s brush - I&#x27;m not a fan of these brushes I feel it hurts the eyelash and it doesn&#x27;t give much volume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard mixed reviews on various Too Faced products - this is a really good intro to a few things. I loved the Lipgloss and Lashgasm mascara, will probably get the full-sizes. The primer products (shadow and face) worked okay and I hated the Lip Insurance (totally irritated my mouth!)</li>
