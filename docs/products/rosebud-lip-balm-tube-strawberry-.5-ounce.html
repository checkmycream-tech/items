            <li>My boyfriend steals some too, because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>I prefer a thicker lip balm at night (pure lanolin works great-- I use Dr. Lipp), but for daytime this tin is perfect to toss in your bag and apply as needed.</li>
            <li>So happy to see my favorite balm came in a tube.</li>

            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li>Still love it because it&#x27;s easier to put on in a tube then using your finger!</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm ever!</li>
            <li>and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Smooth and great coverage.</li>
            <li>nice smelling but does not work for chapped lips to my liking- would not recommend for smoothing lips-</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, mild scent and makes my lips feel good.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice scent, not too sweet.</li>
            <li>You would get more of a better quality product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lip balms from Chapstik to La Mer and this by far is the best lip balm out there.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips so soft and they taste great!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products and the good thing is that it lasts a long time like a couple years</li>
            <li>It is pleasant, a fresh strawberry scent.</li>
            <li>This product works like miracles, makes your lips healthy and shiny</li>
            <li>They have a different consistency but they&#x27;re both wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and lightly scented.</li>
            <li>And its strawberry flavoring is light and perfect, not heavy, perfumey, or phony tasting.</li>
            <li>one more night</li>
            <li>We had tried everything couldn&#x27;t believe that a lip balm worked better than any healing balm for skin we had tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love the strawberry scent and the way it feels on my lips.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes my lips better than the chapstick.</li>
            <li>I LOVE rosebud Strawberry lip balm.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>So glad that amazon carries this.</li>
            <li>I use the home one more to keep my lips moistened.  </li>
            <li>I love the flavor and it has a hint of color as well as a shine.  </li>
            <li>Makes it so much more easier to use.</li>
            <li>I love Rosebud Lip Balm.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using this exclusively and drinking more water.  </li>
            <li>ok, there are plenty of products for that.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just put it on at night and my lips feel wonderful all day long at work.</li>
            <li>i loved the no mess of the tube versus the pot as I feel it&#x27;s more handy and hygenic.  </li>
            <li>Nice to use in the morning and freshen through the day with good old Chapstick.</li>
            <li>I love this and love that it is so light on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you have sensitive skin, too.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, has a very nice scent/flavor, lasts a long time, and keeps my lips moist and healthy!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s better than C.O. Bigelows Rose Salve which I absolutely adore.</li>
            <li>I do find the smell to be quite strong</li>
            <li>It is affordable, works well, feels and smells nice, and comes in a pretty tin that makes me feel fancy and old-fashioned.</li>
            <li>huge tin too.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>It glides on with the consistency of Vaseline, as is smooth and not sticky.</li>
            <li>Treating my lips with this fabulous balm feels like an indulgence.</li>
            <li>Soooo happy that I finally found it in a tube-yeah!!</li>
            <li>if your young child has chapped lips, this is one balm that doesn&#x27;t burn, just soothes, heals and smells good.</li>
            <li>It smells great, is not sticky at all, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The other flavors are good too, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>my lips are nice, soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I saw Smith&#x27;s lip balm on a list of top lip balms and really like the fact that it was in a tube instead of a pot</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would most likely buy more of it once this one runs out.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice but that&#x27;s not enough for me to stay.</li>
            <li>I like to apply this before bed, and wake up with soft smooth lips!</li>
            <li>Wish it were in a smaller container for easy carrying in my purse, but this one is fine to leave at home.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great relief for us that suffer from severe dry skin, and many other conditions as well.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and will definitely buy more the minute I run out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other Smith salves and this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>My 2.5 year-old-daughter always wants to smell my lips when I have it on!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Good texture, not too thin and not too sticky  Light strawberry flavor, doesn&#x27;t make you want to eat your lips  </li>
            <li>It smells great, makes my lips feel silky and soft, and it isn&#x27;t messy.</li>
            <li>Less is more at times!</li>
            <li>This is a great product too bad it is not sold in stores more people would use it it&#x27;s been around for almost a hundred years.</li>
            <li>The tin is HUGE, I think this will last forever</li>
            <li>It works very well under lipstick because it moisturizes but is not too slippery.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but I received the tin and really wanted the tube as pictured and mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li>They tend to get very irritated and also peel.</li>
            <li>it doesnt really do much for color</li>
            <li>After being gently used for one week, the tube busted at the end and product spewed out making in no longer usable.</li>
            <li>I have pretty pink lips naturally, though, so it might show up more on someone with a lighter lip color.</li>
            <li>It smells like sweet, juicy strawberries which is definitely a plus in my book.</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t pay that much for lip balm</li>
            <li>This is nice when I first put it on but after a while my lips feel dry again and my skin rough.  </li>
            <li>while it is adequate, i do believe it fell short of my expectations.</li>
            <li>It works better in the summer when the tin would melt and make a mess.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I had when I was a little girl. :)</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite lip balm for a few years now.</li>
            <li>I love the strawberry smell and sheer pink color-</li>
            <li>And i like the tube packaging better than the small tin.</li>
            <li>I love this in the metal tub, but for some reason, this doesn&#x27;t taste the same as the other form.</li>
            <li>people who don&#x27;t like using their finger to use it, you can easily dab your lips on it because the container is wide enough!!</li>
            <li>If the regular Smith Rosebud salve comes in a larger container I would be very interested in buying that.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me mention that I live in Phoenix, an extremely dry climate.</li>
            <li>it goes clear on lips though.</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li>I have it in the original round container as well.</li>
            <li>it has a subtle strawberry scent that i just love.</li>
            <li>I keep going back to C.O. after trying a new lip balm and will just stay there from now on.</li>
            <li>The next morning they were soft and almost back to normal...</li>
            <li>cause it is not for me, but at least it was nice packed with the other things.</li>
            <li>It actually keeps me from licking my lips because they feel so soft and it lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>(Smith&#x27;s salves are all pretty heavily scented).</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this lip balm is a translucent pink color, but as far as I can tell, barely tints your lips if at all.</li>
            <li>the product might not technically be better than regular ol chapstick, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Last winter my 5 yr old had extremely dry and scaley hands.</li>

            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t pay that much for lip balm</li>
            <li> This is nice when I first put it on but after a while my lips feel dry again and my skin rough.  </li>
            <li> while it is adequate, i do believe it fell short of my expectations.</li>
            <li> It works better in the summer when the tin would melt and make a mess.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I had when I was a little girl. :)</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite lip balm for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I love the strawberry smell and sheer pink color-</li>
            <li> And i like the tube packaging better than the small tin.</li>
            <li> I love this in the metal tub, but for some reason, this doesn&#x27;t taste the same as the other form.</li>
            <li> people who don&#x27;t like using their finger to use it, you can easily dab your lips on it because the container is wide enough!!</li>
            <li> If the regular Smith Rosebud salve comes in a larger container I would be very interested in buying that.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me mention that I live in Phoenix, an extremely dry climate.</li>
            <li> it goes clear on lips though.</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li> I have it in the original round container as well.</li>
            <li> it has a subtle strawberry scent that i just love.</li>
            <li> I keep going back to C.O. after trying a new lip balm and will just stay there from now on.</li>
            <li> The next morning they were soft and almost back to normal...</li>
            <li> cause it is not for me, but at least it was nice packed with the other things.</li>
            <li> It actually keeps me from licking my lips because they feel so soft and it lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> (Smith&#x27;s salves are all pretty heavily scented).</li>
            <li> Anyhow, this lip balm is a translucent pink color, but as far as I can tell, barely tints your lips if at all.</li>
            <li> the product might not technically be better than regular ol chapstick, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Last winter my 5 yr old had extremely dry and scaley hands.</li>
            <li> My only complain would be that it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time</li>
            <li> one tub will last a very long time...</li>
            <li> It is pale pink in the tin but doesn&#x27;t have much of a tint on lips.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t stay on as long either.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but it came in a cute tin that was always IMPOSSIBLE to open!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve also used it for dry skin!</li>
            <li> The lip balm did not have that rosebud smell, it was very dry</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a zillion lip balms and hands down</li>
            <li> I use the lip balm all the time, but I also use the smith co salve which I usually pile on at night and it helps so much-I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> i require long lasting balm that i don&#x27;t need to reapply and sadly, this doesn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> It works well at moisturizing but can be a little greasy under lipstick or products.</li>
            <li> A few lip balms I&#x27;ve used in the past have made me break out, but this stuff has never caused a problem.</li>
            <li> Yes I think I went a bit overboard, but my lips  and my cuticles have never been softer.</li>
            <li> I literally always have at least one of these with me at all times.</li>
            <li> The balm is thick, but stays on your lips.</li>
            <li> this isnt sticky or thick.</li>
            <li> so, sorry if this review is misplaced!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not terribly happy with having to find something to wipe it off my finger with after using it</li>
            <li> I think people have bad experiences because they slather things on.</li>
            <li> I prefer the tube to the annoying and unsanitary tin.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This product works like miracles, makes your lips healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lip balms from Chapstik to La Mer and this by far is the best lip balm out there. I have it in the original round container as well. They have a different consistency but they&#x27;re both wonderful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is made of awesome, and is great to keep in the car because even in the summer heat, the tube keeps it sealed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and lightly scented. The balm is thick, but stays on your lips.</li>
            <li> This lip balm tastes and smells nice with its good strawberry fragrance, and it works well too. Nice to use in the morning and freshen through the day with good old Chapstick. Will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Jan 2, 2012&lt;br /&gt;Still love this stuff! I use it every day and will definitely buy more the minute I run out. Wish it were in a smaller container for easy carrying in my purse, but this one is fine to leave at home. Will search for this brand in a smaller tin. This stuff puts Chapstick to shame! And its strawberry flavoring is light and perfect, not heavy, perfumey, or phony tasting. Nice!</li>
            <li> The only balm you&#x27;ll ever need to heal your lips. We&#x27;ve also used it for dry skin! Last winter my 5 yr old had extremely dry and scaley hands. As a last ditch effort we tried this stuff on them. The next morning they were soft and almost back to normal...one more night and they were healed. We had tried everything couldn&#x27;t believe that a lip balm worked better than any healing balm for skin we had tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if your young child has chapped lips, this is one balm that doesn&#x27;t burn, just soothes, heals and smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and I love it! It makes my lips so soft and they taste great! It smells like sweet, juicy strawberries which is definitely a plus in my book. It&#x27;s great if you have sensitive skin, too. A few lip balms I&#x27;ve used in the past have made me break out, but this stuff has never caused a problem.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this, it was listed as the tin of Smith&#x27;s Strawberry Lip Balm, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m reviewing. I never ordered the tube, but I did notice when it shipped to me the photo was of the tube... so, sorry if this review is misplaced! Anyway... I love this lip balm. I have been using it for years. It is affordable, works well, feels and smells nice, and comes in a pretty tin that makes me feel fancy and old-fashioned. I enjoy using it. Packaging is a big deal to me... the product might not technically be better than regular ol chapstick, but it&#x27;s worth it to me. I&#x27;ve converted a couple of my friends to this balm as well. It is pale pink in the tin but doesn&#x27;t have much of a tint on lips. I have pretty pink lips naturally, though, so it might show up more on someone with a lighter lip color. It works very well under lipstick because it moisturizes but is not too slippery. I prefer a thicker lip balm at night (pure lanolin works great-- I use Dr. Lipp), but for daytime this tin is perfect to toss in your bag and apply as needed. Also works great on cuticles in a pinch! It smells like strawberries but isn&#x27;t overly scented or flavored. If you accidentally eat some of it, it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything. Also my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t mind kissing me when I have this on... it moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t get everywhere like some lip balms. The finish is moist-matte, if that makes sense- not glossy. I have several of these tins laying around-- at work, in my purse, and in my makeup bag. I will continue to repurchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing someone on Youtube recommend it. I bought it at Sephora for about $7. I normally wouldn&#x27;t pay that much for lip balm but I gave it a try and I love it! I love the strawberry scent and the way it feels on my lips. My only complain would be that it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time so I have to apply it often. Otherwise, I would most likely buy more of it once this one runs out.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes my lips better than the chapstick. i&#x27;ve never came across any lip products that does it until now!! it&#x27;s shiny but not greasy at all. people who don&#x27;t like using their finger to use it, you can easily dab your lips on it because the container is wide enough!!</li>
            <li> This brand is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product lasts for quite a while! I wear it every night before I go to sleep so in the morning my lips are nice, soft, and moisturized. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other Smith salves and this one is my favorite! I prefer the tube to the annoying and unsanitary tin. I do find the smell to be quite strong so if you are looking for a simple balm I would try something else (Smith&#x27;s salves are all pretty heavily scented). It works well at moisturizing but can be a little greasy under lipstick or products. I love the strawberry smell and sheer pink color- it goes clear on lips though. It&#x27;s a staple for me.</li>
            <li> Good gloss/balm. Only &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; I will buy from now on. The others were gross.</li>
            <li> I LOVE rosebud Strawberry lip balm. The other flavors are good too, but this one is my favorite. I also like the consistency of this flavor the best too. I literally always have at least one of these with me at all times.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I received the tin and really wanted the tube as pictured and mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm ever!! Tube is definitely different from the pot! Both are awesome, but the tube is perfect for on the go!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm. It has a very nice scent, not too sweet. And i like the tube packaging better than the small tin. It works better in the summer when the tin would melt and make a mess. This also doubles as a great skin moisturizer when you dont have anything else on hand. So glad that amazon carries this.</li>
            <li> Good texture, not too thin and not too sticky  Light strawberry flavor, doesn&#x27;t make you want to eat your lips  The tin is HUGE, I think this will last forever</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff. I keep one in my purse, on my nightstand, in my book bag, in the kitchen, on my dresser. Yes I think I went a bit overboard, but my lips  and my cuticles have never been softer.</li>
            <li> I can see why people rave about this even though it doesn&#x27;t come in a tube.  It&#x27;s the best balm I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Extremely moisturizing and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Purchased 2, one for my handbag and one at home.  I use the home one more to keep my lips moistened.  I love the flavor and it has a hint of color as well as a shine.  Looks like one tub will last a very long time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product prior to buying it from amazon at sephora once...and I have to say it does not compare. The lip balm did not have that rosebud smell, it was very dry and it didn&#x27;t look like it was in good condition. I recommend not buying it from this seller but rather order it from sephora. You would get more of a better quality product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw Smith&#x27;s lip balm on a list of top lip balms and really like the fact that it was in a tube instead of a pot but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s better than C.O. Bigelows Rose Salve which I absolutely adore. This is nice when I first put it on but after a while my lips feel dry again and my skin rough.  It does smell nice but that&#x27;s not enough for me to stay. I keep going back to C.O. after trying a new lip balm and will just stay there from now on.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite lip balm for a few years now. It smells great, is not sticky at all, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> yum! I love this and love that it is so light on.  perfect moisturizer for lips!</li>
            <li> So happy to see my favorite balm came in a tube. Makes it so much more easier to use. Keeps my lips soft.</li>
            <li> I love Rosebud Lip Balm. I just put it on at night and my lips feel wonderful all day long at work. I am not constantly looking for lip balm as this works!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for your lips.  i loved the no mess of the tube versus the pot as I feel it&#x27;s more handy and hygenic.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. It isn&#x27;t gooey like a lot of lip glosses/ balms. It smells great, makes my lips feel silky and soft, and it isn&#x27;t messy.</li>
            <li> I use this as part of my morning and night skincare routine. After washing my face and applying maracuja oil, I apply this balm to my lips. They tend to get very irritated and also peel. This balm is like heaven. It can also be layered to get the desired effect. I think people have bad experiences because they slather things on. Less is more at times! Great product, so cheap and lasts forever!!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great. I purchased it here after smelling it from the tin at a cosmetic store. I don&#x27;t care to apply lip product with my fingers, and this is why I didn&#x27;t purchase it from the tin in-store (they didn&#x27;t carry the tubes). Anyhow, this lip balm is a translucent pink color, but as far as I can tell, barely tints your lips if at all. It glides on with the consistency of Vaseline, as is smooth and not sticky. I like to apply this before bed, and wake up with soft smooth lips! I apply it throughout the day as well. The scent is wonderful, and is not too strong. It is pleasant, a fresh strawberry scent. My 2.5 year-old-daughter always wants to smell my lips when I have it on! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a zillion lip balms and hands down this is the blue ribbon baby for me.  I started with the strawberry and now I order the mocha as well.  I think you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> i was looking for something that moisturized as well as dr dans cortibalm so i decided to try this on a friends recommendation. while it is adequate, i do believe it fell short of my expectations. i require long lasting balm that i don&#x27;t need to reapply and sadly, this doesn&#x27;t do the trick. still a good product, just not for extended periods</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products and the good thing is that it lasts a long time like a couple years</li>
            <li> nice smelling but does not work for chapped lips to my liking- would not recommend for smoothing lips- just smells good but the ingredients do nothing for the dryness or chapped lips</li>
            <li> Came in tin even though listing said tube.  Do not reccomend.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my aunt who is not computer literate. She can&#x27;t find it anywhere else so I get called once a year to resupply her. Amazon and their merchants save the day again. This is a great product too bad it is not sold in stores more people would use it it&#x27;s been around for almost a hundred years.</li>
            <li> I love this in the metal tub, but for some reason, this doesn&#x27;t taste the same as the other form. It also doesn&#x27;t stay on as long either. Still love it because it&#x27;s easier to put on in a tube then using your finger!</li>
            <li> Good shine and works well on my lips. Smooth and great coverage.</li>
            <li> I love the way the balm feels, and the smell is very nice.  I&#x27;m not terribly happy with having to find something to wipe it off my finger with after using it (I reapply frequently), but that&#x27;s not really a criticism of the product, since obviously I knew that before I purchased it.  Won&#x27;t purchase again just for that reason though.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever had. The containers usually last me a year or two as well.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is so moisturizing, it smells so good and it lasts a long time. My favorite lip balm ever!</li>
            <li> First of all, let me mention that I live in Phoenix, an extremely dry climate. I have tried just about every lip balm out there in my quest for a product that keeps my lips moisturized while also being pleasing to use. This lip balm does it all! It glides on smoothly, has a very nice scent/flavor, lasts a long time, and keeps my lips moist and healthy! Treating my lips with this fabulous balm feels like an indulgence. I keep a tin in my bathroom and one in my purse, and I&#x27;m good to go. You should try it!</li>
            <li> This lip balm us a must at home and on the town. Love love love</li>
            <li> I actually like this lip balm. It has a pleasant, mild scent and makes my lips feel good. However, I ordered the lip balm TUBE and received the tin. I ordered from this seller specifically because I wanted the tube (easier application) over the tin. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this exclusively and drinking more water.  My boyfriend steals some too, because it&#x27;s so good. It actually keeps me from licking my lips because they feel so soft and it lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> this isnt sticky or thick. it has a subtle strawberry scent that i just love. it doesnt really do much for color but thats ok, there are plenty of products for that. great for winter. huge tin too.</li>
            <li> arrived as a tin of lip balm and NOT the tube as pictured</li>
            <li> Used the product for one week. Loved the smell and texture. After being gently used for one week, the tube busted at the end and product spewed out making in no longer usable.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet cause it is not for me, but at least it was nice packed with the other things.</li>
            <li> I have used this balm forever but it came in a cute tin that was always IMPOSSIBLE to open! Soooo happy that I finally found it in a tube-yeah!! Thank you so much! I use the lip balm all the time, but I also use the smith co salve which I usually pile on at night and it helps so much-I have extremely dry skin and these have been my lifesaver! If the regular Smith Rosebud salve comes in a larger container I would be very interested in buying that. Thanks for a great relief for us that suffer from severe dry skin, and many other conditions as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s like I had when I was a little girl. :)</li>
