            <li>He has tried others and not been happy.</li>
            <li>and my son is really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I use this and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>a very very nice place to store the unit when you&#x27;re at home.</li>
            <li>but it is very handy for this</li>
            <li>This product looks very nice sitting on a shelf in its see-thru box.</li>
            <li>which is kind of surprising but very welcome.  </li>
            <li>price was wonderful, item was everything I thought it would be and more.  </li>
            <li>This razor is almost as good as manually shaving, I love it!!</li>
            <li>This shaver is very nice and lives up to the good reviews that I had read in advance of purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>It cleans up easy and I am truly impressed considering</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t impress easily when spending $70.00, but even at that price I was impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been struggling with figure out a good shaving technique</li>
            <li>I tried to get a good unit that wasn&#x27;t the cheapest but wasn&#x27;t $200.</li>
            <li>This Norelco is good.</li>
            <li>Well, it turns out that this product is that good.  </li>
            <li>Reading all the reviews for newer shavers had me concerned because there did not appear to be any one shaver that people clearly loved.</li>
            <li>I just could not figure out why this was a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job for my light beard/stubble growth.  </li>
            <li>Good Price.  </li>
            <li>results are excellent, smooth and close shaves.</li>
            <li>Good, close shave.</li>
            <li>So guys if you need a good razor this one is it.  </li>
            <li>Good job Norelco with the improvement.</li>
            <li>This is a good unit and would buy again when needed.</li>
            <li>I miss a dedicated charging stand, but otherwise it&#x27;s been a good replacement.</li>
            <li>If there is any fault to this razor is that to do a good job, it will take longer to shave well.</li>
            <li>It is always good to purchase a product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Good Razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had always good luck with Norelco&#x27;s reliability and this model (7810)</li>
            <li>My husband had a Norelco shaver for years, and he&#x27;s always loved using it.</li>
            <li>and my search goes on for another good shaver.</li>
            <li>This quite operating shaver is surprising me.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good razor at a good price.</li>
            <li>So, while 7810 is a good razor, I would recommend you to purchase 7310 to save $25.</li>
            <li>Razor works good and was a good price .I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s seemingly good quality.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Dad as it&#x27;s what he&#x27;s always used and loved.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find Amazon offered that as they are a preferred place for my shopping.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s definitely a good trade for me.</li>
            <li>A fully charged battery cycle is good for plenty of shaves.</li>
            <li>Good to wash with water.</li>
            <li>Good purchase</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>The others were good, but I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
            <li>The batteries continue to hold a good charge</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good for another 10 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>The 7810XL is a darn good product.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, though, it&#x27;s a good shaver and while it&#x27;s not some super-expensive-awesome model, it does the trick.</li>
            <li>When I need a really good shave</li>
            <li>For what it is, the Norelco 7810 does a good job.</li>
            <li>good product...</li>
            <li>So I get a good shave without spending a fortune.</li>

            <li>cause I heard all good things about them.</li>
            <li>and I am amazed at how good it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>This is a good budget electric razor.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good value for the money, and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>, I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t find one as good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shaver for some time now and the battery life is quite good.  </li>
            <li>This is an all around good product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the razor.</li>

            <li>but just know that for me, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for about a month, and am very pleased with it.  </li>

            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side it looks nice and feels good in the hand also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy, the machine is very easy to use, clean, recharge the battery.</li>
            <li>It does a great job and was worth the money!!</li>
            <li>This shaver is still made in Holland which impressed me, and workmanship appeared to be stellar.</li>
            <li>It sounds more electronic than electrical!</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for two months and knew from the first shave that it was the best razor I have ever had in about 50 years of shaving.</li>
            <li>Best of all, this no-nonsense razor is a real bargain at $60 (it&#x27;s even cheaper now than the $63 I paid Amazon 45 days ago)!  </li>
            <li>I use it on my legs and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>i love it !</li>
            <li>Great razor, charges quick, close shave!</li>
            <li>This is certainly one of the best items I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>This razor works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>The cut is amazingly close -</li>
            <li>I came across the 7810XL and seemed to fit my needs, and also had great reviews.  </li>
            <li>This thing is light weight, which to me, isn&#x27;t always a great thing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing device.  </li>
            <li>I am a rising freshman in college and this shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li>Also, the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li>The battery is amazing.    </li>
            <li>* Holds a charge for an amazing 24 days  </li>
            <li>I agree that it would  be nice if it showed battery strength.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the close shave,and fast.</li>
            <li>He is impressed with how well and fast it works.</li>
            <li>Nice to have the shaver blade assembly on an attached head on a hinge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Norelco razors and feel items from this company exemplify quality.  </li>
            <li>Nice to buy something not made in you know where.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best razor I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can shave in the living room while catching up  on the news.</li>
            <li>but it really just works fine this way!!!!!</li>
            <li>Kind of wished there was a carrying case with it though.</li>
            <li>The razor came fully charged and it gives a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if Norelco still built a corded model</li>
            <li>Nice razor for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice feel.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and it has a nice torque feel when it fires up</li>
            <li>One feature that is lacking that would be nice - a battery indicator.</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>
            <li>This shaver is okay for a fairly good shave.</li>
            <li>But this unit if you are looking for an inexpensive effective Norelco electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as their top of the line units.</li>
            <li>so  well liked we have recommended this to others.</li>
            <li>Recharges nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice product at a nice price giving me a nice shave.</li>
            <li>It does great job with a clean close shave.</li>
            <li>I use a pre-shave lotion to clean the grease off my beard, and Nivea makes a great after-shave lotion.</li>
            <li>Very good ones, Braun to be exact,</li>
            <li>Bottom line on the batteries; any shaver that holds a charge for 2 months and still going strong holds a good charge.  </li>
            <li>Great close shave - as good as the blade and a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric razors, but this one gives a great close shave quickly.</li>
            <li>The shaver is great, it does a super job.  </li>
            <li>Great for quick charges</li>
            <li>The shaver contours nicely to his hand, is easy to use, cuts great (his skin is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt after using the shaver), and hasn&#x27;t needed to be charged yet.</li>
            <li>Which in the end, not one electric I&#x27;ve ever used does as good a job as a cheap disposable blade.. except this one.   </li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco 7810 is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>The shaving is comfortable and the feeling after shaving is good.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and battery life seems to be good.  </li>
            <li>My husband has always owned Norelco shavers, but by far he likes this one best.  </li>
            <li>This must be the best electric razor that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a good razor but a bit light weight.</li>
            <li>the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Great razor, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>And most of all, it shaves nice and close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d now give the unit four stars - still good bang for your buck, but not quite as good as I first thought.</li>
            <li>I loved the product at first sight, used it and liked the shave it gave, very smooth!    </li>
            <li>Brand new, works great and was shipped in good order.  </li>
            <li>my skin still felt like very fine sand paper.  </li>
            <li>If you want a shaver that does not cost an arm and a leg and still gives a reasonably close and comfortable shave, this is a great value!!!</li>
            <li>But, this is a very well engineered shaver that does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li>It shaves great, easy to clean with water, and the parts pop out no problem for better cleaning.</li>
            <li>A very smooth shave and</li>
            <li>Very light weight.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still very comfortable to shave with.</li>
            <li>Shaves are fast,smooth,and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>First, I like to thank everyone for the good and honest rating of this product (Norelco 7810).  </li>
            <li>Cleanup is easy as well; I like to brush out the unit each day (no issues with the brushes), but the water option is nice as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean,my gosh just run it under warm water and maybe use the brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I had certain features I wanted, cord/cordless, recharge light, held a good charge on battery, washable heads, and a good shave like my 5825XL gives.   </li>
            <li>I am glad I chose Phillips Norelco 7810.</li>
            <li>If you buy this shaver, be sure to try it out for one week before making up your mind on whether or not you like it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is always a safe place to buy.</li>
            <li>I have bought nothing but Norelco for last 25 years, this is the best.</li>
            <li>The 8000 series is about $20.00 to $30.00 more than this model as well.</li>
            <li>Maybe it the shaver was $10 more for the plastic stand then the 8250, but</li>
            <li>It was definitely better than by 4817XL.  </li>
            <li>It does seems to get better with each shave.</li>
            <li>They sure do not make them like they used to.</li>
            <li>I almost tossed the shaver but glad I didn&#x27;t because it still worked and held a charge for 3+ wks at that point.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>more than meets my needs.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Norelco SpeedXL 8240XL which I brought at Costco and did not like it, even though it cost more with a fancier head.</li>
            <li>light, BATTERY LIFE, comfortable shave, good price, and BATTERY LIFE.    </li>
            <li>And so quiet I can hear my radio perfectly while I shave.</li>
            <li>Ended up wasting more money just to have the shaving head cleaned.    </li>
            <li>The trimmer is kind of cheap</li>
            <li>I have had many a razor over the years(10).</li>
            <li>Norelco triple-headers have always been my favorite -</li>
            <li>This product is everything advertised and more.  </li>
            <li>It is made in Holland which I find refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Better than my Braun.  </li>
            <li>You have to love a multi-tasker in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Much better than the ones made in China.</li>
            <li>I know that there are many that have said that there is a trade off in closeness, but</li>
            <li>All in all, I am reasonably satisfied.</li>
            <li>I cannot heap upon this product more favorable reviews...    </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re talking wife-shocking smooth!     </li>
            <li>How many times does it take to convince me to say goodbye to Norelco?  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver, I would recommend the 7810XL to anyone and glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>so I was able to compare them side by side.  </li>
            <li>I have had many electric razors over the years.</li>
            <li>THIS LAST ONE IS THE BEST ONE EVER.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many Norelcos.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for 20 years and love them.  </li>
            <li>It cuts closer than most manual razors and in a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Not at all impressed; especially by price versus value ratio.</li>
            <li>If there were anything better on the market I&#x27;d have returned it, but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet</li>
            <li>When my 7865XL wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more, I considered trying to replace the rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that  I bought the Norelco 7810.</li>
            <li>, what more could you want?</li>
            <li>Granted, the 8894 XL was quit a bit more costly.   </li>
            <li>so the Prius Razor works okay for me.  </li>
            <li>D Better shave then</li>
            <li>Before buying from Amazon, I researched extensively on the internet for the best purchase value.  </li>
            <li>I have had Norelco Shavers for years, but they keep getting better &amp; better.</li>
            <li>ok but</li>
            <li>They have used them and love the car charger.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s trimmer is more sturdy also.</li>
            <li>this one however is even better than I thought it would...</li>
            <li>Shaves much better than the Remington</li>
            <li>Oh one more thing.</li>
            <li>Ok stop reading this review and buy the razor :)</li>
            <li>LOVE THE WAY THE HEAD OPENS UP</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s battery life is excellent and it&#x27;s quiet.  </li>
            <li>how much better this is.</li>
            <li>But I look forward to as many years of</li>
            <li>What impresses me most about this shaver, as opposed to the Philips/Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve had before, is the battery life.</li>
            <li>Interesting how your skin has to \\&quot;toughen up\\&quot; for any electric razor.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>This electric razor is with me a million times more on the road than at home on the charger and time and time</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor,</li>
            <li>I got this shaver to replace my norelco 7845XL, and I&#x27;ll have to admit it&#x27;s even better than the one it&#x27;s replacing.  </li>
            <li>... glad to see this one didn&#x27;t suffer from that).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with battery life, and that you can run the shaver corded or battery.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the moment, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the contour of the handle has a nice fit and grip.</li>
            <li>so you have to buy replacements more often.  </li>
            <li>There is no need to spend money on top of the line Norelco shaving systems.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace a Remington model that died and I could not be more satisfied with this Norelco.</li>
            <li>I bought the Norelco 7810XL shaver in 2009 and it is my favorite model ever.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with Norelco for most of my life</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that said that this one shaves better</li>
            <li>I find many of these reviews to be asinine in that they either expect something for nothing or they break it then blame</li>
            <li>I wonder if it&#x27;s authentic.  </li>
            <li>I love Norelco and have used them for 50+ years.  </li>
            <li>I have used norelco shavers since 1985 love them.</li>
            <li>This one is number 5 and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this razor for a couple of years now and really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts longer hairs way better, it is quieter and lighter.</li>
            <li>This shaver does an ok job</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product with no concerns for over a year.</li>
            <li>, We would gladly recommend I would advise my friends to buy it .</li>
            <li>It gives a great shave and is always charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li>A good quality shaver that gives a quick and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>My husband is very happy with this shaver, and it also goes a long time between charges.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the long charge it holds.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and I have to say, I&#x27;m amazed at how good it is.</li>
            <li>It has far surpassed my expectations,  shaves close, easy to clean, and fits perfectly in my hand.  </li>
            <li>A pretty good electric razor.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, it does a good job shaving.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first Norelco over 30 years ago, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a new one a Amazon it works great.</li>
            <li>and shiny new, which makes me happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I love the easy cleanup .</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this is a good time to note all folks considering a Norelco - unless you are good with a soldering iron, you are going to face the same choice I did when the battery eventually dies.    </li>
            <li>I had been looking at online shaver reviews and was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a good replacement that I would like as much.</li>
            <li>It had to be much better than the cheap $35 razor I had tried many years ago.  </li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s very easy to clean under running water.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and provides a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>A very good electric razor, I have used it for a number of years and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have to perform many passes at all) and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s everything i expected at a great price too!</li>
            <li>Not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, but surely better than average.</li>
            <li>Since 1980 I have found Norelco to give me the most comfortable shave of all the razors I have tried.    </li>
            <li>I have owned this product for about a month now, and so far it has been great.</li>
            <li>Most important feature for me:</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this razor as it shaves close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The battery holds a charge f0r many days and the shave is smooth</li>
            <li>Instead, I chose a model that is reasonably priced, yet with good reviews.</li>
            <li>Very quite and good close shave.</li>
            <li>Gives a close shave; Easy to clean ; very light and easy to handle ;</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain, as the original batteries held a charge for so many years.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy!</li>
            <li>My husband has consistently used this brand and style of shaver for many years!  </li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the shaver so far which seems to do a good job very quickly compared to my real old Norelco.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very favorably impressed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went for this one and not the model one below, this one adds the larger slots for longer hair, which is great when reshaping a beard</li>
            <li>I was happy with the 4817XL because it did the job and was well built (obviously lasting many years).  </li>
            <li>The shave is also very quick</li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaver is easy as I just hold the head under the faucet.</li>
            <li>Well made, affordable, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep my Gillette razor for the more precise (and comfortable) trimming of my beard.</li>
            <li>Replacement blades are easy to find.  </li>
            <li>It gives a great shave and the trimmer works better than my last shaver.</li>
            <li>AND YOU CAN EASILY RINSE WITH WATER.</li>
            <li>Another observation of note is that one reviewer thinks it&#x27;s great to be able to plug this shaver in and \\&quot;shave and charge\\&quot; at the same time...</li>
            <li>The head is incredibly easy to wash.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and is easily cleaned.    </li>
            <li>* Shaves very quickly  *</li>
            <li>Cleans up easily</li>
            <li>like the easy cleanup with the faucet.</li>
            <li>already being an owner/user of this brand/model of shaver made the purchasing of it relatively easy.</li>
            <li>I would give it a strong buy recommendation.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this shaver.    </li>
            <li>This gives a very smooth shave, is light and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>He liked it very much, however, it just stopped working after 3 months.  </li>
            <li>This is a great Shaver for the right price,plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Also, the blinking light when the charge is complete is very handy....</li>
            <li>The flip top easy clean feature is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is easy to charge and seems to hold charge just fine.  </li>
            <li>He has been very pleased with it and says he gets a really close shave without tearing his face up.</li>
            <li>Hot water wash is nice -</li>
            <li>MY older one was so nice , Just wish it stilled worked this one has many problems</li>
            <li>Since it runs quite, I felt that is wasn&#x27;t running very fast, but it truly does a great job very close without any grabbing.  </li>
            <li>just replaced the heads good as new.</li>
            <li>First, as mentioned originally, a light that indicates remaining power would definitely be nice.  </li>
            <li>and it is just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Takes half the time and does a perfect job.</li>
            <li>The first was superb, the second was</li>
            <li>Easy to use and comfortable.    </li>
            <li>But for a quick shave, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this razor, and after trying Remington, I will forever remain loyal to Norelco.</li>
            <li>Processed and delivered much more quickly than anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I opted for the 7810 model because it charges more quickly than the cheaper model.</li>
            <li>I cannot use the five minute quick charge option for just one more shave.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this razor as it cuts fairly closely and comfortably during the past 2 months since I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this model shaves any closer than models I had 10 or more years gone by, but this is not a bad thing, as for me personally, Norelco&#x27;s have always shaved great.</li>
            <li>It provides a close shave; it is easy to use and maintain; and the ability to wash it each day makes it easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Good shave, and the trimmer seems to be more effective than on previous models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for a little over a year now and have continued to be impressed by it.  </li>
            <li>the machine does a very good shave and save so much time and the skin is soft and not irritated.</li>
            <li>Unless Sony were to make electric razors, but then again I am a huge Sony whore, so ...</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more from an affordable and useful razor.</li>
            <li>GREAT SHAVER, NO PULLING, NO REDNESS, NO WHISKERS IN THE SINK OR ON THE COUNTER AND ITS VERY QUIET.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>smooth shave,light weight,</li>
            <li>No base charging unit.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply put together.  </li>
            <li>The charging unit is separate, rather than being incorporated into the shaver and that is why it is so light.  </li>
            <li>So finally decided to purchase an electronic one and decided to get this one after reading all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s light, easy to clean, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight because it&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Could hear the shaver staraining to cut my light whiskers.</li>
            <li>I have not tried to clean the razor yet, but from what I read, it is easy to do.</li>
            <li>You will get a close, comfortable shave, every day.</li>
            <li>I suppose I am just a bad-luck case, but I don&#x27;t understand how users of this product are supposed to cheerfully reassemble the head and all its cheap plastic parts when it needs cleaning.</li>
            <li>This has a recharge light and it hasn&#x27;t come on in the 2 months that I have had it.</li>
            <li>The one thing that is vastly important to me is that the shaver gives a close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>and I was done, and my skin felt just about as smooth as it does using a hand razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>and now my skin felt smooth without a trace of roughness.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver quiet but</li>
            <li>Shaves smooth as can be.</li>
            <li>Easy clean.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and shaves well.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a completely smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great functionality, low price</li>
            <li>and the battery is fantastic.</li>
            <li>no indicator light, no power</li>
            <li>It is so easy to clean under running water.</li>
            <li>Cheap parts</li>
            <li>the unit itself is lightweight and comfortable in hand.  </li>
            <li>Have had the razor for several weeks and am getting great shaves from it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, rugged, and gives a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li>Light weight  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li>and this one wasn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave with no pulling of hair.  </li>
            <li>This is not an electric plucker but provides a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The cut is smooth, and it gets close to the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve has this razor about a month now, and so far it&#x27;s doing a good job.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best one yet and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a close and fast shave.</li>
            <li>so far, it&#x27;s getting good reviews.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather quiet, charges very quickly, cleaning the head is fast and easy, the battery has lasted just over two weeks for me and most importantly; the shave is great.  </li>
            <li>I generally use a razor blade but this works great in a quick pinch.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve used various electric models -- mainly Remington, Norelco and Panasonic -- and this performs with the best of them.</li>
            <li>: just run it under hot water, with a more thorough dismantling of the shaving mechanism every month or so (extremely simple mechanism)  - great battery life: who cares if it doesn&#x27;t have a battery level indicator.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone who wants to save time and still get a great shave.</li>
            <li>As long as you use a light touch it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice in that it&#x27;s quieter and easier on my neck than the older razor.  </li>
            <li>It cuts quickly and easily and it leaves my skin baby-smooth.  </li>
            <li>It gives a quick, easy painless shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>After the first week of using my new Norelco I found cleaning it as directed was surprising easy.</li>
            <li>In my case, it delivers a smooth, comfortable, close and quick shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver is not fancy or rich in features.</li>
            <li>Still running for over a month with the original charge.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve tried in over 25 years, and I have been pleased.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco razors for the past 40 years and this one seems to be the best of the lot.</li>
            <li>Ok, this is my first electric shaver since I was a teenager and Kennedy was president.  </li>
            <li>Funny, the remington cost more too.     </li>
            <li>It replaces a higher end Norelco and does a much better job.</li>
            <li>Norelco, in my book, is the only shaver to own!  </li>
            <li>On top of that, my 5 o&#x27; clock shadow was pretty noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The one hour full charge and that you can clean it with water are important qualities to me.</li>
            <li>My only fault with this razor is that it does not come with any kind of a case (soft or otherwise) which would be very handy when traveling.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job and holds the charge for quite a long time... about two weeks!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t offer any comments about the ability to clean it with water as I haven&#x27;t done that yet.  </li>
            <li>It was like this looming penalty because when it was time to clean it, it was going to take some time and invariably, I would find myself having to clean it when I was pressed for time.      </li>
            <li>The plastic protective head cover is a great improvement over my older model which had tiny plastic tabs that would break off even with the most care in putting it on and taking it off.</li>
            <li>You can even pour water on the heads to clean it.</li>
            <li>I can shave and wash the heads and it is clean.</li>
            <li>I have not used water to clean it, as described in the owner&#x27;s materials.  </li>
            <li>It gives a quick, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have been a Norelco user for more years than many readers of this review are old</li>
            <li>This is my third Norelco system, and this is by far the best to date.</li>
            <li>Clean, close shave.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to clean up water from all around the sink.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>So i just bought a second one on amazon since their newer models don&#x27;t sound as good as the 7810XL.</li>
            <li>I love this older Norelco razor and it does a far superior job of shaving</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave, easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>There are some real pluses to this: it is light weight; it does a good job, shaving more closely than many other electric razors that I have tried over time.</li>
            <li>The shaver feels very comfortable in my hand and is very quite.</li>
            <li>I have a teenaged special needs child whom I have to assist with shaving.  </li>
            <li>lol I never been this satisfied with any shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in past.</li>
            <li>Still, I do not recall ever needing to oil the old razor, but then again, that kind of makes sense that one would do that.    </li>
            <li>This razor is able to give me a reasonably close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Recently ordered this shaver after doing a fair amount of research on the internet.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to a good razor, after my last linear foil razor was damaged on a trip.  </li>
            <li>So about 20 years ago I gave up on shaving and went with a full beard.  </li>
            <li>by the third day I realized I had made a good choice.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best deal for the least $.</li>
            <li>so maybe I&#x27;m just not used to the latest modern rotary heads?</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>I expect to be able to use the shaver with the cord as much as I want and still have it charging the battery.</li>
            <li>However if you are a full beard person or one of those five o&#x27;clock growth people, I can&#x27;t imagine this is the Razor for you.</li>
            <li>This last one is inferior (not even as good as the one I threw away).</li>
            <li>I recommend to any that previously own an old model that try this one.</li>
            <li>The only thing I ever wanted from an electric shaver was a good close shave, which I get from this product.</li>
            <li>Norelco should have left a good thing alone.</li>
            <li>I have what most people would call a \\&quot;very light\\&quot; beard-</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Well, this razor is not only as good-</li>
            <li>I normally work night shift, but on the rare occaision that I work day shift, it&#x27;s nice to shave on the way to work.</li>
            <li>And even in that time the irritation was not really bad.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to operate, shaves nice and close with no pulling,and is quiet</li>
            <li>AS expected, it is good to grip and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a no frills razor that works fantastic, and the price is certainly right.</li>
            <li>should I need to plug the shaver in for a quick 3 minute charge to finish the shave, or use the shaver as a full corded model.</li>
            <li>First thing when I get out of bed is usually fine, but sometimes a quick wash with cool water and</li>
            <li>Every shaver had some serious detractors and the detractors made excellent points.      </li>
            <li>(Luckily, I droped it and it shattered</li>
            <li>Relatively quick, and no blood to date.</li>
            <li>The feature I like the most is the ability to simply flip the top and wash away the hair.</li>
            <li>Have been loyal to Norelco for 15 years now</li>
            <li>Been using many different electric razors many years.</li>
            <li>This razor is not only fun but shaves almost as good as my hand razor.  </li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is adequate</li>
            <li>Bought this razor a few weks ago and it is fantastic - a great razor.</li>
            <li>The recharge is fairly quick at just over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always, I quickly checked Amazon&#x27;s reviews for product selection advice.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly (1 hour)  </li>
            <li>It gives a quick, close shave, with no pulling.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works well and the whole thing is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>As with all these shavers its cheaper to buy a new shaver than replace the heads!!!!</li>
            <li>Not wanting to spend $200 on the top of the line, I stepped down this time, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.     </li>
            <li>You can clean it right under the running water in your sink because its water proof.</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice clean shave better than the Braun I previously had.</li>
            <li>so when i first used it I wondered if it was flimsy and cheap but soon found out otherwise.</li>
            <li>-my very first Norelco before the 5825 was cordless</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other electric shavers, but Norelco is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I am overall very satisfied with this product.    </li>
            <li>I just today recharged this razor for the very first time.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my father and my father likes it very much!</li>
            <li>and I have always gotten good performance and long life from their shavers.</li>
            <li>The on/off switch is large and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I loved the battery life (this one is rated in days, while the Remington is rated in minutes), the quiet motor (my wife is a light sleeper), the ability to use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (which the Remington is unable to do), the quality of the design (the blades don&#x27;t fall off during use, unlike the Remington), and best of all ...</li>
            <li>It does not cost much more to buy a new razor than it does to replace the blades</li>
            <li>This latest 7810 takes it to a new level.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my new Norelco.</li>
            <li>It also had floating heads, but the new one has much more freedom to move around the curvature of the face.     </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK to buy something new</li>
            <li>We went looking but almost died ourselves at the price most places wanted for a new one.</li>
            <li>It has a very close shave, is light and looks cool.  </li>
            <li>I thought that was cool when I read reviews, but its really because its like cheap plastic...</li>
            <li>I am glad that I did - Amazon usually has anything that you are looking for and at a good price.</li>
            <li>Over the past five years I brought many electric shavers, none of them were that good.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t own any others and am not an avid electric user, but I would recommend it based on my experience with it so far.</li>
            <li>Razor works really well, is easy to hold, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>A long lasting battery charge and close shave make this excellent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s first set up heads!</li>
            <li>The new one does trim closer and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Makes live so easy and clean.</li>
            <li>The old one, the Norelco 5845 XL, is superior to the new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, provides a very close shave and quick in getting the job done.</li>
            <li>Feels very cheap compared to my old Norelco razors</li>
            <li>Like the fact you can rinse it under hot water to clean it.</li>
            <li>Actually, the 7810X is an awesome upgrade over their previous model electric shaver for producing a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s fine razor, good for everyday use and after battery and blades</li>
            <li>Maybe the higher end models have a better motor but stay away from this model if you are accustomed to the older versions.</li>
            <li>As with other Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve found that they work best with a clean, dry, cool face.</li>
            <li>Fast, close shave, feels comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>Razor is very lightweight but ok...decent shave, grip....but no base charger...give me a break...</li>
            <li>so shipping was free and delivery was fast -- 2 days.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close and smooth with no nicks or rash.</li>
            <li>Cuts smooth, and didn&#x27;t take much time for my skin to adjust to it.</li>
            <li>this razor gives a smooth, fast, and close shave...</li>
            <li>TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A FAST, SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li>The shipping came real fast.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and very close shave.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d bet some higher-end models have a charge status light bar, but to me, that just isn&#x27;t worth an extra $30, $40, $50 or more.)  </li>
            <li>Those 5-10 extra minutes of sleep are so nice.</li>
            <li>I just started using this razor 2 weeks before Christmas and so far love it.  </li>
            <li>It definitely worth every penny.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for nearly a month now, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet which is a great improvement over my old shaver.</li>
            <li>and I am glad the old one worked.     </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s whisper quiet, which is nice.</li>
            <li>On the plus side it is nice looking, it&#x27;s quiet, and can be cleaned by rinsing it with water.  </li>
            <li>However, in the most important category for me, how close it shaves, it comes up short.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 years old and have been shaving with a Remingtom most all of my life.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED NORELCO PRODUCTS FOR MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE</li>
            <li>The floating heads are much better at conforming to your face than my old shaver was.</li>
            <li>This is a nice razor, to replace the one I left at a campground.  </li>
            <li>-- just say \\&quot;I&#x27;m worth</li>
            <li>I had to write a review on this shaver though because its worth every penny.     </li>
            <li>Oh yeah, the price... for the quality of this product, the price is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I use my old one using electric cord:)</li>
            <li>so far don&#x27;t love it because I had to go over my face like 6xs to get all my hairs ...</li>
            <li>I ended up finally switching to a Remington and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s far better than the 2 shaves</li>
            <li>but is better than the old</li>
            <li>The floating heads make it better than the old one.</li>
            <li>Treat yourself to a new 7810 for a much better shave at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have a thick beard and senstive neck, it worked great and no bleeding (I&#x27;ve experienced other brands that have chewed up my neck ...</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, the shaver has a lot more plastic than previous Norelco shavers, which I think will lead to it cracking more easily if accidentally dropped or somehow placed under too much pressure.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a number of electric shavers through the years, never finding one that gave a clean shave, while at the same time being sturdy, battery efficient, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The heads on this razor are better than the more expensive model, it shaves closer,comfortably, than any razor I&#x27;ve used.. which was too close, and it does so in a way that is very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works very nicely with a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found if you use very light pressure, it works better than pressing down on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The good news is it works well until it abruptly dies.  </li>
            <li>A GOOD SHARP BLADE AND SHAVING CREAM TO SHAVE WITH.  </li>
            <li>It shaves closer, is much quieter, and is still running on the original charge after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have not even changed the blade and it is still sharp and no issues whatsoever mechanically or quality wise.</li>
            <li>Closeness of the shave is just right.</li>
            <li>I am in Afghanistan right now and someone stole this one while I was in the shower, and my wife sent me a Remington to replace it.</li>
            <li>And, the price was right.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>Price was right.  </li>
            <li>You can shave right after getting out of a shower with no diminished performance.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other perks include: very smooth shaving, super quiet motor,</li>
            <li>He was in much need of a new shaver and said this one works great and doesn&#x27;t pull at all on his facial hair.</li>
            <li>(yeah, I&#x27;m a geezer), and after using my new 7810 for a month I can tell you that this razor is light years better than the 10 year old one it replaced (7865 XL).  </li>
            <li>This is my first Norelco, but I am pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is much better than the previous model of Norelco shaver, and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>a great shave in very little time.</li>
            <li>As for the actual razor, it is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Apparently, these blades are made of magic.    </li>
            <li>This can barely handle anything more than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and fast shaves so far.  </li>
            <li>It was an excellent shaver and was going to be hard to replace!!</li>
            <li>Stay away from this model and spend a little more money for a better unit.</li>
            <li>The new razors are cheap, plastic pieces of garbage.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to people who are not happy with linear motion shavers to give it a try, or anybody who is looking for an excellent electric shaver for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>However, those older metal parts were no where near as easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean and quiet.</li>
            <li>- close shaving, whether you have a 3-day bear or just for your daily&#x27;clean-up&#x27;  - easy to clean</li>
            <li>Realizing that it can take an electric a while to acclimate to one&#x27;s face (for reasons I have yet to understand), I still have to put tremendous effort into shaving with it, so much so that it irritates my neck beyond reason.  </li>
            <li>But I am getting very discouraged with how quickly their razor are headed for the \\&quot;shaveyard\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean for the next use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left wondering, if I had received the 7810 XL, which is what thought I was ordering, would it have been as good as my old razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review 2 1/2 years after making the purchase and it still works great, especially considering I shave my entire head.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco case fit the new shaver just fine</li>
            <li>This is the most expensive electric razor I&#x27;ve purchased for myself to date, and I&#x27;m happy to say there was some benefit to moving up to a higher price point.    </li>
            <li>I had soon spent more on them than I had on the razor!  </li>
            <li>says it&#x27;s very good with his tough beard.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>Yet, it&#x27;s very light and quiet.</li>
            <li>This unit is easy to take care of and I enjoy shaving again as the old razor was about 8 years old and the battery was shot.  </li>
            <li>The plastic housing is as light as anything I&#x27;ve ever seen, but appears to be solid and well put together in an attractive black and silver color scheme.</li>
            <li>This is balanced very well, comfortable to use, and charges very fast compared to the older one.</li>
            <li>New shaving systems are designed to be fast, easy and profitable for the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has reduced the time I spend shaving significantly and is capable of giving a full and complete shave.</li>
            <li>The Norelco was reasonably priced, holds a charge, doesn&#x27;t sound like a chain saw, and gave a decent shave.</li>
            <li>and when I need a blade-close shave, I use &#x27;Lectric Shave first and the difference becomes negligible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet, the case is more durable</li>
            <li>This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve had in a while that gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used Norelco, but last year when my old one died I changed to Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, and wasn&#x27;t happy with it.</li>
            <li>This one is VERY quiet, and does a better job than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it does exactly what I expected ... nice shave.  </li>
            <li>Years ago my first Norelco was a 7000 series</li>
            <li>Second, it just felt better in my hand then the 7340.  </li>
            <li>It actually had a charge out of the box, but to be on the safe side, I charged it</li>
            <li>Product is quiet and first charge has lasted for more than three weeks.  </li>
            <li>I had to hack and chop at it for 5 minutes or more to get the darn thing open.  </li>
            <li>There is no need for further descriptions as many have done that.</li>
            <li>and I am still on the first charge.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lightweight and pretty durable for traveling.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, who has always been a Norelco man for the 37 yrs we&#x27;ve been married.</li>
            <li>This is probably my fifth Norelco - my last one wouldn&#x27;t take a charge any more after about 8 years.</li>
            <li>but it definitely rinses out quicker and more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Tried it several more times, and it hung up another 2-3 times out of 10.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric in 20 years</li>
            <li>The shaver head can be rinsed under hot tap water which makes cleaning a snap.</li>
            <li>The quality of the shave is outstanding and compares well to a standard blade razor.</li>
            <li>Have used Norelco shavers for many years, and when my last Norelco started to need charging every day</li>
            <li>After my first shave with the 7810</li>
            <li>This time I selected the higher priced 7810XL.</li>
            <li>Prior to this shaver I had the Braun Pulsonic for 3 years and before that mostly had Norelcos.</li>
            <li>It is a much closer shave, so the additional money is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Actually he has purchased the top of the line Norelco shavers before and returned them.  </li>
            <li>My first Norelco shaver lasted 30 years.  </li>
            <li>First one lasted over 15 years, so I stayed with what I considered to be a quality product.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on different electric men&#x27;s shavers.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I just love the overall feel of the razor.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time buyer of an electric razor.</li>
            <li>The first time he used it, his first words were  \\&quot;How</li>
            <li>I have never used an electric razor consistently until I gor this Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Absolute GARBAGE!</li>
            <li>I had purchased a Norelco shaver several years ago, a 5845 XL, and have been pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The first shave irritated his skin a bit as the lubricant and Lectric Shave</li>
            <li>This was my hubby&#x27;s first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>/irritation at first</li>
            <li>The capability of to be cleaned with hot water under the faucet is an additional advantage.    </li>
            <li>So much for the gold box deal!</li>
            <li>This shaver is better than a double edge razor (I&#x27;ve tried the mecur and edwin).  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using an electric shaver, and I use it for shaving my head.  </li>
            <li>Plan on a solid 5 minutes to make sure you&#x27;re getting all the hairs on your head</li>
            <li>This is my first electric, i&#x27;ve been using blades ever since I started shaving.  </li>
            <li>comfortable, close shaves with this model as I&#x27;ve had with my old one.  </li>
            <li>just so you&#x27;re aware of this.</li>
            <li>First time to own/use an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is comparable to those higher end models that break the bank.  </li>
            <li>Charged the battery overnight, have used it more than three weeks now on the initial charge.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my son&#x27;s first electric razor.</li>
            <li>I was able to get 12 shaves off the initial charge.</li>
            <li>Just pop the top open and rinse under running water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for replacement blades, which I am changing for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the case from my old razor, but the charger for this one doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It was funny.</li>
            <li>I picked this up as my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>but this product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get stubble in afternoon after shaving in the morning and it takes many rounds of shaving the same place.</li>
            <li>I got my first Norelco in Germany in 1954 and have use them since.</li>
            <li>I just got my first electric shaved in the mail and  tried it out ...</li>
            <li>exactly* what I want it to.  </li>
            <li>It cuts weekend stubble like hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First charge on the battery lasted 3 weeks of shaving every day Monday through Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>During my first shave, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was running or not because it was so quiet.  </li>
            <li>Norelco&#x27;s dynamic contour feature made a huge difference in the areas on my head that were curved - there was much greater surface to surface contact so the razor performed better with less effort.  </li>
            <li>This new one is even better than the old one he had.</li>
            <li>I have had numerous other razors, Norelco, Remington, but this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Have had a few different models this one is very good.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for weeks, and charges quickly  - surdy: I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost a year, and it works just as new    </li>
            <li>With my old shaver, I used to dump the hair out every day, and clean with the Norelco brush every couple of days.</li>
            <li>The artic looked cool, but most of the reviews were average.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter and much more quiet, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have, as they&#x27;ve cut costs on these things, Norleco has eliminated the carrying case, very handy when you travel as the blade cover comes off easy and if you nick a blade.. you&#x27;re screwed</li>
            <li>One thing I find useful when the beard gets too long to easily shave with the heads...</li>
            <li>Very good at cutting for a close shave, the only thing I would have liked is a battery indicator to know when the battery is going to die.</li>
            <li>Another positive is the battery life...  </li>
            <li>I wanted to buy a cheaper Norelco model but the reviews were luke-warm and most confirmed that they were often of Chinese or Mexican origin.</li>
            <li>I pretty much use it every day now.  </li>
            <li>This one is pretty much identical, but it is lighter.</li>
            <li>If your electric shaver is more than a few years old, an upgrade is worthwhile and probably something to consider.</li>
            <li>Cutting results are good but not as good as my old razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the description claims, \\&quot;...one-hour full charge offers up to 17 days of cordless shaving.\\</li>
            <li>Norelcos require very little maintenance and that is good because I don&#x27;t do much in that department...</li>
            <li>Inside the perfectly adequate cardboard box was a nearly bullet-proof plastic contraption wrapped around the shaver and its accessories.  </li>
            <li>Simply and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use the trimmer a lot, as I like the short stubble look and its easy maintainance.  </li>
            <li>but it snaps back in place easily.  </li>
            <li>It has been three weeks since I got it, and it is still running strong with the initial charge.</li>
            <li>Spending that much did me a lot of good in the past.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re an electric shaver who prefers rotaries to foils this might be a smart choice.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product certainly will not disappoint.</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to clean, holds a charge for a really long time, and has clear indicators for when it is done charging.  </li>
            <li>The initial cost of buying the shaver itself is significant (in comparison with a regular old razor blade), but over time I can really see how this will save money and be just as effective.</li>
            <li>It has proven to be light weight in the hand, easy to handle and cuts smooth on a not so tough beard.</li>
            <li>and I always have a problem getting the new blades in right.  </li>
            <li>It is much quieter than the first one, and shaves equal to or better than the old one.  </li>
            <li>If you can overcome the following caveats, then you will be fine with this</li>
            <li>As others have noted, it is quick, quiet, and cuts the hair to a good length (if I want a closer shave or if I skip shaving for a few days, that&#x27;s what my standalone razor is for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my neck area burning however, which a real blade/lather doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>The description should have stated whether or not it has a low battery light.  </li>
            <li>I have a very angular chin.</li>
            <li>Makes you wonder how much of a difference there really is.  </li>
            <li>Did not see much sense in paying a premium if there were issues with the basics.   </li>
            <li>It was like someone actually thought about the fact that a shaver should fit a hand.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had a light for when the battery was low - which is so infrequent</li>
            <li>Much happier with the Braun unit.</li>
            <li>Battery life is better than I expected</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone looking for a reasonably priced razor.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave - without razor burn.</li>
            <li>would have some advance notice that the shaver was ready to die.</li>
            <li>it is probably still a great personal grooming item that I&#x27;ll use daily for the next 3-5 years.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have any complaints really, this shaver just works.  </li>
            <li>this review is years after the purchase Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>So, much that he ordered another one.  </li>
            <li>This was to replace a much cheaper razor of mine that was just not doing the job.</li>
            <li>Really now on week four and still going.  </li>
            <li>Very silent and smooth operation.</li>
            <li>and by how much -- the battery charge is decreasing.</li>
            <li>The 7810 is much lighter weight and quieter as well.</li>
            <li>the razor arrived as promised and was fully charged ready to use.  </li>
            <li>I really like the closeness of the shave I am now getting with the 7810</li>
            <li>It was in my price   range and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>This has really been a blessing.</li>
            <li>Very quite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noticeable the closer shaving that you get.</li>
            <li>The unit works very well.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave with almost no pressure.  </li>
            <li>Also, I wish it had a red light that would warn me that I am close to running out of power.  </li>
            <li>The 7810XL has a three-minute fast charge feature that works really well on Sunday mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has worked well without too much noise and seems to hold a charge well, too.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is a racket that you can&#x27;t get out of.  </li>
            <li>It does not do a real close shave.</li>
            <li>And the shave is much smoother than I ever thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It shaves close enough, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is really important.</li>
            <li>It shaves well and the rechargeable battery is really strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am ready to pitch it.</li>
            <li>The gentleman I bought it for really likes it.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s too early to say for sure as I have used it only for 1 month.  </li>
            <li>This unit gives a good enough shave, but it is nowhere near as solid a product.   </li>
            <li>I had been using the same razor for about 7 years and really liked it, but something broke on a recent trip</li>
            <li>The motor seems to drive the blades too slowly to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>The workmanship and quality is equal to my previous model and it shaves remarkably well for a non-blade shaving system.</li>
            <li>Maybe it made the shave more efficient, but Amazon reviews seem to indicate shavers with the HQ9 blades were actually less efficient and less effective.  </li>
            <li>I thought at first it was weak, but realized it was just that good...</li>
            <li>strong, long battery life, and close shave..   </li>
            <li>My experience with foil shavers is that they seem to cause more ingrown hairs on my face, than any other method of shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually quite useful!</li>
            <li>it does better than other electric razors around the jawline</li>
            <li>I looked into other models, and found this razor to be top quality and within my price range.</li>
            <li>The washing with water feature seems pretty cool, although cleaning it probably has more to do with personal hygeine and less to do with its performance?</li>
            <li>With the 4817XL, you just waited until the shaver clogged up and started spitting hairs back out to know when it was time to clean.  </li>
            <li>There is a green LED light that shows when the batteries are being charged which blinks once a full charge has been reached.</li>
            <li>I use the trimmer on the back to shorten the hair so it can be cleanly shaved with the heads.</li>
            <li>so I can easily clean it without working about the internal parts getting wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; It takes seconds and means it will always be clean the next time you use it.</li>
            <li>pleasantly pleased-  afraid it would&#x27;t be as good a shave as my very old one.</li>
            <li>It still doesn&#x27;t match a real razor shave, but the unit has held-up very well and still holds a charge as well as when new.</li>
            <li>I did follow instructions and gave it an initial charge overnight before using fo rthe first time, but it never worked right.  </li>
            <li>The data that is available does not clearly differentiate the shavers.  </li>
            <li>I first tried to buy this razor directly from norelco</li>
            <li>They have a nice comparison feature that is really slick, but not all the data populates for all the shavers.  </li>
            <li>My first was 7 years old and still worked find</li>
            <li>No nylon case like my 1st one but the old case is the right size for the new one.</li>
            <li>The new one is lighter but holds a charge much longer and is quieter.  </li>
            <li>I have used this shaver with 3-year-old blades to clean up stubble left from a shave with a new Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The 7810XL is lighter because it uses a lot more plastic then metal and less parts.  </li>
            <li>We are using a blade but thought that an electric might be more convenient and less time-consuming.  </li>
            <li>For the price I love this shaver, it&#x27;s been over a year and a half</li>
            <li>This model doesn&#x27;t even have all the extra features or settings and truthfully, they aren&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li>I am replacing a much older model that was not water-resistant, and this model&#x27;s washable head and water-resistance makes it easier to use around the sink and shower.</li>
            <li>this is a really nice shaver that is quiet, shaves close, holds a charge well - and doesn&#x27;t break the bank like the alleged top-of-the-line shavers do.    </li>
            <li>I contemplated the more expensive models, but I&#x27;m glad I gave this one a shot.  </li>
            <li>Works great, delivered fast, cannot go wrong with Norelco in my opinion</li>
            <li>The 8250 has the same basic feel, but it was $25 more.  </li>
            <li>It charges lightning fast as advertised, yet it holds its charge very well (so far).      </li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t expect this razor to give him as close of a shave as an actual razor blade, but because of his experience with his last Norelco, we did expect more.     </li>
            <li>The standard Braun shavers are way better and designed to last years, not months.</li>
            <li>the main on/off button broke</li>
            <li>I recently upgraded from a different Philips Norelco shaver and this seems to be a much better system.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my older Norelco triple head shaver.</li>
            <li>The Norelco 7810 is lighter in weight than my older one.</li>
            <li>It is much quieter, and it shaves much closer than the old one did.</li>
            <li>On Amazon, I saw a more expensive model 7810 and thought I probably deserved a better one.    </li>
            <li>You should just dump the scraps in the trash and then give it a quick rinse, shake out the excess water and put it back in \\&quot;its spot.\\</li>
            <li>The battery life is probably the biggest pro of this particular model.  </li>
            <li>i am a classic man, i´ve prefered to use the blade shave and philps is an alternative for me, execellent.</li>
            <li>It shaves closer than the older models</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always just used a traditional Gillette razor over the years (most recently, the Mach4).</li>
            <li>We often spend time in a field environment without running water or mirrors and I&#x27;m still expected to have a reasonably hair free face.</li>
            <li>This one in particular gives NO warning that it&#x27;s about to die.  </li>
            <li>and I have been struggling to find a decent replacement ever since.  </li>
            <li>I bought an off brand last time and it did not last long and never did give me a good shave.</li>
            <li>At times it sounds as if it&#x27;s too weak to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li>There must be something funny about a guy with a half-shaven face purchasing a new electric shaver early on Sunday morning because the clerk couldn&#x27;t stop giggling.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Norelco razor.</li>
            <li>My take on it: highly recommended.    </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Shaver to anyone in the market for one...</li>
            <li>I highly recommed this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Close cut Highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, waterproof, easy to clean and can be used dry or wet.</li>
            <li>That would be a positive, but without a low battery light, I cannot even rely on a slowing motor to know the battery is low.</li>
            <li>I have used it daily since and it knocks down daily growth very effectively.  </li>
            <li>Other positives- lightweight,  easy to handle</li>
            <li>I found those heads to be pretty irritating to my face, even after a year of using it, and it seemed to pull my skinn and missed more whiskers than I&#x27;d expect, leading to ingrown hairs or that super long solo whisker you missed all week that your wife plucks off with a tweezer right before you go out with her..</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast, course and dense and the 7310 turned my cheeks into baby soft pillows.</li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s much quieter than his old one.  </li>
            <li>I really like this one so far.</li>
            <li>The 8260 was not available at the closest store, but I was able to view it in the display case.  </li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;ll most likely never be shaving far enough away from an electrical outlet</li>
            <li>It holds a full charge so long, I don&#x27;t even pack the ac/charger.</li>
            <li>I normally need to shave twice a day.</li>
            <li>Reading personal reviews is very helpful, thanks to those who take the time to do so!  </li>
            <li>Well worth extra cost.</li>
            <li>Norelco, as I understand it, is pretty much the only brand to go with.</li>
            <li>After a month of poor shaves, I ordered the 7810 and have been delighted with the results.</li>
            <li>This one is a little more comfortable to hold than the other one.</li>
            <li>the razor is all that I expected -- cuts well &#x3D;&#x3D; charges easily and cleans with NO trouble -- since you can just rinse it under water</li>
            <li>It was also easy enough to push back in.  </li>
            <li>From day one it was more convenient and less irritation and now that my skin has completely adjusted it is night and day</li>
            <li>Directions on initial use were simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Again, it is far better than my previous shaver, so I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my other Norelco razor, more expensive one, which was good but</li>
            <li>The only con is that the pop-up trimmer is not as good as other shavers I have owned, but I use a beard trimmer for such things anyway.</li>
            <li>It recharges quickly and holds a charge a long time.  </li>
            <li>I viewed the new one with trepidation when unwrapping it due to the light weight.  </li>
            <li>With the new Norelco he doesn&#x27;t feel a thing with the aftershave.  </li>
            <li>He loves his new Norelco.</li>
            <li>so I needed a new razor)</li>
            <li>With that in mind, when my 8000&#x27;s blades dulled and it was time for a new set..</li>
            <li>if it did not work, I would buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>He has since bought a new one and this one just sits in a box under the sink.</li>
            <li>I used it for three weeks hoping my beard just had to adjust to the new razor.</li>
            <li>Then I realized that maybe I needed new blades.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new electric shaver</li>
            <li>I have had Norelco&#x27;s for a number of years and their working life seems to get shorter and shorter with every new razor I buy.  </li>
            <li>I just move on to a new shaver or shaving method -</li>
            <li>The thing is like new.  </li>
            <li>The battery died and I think I may have messed it up trying to solder in a new battery.  </li>
            <li>I felt, after all this time, maybe Norelco had improved the shaver, so I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>Even Amazon&#x27;s fastest order fulfillment system wasn&#x27;t going to get me a new shaver within an hour.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just get a new one again.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;d buy another if &amp; when he needs a new one.</li>
            <li>Has metal heads rather than these new ones with plastic heads that fall out all the time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much more comfortable and less messy.  </li>
            <li>Second, and as mentioned by others, it would be nice to have some sort of warning when the batteries are going to die - as it is, the shaver just stops dead...</li>
            <li>I do get a shadow earlier than if I use a straight razor, but that isn&#x27;t much to complain about.</li>
            <li>I think the charger could be more travel-friendly, that is, compact, but with this long battery life you&#x27;d need to be on the road for a long time to bother bringing it.</li>
            <li>The packaging consists of that horrific plastic clam-shell stuff so better have a strong pair of scissors handy.</li>
            <li>The recharger cord is more compact than my previous shaver but other than that they are pretty much identical.</li>
            <li>I used that one for a year, and it never dod a good job on my neck unless I pushed real hard, then it would cut me.</li>
            <li>This new cap holds tight and strong, and has nothing that will break off.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This replaced a Norelco shaver that was very old but still working.  </li>
            <li>However I was very surprised to see that it shaves well.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>On my third week on the first chWarge of the battery.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I am not sure it that equates to better or lower reliability.   </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t obvious, until after I pushed the on button and used it the first time.  </li>
            <li>worth the money, as long as it isn&#x27;t $120+ for just the shaving unit</li>
            <li>This razor is pretty basic and just what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I use regularly.</li>
            <li>Finally, the price is pretty reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only other thing to comment upon is that it would be better to have a meter indicating remaining battery life instead of just stopping.</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, it was so quiet</li>
            <li>Especially if it&#x27;s your first one.</li>
            <li>It is even better than the last more expensive Norelco model.</li>
            <li>This razor battery lasted for about 10 days after full charge but shaving is not very close.</li>
            <li>But with a power cord to plug in and charge AND SHAVE at the same time, there&#x27;s no major need for that indicator light.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I have a very heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>that so far that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve done with my new 7180.  </li>
            <li>rather than spend $40.00 on new blades I figured and extra $20.00 for a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>replaced old norelco (10 yurs) with new.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is quieter and does a better job that my previous 7600, which died suddenly only to relive once I bought the new one.</li>
            <li>The lack of a low batter light is no disadvantage since the battery lasts so long.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend&#x27;s son, he has cerebral palsy and is wheelchair bound, part of this condition is he has trouble sitting still, and startles easily,</li>
            <li>It shaves very rapidly and thoroughly and there is absolutely no irritation even on the first use.  </li>
            <li>The braun and other electrics are not as good for neck, upper lip, and facial hairs that might grow in a different direction.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that my real old one had the remaining minutes displayed which was nice.</li>
            <li>I guess this was asking too much, and although the 7810 is simple, light, and quiet, I could still sandpaper furniture with my beard after a long session with this product.  </li>
            <li>I find that it cuts closest when my face is dry (usually right out of bed).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t compare to other razors since this is my first, but I like the results....and what else really matters?</li>
            <li>Certainly, now I could actually break a part that I could not break before.  </li>
            <li>When trying to get some of the whiskers out of the unit, the floating heads tend to fall out and they are not always as easy to get back in place as I would like (on the other hand, I tend to be impatient!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently replaced an older Norelco men&#x27;s shaver with a new 7810XL model.</li>
            <li>7810 Men&#x27;s Cutting System Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] arrived in great shape and within the estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li>I sent my 20year old Norelco to electricshaverstore.com, who cleaned my old one, replaced the battery, and fixed the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The booklet clearly states that it \\&quot;does not</li>
            <li>He said with his old shaver his face stung after he put on aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old Norelco that I had been using to shave my head in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>If this lasts 1/4 the time my old model did, it will pay for itself in disposable razors.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t have a battery meter (my 10 year old one that died did), but so far just charged it after 3 weeks for fear</li>
            <li>My old Norelco was 10+ years old and was showing it&#x27;s age.  </li>
            <li>The razor is very well made and runs very quietly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to replace my old Norelco razor which was 7 years old.</li>
            <li>I feel that I am getting a very close shave after a short brake in period of a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I did have to get the on/off plastic button glued on by a regional Norelco certified repair shop on my old Norelco about 1+ yrs ago.</li>
            <li>Not cheap (though it may feel a bit cheap)</li>
            <li>I brought this to replace a old Norelco that battery that was loosing it&#x27;s charge.</li>
            <li>It shaves day old beard as well as 5 O\\&quot;clock touch ups.</li>
            <li>It is lighter and does not have the loud buzz when in use.  </li>
            <li>so all I can relate it to is old tech and hand razors.  </li>
            <li>Old electric razors sounded like I was using an echo weed trimmer in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>No problems since Amazon offers the blade refills via Amazon Prime/subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li>Although it cut the hair from the bottom same as the blade shaving do, but also skin may suffer from straight contact with rotary blade of this razor.</li>
            <li>So I will not recommend it for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>He is sensitive to loud noises, so</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace my old Remington.</li>
            <li>I got this for Christmas to replace my 15 year old</li>
            <li>I am surprised this is what has become of Philips Norelco razors.</li>
            <li>I had to go over areas of my face 10 or 12 times to get anything near satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>my 4th noreloco and every one (so far) has lasted for years &amp; years......</li>
            <li>I can still manage to use my old Norelco razor by, get this, sticking the eraser end of a pencil into the on/off hole to turn it on.  </li>
            <li>The 7810 gives a very close shave and runs quietly.  </li>
            <li>So, I decided to buy one for myself to replace my old 3500 model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers since I was 18 years old.</li>
            <li>(the heads in the old one had been replaced 30 days before the batts gave out).  </li>
            <li>This razor was purchased to replace my old 8894 XL.</li>
            <li>my old Norelco (probably 20 years old).</li>
            <li>he recommend purchasing Electric Shaver lubricant and Lectric Shave aftershave if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The three razors \\&quot;float,\\&quot; doing reasonably well in following the curves of my face.</li>
            <li>A replacement for my 10 yr old Norelco 5603X, which by the way is still giving me 3-4 30 minute shaves per charge,</li>
            <li>I have to watch the clock with my old one...</li>
            <li>The 7810 is very quiet, though - almost too much so.</li>
            <li>I must say, Philips/Norelco electric shavers have always stood out as far as quality and longevity goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Norelco had that feature (Norelco Model: 8151XL).</li>
            <li>The results for me are a closer shave with fewer passes compared to my old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get no indication that the batter charge is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>This one is sorta on the low end of the price range but it does what my husband wants it to and he hasn&#x27;t had to gharge it yet</li>
            <li>First charge takes a long time.</li>
            <li>they just don&#x27;t measure up to the old ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the shave close and comfortable, although I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li>This model is also quieter than my old model.</li>
            <li>So just how much money does Norelco expect you to pay to get a basic shave?</li>
            <li>I got from an 8 hour charge on old shaver.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old son could probably get 17 days out of it.</li>
            <li>I really miss that red light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>old shaver slowed near the end of the charge, but this one does not.</li>
            <li>I have an old Philips that I purchased in France on 2005, so I wanted a change</li>
            <li>Thus far, no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Have only used this a few times - it&#x27;s more like a backup in the case that i don&#x27;t have time for a blade.</li>
            <li>My husbands norelco of many years died a few months back</li>
            <li>It took him a few tries to get the hang of it, but it gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>This unit is very light-weight, make sure you hold onto it tight when it&#x27;s wet if you have a tile floor!</li>
            <li>After I got it down to a short length, they blades really make quick work of the stubble.  </li>
            <li>I mean what more do you want.</li>
            <li>The main gripe that I have is that it does not give a real close shave, and you have to work at it and keep going over more difficult spots like your neck and chin.  </li>
            <li>than first impressions would have you believe, and I&#x27;m still getting well over the product description&#x27;s indicated number of shaves on a single battery charge.    </li>
            <li>I tried again with the Norelco 7810 and was pleased to experience little to minor irritation.  </li>
            <li>But back to this 7810 shaver, it looks like the replacement for my old model, and is priced at exactly the same amount.</li>
            <li>Although each new generation of Norelco&#x27;s claim to shave closer and closer, I personally think the secret lies in good sharp blades and a dry clean face.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shaver for my husband a few days ago, and right off the bat, he noticed it didn&#x27;t give him the close shave he was used to with his older Norelco.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soldered in and if you do get a new battery in it, you still have an old razor with ten year old technology.  </li>
            <li>One reviewer said when the recharge light comes on it loses power right away, I say who cares if the charge lasts as long as it does.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic in particular almost cuts too close, and left me with razor burn.</li>
            <li>I used Norelcos for 25 years and recently had to make the choice between replacing my older 4817XL or paying $55 to have someone put in the battery I already paid $15 to get.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, so I never really wanted to return to using blades.  </li>
            <li>With other shavers I have owned I would usually shave with a disposable shaver Monday mornings since the electric shaver wouldn&#x27;t do a good enough job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost every high end electric razor on the market in the last 15 years.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is, like all the shavers, the replacement heads are priced too high.</li>
            <li>With most of the weight located near the cutting heads, the balance point for this light weight shaver is just above the handle.</li>
            <li>I need to order a new cord for it from them now as I think I threw the old one away last week.</li>
            <li>Usually I use these reviews as my guide as to whether or not i&#x27;ll buy the product or not and let me tell you the reviews were all accurate on this shaver.</li>
            <li>this method left me with a 5:00 shadow at about 11:15.. and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it feels cheap and weak at the beginning, very quite,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much lighter and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; as my old electric, and since the transformer is in the plug and not the razor the cord is more expensive to replace, but if moving the AC voltage components out of the razor means i can wash it out under the faucet</li>
            <li>The only thing to beware of is that inside the head assembly some of the parts are cheap plastic and appear to be quite fragile, so be careful not to drop it lest you want it your razor to become a paper weight.</li>
            <li>My skin irritated for exactly 2 days as expected (user&#x27;s manual says up to three weeks), but no problem after that.</li>
            <li>I wet my face first</li>
            <li>It is extremely quiet, cuts very well and has a long battery live - haven&#x27;t recharged it yet.  </li>
            <li>It also shaved much closer than my old one (could have been just because it was old and not as sharp).   </li>
            <li>new Norelco is definitely a product that \\&quot;you get what you pay for..\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for a new electric.    </li>
            <li>A couple years I thought to buy a new one and bought their low priced model.</li>
            <li>I should have popped for a new one before I bought the last set of replacement blades</li>
            <li>I was expecting a deal and something new, not a potential aids death sentence.</li>
            <li>Shaving with an electric razor is all new to me, I have been using a regular razor for 35 years!</li>
            <li>and I had problem shaving near my neck with it, because my hairs tend to grow near parallel to my skin around neck.</li>
            <li>My husband does not have a heavy growth of 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, so facial hair is fairly light.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and think the flashing green light means it&#x27;s still charging.</li>
            <li>My husband loves that one charge will last up to 17 days and this electric shavor is much quieter than the last one.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s very convenient, and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to spending money on Gillette Blades.  </li>
            <li>I found the same brand same specifications at much lower price at Walmart.</li>
            <li>This is my third, replacing my previous one, which couldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and was less effective even when plugged in.</li>
            <li>A huge, hard plastic bubble was inside the box, with the shaver, a cord, a brush, a small manual, and, mostly, a huge amount of air.  </li>
            <li>My final minor complaint is that it would be nice if it came with a travel carrying case instead of the cloth pouch that is included - but that&#x27;s a really minor beef, since most of us have a small travel kit for our shaver, toothbrush/paste, etc.</li>
            <li>Initial charging was very simple to accomplish and the initial use of my new Norelco was very comfortable and clean cutting.</li>
            <li>Purchased a Remington, hated it, went back to a Norelco, LOVE IT..., appears to keep a good charge, wish it had a read out like my last one on battery life.  </li>
            <li>For my old Norelco, I did buy a new set of blades after 2 yrs but used them continuously until the shaver finally died last month.</li>
            <li>It is also easier to clean - not sure why</li>
            <li>My previous Norelco shaver had a red low battery light.</li>
            <li>The battery of this razor lasts many shaves longer than my other previously owned razors, the shave is much closer and smoother, and the battery charge takes less that one hour even when the battery is completely discharged.  </li>
            <li>The trouble started when after shaving, I wanted to clean the head and fipped it open.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend enjoyed this cutting system very much.</li>
            <li>Not that the 4817XL was particularly heavy to begin with - especially in comparison to the earlier Norelcos I used, but the light weight of the 7810XL made it easier to work with.      </li>
            <li>Oh by the way Phillips offers a 30 day return policy on this so if you don&#x27;t like it just send it back.  </li>
            <li>And daily cleaning is a snap since you merely flip open the top and rinse it with hot water.  </li>
            <li>The Head will pop off if I open it too far</li>
            <li>They are finally back to the old shaver reliability.  </li>
            <li>Have to replace the old one occasionally</li>
            <li>very QUIET compared to my old face-eater.</li>
            <li>The last time I charged it was early July</li>
            <li>This shaver replaces a 10 year old Norelco that finally wore out.</li>
            <li>When that happens you can wait a few second and turn on and use for a short time or plug it in, use and then leave pugged to recharge - take about an hour and has flashing light when done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where this model (and apparently its successor) excels is in the features.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had one from my previous unit, but that&#x27;s the main thing that I see as missing.</li>
            <li>Take it from experience and wasted money - it&#x27;s WELL worth it to upgrade to this shaver.  </li>
            <li>and it is sort of ok product, but not great product.</li>
            <li>As for charging time, after the initial four hour charge (mine actually took far less than that), I&#x27;ve confirmed Norelco&#x27;s claim that subsequent charges only take an hour.    </li>
            <li>It may not matter which one is better made because I will probably end up facing the choice again between an expensive battery replacement and a new shaver</li>
            <li>The 7180 is a quiet, extremely lightweight unit that cuts very, very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I really like this thing, and I only &#x27;dry shave&#x27; with it, meaning not in the shower.</li>
            <li>Oddly, the complaint with the razor was that it failed to perform in the areas most important to the device - so I quickly ruled it out.  </li>
            <li>I did research other models like the 7310 and 7340 and could not really find major differences other than one review that said that the motor in the 7810 was faster and thus cut better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why many of the other models do not have this feature, since it means that I don&#x27;t need to continually recharge the battery for fear of it running out mid-shave.  </li>
            <li>Counter intuitively, the light is steady green when charging and flashing green when fully charged.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it would do on my hardcore cable thick hair, but his baby fine hair comes right off.</li>
            <li>He said it was too hard to clean and that the battery didn&#x27;t stay charged.</li>
            <li>It does feel a little cheap, and I would be careful not to drop it, but you buy it for the function is serves,</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was never willing to spend much money for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>If the red light came on, then I could usually finish my last shave.</li>
            <li>First, the 7810 was the only shaver that got a 4.5 average star rating at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Did not really need all the buzzers and bells and this particular model</li>
            <li>That was a far more expensive unit when I got it about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It has a little trouble getting whiskers on my neck that lay flat, but my chin and cheeks come out very smooth.</li>
            <li>If there was no red light, then I had at least one shave left.</li>
            <li>The motor barely had enough power to turn the blades.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts at least 2-3 weeks after a full charge (about 15-30 minutes).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the foil heads and found them less durable and less comfortable.</li>
            <li>then a few moments to dry completely is helpful, like if I&#x27;m in a hot climate.</li>
            <li>same price or less for a higher level of  same band at walmart.</li>
            <li>I have owned numerous other rechargeable battery operated razors in the past but my purchase of the \\&quot;Philips Norelco 7810 Men&#x27;s Cutting System\\&quot; razor is by far the best quality of them  all.  </li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t warn you when it is near time to charge, it does have a very long battery life between charges.</li>
            <li>but I know it won&#x27;t be long before they (10 yr old NiCads) finally give up the ghost.</li>
            <li>Second, after a few months it no longer cuts the hairs on my neck as well as it first did, despite following all cleaning and lubricating recommendations.  </li>
            <li>I then returned to standard razors of many types and blade configurations, and gels and salves and still was not able to shave everyday.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close, with little to no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe I was going over my face too many times or too hard, so after a few days I tried it again, going over each area only once and using the lightest touch possible.  </li>

            <li> a very very nice place to store the unit when you&#x27;re at home.</li>
            <li> but it is very handy for this</li>
            <li> This product looks very nice sitting on a shelf in its see-thru box.</li>
            <li> which is kind of surprising but very welcome.  </li>
            <li> price was wonderful, item was everything I thought it would be and more.  </li>
            <li> This razor is almost as good as manually shaving, I love it!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very nice and lives up to the good reviews that I had read in advance of purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> It cleans up easy and I am truly impressed considering</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t impress easily when spending $70.00, but even at that price I was impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been struggling with figure out a good shaving technique</li>
            <li> I tried to get a good unit that wasn&#x27;t the cheapest but wasn&#x27;t $200.</li>
            <li> This Norelco is good.</li>
            <li> Well, it turns out that this product is that good.  </li>
            <li> Reading all the reviews for newer shavers had me concerned because there did not appear to be any one shaver that people clearly loved.</li>
            <li> I just could not figure out why this was a good thing.  </li>
            <li> It does an excellent job for my light beard/stubble growth.  </li>
            <li> Good Price.  </li>
            <li> results are excellent, smooth and close shaves.</li>
            <li> Good, close shave.</li>
            <li> So guys if you need a good razor this one is it.  </li>
            <li> Good job Norelco with the improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a good unit and would buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> I miss a dedicated charging stand, but otherwise it&#x27;s been a good replacement.</li>
            <li> If there is any fault to this razor is that to do a good job, it will take longer to shave well.</li>
            <li> It is always good to purchase a product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Good Razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had always good luck with Norelco&#x27;s reliability and this model (7810)</li>
            <li> My husband had a Norelco shaver for years, and he&#x27;s always loved using it.</li>
            <li> and my search goes on for another good shaver.</li>
            <li> This quite operating shaver is surprising me.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good razor at a good price.</li>
            <li> So, while 7810 is a good razor, I would recommend you to purchase 7310 to save $25.</li>

            <li> The 7810XL is a darn good product.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very happy, the machine is very easy to use, clean, recharge the battery.</li>
            <li> It does a great job and was worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This shaver is still made in Holland which impressed me, and workmanship appeared to be stellar.</li>
            <li> It sounds more electronic than electrical!</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for two months and knew from the first shave that it was the best razor I have ever had in about 50 years of shaving.</li>
            <li> Best of all, this no-nonsense razor is a real bargain at $60 (it&#x27;s even cheaper now than the $63 I paid Amazon 45 days ago)!  </li>
            <li> I use it on my legs and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> i love it !</li>
            <li> Great razor, charges quick, close shave!</li>
            <li> This is certainly one of the best items I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> This razor works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> The cut is amazingly close -</li>
            <li> I came across the 7810XL and seemed to fit my needs, and also had great reviews.  </li>
            <li> This thing is light weight, which to me, isn&#x27;t always a great thing.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing device.  </li>
            <li> I am a rising freshman in college and this shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li> Also, the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> The battery is amazing.    </li>
            <li> * Holds a charge for an amazing 24 days  </li>
            <li> I agree that it would  be nice if it showed battery strength.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the close shave,and fast.</li>
            <li> He is impressed with how well and fast it works.</li>
            <li> Nice to have the shaver blade assembly on an attached head on a hinge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Norelco razors and feel items from this company exemplify quality.  </li>
            <li> Nice to buy something not made in you know where.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best razor I have ever owned!  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can shave in the living room while catching up  on the news.</li>
            <li> but it really just works fine this way!!!!!</li>
            <li> Kind of wished there was a carrying case with it though.</li>
            <li> The razor came fully charged and it gives a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if Norelco still built a corded model</li>
            <li> Nice razor for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice feel.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and it has a nice torque feel when it fires up</li>
            <li> One feature that is lacking that would be nice - a battery indicator.</li>
            <li> Nice design.</li>
            <li> This shaver is okay for a fairly good shave.</li>
            <li> But this unit if you are looking for an inexpensive effective Norelco electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as their top of the line units.</li>
            <li> so  well liked we have recommended this to others.</li>
            <li> Recharges nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice product at a nice price giving me a nice shave.</li>
            <li> It does great job with a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> I use a pre-shave lotion to clean the grease off my beard, and Nivea makes a great after-shave lotion.</li>
            <li> Very good ones, Braun to be exact,</li>
            <li> Bottom line on the batteries; any shaver that holds a charge for 2 months and still going strong holds a good charge.  </li>
            <li> Great close shave - as good as the blade and a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric razors, but this one gives a great close shave quickly.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great, it does a super job.  </li>
            <li> Great for quick charges</li>
            <li> The shaver contours nicely to his hand, is easy to use, cuts great (his skin is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt after using the shaver), and hasn&#x27;t needed to be charged yet.</li>
            <li> Which in the end, not one electric I&#x27;ve ever used does as good a job as a cheap disposable blade.. except this one.   </li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 7810 is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li> The shaving is comfortable and the feeling after shaving is good.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight and battery life seems to be good.  </li>
            <li> My husband has always owned Norelco shavers, but by far he likes this one best.  </li>
            <li> This must be the best electric razor that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a good razor but a bit light weight.</li>
            <li> the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Great razor, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> And most of all, it shaves nice and close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d now give the unit four stars - still good bang for your buck, but not quite as good as I first thought.</li>
            <li> I loved the product at first sight, used it and liked the shave it gave, very smooth!    </li>
            <li> Brand new, works great and was shipped in good order.  </li>
            <li> my skin still felt like very fine sand paper.  </li>
            <li> If you want a shaver that does not cost an arm and a leg and still gives a reasonably close and comfortable shave, this is a great value!!!</li>
            <li> But, this is a very well engineered shaver that does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li> It shaves great, easy to clean with water, and the parts pop out no problem for better cleaning.</li>
            <li> A very smooth shave and</li>
            <li> Very light weight.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still very comfortable to shave with.</li>
            <li> Shaves are fast,smooth,and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> First, I like to thank everyone for the good and honest rating of this product (Norelco 7810).  </li>
            <li> Cleanup is easy as well; I like to brush out the unit each day (no issues with the brushes), but the water option is nice as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean,my gosh just run it under warm water and maybe use the brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I had certain features I wanted, cord/cordless, recharge light, held a good charge on battery, washable heads, and a good shave like my 5825XL gives.   </li>
            <li> I am glad I chose Phillips Norelco 7810.</li>
            <li> If you buy this shaver, be sure to try it out for one week before making up your mind on whether or not you like it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is always a safe place to buy.</li>
            <li> I have bought nothing but Norelco for last 25 years, this is the best.</li>
            <li> The 8000 series is about $20.00 to $30.00 more than this model as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe it the shaver was $10 more for the plastic stand then the 8250, but</li>
            <li> It was definitely better than by 4817XL.  </li>
            <li> It does seems to get better with each shave.</li>
            <li> They sure do not make them like they used to.</li>
            <li> I almost tossed the shaver but glad I didn&#x27;t because it still worked and held a charge for 3+ wks at that point.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> more than meets my needs.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Norelco SpeedXL 8240XL which I brought at Costco and did not like it, even though it cost more with a fancier head.</li>
            <li> light, BATTERY LIFE, comfortable shave, good price, and BATTERY LIFE.    </li>
            <li> And so quiet I can hear my radio perfectly while I shave.</li>
            <li> Ended up wasting more money just to have the shaving head cleaned.    </li>
            <li> The trimmer is kind of cheap</li>
            <li> I have had many a razor over the years(10).</li>
            <li> Norelco triple-headers have always been my favorite -</li>
            <li> This product is everything advertised and more.  </li>
            <li> It is made in Holland which I find refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Better than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> You have to love a multi-tasker in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Much better than the ones made in China.</li>
            <li> I know that there are many that have said that there is a trade off in closeness, but</li>
            <li> All in all, I am reasonably satisfied.</li>
            <li> I cannot heap upon this product more favorable reviews...    </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking wife-shocking smooth!     </li>
            <li> How many times does it take to convince me to say goodbye to Norelco?  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver, I would recommend the 7810XL to anyone and glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> so I was able to compare them side by side.  </li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors over the years.</li>
            <li> THIS LAST ONE IS THE BEST ONE EVER.  </li>
            <li> I have owned many Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for 20 years and love them.  </li>
            <li> It cuts closer than most manual razors and in a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed; especially by price versus value ratio.</li>
            <li> If there were anything better on the market I&#x27;d have returned it, but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet</li>
            <li> When my 7865XL wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more, I considered trying to replace the rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that  I bought the Norelco 7810.</li>
            <li> , what more could you want?</li>
            <li> Granted, the 8894 XL was quit a bit more costly.   </li>
            <li> so the Prius Razor works okay for me.  </li>
            <li> D Better shave then</li>
            <li> Before buying from Amazon, I researched extensively on the internet for the best purchase value.  </li>
            <li> I have had Norelco Shavers for years, but they keep getting better &amp; better.</li>
            <li> ok but</li>
            <li> They have used them and love the car charger.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s trimmer is more sturdy also.</li>
            <li> this one however is even better than I thought it would...</li>
            <li> Shaves much better than the Remington</li>
            <li> Oh one more thing.</li>
            <li> Ok stop reading this review and buy the razor :)</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY THE HEAD OPENS UP</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s battery life is excellent and it&#x27;s quiet.  </li>
            <li> how much better this is.</li>
            <li> But I look forward to as many years of</li>
            <li> What impresses me most about this shaver, as opposed to the Philips/Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve had before, is the battery life.</li>
            <li> Interesting how your skin has to \\&quot;toughen up\\&quot; for any electric razor.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> This electric razor is with me a million times more on the road than at home on the charger and time and time</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor,</li>
            <li> I got this shaver to replace my norelco 7845XL, and I&#x27;ll have to admit it&#x27;s even better than the one it&#x27;s replacing.  </li>
            <li> ... glad to see this one didn&#x27;t suffer from that).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with battery life, and that you can run the shaver corded or battery.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the moment, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, the contour of the handle has a nice fit and grip.</li>
            <li> so you have to buy replacements more often.  </li>
            <li> There is no need to spend money on top of the line Norelco shaving systems.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a Remington model that died and I could not be more satisfied with this Norelco.</li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco 7810XL shaver in 2009 and it is my favorite model ever.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with Norelco for most of my life</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said that this one shaves better</li>
            <li> I find many of these reviews to be asinine in that they either expect something for nothing or they break it then blame</li>
            <li> I wonder if it&#x27;s authentic.  </li>
            <li> I love Norelco and have used them for 50+ years.  </li>
            <li> I have used norelco shavers since 1985 love them.</li>
            <li> This one is number 5 and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for a couple of years now and really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts longer hairs way better, it is quieter and lighter.</li>
            <li> This shaver does an ok job</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product with no concerns for over a year.</li>
            <li> , We would gladly recommend I would advise my friends to buy it .</li>
            <li> It gives a great shave and is always charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> A good quality shaver that gives a quick and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this shaver, and it also goes a long time between charges.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the long charge it holds.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have to say, I&#x27;m amazed at how good it is.</li>
            <li> It has far surpassed my expectations,  shaves close, easy to clean, and fits perfectly in my hand.  </li>
            <li> A pretty good electric razor.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, it does a good job shaving.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first Norelco over 30 years ago, and loved it.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a new one a Amazon it works great.</li>
            <li> and shiny new, which makes me happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I love the easy cleanup .</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this is a good time to note all folks considering a Norelco - unless you are good with a soldering iron, you are going to face the same choice I did when the battery eventually dies.    </li>
            <li> I had been looking at online shaver reviews and was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a good replacement that I would like as much.</li>
            <li> It had to be much better than the cheap $35 razor I had tried many years ago.  </li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s very easy to clean under running water.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and provides a close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> A very good electric razor, I have used it for a number of years and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have to perform many passes at all) and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s everything i expected at a great price too!</li>
            <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, but surely better than average.</li>
            <li> Since 1980 I have found Norelco to give me the most comfortable shave of all the razors I have tried.    </li>
            <li> I have owned this product for about a month now, and so far it has been great.</li>
            <li> Most important feature for me:</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this razor as it shaves close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge f0r many days and the shave is smooth</li>
            <li> Instead, I chose a model that is reasonably priced, yet with good reviews.</li>
            <li> Very quite and good close shave.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave; Easy to clean ; very light and easy to handle ;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain, as the original batteries held a charge for so many years.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy!</li>
            <li> My husband has consistently used this brand and style of shaver for many years!  </li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the shaver so far which seems to do a good job very quickly compared to my real old Norelco.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very favorably impressed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went for this one and not the model one below, this one adds the larger slots for longer hair, which is great when reshaping a beard</li>
            <li> I was happy with the 4817XL because it did the job and was well built (obviously lasting many years).  </li>
            <li> The shave is also very quick</li>
            <li> Cleaning the shaver is easy as I just hold the head under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Well made, affordable, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep my Gillette razor for the more precise (and comfortable) trimming of my beard.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades are easy to find.  </li>
            <li> It gives a great shave and the trimmer works better than my last shaver.</li>
            <li> AND YOU CAN EASILY RINSE WITH WATER.</li>
            <li> Another observation of note is that one reviewer thinks it&#x27;s great to be able to plug this shaver in and \\&quot;shave and charge\\&quot; at the same time...</li>
            <li> The head is incredibly easy to wash.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and is easily cleaned.    </li>
            <li> * Shaves very quickly  *</li>
            <li> Cleans up easily</li>
            <li> like the easy cleanup with the faucet.</li>
            <li> already being an owner/user of this brand/model of shaver made the purchasing of it relatively easy.</li>
            <li> I would give it a strong buy recommendation.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this shaver.    </li>
            <li> This gives a very smooth shave, is light and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> He liked it very much, however, it just stopped working after 3 months.  </li>
            <li> This is a great Shaver for the right price,plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Also, the blinking light when the charge is complete is very handy....</li>
            <li> The flip top easy clean feature is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is easy to charge and seems to hold charge just fine.  </li>
            <li> He has been very pleased with it and says he gets a really close shave without tearing his face up.</li>
            <li> Hot water wash is nice -</li>
            <li> MY older one was so nice , Just wish it stilled worked this one has many problems</li>
            <li> Since it runs quite, I felt that is wasn&#x27;t running very fast, but it truly does a great job very close without any grabbing.  </li>
            <li> just replaced the heads good as new.</li>
            <li> First, as mentioned originally, a light that indicates remaining power would definitely be nice.  </li>
            <li> and it is just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Takes half the time and does a perfect job.</li>
            <li> The first was superb, the second was</li>
            <li> Easy to use and comfortable.    </li>
            <li> But for a quick shave, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, and after trying Remington, I will forever remain loyal to Norelco.</li>
            <li> Processed and delivered much more quickly than anticipated.  </li>
            <li> I opted for the 7810 model because it charges more quickly than the cheaper model.</li>
            <li> I cannot use the five minute quick charge option for just one more shave.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this razor as it cuts fairly closely and comfortably during the past 2 months since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this model shaves any closer than models I had 10 or more years gone by, but this is not a bad thing, as for me personally, Norelco&#x27;s have always shaved great.</li>
            <li> It provides a close shave; it is easy to use and maintain; and the ability to wash it each day makes it easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good shave, and the trimmer seems to be more effective than on previous models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for a little over a year now and have continued to be impressed by it.  </li>
            <li> the machine does a very good shave and save so much time and the skin is soft and not irritated.</li>
            <li> Unless Sony were to make electric razors, but then again I am a huge Sony whore, so ...</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more from an affordable and useful razor.</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAVER, NO PULLING, NO REDNESS, NO WHISKERS IN THE SINK OR ON THE COUNTER AND ITS VERY QUIET.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> smooth shave,light weight,</li>
            <li> No base charging unit.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply put together.  </li>
            <li> The charging unit is separate, rather than being incorporated into the shaver and that is why it is so light.  </li>
            <li> So finally decided to purchase an electronic one and decided to get this one after reading all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s light, easy to clean, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight because it&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> Could hear the shaver staraining to cut my light whiskers.</li>
            <li> I have not tried to clean the razor yet, but from what I read, it is easy to do.</li>
            <li> You will get a close, comfortable shave, every day.</li>
            <li> I suppose I am just a bad-luck case, but I don&#x27;t understand how users of this product are supposed to cheerfully reassemble the head and all its cheap plastic parts when it needs cleaning.</li>
            <li> This has a recharge light and it hasn&#x27;t come on in the 2 months that I have had it.</li>
            <li> The one thing that is vastly important to me is that the shaver gives a close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> and I was done, and my skin felt just about as smooth as it does using a hand razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> and now my skin felt smooth without a trace of roughness.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver quiet but</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth as can be.</li>
            <li> Easy clean.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and shaves well.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a completely smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great functionality, low price</li>
            <li> and the battery is fantastic.</li>
            <li> no indicator light, no power</li>
            <li> It is so easy to clean under running water.</li>
            <li> Cheap parts</li>
            <li> the unit itself is lightweight and comfortable in hand.  </li>
            <li> Have had the razor for several weeks and am getting great shaves from it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, rugged, and gives a satisfactory shave.</li>
            <li> Light weight  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li> and this one wasn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave with no pulling of hair.  </li>
            <li> This is not an electric plucker but provides a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The cut is smooth, and it gets close to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has this razor about a month now, and so far it&#x27;s doing a good job.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best one yet and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a close and fast shave.</li>
            <li> so far, it&#x27;s getting good reviews.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather quiet, charges very quickly, cleaning the head is fast and easy, the battery has lasted just over two weeks for me and most importantly; the shave is great.  </li>
            <li> I generally use a razor blade but this works great in a quick pinch.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used various electric models -- mainly Remington, Norelco and Panasonic -- and this performs with the best of them.</li>
            <li> : just run it under hot water, with a more thorough dismantling of the shaving mechanism every month or so (extremely simple mechanism)  - great battery life: who cares if it doesn&#x27;t have a battery level indicator.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone who wants to save time and still get a great shave.</li>
            <li> As long as you use a light touch it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice in that it&#x27;s quieter and easier on my neck than the older razor.  </li>
            <li> It cuts quickly and easily and it leaves my skin baby-smooth.  </li>
            <li> It gives a quick, easy painless shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> After the first week of using my new Norelco I found cleaning it as directed was surprising easy.</li>
            <li> In my case, it delivers a smooth, comfortable, close and quick shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not fancy or rich in features.</li>
            <li> Still running for over a month with the original charge.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve tried in over 25 years, and I have been pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for the past 40 years and this one seems to be the best of the lot.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is my first electric shaver since I was a teenager and Kennedy was president.  </li>
            <li> Funny, the remington cost more too.     </li>
            <li> It replaces a higher end Norelco and does a much better job.</li>
            <li> Norelco, in my book, is the only shaver to own!  </li>
            <li> On top of that, my 5 o&#x27; clock shadow was pretty noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The one hour full charge and that you can clean it with water are important qualities to me.</li>
            <li> My only fault with this razor is that it does not come with any kind of a case (soft or otherwise) which would be very handy when traveling.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job and holds the charge for quite a long time... about two weeks!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t offer any comments about the ability to clean it with water as I haven&#x27;t done that yet.  </li>
            <li> It was like this looming penalty because when it was time to clean it, it was going to take some time and invariably, I would find myself having to clean it when I was pressed for time.      </li>
            <li> The plastic protective head cover is a great improvement over my older model which had tiny plastic tabs that would break off even with the most care in putting it on and taking it off.</li>
            <li> You can even pour water on the heads to clean it.</li>
            <li> I can shave and wash the heads and it is clean.</li>
            <li> I have not used water to clean it, as described in the owner&#x27;s materials.  </li>
            <li> It gives a quick, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for more years than many readers of this review are old</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco system, and this is by far the best to date.</li>
            <li> Clean, close shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to clean up water from all around the sink.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li> So i just bought a second one on amazon since their newer models don&#x27;t sound as good as the 7810XL.</li>
            <li> I love this older Norelco razor and it does a far superior job of shaving</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave, easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> There are some real pluses to this: it is light weight; it does a good job, shaving more closely than many other electric razors that I have tried over time.</li>
            <li> The shaver feels very comfortable in my hand and is very quite.</li>
            <li> I have a teenaged special needs child whom I have to assist with shaving.  </li>
            <li> lol I never been this satisfied with any shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in past.</li>
            <li> Still, I do not recall ever needing to oil the old razor, but then again, that kind of makes sense that one would do that.    </li>
            <li> This razor is able to give me a reasonably close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Recently ordered this shaver after doing a fair amount of research on the internet.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to a good razor, after my last linear foil razor was damaged on a trip.  </li>
            <li> So about 20 years ago I gave up on shaving and went with a full beard.  </li>
            <li> by the third day I realized I had made a good choice.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best deal for the least $.</li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m just not used to the latest modern rotary heads?</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> I expect to be able to use the shaver with the cord as much as I want and still have it charging the battery.</li>
            <li> However if you are a full beard person or one of those five o&#x27;clock growth people, I can&#x27;t imagine this is the Razor for you.</li>
            <li> This last one is inferior (not even as good as the one I threw away).</li>
            <li> I recommend to any that previously own an old model that try this one.</li>
            <li> The only thing I ever wanted from an electric shaver was a good close shave, which I get from this product.</li>
            <li> Norelco should have left a good thing alone.</li>
            <li> I have what most people would call a \\&quot;very light\\&quot; beard-</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Well, this razor is not only as good-</li>
            <li> I normally work night shift, but on the rare occaision that I work day shift, it&#x27;s nice to shave on the way to work.</li>
            <li> And even in that time the irritation was not really bad.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to operate, shaves nice and close with no pulling,and is quiet</li>
            <li> AS expected, it is good to grip and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a no frills razor that works fantastic, and the price is certainly right.</li>
            <li> should I need to plug the shaver in for a quick 3 minute charge to finish the shave, or use the shaver as a full corded model.</li>
            <li> First thing when I get out of bed is usually fine, but sometimes a quick wash with cool water and</li>
            <li> Every shaver had some serious detractors and the detractors made excellent points.      </li>
            <li> (Luckily, I droped it and it shattered</li>
            <li> Relatively quick, and no blood to date.</li>
            <li> The feature I like the most is the ability to simply flip the top and wash away the hair.</li>
            <li> Have been loyal to Norelco for 15 years now</li>
            <li> Been using many different electric razors many years.</li>
            <li> This razor is not only fun but shaves almost as good as my hand razor.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is adequate</li>
            <li> Bought this razor a few weks ago and it is fantastic - a great razor.</li>
            <li> The recharge is fairly quick at just over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As always, I quickly checked Amazon&#x27;s reviews for product selection advice.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly (1 hour)  </li>
            <li> It gives a quick, close shave, with no pulling.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works well and the whole thing is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> As with all these shavers its cheaper to buy a new shaver than replace the heads!!!!</li>
            <li> Not wanting to spend $200 on the top of the line, I stepped down this time, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.     </li>
            <li> You can clean it right under the running water in your sink because its water proof.</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice clean shave better than the Braun I previously had.</li>
            <li> so when i first used it I wondered if it was flimsy and cheap but soon found out otherwise.</li>
            <li> -my very first Norelco before the 5825 was cordless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric shavers, but Norelco is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I am overall very satisfied with this product.    </li>
            <li> I just today recharged this razor for the very first time.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my father and my father likes it very much!</li>
            <li> and I have always gotten good performance and long life from their shavers.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is large and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I loved the battery life (this one is rated in days, while the Remington is rated in minutes), the quiet motor (my wife is a light sleeper), the ability to use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (which the Remington is unable to do), the quality of the design (the blades don&#x27;t fall off during use, unlike the Remington), and best of all ...</li>
            <li> It does not cost much more to buy a new razor than it does to replace the blades</li>
            <li> This latest 7810 takes it to a new level.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my new Norelco.</li>
            <li> It also had floating heads, but the new one has much more freedom to move around the curvature of the face.     </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK to buy something new</li>
            <li> We went looking but almost died ourselves at the price most places wanted for a new one.</li>
            <li> It has a very close shave, is light and looks cool.  </li>
            <li> I thought that was cool when I read reviews, but its really because its like cheap plastic...</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did - Amazon usually has anything that you are looking for and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Over the past five years I brought many electric shavers, none of them were that good.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t own any others and am not an avid electric user, but I would recommend it based on my experience with it so far.</li>
            <li> Razor works really well, is easy to hold, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> A long lasting battery charge and close shave make this excellent.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s first set up heads!</li>
            <li> The new one does trim closer and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Makes live so easy and clean.</li>
            <li> The old one, the Norelco 5845 XL, is superior to the new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, provides a very close shave and quick in getting the job done.</li>
            <li> Feels very cheap compared to my old Norelco razors</li>
            <li> Like the fact you can rinse it under hot water to clean it.</li>
            <li> Actually, the 7810X is an awesome upgrade over their previous model electric shaver for producing a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s fine razor, good for everyday use and after battery and blades</li>
            <li> Maybe the higher end models have a better motor but stay away from this model if you are accustomed to the older versions.</li>
            <li> As with other Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve found that they work best with a clean, dry, cool face.</li>
            <li> Fast, close shave, feels comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> Razor is very lightweight but ok...decent shave, grip....but no base charger...give me a break...</li>
            <li> so shipping was free and delivery was fast -- 2 days.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close and smooth with no nicks or rash.</li>
            <li> Cuts smooth, and didn&#x27;t take much time for my skin to adjust to it.</li>
            <li> this razor gives a smooth, fast, and close shave...</li>
            <li> TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A FAST, SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li> The shipping came real fast.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and very close shave.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d bet some higher-end models have a charge status light bar, but to me, that just isn&#x27;t worth an extra $30, $40, $50 or more.)  </li>
            <li> Those 5-10 extra minutes of sleep are so nice.</li>
            <li> I just started using this razor 2 weeks before Christmas and so far love it.  </li>
            <li> It definitely worth every penny.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for nearly a month now, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet which is a great improvement over my old shaver.</li>
            <li> and I am glad the old one worked.     </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s whisper quiet, which is nice.</li>
            <li> On the plus side it is nice looking, it&#x27;s quiet, and can be cleaned by rinsing it with water.  </li>
            <li> However, in the most important category for me, how close it shaves, it comes up short.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old and have been shaving with a Remingtom most all of my life.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED NORELCO PRODUCTS FOR MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE</li>
            <li> The floating heads are much better at conforming to your face than my old shaver was.</li>
            <li> This is a nice razor, to replace the one I left at a campground.  </li>
            <li> -- just say \\&quot;I&#x27;m worth</li>
            <li> I had to write a review on this shaver though because its worth every penny.     </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, the price... for the quality of this product, the price is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I use my old one using electric cord:)</li>
            <li> so far don&#x27;t love it because I had to go over my face like 6xs to get all my hairs ...</li>
            <li> I ended up finally switching to a Remington and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s far better than the 2 shaves</li>
            <li> but is better than the old</li>
            <li> The floating heads make it better than the old one.</li>
            <li> Treat yourself to a new 7810 for a much better shave at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and senstive neck, it worked great and no bleeding (I&#x27;ve experienced other brands that have chewed up my neck ...</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the shaver has a lot more plastic than previous Norelco shavers, which I think will lead to it cracking more easily if accidentally dropped or somehow placed under too much pressure.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a number of electric shavers through the years, never finding one that gave a clean shave, while at the same time being sturdy, battery efficient, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The heads on this razor are better than the more expensive model, it shaves closer,comfortably, than any razor I&#x27;ve used.. which was too close, and it does so in a way that is very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works very nicely with a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found if you use very light pressure, it works better than pressing down on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The good news is it works well until it abruptly dies.  </li>
            <li> A GOOD SHARP BLADE AND SHAVING CREAM TO SHAVE WITH.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closer, is much quieter, and is still running on the original charge after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have not even changed the blade and it is still sharp and no issues whatsoever mechanically or quality wise.</li>
            <li> Closeness of the shave is just right.</li>
            <li> I am in Afghanistan right now and someone stole this one while I was in the shower, and my wife sent me a Remington to replace it.</li>
            <li> And, the price was right.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> Price was right.  </li>
            <li> You can shave right after getting out of a shower with no diminished performance.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other perks include: very smooth shaving, super quiet motor,</li>
            <li> He was in much need of a new shaver and said this one works great and doesn&#x27;t pull at all on his facial hair.</li>
            <li> (yeah, I&#x27;m a geezer), and after using my new 7810 for a month I can tell you that this razor is light years better than the 10 year old one it replaced (7865 XL).  </li>
            <li> This is my first Norelco, but I am pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is much better than the previous model of Norelco shaver, and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> a great shave in very little time.</li>
            <li> As for the actual razor, it is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Apparently, these blades are made of magic.    </li>
            <li> This can barely handle anything more than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and fast shaves so far.  </li>
            <li> It was an excellent shaver and was going to be hard to replace!!</li>
            <li> Stay away from this model and spend a little more money for a better unit.</li>
            <li> The new razors are cheap, plastic pieces of garbage.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to people who are not happy with linear motion shavers to give it a try, or anybody who is looking for an excellent electric shaver for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> However, those older metal parts were no where near as easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean and quiet.</li>
            <li> - close shaving, whether you have a 3-day bear or just for your daily&#x27;clean-up&#x27;  - easy to clean</li>
            <li> Realizing that it can take an electric a while to acclimate to one&#x27;s face (for reasons I have yet to understand), I still have to put tremendous effort into shaving with it, so much so that it irritates my neck beyond reason.  </li>
            <li> But I am getting very discouraged with how quickly their razor are headed for the \\&quot;shaveyard\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean for the next use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left wondering, if I had received the 7810 XL, which is what thought I was ordering, would it have been as good as my old razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review 2 1/2 years after making the purchase and it still works great, especially considering I shave my entire head.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco case fit the new shaver just fine</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive electric razor I&#x27;ve purchased for myself to date, and I&#x27;m happy to say there was some benefit to moving up to a higher price point.    </li>
            <li> I had soon spent more on them than I had on the razor!  </li>
            <li> says it&#x27;s very good with his tough beard.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> Yet, it&#x27;s very light and quiet.</li>
            <li> This unit is easy to take care of and I enjoy shaving again as the old razor was about 8 years old and the battery was shot.  </li>
            <li> The plastic housing is as light as anything I&#x27;ve ever seen, but appears to be solid and well put together in an attractive black and silver color scheme.</li>
            <li> This is balanced very well, comfortable to use, and charges very fast compared to the older one.</li>
            <li> New shaving systems are designed to be fast, easy and profitable for the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has reduced the time I spend shaving significantly and is capable of giving a full and complete shave.</li>
            <li> The Norelco was reasonably priced, holds a charge, doesn&#x27;t sound like a chain saw, and gave a decent shave.</li>
            <li> and when I need a blade-close shave, I use &#x27;Lectric Shave first and the difference becomes negligible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet, the case is more durable</li>
            <li> This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve had in a while that gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Norelco, but last year when my old one died I changed to Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, and wasn&#x27;t happy with it.</li>
            <li> This one is VERY quiet, and does a better job than the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it does exactly what I expected ... nice shave.  </li>
            <li> Years ago my first Norelco was a 7000 series</li>
            <li> Second, it just felt better in my hand then the 7340.  </li>
            <li> It actually had a charge out of the box, but to be on the safe side, I charged it</li>
            <li> Product is quiet and first charge has lasted for more than three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had to hack and chop at it for 5 minutes or more to get the darn thing open.  </li>
            <li> There is no need for further descriptions as many have done that.</li>
            <li> and I am still on the first charge.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lightweight and pretty durable for traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who has always been a Norelco man for the 37 yrs we&#x27;ve been married.</li>
            <li> This is probably my fifth Norelco - my last one wouldn&#x27;t take a charge any more after about 8 years.</li>
            <li> but it definitely rinses out quicker and more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Tried it several more times, and it hung up another 2-3 times out of 10.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric in 20 years</li>
            <li> The shaver head can be rinsed under hot tap water which makes cleaning a snap.</li>
            <li> The quality of the shave is outstanding and compares well to a standard blade razor.</li>
            <li> Have used Norelco shavers for many years, and when my last Norelco started to need charging every day</li>
            <li> After my first shave with the 7810</li>
            <li> This time I selected the higher priced 7810XL.</li>
            <li> Prior to this shaver I had the Braun Pulsonic for 3 years and before that mostly had Norelcos.</li>
            <li> It is a much closer shave, so the additional money is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Actually he has purchased the top of the line Norelco shavers before and returned them.  </li>
            <li> My first Norelco shaver lasted 30 years.  </li>
            <li> First one lasted over 15 years, so I stayed with what I considered to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on different electric men&#x27;s shavers.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I just love the overall feel of the razor.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time buyer of an electric razor.</li>
            <li> The first time he used it, his first words were  \\&quot;How</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor consistently until I gor this Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Absolute GARBAGE!</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Norelco shaver several years ago, a 5845 XL, and have been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The first shave irritated his skin a bit as the lubricant and Lectric Shave</li>
            <li> This was my hubby&#x27;s first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> /irritation at first</li>
            <li> The capability of to be cleaned with hot water under the faucet is an additional advantage.    </li>
            <li> So much for the gold box deal!</li>
            <li> This shaver is better than a double edge razor (I&#x27;ve tried the mecur and edwin).  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric shaver, and I use it for shaving my head.  </li>
            <li> Plan on a solid 5 minutes to make sure you&#x27;re getting all the hairs on your head</li>
            <li> This is my first electric, i&#x27;ve been using blades ever since I started shaving.  </li>
            <li> comfortable, close shaves with this model as I&#x27;ve had with my old one.  </li>
            <li> just so you&#x27;re aware of this.</li>
            <li> First time to own/use an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is comparable to those higher end models that break the bank.  </li>
            <li> Charged the battery overnight, have used it more than three weeks now on the initial charge.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my son&#x27;s first electric razor.</li>
            <li> I was able to get 12 shaves off the initial charge.</li>
            <li> Just pop the top open and rinse under running water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for replacement blades, which I am changing for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the case from my old razor, but the charger for this one doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> It was funny.</li>
            <li> I picked this up as my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> but this product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get stubble in afternoon after shaving in the morning and it takes many rounds of shaving the same place.</li>
            <li> I got my first Norelco in Germany in 1954 and have use them since.</li>
            <li> I just got my first electric shaved in the mail and  tried it out ...</li>
            <li> exactly* what I want it to.  </li>
            <li> It cuts weekend stubble like hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First charge on the battery lasted 3 weeks of shaving every day Monday through Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> During my first shave, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was running or not because it was so quiet.  </li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s dynamic contour feature made a huge difference in the areas on my head that were curved - there was much greater surface to surface contact so the razor performed better with less effort.  </li>
            <li> This new one is even better than the old one he had.</li>
            <li> I have had numerous other razors, Norelco, Remington, but this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Have had a few different models this one is very good.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for weeks, and charges quickly  - surdy: I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost a year, and it works just as new    </li>
            <li> With my old shaver, I used to dump the hair out every day, and clean with the Norelco brush every couple of days.</li>
            <li> The artic looked cool, but most of the reviews were average.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter and much more quiet, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have, as they&#x27;ve cut costs on these things, Norleco has eliminated the carrying case, very handy when you travel as the blade cover comes off easy and if you nick a blade.. you&#x27;re screwed</li>
            <li> One thing I find useful when the beard gets too long to easily shave with the heads...</li>
            <li> Very good at cutting for a close shave, the only thing I would have liked is a battery indicator to know when the battery is going to die.</li>
            <li> Another positive is the battery life...  </li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a cheaper Norelco model but the reviews were luke-warm and most confirmed that they were often of Chinese or Mexican origin.</li>
            <li> I pretty much use it every day now.  </li>
            <li> This one is pretty much identical, but it is lighter.</li>
            <li> If your electric shaver is more than a few years old, an upgrade is worthwhile and probably something to consider.</li>
            <li> Cutting results are good but not as good as my old razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the description claims, \\&quot;...one-hour full charge offers up to 17 days of cordless shaving.\\</li>
            <li> Norelcos require very little maintenance and that is good because I don&#x27;t do much in that department...</li>
            <li> Inside the perfectly adequate cardboard box was a nearly bullet-proof plastic contraption wrapped around the shaver and its accessories.  </li>
            <li> Simply and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer a lot, as I like the short stubble look and its easy maintainance.  </li>
            <li> but it snaps back in place easily.  </li>
            <li> It has been three weeks since I got it, and it is still running strong with the initial charge.</li>
            <li> Spending that much did me a lot of good in the past.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an electric shaver who prefers rotaries to foils this might be a smart choice.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product certainly will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to clean, holds a charge for a really long time, and has clear indicators for when it is done charging.  </li>
            <li> The initial cost of buying the shaver itself is significant (in comparison with a regular old razor blade), but over time I can really see how this will save money and be just as effective.</li>
            <li> It has proven to be light weight in the hand, easy to handle and cuts smooth on a not so tough beard.</li>
            <li> and I always have a problem getting the new blades in right.  </li>
            <li> It is much quieter than the first one, and shaves equal to or better than the old one.  </li>
            <li> If you can overcome the following caveats, then you will be fine with this</li>
            <li> As others have noted, it is quick, quiet, and cuts the hair to a good length (if I want a closer shave or if I skip shaving for a few days, that&#x27;s what my standalone razor is for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my neck area burning however, which a real blade/lather doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> The description should have stated whether or not it has a low battery light.  </li>
            <li> I have a very angular chin.</li>
            <li> Makes you wonder how much of a difference there really is.  </li>
            <li> Did not see much sense in paying a premium if there were issues with the basics.   </li>
            <li> It was like someone actually thought about the fact that a shaver should fit a hand.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a light for when the battery was low - which is so infrequent</li>
            <li> Much happier with the Braun unit.</li>
            <li> Battery life is better than I expected</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone looking for a reasonably priced razor.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave - without razor burn.</li>
            <li> would have some advance notice that the shaver was ready to die.</li>
            <li> it is probably still a great personal grooming item that I&#x27;ll use daily for the next 3-5 years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have any complaints really, this shaver just works.  </li>
            <li> this review is years after the purchase Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> So, much that he ordered another one.  </li>
            <li> This was to replace a much cheaper razor of mine that was just not doing the job.</li>
            <li> Really now on week four and still going.  </li>
            <li> Very silent and smooth operation.</li>
            <li> and by how much -- the battery charge is decreasing.</li>
            <li> The 7810 is much lighter weight and quieter as well.</li>
            <li> the razor arrived as promised and was fully charged ready to use.  </li>
            <li> I really like the closeness of the shave I am now getting with the 7810</li>
            <li> It was in my price   range and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> This has really been a blessing.</li>
            <li> Very quite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noticeable the closer shaving that you get.</li>
            <li> The unit works very well.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave with almost no pressure.  </li>
            <li> Also, I wish it had a red light that would warn me that I am close to running out of power.  </li>
            <li> The 7810XL has a three-minute fast charge feature that works really well on Sunday mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has worked well without too much noise and seems to hold a charge well, too.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is a racket that you can&#x27;t get out of.  </li>
            <li> It does not do a real close shave.</li>
            <li> And the shave is much smoother than I ever thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It shaves close enough, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is really important.</li>
            <li> It shaves well and the rechargeable battery is really strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am ready to pitch it.</li>
            <li> The gentleman I bought it for really likes it.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s too early to say for sure as I have used it only for 1 month.  </li>
            <li> This unit gives a good enough shave, but it is nowhere near as solid a product.   </li>
            <li> I had been using the same razor for about 7 years and really liked it, but something broke on a recent trip</li>
            <li> The motor seems to drive the blades too slowly to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> The workmanship and quality is equal to my previous model and it shaves remarkably well for a non-blade shaving system.</li>
            <li> Maybe it made the shave more efficient, but Amazon reviews seem to indicate shavers with the HQ9 blades were actually less efficient and less effective.  </li>
            <li> I thought at first it was weak, but realized it was just that good...</li>
            <li> strong, long battery life, and close shave..   </li>
            <li> My experience with foil shavers is that they seem to cause more ingrown hairs on my face, than any other method of shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite useful!</li>
            <li> it does better than other electric razors around the jawline</li>
            <li> I looked into other models, and found this razor to be top quality and within my price range.</li>
            <li> The washing with water feature seems pretty cool, although cleaning it probably has more to do with personal hygeine and less to do with its performance?</li>
            <li> With the 4817XL, you just waited until the shaver clogged up and started spitting hairs back out to know when it was time to clean.  </li>
            <li> There is a green LED light that shows when the batteries are being charged which blinks once a full charge has been reached.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer on the back to shorten the hair so it can be cleanly shaved with the heads.</li>
            <li> so I can easily clean it without working about the internal parts getting wet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; It takes seconds and means it will always be clean the next time you use it.</li>
            <li> pleasantly pleased-  afraid it would&#x27;t be as good a shave as my very old one.</li>
            <li> It still doesn&#x27;t match a real razor shave, but the unit has held-up very well and still holds a charge as well as when new.</li>
            <li> I did follow instructions and gave it an initial charge overnight before using fo rthe first time, but it never worked right.  </li>
            <li> The data that is available does not clearly differentiate the shavers.  </li>
            <li> I first tried to buy this razor directly from norelco</li>
            <li> They have a nice comparison feature that is really slick, but not all the data populates for all the shavers.  </li>
            <li> My first was 7 years old and still worked find</li>
            <li> No nylon case like my 1st one but the old case is the right size for the new one.</li>
            <li> The new one is lighter but holds a charge much longer and is quieter.  </li>
            <li> I have used this shaver with 3-year-old blades to clean up stubble left from a shave with a new Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The 7810XL is lighter because it uses a lot more plastic then metal and less parts.  </li>
            <li> We are using a blade but thought that an electric might be more convenient and less time-consuming.  </li>
            <li> For the price I love this shaver, it&#x27;s been over a year and a half</li>
            <li> This model doesn&#x27;t even have all the extra features or settings and truthfully, they aren&#x27;t necessary.  </li>
            <li> I am replacing a much older model that was not water-resistant, and this model&#x27;s washable head and water-resistance makes it easier to use around the sink and shower.</li>
            <li> this is a really nice shaver that is quiet, shaves close, holds a charge well - and doesn&#x27;t break the bank like the alleged top-of-the-line shavers do.    </li>
            <li> I contemplated the more expensive models, but I&#x27;m glad I gave this one a shot.  </li>
            <li> Works great, delivered fast, cannot go wrong with Norelco in my opinion</li>
            <li> The 8250 has the same basic feel, but it was $25 more.  </li>
            <li> It charges lightning fast as advertised, yet it holds its charge very well (so far).      </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t expect this razor to give him as close of a shave as an actual razor blade, but because of his experience with his last Norelco, we did expect more.     </li>
            <li> The standard Braun shavers are way better and designed to last years, not months.</li>
            <li> the main on/off button broke</li>
            <li> I recently upgraded from a different Philips Norelco shaver and this seems to be a much better system.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my older Norelco triple head shaver.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 7810 is lighter in weight than my older one.</li>
            <li> It is much quieter, and it shaves much closer than the old one did.</li>
            <li> On Amazon, I saw a more expensive model 7810 and thought I probably deserved a better one.    </li>
            <li> You should just dump the scraps in the trash and then give it a quick rinse, shake out the excess water and put it back in \\&quot;its spot.\\</li>
            <li> The battery life is probably the biggest pro of this particular model.  </li>
            <li> i am a classic man, i´ve prefered to use the blade shave and philps is an alternative for me, execellent.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer than the older models</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always just used a traditional Gillette razor over the years (most recently, the Mach4).</li>
            <li> We often spend time in a field environment without running water or mirrors and I&#x27;m still expected to have a reasonably hair free face.</li>
            <li> This one in particular gives NO warning that it&#x27;s about to die.  </li>
            <li> and I have been struggling to find a decent replacement ever since.  </li>
            <li> I bought an off brand last time and it did not last long and never did give me a good shave.</li>
            <li> At times it sounds as if it&#x27;s too weak to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> There must be something funny about a guy with a half-shaven face purchasing a new electric shaver early on Sunday morning because the clerk couldn&#x27;t stop giggling.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> My take on it: highly recommended.    </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Shaver to anyone in the market for one...</li>
            <li> I highly recommed this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Close cut Highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, waterproof, easy to clean and can be used dry or wet.</li>
            <li> That would be a positive, but without a low battery light, I cannot even rely on a slowing motor to know the battery is low.</li>
            <li> I have used it daily since and it knocks down daily growth very effectively.  </li>
            <li> Other positives- lightweight,  easy to handle</li>
            <li> I found those heads to be pretty irritating to my face, even after a year of using it, and it seemed to pull my skinn and missed more whiskers than I&#x27;d expect, leading to ingrown hairs or that super long solo whisker you missed all week that your wife plucks off with a tweezer right before you go out with her..</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast, course and dense and the 7310 turned my cheeks into baby soft pillows.</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s much quieter than his old one.  </li>
            <li> I really like this one so far.</li>
            <li> The 8260 was not available at the closest store, but I was able to view it in the display case.  </li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;ll most likely never be shaving far enough away from an electrical outlet</li>
            <li> It holds a full charge so long, I don&#x27;t even pack the ac/charger.</li>
            <li> I normally need to shave twice a day.</li>
            <li> Reading personal reviews is very helpful, thanks to those who take the time to do so!  </li>
            <li> Well worth extra cost.</li>
            <li> Norelco, as I understand it, is pretty much the only brand to go with.</li>
            <li> After a month of poor shaves, I ordered the 7810 and have been delighted with the results.</li>
            <li> This one is a little more comfortable to hold than the other one.</li>
            <li> the razor is all that I expected -- cuts well &#x3D;&#x3D; charges easily and cleans with NO trouble -- since you can just rinse it under water</li>
            <li> It was also easy enough to push back in.  </li>
            <li> From day one it was more convenient and less irritation and now that my skin has completely adjusted it is night and day</li>
            <li> Directions on initial use were simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Again, it is far better than my previous shaver, so I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my other Norelco razor, more expensive one, which was good but</li>
            <li> The only con is that the pop-up trimmer is not as good as other shavers I have owned, but I use a beard trimmer for such things anyway.</li>
            <li> It recharges quickly and holds a charge a long time.  </li>
            <li> I viewed the new one with trepidation when unwrapping it due to the light weight.  </li>
            <li> With the new Norelco he doesn&#x27;t feel a thing with the aftershave.  </li>
            <li> He loves his new Norelco.</li>
            <li> so I needed a new razor)</li>
            <li> With that in mind, when my 8000&#x27;s blades dulled and it was time for a new set..</li>
            <li> if it did not work, I would buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> He has since bought a new one and this one just sits in a box under the sink.</li>
            <li> I used it for three weeks hoping my beard just had to adjust to the new razor.</li>
            <li> Then I realized that maybe I needed new blades.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new electric shaver</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco&#x27;s for a number of years and their working life seems to get shorter and shorter with every new razor I buy.  </li>
            <li> I just move on to a new shaver or shaving method -</li>
            <li> The thing is like new.  </li>
            <li> The battery died and I think I may have messed it up trying to solder in a new battery.  </li>
            <li> I felt, after all this time, maybe Norelco had improved the shaver, so I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> Even Amazon&#x27;s fastest order fulfillment system wasn&#x27;t going to get me a new shaver within an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just get a new one again.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d buy another if &amp; when he needs a new one.</li>
            <li> Has metal heads rather than these new ones with plastic heads that fall out all the time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much more comfortable and less messy.  </li>
            <li> Second, and as mentioned by others, it would be nice to have some sort of warning when the batteries are going to die - as it is, the shaver just stops dead...</li>
            <li> I do get a shadow earlier than if I use a straight razor, but that isn&#x27;t much to complain about.</li>
            <li> I think the charger could be more travel-friendly, that is, compact, but with this long battery life you&#x27;d need to be on the road for a long time to bother bringing it.</li>
            <li> The packaging consists of that horrific plastic clam-shell stuff so better have a strong pair of scissors handy.</li>
            <li> The recharger cord is more compact than my previous shaver but other than that they are pretty much identical.</li>
            <li> I used that one for a year, and it never dod a good job on my neck unless I pushed real hard, then it would cut me.</li>
            <li> This new cap holds tight and strong, and has nothing that will break off.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This replaced a Norelco shaver that was very old but still working.  </li>
            <li> However I was very surprised to see that it shaves well.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> On my third week on the first chWarge of the battery.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it that equates to better or lower reliability.   </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t obvious, until after I pushed the on button and used it the first time.  </li>
            <li> worth the money, as long as it isn&#x27;t $120+ for just the shaving unit</li>
            <li> This razor is pretty basic and just what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I use regularly.</li>
            <li> Finally, the price is pretty reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only other thing to comment upon is that it would be better to have a meter indicating remaining battery life instead of just stopping.</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, it was so quiet</li>
            <li> Especially if it&#x27;s your first one.</li>
            <li> It is even better than the last more expensive Norelco model.</li>
            <li> This razor battery lasted for about 10 days after full charge but shaving is not very close.</li>
            <li> But with a power cord to plug in and charge AND SHAVE at the same time, there&#x27;s no major need for that indicator light.  </li>
            <li> Ok so I have a very heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> that so far that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve done with my new 7180.  </li>
            <li> rather than spend $40.00 on new blades I figured and extra $20.00 for a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> replaced old norelco (10 yurs) with new.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is quieter and does a better job that my previous 7600, which died suddenly only to relive once I bought the new one.</li>
            <li> The lack of a low batter light is no disadvantage since the battery lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend&#x27;s son, he has cerebral palsy and is wheelchair bound, part of this condition is he has trouble sitting still, and startles easily,</li>
            <li> It shaves very rapidly and thoroughly and there is absolutely no irritation even on the first use.  </li>
            <li> The braun and other electrics are not as good for neck, upper lip, and facial hairs that might grow in a different direction.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my real old one had the remaining minutes displayed which was nice.</li>
            <li> I guess this was asking too much, and although the 7810 is simple, light, and quiet, I could still sandpaper furniture with my beard after a long session with this product.  </li>
            <li> I find that it cuts closest when my face is dry (usually right out of bed).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t compare to other razors since this is my first, but I like the results....and what else really matters?</li>
            <li> Certainly, now I could actually break a part that I could not break before.  </li>
            <li> When trying to get some of the whiskers out of the unit, the floating heads tend to fall out and they are not always as easy to get back in place as I would like (on the other hand, I tend to be impatient!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently replaced an older Norelco men&#x27;s shaver with a new 7810XL model.</li>
            <li> 7810 Men&#x27;s Cutting System Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] arrived in great shape and within the estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li> I sent my 20year old Norelco to electricshaverstore.com, who cleaned my old one, replaced the battery, and fixed the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The booklet clearly states that it \\&quot;does not</li>
            <li> He said with his old shaver his face stung after he put on aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Norelco that I had been using to shave my head in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> If this lasts 1/4 the time my old model did, it will pay for itself in disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t have a battery meter (my 10 year old one that died did), but so far just charged it after 3 weeks for fear</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was 10+ years old and was showing it&#x27;s age.  </li>
            <li> The razor is very well made and runs very quietly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace my old Norelco razor which was 7 years old.</li>
            <li> I feel that I am getting a very close shave after a short brake in period of a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I did have to get the on/off plastic button glued on by a regional Norelco certified repair shop on my old Norelco about 1+ yrs ago.</li>
            <li> Not cheap (though it may feel a bit cheap)</li>
            <li> I brought this to replace a old Norelco that battery that was loosing it&#x27;s charge.</li>
            <li> It shaves day old beard as well as 5 O\\&quot;clock touch ups.</li>
            <li> It is lighter and does not have the loud buzz when in use.  </li>
            <li> so all I can relate it to is old tech and hand razors.  </li>
            <li> Old electric razors sounded like I was using an echo weed trimmer in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> No problems since Amazon offers the blade refills via Amazon Prime/subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li> Although it cut the hair from the bottom same as the blade shaving do, but also skin may suffer from straight contact with rotary blade of this razor.</li>
            <li> So I will not recommend it for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> He is sensitive to loud noises, so</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Remington.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas to replace my 15 year old</li>
            <li> I am surprised this is what has become of Philips Norelco razors.</li>
            <li> I had to go over areas of my face 10 or 12 times to get anything near satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> my 4th noreloco and every one (so far) has lasted for years &amp; years......</li>
            <li> I can still manage to use my old Norelco razor by, get this, sticking the eraser end of a pencil into the on/off hole to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> The 7810 gives a very close shave and runs quietly.  </li>
            <li> So, I decided to buy one for myself to replace my old 3500 model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers since I was 18 years old.</li>
            <li> (the heads in the old one had been replaced 30 days before the batts gave out).  </li>
            <li> This razor was purchased to replace my old 8894 XL.</li>
            <li> my old Norelco (probably 20 years old).</li>
            <li> he recommend purchasing Electric Shaver lubricant and Lectric Shave aftershave if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The three razors \\&quot;float,\\&quot; doing reasonably well in following the curves of my face.</li>
            <li> A replacement for my 10 yr old Norelco 5603X, which by the way is still giving me 3-4 30 minute shaves per charge,</li>
            <li> I have to watch the clock with my old one...</li>
            <li> The 7810 is very quiet, though - almost too much so.</li>
            <li> I must say, Philips/Norelco electric shavers have always stood out as far as quality and longevity goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Norelco had that feature (Norelco Model: 8151XL).</li>
            <li> The results for me are a closer shave with fewer passes compared to my old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get no indication that the batter charge is nearly gone.</li>
            <li> This one is sorta on the low end of the price range but it does what my husband wants it to and he hasn&#x27;t had to gharge it yet</li>
            <li> First charge takes a long time.</li>
            <li> they just don&#x27;t measure up to the old ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the shave close and comfortable, although I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> This model is also quieter than my old model.</li>
            <li> So just how much money does Norelco expect you to pay to get a basic shave?</li>
            <li> I got from an 8 hour charge on old shaver.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son could probably get 17 days out of it.</li>
            <li> I really miss that red light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> old shaver slowed near the end of the charge, but this one does not.</li>
            <li> I have an old Philips that I purchased in France on 2005, so I wanted a change</li>
            <li> Thus far, no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Have only used this a few times - it&#x27;s more like a backup in the case that i don&#x27;t have time for a blade.</li>
            <li> My husbands norelco of many years died a few months back</li>
            <li> It took him a few tries to get the hang of it, but it gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> This unit is very light-weight, make sure you hold onto it tight when it&#x27;s wet if you have a tile floor!</li>
            <li> After I got it down to a short length, they blades really make quick work of the stubble.  </li>
            <li> I mean what more do you want.</li>
            <li> The main gripe that I have is that it does not give a real close shave, and you have to work at it and keep going over more difficult spots like your neck and chin.  </li>
            <li> than first impressions would have you believe, and I&#x27;m still getting well over the product description&#x27;s indicated number of shaves on a single battery charge.    </li>
            <li> I tried again with the Norelco 7810 and was pleased to experience little to minor irritation.  </li>
            <li> But back to this 7810 shaver, it looks like the replacement for my old model, and is priced at exactly the same amount.</li>
            <li> Although each new generation of Norelco&#x27;s claim to shave closer and closer, I personally think the secret lies in good sharp blades and a dry clean face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver for my husband a few days ago, and right off the bat, he noticed it didn&#x27;t give him the close shave he was used to with his older Norelco.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soldered in and if you do get a new battery in it, you still have an old razor with ten year old technology.  </li>
            <li> One reviewer said when the recharge light comes on it loses power right away, I say who cares if the charge lasts as long as it does.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic in particular almost cuts too close, and left me with razor burn.</li>
            <li> I used Norelcos for 25 years and recently had to make the choice between replacing my older 4817XL or paying $55 to have someone put in the battery I already paid $15 to get.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, so I never really wanted to return to using blades.  </li>
            <li> With other shavers I have owned I would usually shave with a disposable shaver Monday mornings since the electric shaver wouldn&#x27;t do a good enough job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every high end electric razor on the market in the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is, like all the shavers, the replacement heads are priced too high.</li>
            <li> With most of the weight located near the cutting heads, the balance point for this light weight shaver is just above the handle.</li>
            <li> I need to order a new cord for it from them now as I think I threw the old one away last week.</li>
            <li> Usually I use these reviews as my guide as to whether or not i&#x27;ll buy the product or not and let me tell you the reviews were all accurate on this shaver.</li>
            <li> this method left me with a 5:00 shadow at about 11:15.. and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it feels cheap and weak at the beginning, very quite,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much lighter and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; as my old electric, and since the transformer is in the plug and not the razor the cord is more expensive to replace, but if moving the AC voltage components out of the razor means i can wash it out under the faucet</li>
            <li> The only thing to beware of is that inside the head assembly some of the parts are cheap plastic and appear to be quite fragile, so be careful not to drop it lest you want it your razor to become a paper weight.</li>
            <li> My skin irritated for exactly 2 days as expected (user&#x27;s manual says up to three weeks), but no problem after that.</li>
            <li> I wet my face first</li>
            <li> It is extremely quiet, cuts very well and has a long battery live - haven&#x27;t recharged it yet.  </li>
            <li> It also shaved much closer than my old one (could have been just because it was old and not as sharp).   </li>
            <li> new Norelco is definitely a product that \\&quot;you get what you pay for..\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for a new electric.    </li>
            <li> A couple years I thought to buy a new one and bought their low priced model.</li>
            <li> I should have popped for a new one before I bought the last set of replacement blades</li>
            <li> I was expecting a deal and something new, not a potential aids death sentence.</li>
            <li> Shaving with an electric razor is all new to me, I have been using a regular razor for 35 years!</li>
            <li> and I had problem shaving near my neck with it, because my hairs tend to grow near parallel to my skin around neck.</li>
            <li> My husband does not have a heavy growth of 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, so facial hair is fairly light.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and think the flashing green light means it&#x27;s still charging.</li>
            <li> My husband loves that one charge will last up to 17 days and this electric shavor is much quieter than the last one.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s very convenient, and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to spending money on Gillette Blades.  </li>
            <li> I found the same brand same specifications at much lower price at Walmart.</li>
            <li> This is my third, replacing my previous one, which couldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and was less effective even when plugged in.</li>
            <li> A huge, hard plastic bubble was inside the box, with the shaver, a cord, a brush, a small manual, and, mostly, a huge amount of air.  </li>
            <li> My final minor complaint is that it would be nice if it came with a travel carrying case instead of the cloth pouch that is included - but that&#x27;s a really minor beef, since most of us have a small travel kit for our shaver, toothbrush/paste, etc.</li>
            <li> Initial charging was very simple to accomplish and the initial use of my new Norelco was very comfortable and clean cutting.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Remington, hated it, went back to a Norelco, LOVE IT..., appears to keep a good charge, wish it had a read out like my last one on battery life.  </li>
            <li> For my old Norelco, I did buy a new set of blades after 2 yrs but used them continuously until the shaver finally died last month.</li>
            <li> It is also easier to clean - not sure why</li>
            <li> My previous Norelco shaver had a red low battery light.</li>
            <li> The battery of this razor lasts many shaves longer than my other previously owned razors, the shave is much closer and smoother, and the battery charge takes less that one hour even when the battery is completely discharged.  </li>
            <li> The trouble started when after shaving, I wanted to clean the head and fipped it open.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend enjoyed this cutting system very much.</li>
            <li> Not that the 4817XL was particularly heavy to begin with - especially in comparison to the earlier Norelcos I used, but the light weight of the 7810XL made it easier to work with.      </li>
            <li> Oh by the way Phillips offers a 30 day return policy on this so if you don&#x27;t like it just send it back.  </li>
            <li> And daily cleaning is a snap since you merely flip open the top and rinse it with hot water.  </li>
            <li> The Head will pop off if I open it too far</li>
            <li> They are finally back to the old shaver reliability.  </li>
            <li> Have to replace the old one occasionally</li>
            <li> very QUIET compared to my old face-eater.</li>
            <li> The last time I charged it was early July</li>
            <li> This shaver replaces a 10 year old Norelco that finally wore out.</li>
            <li> When that happens you can wait a few second and turn on and use for a short time or plug it in, use and then leave pugged to recharge - take about an hour and has flashing light when done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where this model (and apparently its successor) excels is in the features.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I had one from my previous unit, but that&#x27;s the main thing that I see as missing.</li>
            <li> Take it from experience and wasted money - it&#x27;s WELL worth it to upgrade to this shaver.  </li>
            <li> and it is sort of ok product, but not great product.</li>
            <li> As for charging time, after the initial four hour charge (mine actually took far less than that), I&#x27;ve confirmed Norelco&#x27;s claim that subsequent charges only take an hour.    </li>
            <li> It may not matter which one is better made because I will probably end up facing the choice again between an expensive battery replacement and a new shaver</li>
            <li> The 7180 is a quiet, extremely lightweight unit that cuts very, very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I really like this thing, and I only &#x27;dry shave&#x27; with it, meaning not in the shower.</li>
            <li> Oddly, the complaint with the razor was that it failed to perform in the areas most important to the device - so I quickly ruled it out.  </li>
            <li> I did research other models like the 7310 and 7340 and could not really find major differences other than one review that said that the motor in the 7810 was faster and thus cut better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why many of the other models do not have this feature, since it means that I don&#x27;t need to continually recharge the battery for fear of it running out mid-shave.  </li>
            <li> Counter intuitively, the light is steady green when charging and flashing green when fully charged.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would do on my hardcore cable thick hair, but his baby fine hair comes right off.</li>
            <li> He said it was too hard to clean and that the battery didn&#x27;t stay charged.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little cheap, and I would be careful not to drop it, but you buy it for the function is serves,</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was never willing to spend much money for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> If the red light came on, then I could usually finish my last shave.</li>
            <li> First, the 7810 was the only shaver that got a 4.5 average star rating at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Did not really need all the buzzers and bells and this particular model</li>
            <li> That was a far more expensive unit when I got it about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It has a little trouble getting whiskers on my neck that lay flat, but my chin and cheeks come out very smooth.</li>
            <li> If there was no red light, then I had at least one shave left.</li>
            <li> The motor barely had enough power to turn the blades.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts at least 2-3 weeks after a full charge (about 15-30 minutes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the foil heads and found them less durable and less comfortable.</li>
            <li> then a few moments to dry completely is helpful, like if I&#x27;m in a hot climate.</li>
            <li> same price or less for a higher level of  same band at walmart.</li>
            <li> I have owned numerous other rechargeable battery operated razors in the past but my purchase of the \\&quot;Philips Norelco 7810 Men&#x27;s Cutting System\\&quot; razor is by far the best quality of them  all.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t warn you when it is near time to charge, it does have a very long battery life between charges.</li>
            <li> but I know it won&#x27;t be long before they (10 yr old NiCads) finally give up the ghost.</li>
            <li> Second, after a few months it no longer cuts the hairs on my neck as well as it first did, despite following all cleaning and lubricating recommendations.  </li>
            <li> I then returned to standard razors of many types and blade configurations, and gels and salves and still was not able to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close, with little to no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was going over my face too many times or too hard, so after a few days I tried it again, going over each area only once and using the lightest touch possible.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s past reputation, as this is a poor excuse, but a good example of junk.</li>
            <li> I like that it does not slow down toward the end of the charge.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine the duration of the charge but it appears to be on track for at least 4 wks of shaving.</li>
            <li> Found shaver locally for $10 less within four days of receiving from Amazon and normally would take it back to store</li>
            <li> Very easy to maintain especially since it can be cleaned by simply washing the cutting heads.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who wish a travel case had been included; I&#x27;ll use my old one, but it should still come with one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how long the battery charge will take after the initial charge, because after three weeks, I&#x27;m still working on the initial charge.</li>
            <li> The clippers built into the back made short work of the long stuff.  </li>
            <li> main thing missing from my perspective is a case to hold the shaver and brushes.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, he has had several made by Philips and they last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It makes very little noise which makes you think well is it really doing anything but trust me its doing everything.     </li>
            <li> I really was not sure what the difference was between the 7810 and 7340, but two things struck me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the 7810 as a backup for when I&#x27;m too lazy to do a real shave in the morning.  </li>
            <li> A lifelong Norelco user, I recently purchased a Norelco 7180 to replace my last shaver (which only lasted 10 years - for shame...).  </li>
            <li> The only criticisms I have to offer are minor.  </li>
            <li> so it probably just has to last as long as the battery.</li>
            <li> Razor is well made and should last a long time...</li>
            <li> The only minor gripe I have is I wish this shaver came with a carrying case.  </li>
            <li> I did a test to see how long it will last, It did</li>
            <li> Both do not sound powerful (being quiet) but do get the job done after a few passes.    </li>
            <li> That has to be a fluke, and we&#x27;ll see how long the second charge lasts - I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this review after the batteries run dry the second time.  </li>
            <li> With a heavy beard you are going to get about 6 months of use before you need to buy new blades.  </li>
            <li> The battery was not lasting very long anymore</li>
            <li> Charge is lasting a very long time as advertised.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not expecting it to last very long.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t matter to us as the old case from his previous razor worked.</li>
            <li> My old one (at least 15 years old) served me well, but the battery died and wouldn&#x27;t recharge anymore.</li>
            <li> After years of using electric razors, this is the first that I have been unhappy since the first use.    </li>
            <li> I have odd facial hair in that it grows in about 10 different directions, so blades required multiple passes and often left me with razor burn and in grown hairs.    </li>
            <li> Seems to shave as well, if not better, than my older model.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to do this with my older shavers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok....blades dull too fast.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product and Amazon&#x27;s free shipping was super-fast as always.</li>
            <li> The shave is not quite as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s not far off...</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time between charges too.</li>
            <li> none so far, maybe after a few month and comeback to update</li>
            <li> I get a close shave each day and it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It does hold a charge for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> Long charge life.</li>
            <li> This model has a long charge battery.</li>
            <li> It takes me twice as long to shave as it did before.</li>
            <li> Shaver works well and keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Long duration batteries.</li>
            <li> The only thing you can&#x27;t do is shave wet with lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this badboy with me on long road trips</li>
            <li> It could be that I take too long to shave.</li>
            <li> It gives a relatively close shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I can be using this razor and suddenly it stops because the battery is empty.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.  </li>
            <li> , it is very hard to clean it each time after a shave and also this thing is not build for someone like me with a heavy set of facial hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than the previous, expensive Braun and Panasonic foils</li>
            <li> My previous (recent) Norelcos have had indicator lights that come on when the battery is low, but this one does not.  </li>
            <li> Even with the previous Braun and Panasonic shavers, I was constantly going back to using blades.  </li>
            <li> That said,  it seems to be really quiet because it lacks a lot of power- on a full charge you can hear the little blades jut churning away trying to cut those tiny whiskers (and on me they are very tiny).</li>
            <li> The blades appear to be really sharp and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The only odd things that have happened are that the plastic holder for the trimmer on the back fell off, it was easy enough to put back on, but was shocked to have it fall off within 3 weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> This left me with the hundreds of reviews on Amazon and other sites to figure out which one to buy.    </li>
            <li> I have owned remington, panasonic and one other brand and have always gone back to norelco.</li>
            <li> my skin felt smoother than it has in as long as I can remember, whether using a 5 blade \\&quot;fusion\\&quot; type razor or electric!</li>
            <li> I guess, as compared to other similar products, the 7810 works well,</li>
            <li> The design of the cover of the head has different patterns, lines as the former but also little holes that catch the shortest remaining stuble.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for months, and gets a relatively close cut on my face without nicks and without any type of cream, paste, gel, oil, or other lubricant.</li>
            <li> The charge doesn&#x27;t take very long.  </li>
            <li> It runs for a very long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to hold a very long charge.  </li>
            <li> It holds its charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> keep the thing dry and heads oiled when stored, and I never bring it into the shower, so</li>
            <li> Your skin needs to be completely dry, and a preshave lotion would no doubt help.  </li>
            <li> I sit it on my counter to dry</li>
            <li> From the sound of it, the cutting heads are rotating faster than the earlier models.</li>
            <li> I decided that it was just getting obscenely ridiculous with how much companies like Gillette are charging for replacement razor cartridges, so I gave this a shot.</li>
            <li> (either dry w/ the enclosed brush or w/ water)  </li>
            <li> but maybe I just try it dry ...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to take longer to get a complete shave than was expecting.</li>
            <li> Low noise,some have complained its loud</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on my extermely tough beard.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco works with a single \\&quot;pass.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> But this one has just a single LED to tell you it&#x27;s fully charged.  </li>
            <li> After a single charge it seems to go on forever.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive beard and have used foil razors in the past.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when the batteries are starting to get Low - there is NO Charge Indicator to let you Know that the Razor needs charged</li>
            <li> Slightly irritating at first coming from a blade &amp; cream.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it difficult to tell the differences between shavers in the same series, it was not easy to figure out why you would want to consider a shaver at the next higher level.  </li>
            <li> I only decided to get a new one as the NiCad battery had become weak.</li>
            <li> I am part Native American and thus I grow very little facial</li>
            <li> This model is about the same price as my previous one and it says \\&quot;Made in</li>
            <li> Got the replacement blades for 5 bucks less than local......</li>
            <li> I tried Braun but it only lasted  less than a year.</li>
            <li> I subsequently need to shave less often and when I do shave, it takes a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li> The first, reviewed previously, failed for the same reason.  </li>
            <li> Well, 7810 might be slightly lighter and a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> Two previous shavers, very similar, had battery charging problems.  </li>
            <li> Any further small appliances that I purchase will be from a retail store where the clerk can open the package before payment is made.</li>
            <li> unit is fairly quiet like my previous Norelco which lets me shave in the morning without waking my spouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my previous model it would last until next morning and less passes over my face.  </li>
            <li> It also cost a little less than my old shaver did in 1996.</li>
            <li> However, there no longer is a red LED that glows when the batteries are down to their last few minutes of life.</li>
            <li> One tip - the shaver does not noticeably slow down as the battery charge gives out - instead it suddenly cuts off completely.</li>
            <li> Having it suddenly quit running is annoying, even if you can use the quick charge feature and then finish your shave after only a short delay.    </li>
            <li> Took a while to find a Norelco without too many bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> This was the most overpackaged product I have ever seen, and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad ones.  </li>
            <li> I changed the blades on the old unit every year and never had a problem or complaint with it.</li>
            <li> Be ready to spend at least a few minutes just to get the shaver out of its packaging.  </li>
            <li> just what I expected from Norelco.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you need to be careful and look at a mirror??\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> This left me with the 8250, 8260, 7810, 7340, 7120 and probably a few others.  </li>
            <li> He simply glued the broken plastic piece back in place and for ten bucks I was on my way.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see or feel it being as close as a blade, and I expected that,</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and had to go over and over the same spots to get an acceptable shave.  </li>
            <li> Be careful opening this thing.  </li>
            <li> Not that I ever felt like my last razor was &#x27;heavy&#x27;...</li>
            <li> Maybe not poor by today&#x27;s standards, but poor compared to what Norleco used to produce.  </li>
            <li> Not much at all to complain about.</li>
            <li> but they simply do not work.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe some sleaze bags are buying them, using them for a few months then exchanging them since blades are so expensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will destroy a Schick Hydra 5 in about 8 days and NO, the acclaimed sharperners and sharpening tricks such as swiping on denim can not salvage a razor that has gone up against my whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I still have to go back over it a few times.</li>
            <li> However, it takes a few minutes to get the job done properly, and the shave is not as close as with blades.</li>
            <li> I have bought three Phillips Norelco razors in the last few years range</li>
            <li> Finally, I decided to spend a few bucks and purchased the Phillips Norelco 7810.  </li>
            <li> I have no real complaints with this razor.  </li>
            <li> He always cut himself with a razor no matter how careful he was.</li>
            <li> I use it when on military maneuvers with the National Guard.</li>
            <li> Rather, I prefer a double edge blade in an old-fashioned heavy handle.</li>
            <li> I do not use it as a wet razor</li>
            <li> Stray hairs were left behind, and my skin was still left with red welts.  </li>
            <li> There are little stubs left here and there, but other than that, not much to complain.</li>
            <li> I tried a third time, this time carefully stretching the skin tight and shaving one small area at a time, with the same results.</li>
            <li> You will nerver replace a blade, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> The biggest single complaint is the rotational speed of the blades must be about half of the old 3605X.</li>
            <li> the main negative is the bubble wrap packaging that makes you destroy packaging so that you cannot return the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the cordless Norelco 7810 electric shaver for a couple of weeks now and find that, for me, The triple cutting heads are spaced too far apart (unlike the triple heads on my older Norelco shaver which the 7810 replaces).</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard, and it trims it very well, with very little (if any) irritation.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco gave me at least 5 weeks on average</li>
            <li> The speed of the cutting heads is higher and quiet.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that to me, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it holds a charge for as long as is advertised.</li>
            <li> This new razor is so weak and has no power.</li>
            <li> had one of these b4 doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as other other one did.</li>
            <li> But it, like other electrics, can&#x27;t shave as close as a blade and lather.</li>
            <li> The other thing was that the head assembly came off too.  </li>
            <li> Also compared prices at local businesses in our small town.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun, Panasonic and other electric razors and this one did not seem to be up to par with those.  </li>
            <li> It dies abruptly when it needs a charge.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned that they miss the travel case.</li>
            <li> One required an 8 hour charge and the other 1 hour.  </li>
            <li> After reveiwing some of the  coments from other people, I was going to order  the newest one out</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been shaving with disposable razors for the past 4 years, or should I say, occasionally shaving.  </li>
            <li> Shaving time takes a bit longer than other models.</li>
            <li> so I prefer them to other brands.</li>
            <li> I looked for other razors and came across this Norelco 7810.  </li>
            <li> I have used my Norelco for several years without a problem, other than the usual maintenance and blade replacements.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to being very curious but sometimes that small extra part left-over after closing up puzzles me....;&gt;)  </li>
            <li> After that my dead shaver would not charge, not sure if its the actual charger or the shaver, either way it&#x27;s a total waste.</li>
            <li> received purchase in less than one week, so everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> It has fully cut every hair on those tough spots, which had me really surprised.  </li>
            <li> Based my purchase on researching previous reviews and shoppiing other stores and sites for value.</li>
            <li> did the other half star go?  </li>
            <li> but I find that hard to believe since they both use the same cutter heads according to Norelco.</li>
            <li> It makes a loud high frequency whine that makes shaving  a bad experience.</li>
            <li> Our only complaint would be, it didn&#x27;t come with a case.</li>
            <li> SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE HAD AT LEAST TEN NORELCO SHAVERS AND EVERY ONE OF THEM</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they switch the flip direction of the trimmer ( sideburn cutter) and it collapses (try&#x27;s to shut) when you use an upward motion.  </li>
            <li> I have a really thick beard and have been through a hundred and one different razors.  </li>
            <li> Remember it sounds slow and low</li>
            <li> Back then, my beard wasn&#x27;t so thick</li>
            <li> The most annoying thing about it is, of all the ones I&#x27;ve had, this one leaks shaved beard everywhere.</li>
            <li> When trying to push the button, to turn it off, it wouldn&#x27;t press down, because the plastic around it was keeping it from being fully pressed.  </li>
            <li> The price goes up, the quality goes down.</li>
            <li> Previous one just died.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a replacement for a previous Norelco shaver that I had owned.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a fancy, automatic cleaning system, like the previous foil shavers I owned included.  </li>
            <li> I bought a different model of Philips Norelco (7340), and it failed with the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I took a half star off for that.  </li>
            <li> so you typically won&#x27;t need the charger when traveling.</li>
            <li> Received it in less time then was quoted.  </li>
            <li> Fully charged the 7810XL blades spin at half of what a fully charged 3605X does.</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS AT MY DOORSTEP IN LESS THAN</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve both been using it for about 6 months, and it&#x27;s gotten slightly duller</li>
            <li> I used the 7810XL for two and a half years before it died.  </li>
            <li> I spend half the time needed to shave that I used to.</li>
            <li> Previously the Norelco Razor I used had an indicator telling me the level of battery charge.</li>
            <li> I purchaased the shaver because I had a Norelco previously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noticeably lighter than the previous model.</li>
            <li> One would be that the shaver&#x27;s casing seems so light, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to break it if I sit it down on the counter a little too hard.</li>
            <li> (The previous shavers slowed down to a fizzle and then went dead).</li>
            <li> the new heads were too expensive.</li>
            <li> However, I did worry that it was a little tinny or cheap-sounding.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the head will stick or bounce a little.  </li>
            <li> Since one of the little pieces of the assembly was lost in the process, this is now a pile of parts in a baggie.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 other Norelcos in the past</li>
            <li> and my Monday morning shave takes a little longer</li>
            <li> For the price, you CAN NOT beat this little guy.</li>
            <li> clipper feels a little chintzy.</li>
            <li> Once the screens come out I have a very hard time putting them back in.</li>
            <li> However, hard to cut areas do take some extra effort and time; but given the outrageous cost of replacement blades for standard blade razors, the Norelco is a convenient and economical alternative.</li>
            <li> and it is very convenient to just rinse off the cutting blades after using.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s quieter and lighter than past models, although admittedly at first it felt \\&quot;cheaper.\\&quot; I can hear when the blades are cutting, indicating I need to keep at that spot, and when they&#x27;re not, indicating that I can move on.</li>
            <li> but then I randomly searched for an electric shaver for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> or if I skip a few days of shaving.  </li>
            <li> The only model I&#x27;ve not tried are any of the Remmingtons, based on their consistanly poor reviews.     </li>
            <li> my now dead 4817XL did not do.    </li>
            <li> Such packaging is entirely unnecessary and is environmentally unsound.</li>
            <li> I could have done 30 passes on my neck, yet there would still be a few hairs hanging around.    </li>
            <li> His last razor lasted approximately 9 yrs.</li>
            <li> I did however begin to think it was acting poorly.  </li>
            <li> The batteries when fully charged will give one about 45-60 minutes of total shaving time, and unlike some models, a fully exhausted shaver can fully be recharged in one hour.</li>
            <li> USE IT EVERYDAY ,AND STILL HAVENT RECHARGED IT..</li>
            <li> (so before you know it - the batteries go completely dead).  </li>
            <li> I have never had so much trouble getting to a product as this one, even with a heavy scissors.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine a few months ago</li>
            <li> (I replaced the batteries a few years after I got it).</li>
            <li> Once every few weeks, I would take the head apart, go to the garage and use my air compressor to blow the remaining hair out.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t turn into a Viking if I forgot to shave for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> This razor DOES NOT handle a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> But it takes a few passes to do so.</li>
            <li> Tried to re-charge it, and it was dead...</li>
            <li> Instead of getting a heads-up about whether or not the battery is almost dead, it just immediately stops working.</li>
            <li> He said to stay with it for a few weeks as my beard needed time to get used to being shaved this way.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t give you a warning when the battery is almost dead.</li>
            <li> Other than that one complaint</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the 7810 XL, but what was shipped was not an XL, but a plain 7810.</li>
            <li> This unit has a few less \\&quot;bell and whistles\\&quot;, but at least it works and works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so used to cleaning the cutting head assembly on my old shaver with the little brush that comes with them,</li>
            <li> Also, there is no rubber grip, just hard black plastic  </li>
            <li> It literally rubs my face RAW.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;men&#x27;s cutting system\\&quot; unfortunately has all the hallmarks of cheap Chinese-made junk toys.</li>
            <li> First they started making the batteries almost impossible to replace, now the blades get dull faster</li>
            <li> The only thing he complained about was that when it goes dead, there is absolutely no warning - it just stops cold.  </li>
            <li> The cut is close with very little irritation.  </li>
            <li> Shaving and cleaning the razor takes very little time.  </li>
            <li> TAKES MY BEARD OFF WITH VERY LITTLE PULL.</li>
            <li> Sunday morning a few weeks ago, my electric shaver slipped out of my hand and bounced hard off the tile floor leaving me staring in the mirror with a half-shaven face.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors off and on for the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick, heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I used the usual throw away razors/cream for about a week.  </li>
            <li> As far as cutting....</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself first, and was so horribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now it has failed, same way.  </li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m still not sure if the reviewer is correct when they say there is no advance warning.</li>
            <li> I had gone back to a blade after being disappointed with my last shaver.</li>
            <li> I have owned norelco in the past</li>
            <li> but I usually don&#x27;t shave on the weekends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric razors in the past, but they always irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> Will now have to investigate the warranty on it, as it is past the return date to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Made his face red and bumpy every time he used it, so needless to say we don&#x27;t have it anymore</li>
            <li> Over the past 45 years I have used safety razors as well as Norelco,Braun and Remington electric razors.</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that is difficult to get every spot.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why that is, but it was a consistant complaint amongst folks that tried both series.    </li>
            <li> The trimmer was a horrible angle and kept closing up when trimming my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it, and that was easy</li>
            <li> (That, and the water here is unbelievably hard - I don&#x27;t know what if anything that would do to the shaver&#x27;s performance.)    </li>
            <li> Did I say the plastic was HARD?.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a Norelco 5825 XL in 1996 and decided to replace it this year (2010) since replacement heads were getting hard to find</li>
            <li> The flaw is that the pop-up trimmer hardly cuts at all.</li>
            <li> you can hardly hear it.</li>
            <li> battery wasn&#x27;t charging anymore and blades getting dull after one year of use.</li>
            <li> This feature causes missed or incomplete shaved areas on certain parts of my face, resulting in annoyingly longer shave sessions.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law has the difficult combination of a very thick and tough beard and extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> big disappointment for me...</li>
            <li> A gift for my husband who is on blood thinners and always cutting himself with traditional razors.</li>
            <li> Seems to hold a charge for at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> and it is now late September.</li>
            <li> and I can go at least 2 weeks between charges</li>
            <li> at least 25 shaves on one charge so that exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> longtime shopper on amazon and have never had a negative thing to say on anything.</li>
            <li> My beard is thick.</li>
            <li> Blades spin slowly and takes forever to get a shave.   </li>
            <li> I was forced to purchase another razor when the side burn trimmer and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an unnecessary piece of clutter and landfill waste.</li>
            <li> I was forced to return it.  </li>
            <li> I have used my Norelco 5842 XL for years, I mean like over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I mean, its a razor, we&#x27;re talking ounces here.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure which rotary shaver to buy, buy this one!</li>
            <li> Overall, we are disappointed and think the $60 was a waste of money.     </li>
            <li> Anyway, out of a bunch of overpriced crap, this one seems to have decent value.</li>
            <li> &quot; but half the advertised shaves is a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and a sensitive skin-a bad combination.</li>
            <li> And, although I like the cleaning base for the Braun, it was like haveing a new razor every shave, it was still $6.00 a month just for the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> As it now stands, once the battery power has been exhausted the shaver simply stops cold.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It is impossible for a senior citizen like myself to actually open the plastic box, so I have no idea</li>
            <li> second complaint is outright annoying to me.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other bad reviews, this is a common complaint!  </li>
            <li> This one had nothing written too poorly about it, so I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I recall one reviewer commenting on the poor stand design and after seeing it, I agree.  </li>
            <li> It was poor and returned it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That would explain the rave reviews and handful of poor</li>
            <li> I attempted to remove the batteries, but alas, the batteries were soldered onto the printed circuit.  </li>
            <li> and he was heart broken.</li>
            <li> Shaving beard is painful as its feel like sharp pricking while shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will try replacing the blades since I really hate wet shaving but straight out of the box, this makes shaver 3 or 4 from norelco and remington that were PATHETIC compared to their predecessors.</li>
            <li> In this model, the center of the three cutting heads is flexible which helps the cutting heads stay in contact with my face.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers I am disappointed in the 7810XL.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the Norelco #7810XL  Very disappointed in Norelco&#x27;s engineering of this item.  </li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s web site is useless for comparing shavers.  </li>
            <li> I had a much cheaper remington rotary shaver before this - NO comparison, it was terrible and painful.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry with this one.</li>
            <li> Also, these heads are outrageously expensive, so I&#x27;m going to try the sharpening system made by Vollco.</li>
            <li> The shave is close; unfortunately, it seems that the razor misses spots.</li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.   </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when ordering this shaver as I never seem to like anyone that I buy...</li>
            <li> Not perfect but</li>
            <li> but, however wrong, it does make that impression.    </li>
            <li> The charging cord seems flimsy and unlikely to hold up under repeated packing and repacking.</li>
            <li> Sorry Philips/Norelco - not a fan anymore.  </li>
            <li> I purchased TWO Philips/Norelco shavers in the past year and was sorely disappointed in both.  </li>
            <li> The replacement Norelco I tried at $35 gave me terrible razor burn, and left horrible red welts all over my neck.  </li>
            <li> I was so wrong.  </li>
            <li> I had a foil razor for a few years, but it just got annoying having to charge it every week.  </li>
            <li> That sounded silly to me and made no sense.</li>
            <li> Dropping this was a very poor decision in my opinion for the reason noted.</li>
            <li> not great disappointed ...but will update my review</li>
            <li> Oh, Norelco no longer includes a travel case or pouch with this model which was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> that I bought in 2005, I replaced the cutting heads twice.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 7810 Men&#x27;s Cutting System]]</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 7810XL Men&#x27;s Cutting System</li>
            <li> Cuts poorly and the trimmer is worthless in practical use.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry!  </li>
            <li> The bad news is you get no warning it is about to die.  </li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> That was probably a bad idea by Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The razor had a bad battery or motor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When the battery went bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but when used correctly it shaves virtually as close as a blade (or as close as I could ever get with a blade without cutting myself!).      </li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with it after shaving with it for a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wanted to buy one today as a gift and am disappointed to find it discontinued with amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This electric razor proved to be very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy -</li>
            <li> Also, the location of the on/off button, combined with the body shape, can lead to annoying accidental shut offs  </li>
            <li> Initially I hated this product as it used to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It gave me the worst shave I have ever had from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product!!  </li>
            <li> This is no problem when I&#x27;m at home, but if I&#x27;m traveling and don&#x27;t have my charger, I can see it being very annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Would not run or charge, Got my money back after sending it back.</li>
            <li> had one of these b4 doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as close as other other one did. maybe i&#x27;ll try the swivel head next time</li>
            <li> This razor works amazingly well. I would buy again. I generally use a razor blade but this works great in a quick pinch.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been struggling with figure out a good shaving technique and I&#x27;ve bought into all kinds of systems of thoughts, using electric shavers in the pass, but without a real good results.  I have very sensitive skin and it seems like redness, irritation, and problems was my destiny, but then I randomly searched for an electric shaver for sensitive skin.  Now, this isn&#x27;t even the model that I found.   I found the jamesbond norelco that had sensitivity settings.  Anyway, I talked to a friend about it, and he said he had been using norelco for years.  For one reason or another, I just never gave them a try.  Sam&#x27;s Club Norelco budget shaver for [...] bucks with an extra head.  I bought it.  It said it might take 45 days to adjust to your skin.  No irritation.  Nothing.  This is a budget model and it is excellent.  Wow!  I&#x27;m so happy.  3 days of shaving and I&#x27;m almost perfect.  This model doesn&#x27;t even have all the extra features or settings and truthfully, they aren&#x27;t necessary.  But, in the future, I will be purchasing one of the newer models just to see how their advancements in design have paid off.  Why didn&#x27;t I find this shaver 10 years ago?  It cleans up easy and I am truly impressed considering this is a budget razor.</li>
            <li> I tried to get a good unit that wasn&#x27;t the cheapest but wasn&#x27;t $200. I&#x27;m happy with the shaver so far which seems to do a good job very quickly compared to my real old Norelco. My only complaint is that my real old one had the remaining minutes displayed which was nice. Seems like the newest models would also have that feature since I&#x27;m going to have to carry the cord all of the time since they don&#x27;t recommend \\&quot;topping off\\&quot; the batteries.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this product is a disgrace, both in matters of convenience and environmentally.  This company should not be rewarded with business until it changes its manner of delivering its product.</li>
            <li> A great product for me.  Personally, I just prefer rotating head razors to reciprocating head models.  I am replacing a much older model that was not water-resistant, and this model&#x27;s washable head and water-resistance makes it easier to use around the sink and shower.</li>
            <li> This Norelco is good. But it, like other electrics, can&#x27;t shave as close as a blade and lather. Just doesn&#x27;t happen!  But for a quick shave, it&#x27;s ok. Leaves my neck area burning however, which a real blade/lather doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> A lifelong Norelco user, I recently purchased a Norelco 7180 to replace my last shaver (which only lasted 10 years - for shame...).  So far, I am very favorably impressed.  The 7180 is a quiet, extremely lightweight unit that cuts very, very well.  The shave is not quite as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s not far off... and when I need a blade-close shave, I use &#x27;Lectric Shave first and the difference becomes negligible.  Another positive is the battery life...  I know they claim 17 days of cordless shaving, which seemed incredible.  But, the initial charge in mine actually lasted until the 52nd shave.  That has to be a fluke, and we&#x27;ll see how long the second charge lasts - I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this review after the batteries run dry the second time.  As for charging time, after the initial four hour charge (mine actually took far less than that), I&#x27;ve confirmed Norelco&#x27;s claim that subsequent charges only take an hour.    I can&#x27;t offer any comments about the ability to clean it with water as I haven&#x27;t done that yet.  I&#x27;m so used to cleaning the cutting head assembly on my old shaver with the little brush that comes with them, that so far that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve done with my new 7180.  Sooner or later, I suppose I&#x27;ll have to try washing it - but it goes against everything I ever learned to wash an electrical appliance, even if it is turned off and unplugged. (That, and the water here is unbelievably hard - I don&#x27;t know what if anything that would do to the shaver&#x27;s performance.)    The only criticisms I have to offer are minor.  One would be that the shaver&#x27;s casing seems so light, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to break it if I sit it down on the counter a little too hard. I doubt this is a valid concern, but it does seem that way.  Second, and as mentioned by others, it would be nice to have some sort of warning when the batteries are going to die - as it is, the shaver just stops dead... though you can plug it in to finish, or do a three minute charge to finish an unpluggedshave.  (I&#x27;d bet some higher-end models have a charge status light bar, but to me, that just isn&#x27;t worth an extra $30, $40, $50 or more.)  My final minor complaint is that it would be nice if it came with a travel carrying case instead of the cloth pouch that is included - but that&#x27;s a really minor beef, since most of us have a small travel kit for our shaver, toothbrush/paste, etc. anyway.    Bottom line:  this is a really nice shaver that is quiet, shaves close, holds a charge well - and doesn&#x27;t break the bank like the alleged top-of-the-line shavers do.    UPDATE:    After ten months, here&#x27;s an updated opinion:    PROS  It&#x27;s very quiet, the case is more durable than first impressions would have you believe, and I&#x27;m still getting well over the product description&#x27;s indicated number of shaves on a single battery charge.    CONS  I have two issues with this shaver.  First, as mentioned originally, a light that indicates remaining power would definitely be nice.  Having it suddenly quit running is annoying, even if you can use the quick charge feature and then finish your shave after only a short delay.    Second, after a few months it no longer cuts the hairs on my neck as well as it first did, despite following all cleaning and lubricating recommendations.  It still cuts them, but I have to go over the area multiple times.    I&#x27;d now give the unit four stars - still good bang for your buck, but not quite as good as I first thought.</li>
            <li> This razor does not indicate when the battery is low.  It just stops in the middle of shaving on about the fourth shave.  I have used Norelcos for over 50 years.  My previous (recent) Norelcos have had indicator lights that come on when the battery is low, but this one does not.  The description should have stated whether or not it has a low battery light.  This may be the last Norelco that I purchase.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend enjoyed this cutting system very much. It took him a few tries to get the hang of it, but it gives him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> the razor is all that I expected -- cuts well &#x3D;&#x3D; charges easily and cleans with NO trouble -- since you can just rinse it under water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went for this one and not the model one below, this one adds the larger slots for longer hair, which is great when reshaping a beard or if I skip a few days of shaving.  The cut is close with very little irritation.  It is extremely easy to clean, holds a charge for a really long time, and has clear indicators for when it is done charging.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more from an affordable and useful razor.</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAVER, NO PULLING, NO REDNESS, NO WHISKERS IN THE SINK OR ON THE COUNTER AND ITS VERY QUIET.</li>
            <li> My last shaver was Brawn 7 series and I had problem shaving near my neck with it, because my hairs tend to grow near parallel to my skin around neck. None of linear motion shavers I have owned in the last 20 years did the job to my satisfaction. I decided to try a rotary shaver for a try. Since it was meant to be an experiment, I did not choose a top-of-the-line model. Instead, I chose a model that is reasonably priced, yet with good reviews. I am glad I chose Phillips Norelco 7810. It has been three weeks since I got it, and it is still running strong with the initial charge. My skin irritated for exactly 2 days as expected (user&#x27;s manual says up to three weeks), but no problem after that. It shaves perfectly everywhere on my face and neck. To me this is incredible. Closeness of the shave is just right. It shaves relatively quietly. Easy to clean.  This shaver is not fancy or rich in features. But, this is a very well engineered shaver that does the job beautifully. I would recommend to people who are not happy with linear motion shavers to give it a try, or anybody who is looking for an excellent electric shaver for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This replaced a Norelco shaver that was very old but still working.  I would recommend this shaver to everyone.  It is very quiet and does a great job.  If you buy this shaver, be sure to try it out for one week before making up your mind on whether or not you like it.  It certainly is different from the one you are currently using.  What a winner!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband&#x27;s 54th birthday.  He hasn&#x27;t stopped raving about how great this razor is!  It has a very close shave, is light and looks cool.  He said with his old shaver his face stung after he put on aftershave.  With the new Norelco he doesn&#x27;t feel a thing with the aftershave.  My husband does not have a heavy growth of 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, so facial hair is fairly light.  He loves his new Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is the first shaver I&#x27;ve had in a while that gives me a close shave. I have a very angular chin. It&#x27;s also quiet. I think it&#x27;s a great shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> ZERO problems after 4-1/2 years. Excellent razor. Battery lasts a long time between charges too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old Norelco that I had been using to shave my head in the mornings.  I don&#x27;t use it on the face, as I have a beard.  This razor is quiet, the battery lasts over a week with daily use, and it cuts close.  I contemplated the more expensive models, but I&#x27;m glad I gave this one a shot.  If this lasts 1/4 the time my old model did, it will pay for itself in disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I have had many many Norelco&#x27;s and this is the very worst.  It makes a loud high frequency whine that makes shaving  a bad experience. I have to wear air line style ear protectors.  It seems to be a combination of the motor and the blades.  It still shrieks if I run it with the blades up, just the motor.  Also, there is no rubber grip, just hard black plastic  and it is slippery.</li>
            <li> On my third week on the first chWarge of the battery. Fast, close shave, feels comfortable in my hand. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace the same model that I have been using. It does not cost much more to buy a new razor than it does to replace the blades and I always have a problem getting the new blades in right.  I first tried to buy this razor directly from norelco but they said they did not offer that model anymore and suggested that I try amazan. I am glad that I did - Amazon usually has anything that you are looking for and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the razor. It gives me a nice clean shave better than the Braun I previously had. I agree that it would  be nice if it showed battery strength.</li>
            <li> This is a great Shaver for the right price,plus fast shipping.I was impressed with the close shave,and fast.Amazon is always a safe place to buy.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Remington, hated it, went back to a Norelco, LOVE IT..., appears to keep a good charge, wish it had a read out like my last one on battery life.  Works great, delivered fast, cannot go wrong with Norelco in my opinion</li>
            <li> just what I expected from Norelco. smooth shave,light weight,and with trimmer. what else could you expect. I have bought nothing but Norelco for last 25 years, this is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has this razor about a month now, and so far it&#x27;s doing a good job. I&#x27;ve always used Norelco, but last year when my old one died I changed to Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Pivot Action Linear Wet/Dry Shaver, and wasn&#x27;t happy with it. I used that one for a year, and it never dod a good job on my neck unless I pushed real hard, then it would cut me. (Luckily, I droped it and it shattered so I needed a new razor) This one is VERY quiet, and does a better job than the Panasonic. Close shave, not as close as a blade, but close enough. Relatively quick, and no blood to date. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t have a battery meter (my 10 year old one that died did), but so far just charged it after 3 weeks for fear it would all of a sudden die. Like the fact you can rinse it under hot water to clean it.</li>
            <li> Took a while to find a Norelco without too many bad reviews.  This one had nothing written too poorly about it, so I bought it.  My old Norelco was 10+ years old and was showing it&#x27;s age.  They prior reviews are correct, this is a very quiet razor.  It also shaved much closer than my old one (could have been just because it was old and not as sharp).   The only odd things that have happened are that the plastic holder for the trimmer on the back fell off, it was easy enough to put back on, but was shocked to have it fall off within 3 weeks of using it.  The other thing was that the head assembly came off too.  The hinge for the head assembly is just wedged into the unit.  I think I dropped the razor about 1 foot onto the counter and this may have dislodeged it.  It was also easy enough to push back in.  If it happens again, I&#x27;ll push some epoxy into the hinge.  Otherwise, it does exactly what I expected ... nice shave.  I have a thick beard and senstive neck, it worked great and no bleeding (I&#x27;ve experienced other brands that have chewed up my neck ... some of you know what I&#x27;m talking about).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every high end electric razor on the market in the last 15 years. I&#x27;ve had the Braun, both the pulsonic and the 7 series. I&#x27;ve had the Panasonic and I&#x27;ve had several Norelcos. The only model I&#x27;ve not tried are any of the Remmingtons, based on their consistanly poor reviews.     In summary, if you looking to go to electric you have to choose between the foil shavers, like the Braun and Panasoinc or the rotery model, like Norelco. My experience with foil shavers is that they seem to cause more ingrown hairs on my face, than any other method of shaving. The Panasonic in particular almost cuts too close, and left me with razor burn. I tried shaving with it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; as they advocate, with cream.. this method left me with a 5:00 shadow at about 11:15.. and made a huge mess. If I was going to futz with shaving cream I&#x27;d use blade.     Which in the end, not one electric I&#x27;ve ever used does as good a job as a cheap disposable blade.. except this one.   Prior to this razor I had been using one of the 8000 series models with the \\&quot;faster shave\\&quot; heads, those have three rings of holes on them. The claim being it was 50% faster and X amount closer. I found those heads to be pretty irritating to my face, even after a year of using it, and it seemed to pull my skinn and missed more whiskers than I&#x27;d expect, leading to ingrown hairs or that super long solo whisker you missed all week that your wife plucks off with a tweezer right before you go out with her.. ouch.     The 8000 series is about $20.00 to $30.00 more than this model as well. Years ago my first Norelco was a 7000 series and I remembered it being very good. With that in mind, when my 8000&#x27;s blades dulled and it was time for a new set.. rather than spend $40.00 on new blades I figured and extra $20.00 for a whole new razor. Not wanting to spend $200 on the top of the line, I stepped down this time, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.     The heads on this razor are better than the more expensive model, it shaves closer,comfortably, than any razor I&#x27;ve used.. which was too close, and it does so in a way that is very comfortable and easy to use. No pulling skin no missed hairs, no ingrown hairs, and no rash like the panasonic.. And, although I like the cleaning base for the Braun, it was like haveing a new razor every shave, it was still $6.00 a month just for the cleaning solution. This one is just about perfect.     The only complaint I have, as they&#x27;ve cut costs on these things, Norleco has eliminated the carrying case, very handy when you travel as the blade cover comes off easy and if you nick a blade.. you&#x27;re screwed and they&#x27;ve eliminated the charger stand.. a very very nice place to store the unit when you&#x27;re at home. I&#x27;d pay for those things to get them added back in the box.     This is a no frills razor that works fantastic, and the price is certainly right. Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I opened the package for my dad who immediately started to use it without a mirror.  I said, \\&quot;Dad!  Don&#x27;t you need to be careful and look at a mirror??\\&quot;  Well, it turns out that this product is that good.  He continued to shave everything off his chin without the mirror with the exception of the upper lip.  He looks clean-shaven and so I give Philips Norelco a 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I used Norelcos for 25 years and recently had to make the choice between replacing my older 4817XL or paying $55 to have someone put in the battery I already paid $15 to get.  I figured I would try to put the battery in myself and if it did not work, I would buy a new shaver.  Since you are reading this review, you know what happened.  Nevertheless, this is a good time to note all folks considering a Norelco - unless you are good with a soldering iron, you are going to face the same choice I did when the battery eventually dies.    I was happy with the 4817XL because it did the job and was well built (obviously lasting many years).  Reading all the reviews for newer shavers had me concerned because there did not appear to be any one shaver that people clearly loved. Every shaver had some serious detractors and the detractors made excellent points.      Norelco&#x27;s web site is useless for comparing shavers.  They have a nice comparison feature that is really slick, but not all the data populates for all the shavers.  The data that is available does not clearly differentiate the shavers.  Not only was it difficult to tell the differences between shavers in the same series, it was not easy to figure out why you would want to consider a shaver at the next higher level.  Makes you wonder how much of a difference there really is.  This left me with the hundreds of reviews on Amazon and other sites to figure out which one to buy.    The artic looked cool, but most of the reviews were average.  Oddly, the complaint with the razor was that it failed to perform in the areas most important to the device - so I quickly ruled it out.  Did not see much sense in paying a premium if there were issues with the basics.   I also ruled out the 8245 from Costco because it had lower rating and lot of complaints.  Same with the 8420.      This left me with the 8250, 8260, 7810, 7340, 7120 and probably a few others.  The list was further narrowed to a comparison between the 8250, 8260, 7810,and 7340 by the fact that I now needed a razor ASAP and had to shop locally. The 8260 was not available at the closest store, but I was able to view it in the display case.  I recall one reviewer commenting on the poor stand design and after seeing it, I agree.  Maybe it the shaver was $10 more for the plastic stand then the 8250, but at nearly double the price, no thank you.    I really was not sure what the difference was between the 7810 and 7340, but two things struck me.  First, the 7810 was the only shaver that got a 4.5 average star rating at Amazon.  Nothing else was close.  Second, it just felt better in my hand then the 7340.  It was like someone actually thought about the fact that a shaver should fit a hand.  Something my now dead 4817XL did not do.    The 8250 has the same basic feel, but it was $25 more.  The $25 bought a pivoting head and 3 shaving heads.  I just could not figure out why this was a good thing.  Maybe this comes from using a shaver that did not have one, but I could not determine what this was going to do differently that simple moving my hand.   Maybe it made the shave more efficient, but Amazon reviews seem to indicate shavers with the HQ9 blades were actually less efficient and less effective.  I am not sure why that is, but it was a consistant complaint amongst folks that tried both series.    I went with the 7810XL.  It actually had a charge out of the box, but to be on the safe side, I charged it and then I used it.  Wow!  It was definitely better than by 4817XL.  Norelco&#x27;s dynamic contour feature made a huge difference in the areas on my head that were curved - there was much greater surface to surface contact so the razor performed better with less effort.  Not that the 4817XL was particularly heavy to begin with - especially in comparison to the earlier Norelcos I used, but the light weight of the 7810XL made it easier to work with.      The feature I like the most is the ability to simply flip the top and wash away the hair.It takes seconds to do it and it improves the shave.  With the 4817XL, you just waited until the shaver clogged up and started spitting hairs back out to know when it was time to clean.  It was like this looming penalty because when it was time to clean it, it was going to take some time and invariably, I would find myself having to clean it when I was pressed for time.      Reading the manual for the 7810XL suggests there is more maintenance to this shaver than I recall having to do with the 4817XL, but it is possible over the years I simply failed to perform all the steps I should have been doing.  Still, I do not recall ever needing to oil the old razor, but then again, that kind of makes sense that one would do that.    The 7810XL is lighter because it uses a lot more plastic then metal and less parts.  I am not sure it that equates to better or lower reliability.   Certainly, now I could actually break a part that I could not break before.  However, those older metal parts were no where near as easy to clean.  It may not matter which one is better made because I will probably end up facing the choice again between an expensive battery replacement and a new shaver so it probably just has to last as long as the battery.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful electric razor. I have been shaving for 13 years and this was my third Norelco. The only time I ever used a disposable razor was during basic training. I am in Afghanistan right now and someone stole this one while I was in the shower, and my wife sent me a Remington to replace it. I loved the battery life (this one is rated in days, while the Remington is rated in minutes), the quiet motor (my wife is a light sleeper), the ability to use it while it&#x27;s plugged in (which the Remington is unable to do), the quality of the design (the blades don&#x27;t fall off during use, unlike the Remington), and best of all ... the car charger (which the Remington didn&#x27;t have, not that it would matter because you can&#x27;t use the Remington while it&#x27;s pluggerd in). Talk about genius. I normally work night shift, but on the rare occaision that I work day shift, it&#x27;s nice to shave on the way to work. Those 5-10 extra minutes of sleep are so nice. It was a Christmas present from my wife, to replace the Norelco that I got as a wedding gift 6 years ago. I love this razor, and after trying Remington, I will forever remain loyal to Norelco. Unless Sony were to make electric razors, but then again I am a huge Sony whore, so ...</li>
            <li> He said it was too hard to clean and that the battery didn&#x27;t stay charged. He has since bought a new one and this one just sits in a box under the sink.</li>
            <li> I have owned 4 norelco shavers. This is definitely the best one yet and was reasonably priced. It shaves very close. It&#x27;s quiet. The flip top easy clean feature is fantastic. Just hold it under the faucet and flush it out. It is sealed so that the water won&#x27;t hurt it inside. It runs for about 2 weeks on a charge (unbelievable)and I like that it does not slow down toward the end of the charge. It just stops but that&#x27;s no problem because all you do is plug it in and keep shaving, then let it recharge. I have no negatives at all with this shaver. Norelco shavers have always shaved closer for me. I have owned remington, panasonic and one other brand and have always gone back to norelco.</li>
            <li> Product is quiet and first charge has lasted for more than three weeks.  Cutting results are good but not as good as my old razor.  It does seems to get better with each shave.</li>
            <li> Have been loyal to Norelco for 15 years now but this shaver was a dud.  No base charging unit.  Cheaply put together.  I would pass on this one.  Ended up giving it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I just started using this razor 2 weeks before Christmas and so far love it.  I do wish it had a light for when the battery was low - which is so infrequent (I&#x27;ve charged it 1x since I started using it daily).  But with a power cord to plug in and charge AND SHAVE at the same time, there&#x27;s no major need for that indicator light.  I had the Norelco Advantage before that and was very happy with it.  This unit is easy to take care of and I enjoy shaving again as the old razor was about 8 years old and the battery was shot.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and provides a close, comfortable shave.  Battery charge holds well.   Still running for over a month with the original charge.  Would buy this model again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver I have ever used.  It is  extremely quiet and lightweight so when i first used it I wondered if it was flimsy and cheap but soon found out otherwise. It shaves very rapidly and thoroughly and there is absolutely no irritation even on the first use.  It leaves no stubble at all. The charging unit is separate, rather than being incorporated into the shaver and that is why it is so light.  I would have rated it with 5 stars except for the packaging which was an abomination:  Inside the perfectly adequate cardboard box was a nearly bullet-proof plastic contraption wrapped around the shaver and its accessories.  I had to hack and chop at it for 5 minutes or more to get the darn thing open.  I felt like borrowing the Jaws of Life from the local ambulance co.  to extract the shaver.  Such packaging is entirely unnecessary and is environmentally unsound.</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive electric razor I&#x27;ve purchased for myself to date, and I&#x27;m happy to say there was some benefit to moving up to a higher price point.    The razor is very well made and runs very quietly.  It charges lightning fast as advertised, yet it holds its charge very well (so far).      The cut is amazingly close - I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it, but when used correctly it shaves virtually as close as a blade (or as close as I could ever get with a blade without cutting myself!).      I had a much cheaper remington rotary shaver before this - NO comparison, it was terrible and painful.  Take it from experience and wasted money - it&#x27;s WELL worth it to upgrade to this shaver.  I don&#x27;t impress easily when spending $70.00, but even at that price I was impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to replace my old Norelco razor which was 7 years old. I changed the blades on the old unit every year and never had a problem or complaint with it. After 7 years the motor finally gave out. I thought I would replace it with another Norelco product. The new razors are cheap, plastic pieces of garbage. They sure do not make them like they used to. It gave me the worst shave I have ever had from an electric shaver. I used it for three weeks hoping my beard just had to adjust to the new razor. The motor barely had enough power to turn the blades. I would not recommend this product to anyone.......I threw the shaver in the trash and bought a Braun razor. Much happier with the Braun unit. Norelco products aren&#x27;t what they used to be.....</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the Norelco 7810 shaver at this time. I feel that I am getting a very close shave after a short brake in period of a couple of days. The charge doesn&#x27;t take very long.  The shaver feels very comfortable in my hand and is very quite.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco cordless razor. Previous one just died. I always fully discharged it then re-charged it for the 7 yrs I shaved with it. Excellent life-span I&#x27;d say.  I wanted to buy a cheaper Norelco model but the reviews were luke-warm and most confirmed that they were often of Chinese or Mexican origin. This model is about the same price as my previous one and it says \\&quot;Made in Netherlands\\&quot;. It is lighter. Still feels the same in my hand. It does an excellent job for my light beard/stubble growth.  It charges quickly and although I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine the duration of the charge but it appears to be on track for at least 4 wks of shaving. My old Norelco gave me at least 5 weeks on average and I think it was a Ni-Cad battery.  I&#x27;m told this has a Ni-MH battery but I haven&#x27;t opened it to check. No need. I&#x27;m prone to being very curious but sometimes that small extra part left-over after closing up puzzles me....;&gt;)  I did have to get the on/off plastic button glued on by a regional Norelco certified repair shop on my old Norelco about 1+ yrs ago. He simply glued the broken plastic piece back in place and for ten bucks I was on my way.  I almost tossed the shaver but glad I didn&#x27;t because it still worked and held a charge for 3+ wks at that point.&lt;br /&gt;This new Norelco is definitely a product that \\&quot;you get what you pay for..\\&quot;. It is excellent. Not cheap (though it may feel a bit cheap) and I expect it to last me another 5-7 yrs.  For my old Norelco, I did buy a new set of blades after 2 yrs but used them continuously until the shaver finally died last month. The new one does trim closer and is easy to clean. The packaging consists of that horrific plastic clam-shell stuff so better have a strong pair of scissors handy. No nylon case like my 1st one but the old case is the right size for the new one. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product and Amazon&#x27;s free shipping was super-fast as always.</li>
            <li> This is certainly one of the best items I have ever bought. There is no need for further descriptions as many have done that. It is magnificent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He likes it very much.  It holds a charge forever.  He has only had to charge it twice since Christmas.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a replacement for a previous Norelco shaver that I had owned.  Did not really need all the buzzers and bells and this particular model more than meets my needs.  Gives a close shave; Easy to clean ; very light and easy to handle ; Good Price.  Based my purchase on researching previous reviews and shoppiing other stores and sites for value.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Norelco 7810 shaver for about 28 days and I am still on the first charge. Wow! I brought this to replace a old Norelco that battery that was loosing it&#x27;s charge. It&#x27;s light weight, provides a very close shave and quick in getting the job done. I tried the Norelco SpeedXL 8240XL which I brought at Costco and did not like it, even though it cost more with a fancier head. I just wish the 7810 came with a travel case.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver.  I dont use them myself but the boys like them.  No complaints</li>
            <li> First, I like to thank everyone for the good and honest rating of this product (Norelco 7810).  I bought the Philips Norelco 7810 about a month ago, and definitely would recommend this product.  I have been using blades for the last few years, but sometimes it just takes too much time to use the blades.  So finally decided to purchase an electronic one and decided to get this one after reading all the great reviews.  I pretty much use it every day now.  After about a month, the battery is still running (after the 1st charge).  It definitely worth every penny.    PROS: light, BATTERY LIFE, comfortable shave, good price, and BATTERY LIFE.    CONS: none so far, maybe after a few month and comeback to update</li>
            <li> This razor is great. I have a really thick beard and have been through a hundred and one different razors.  This razor is able to give me a reasonably close shave with no irritation.  Battery life is better than I expected and it&#x27;s lightweight and pretty durable for traveling.</li>
            <li> (review is by my husband, Michael)  Shaving is a chore I&#x27;ve been at for 45 years.  Went from a blade to an electric about  35 years ago.  This Norelco is the best I&#x27;ve experienced......results are excellent, smooth and close shaves. And so quiet I can hear my radio perfectly while I shave.</li>
            <li> A good quality shaver that gives a quick and comfortable shave.  The only drawback is, like all the shavers, the replacement heads are priced too high.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors off and on for the past 10 years.  I&#x27;ve had three total prior to this model.  A low-end Norelco and a high-end Braun and Panasonic.  Even with the previous Braun and Panasonic shavers, I was constantly going back to using blades.  I have pretty sensitive skin, so I never really wanted to return to using blades.  I just couldn&#x27;t get a close shave with any of the prior electrics, especially around the chin and neck areas.  I could have done 30 passes on my neck, yet there would still be a few hairs hanging around.    I did a lot of research and read tons of reviews on basically every electric shaver on Amazon.  I decided that I would try out a rotary instead of a foil this time.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend $120-250.  Spending that much did me a lot of good in the past.  I didn&#x27;t need a fancy, automatic cleaning system, like the previous foil shavers I owned included.  Ended up wasting more money just to have the shaving head cleaned.    I came across the 7810XL and seemed to fit my needs, and also had great reviews.  I&#x27;ve been using the shaver for nearly a month now, and I absolutely love it.  It&#x27;s rather quiet, charges very quickly, cleaning the head is fast and easy, the battery has lasted just over two weeks for me and most importantly; the shave is great.  It&#x27;s so much better than the previous, expensive Braun and Panasonic foils I had.  It has fully cut every hair on those tough spots, which had me really surprised.  The shave is also very quick (I don&#x27;t have to perform many passes at all) and comfortable.  I don&#x27;t see or feel it being as close as a blade, and I expected that, but it&#x27;s much more comfortable and less messy.  The 7810XL has actually turned my thinking around, as it&#x27;s not a chore or hassle to shave anymore.  I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who is looking for a new electric.    The only drawback (I won&#x27;t take away any points or stars for this) I&#x27;ve come across is the packaging.  Like others have said, the retail packaging is a nightmare.  Be ready to spend at least a few minutes just to get the shaver out of its packaging.  And hopefully you won&#x27;t cut any of your fingers in the process.</li>
            <li> Recently ordered this shaver after doing a fair amount of research on the internet. Also compared prices at local businesses in our small town. I bought this for my husband, who has always been a Norelco man for the 37 yrs we&#x27;ve been married. His last razor lasted approximately 9 yrs. He is impressed with how well and fast it works. Our only complaint would be, it didn&#x27;t come with a case. This didn&#x27;t matter to us as the old case from his previous razor worked.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Norelco 7810 to replace a Braun shaver that was not doing the job.  Bottom line, this Norelco 7810 is excellent.  Shaves close, does not require mutiple passes like the Braun. The Norelco is also very quiet.  The trimmer is kind of cheap but the shaver is great. I would give it a strong buy recommendation.</li>
            <li> I have had many a razor over the years(10). This has been the best I&#x27;ve had. It shaves day old beard as well as 5 O\\&quot;clock touch ups. It&#x27;s also easy to clean and quiet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 and have been shaving with electrics since I was 18. I have a thick, heavy beard. Norelco triple-headers have always been my favorite - I&#x27;ve tried the foil heads and found them less durable and less comfortable. This is probably my fifth Norelco - my last one wouldn&#x27;t take a charge any more after about 8 years. This one is pretty much identical, but it is lighter. It is also easier to clean - not sure why but it definitely rinses out quicker and more thoroughly. The recharger cord is more compact than my previous shaver but other than that they are pretty much identical. Good, close shave. Norelcos require very little maintenance and that is good because I don&#x27;t do much in that department...</li>
            <li> I had used a Braun for a couple years, and it simply didn&#x27;t give me a close shave.  I have a heavy beard and had to go over and over the same spots to get an acceptable shave.  The Norelco works with a single \\&quot;pass.\\&quot;  And, it&#x27;s light, easy to clean, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun, Panasonic and other electric razors and this one did not seem to be up to par with those.  It is lighter and does not have the loud buzz when in use.  However I was very surprised to see that it shaves well.  I get a close shave each day and it holds a charge for a long time. I did chose this based on the reviews and I am happy that I did. I would recommend this to someone looking for a reasonably priced razor.</li>
            <li> This product is everything advertised and more.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a close and fast shave.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this razor as it cuts fairly closely and comfortably during the past 2 months since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace another Norelco which was having some problems with it&#x27;s electrical system and periodically stopping.  That was a far more expensive unit when I got it about 5 years ago.  This unit has a few less \\&quot;bell and whistles\\&quot;, but at least it works and works well.  Nice to have the shaver blade assembly on an attached head on a hinge.  I&#x27;ve always liked Norelco razors and feel items from this company exemplify quality.  It does a great job!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to a good razor, after my last linear foil razor was damaged on a trip.  This thing is light weight, which to me, isn&#x27;t always a great thing.  It&#x27;s light weight because it&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic.  The area around the on/off button, wasn&#x27;t even fully attached.  It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t obvious, until after I pushed the on button and used it the first time.  When trying to push the button, to turn it off, it wouldn&#x27;t press down, because the plastic around it was keeping it from being fully pressed.  Tried it several more times, and it hung up another 2-3 times out of 10.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have a very heavy beard.  So about 20 years ago I gave up on shaving and went with a full beard.  When I decided to get rid of it I used the usual throw away razors/cream for about a week.  that is when I remembered why I went with a beard years ago.  This is my first electric in 20 years so all I can relate it to is old tech and hand razors.  This is an amazing device.  It is easy to charge and seems to hold charge just fine.  As far as cutting.... by the third day I realized I had made a good choice.  It works great!  I also notice how quiet it is.  Old electric razors sounded like I was using an echo weed trimmer in my bathroom.  This one is whisper quiet.  Works very nicely with a heavy beard.  So guys if you need a good razor this one is it.  It is made in Holland which I find refreshing.  Nice to buy something not made in you know where.  Get it.... Oh by the way Phillips offers a 30 day return policy on this so if you don&#x27;t like it just send it back.  sign me beardless in Oklahoma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Have had this now since June.  That makes it around six months.  It continues to function without any problems.  I did however begin to think it was acting poorly.  Then I realized that maybe I needed new blades.  BINGO!  With a heavy beard you are going to get about 6 months of use before you need to buy new blades.  No problems since Amazon offers the blade refills via Amazon Prime/subscribe and save.  Got the replacement blades for 5 bucks less than local...... I love this razor.  It is a hit it all categories.</li>
            <li> Just buy it- it&#x27;s the best deal for the least $. I have used mine for a month and my girl can&#x27;t tell the difference on me from a razor...It works great on two day growths too....</li>
            <li> Since I bought this Norelco I have some issues with my skin. Although it cut the hair from the bottom same as the blade shaving do, but also skin may suffer from straight contact with rotary blade of this razor. So I will not recommend it for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Norelco razor. It gives a very close shave - without razor burn. It runs for a very long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with this shaver.  It&#x27;s easy to operate, shaves nice and close with no pulling,and is quiet so it doesn&#x27;t bother the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced an older Norelco men&#x27;s shaver with a new 7810XL model. This shaver is still made in Holland which impressed me, and workmanship appeared to be stellar. The plastic housing is as light as anything I&#x27;ve ever seen, but appears to be solid and well put together in an attractive black and silver color scheme. Although each new generation of Norelco&#x27;s claim to shave closer and closer, I personally think the secret lies in good sharp blades and a dry clean face. I don&#x27;t think this model shaves any closer than models I had 10 or more years gone by, but this is not a bad thing, as for me personally, Norelco&#x27;s have always shaved great. The shaver head can be rinsed under hot tap water which makes cleaning a snap. The plastic protective head cover is a great improvement over my older model which had tiny plastic tabs that would break off even with the most care in putting it on and taking it off. This new cap holds tight and strong, and has nothing that will break off. Good job Norelco with the improvement. The batteries when fully charged will give one about 45-60 minutes of total shaving time, and unlike some models, a fully exhausted shaver can fully be recharged in one hour. Some Norelco models can take up to 8 hours. There is a green LED light that shows when the batteries are being charged which blinks once a full charge has been reached. However, there no longer is a red LED that glows when the batteries are down to their last few minutes of life. This to me was a great feature as one would have some advance notice that the shaver was ready to die. As it now stands, once the battery power has been exhausted the shaver simply stops cold. Dropping this was a very poor decision in my opinion for the reason noted. Still, I&#x27;ll most likely never be shaving far enough away from an electrical outlet should I need to plug the shaver in for a quick 3 minute charge to finish the shave, or use the shaver as a full corded model. Oh, Norelco no longer includes a travel case or pouch with this model which was quite disappointing. Still, for my money ($75-$85) it is probably still a great personal grooming item that I&#x27;ll use daily for the next 3-5 years.</li>
            <li> I needed a new electric shaver so I bought a new one a Amazon it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a number of electric shavers through the years, never finding one that gave a clean shave, while at the same time being sturdy, battery efficient, and easy to clean.The Philips Norelco 7810 is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  - close shaving, whether you have a 3-day bear or just for your daily&#x27;clean-up&#x27;  - easy to clean: just run it under hot water, with a more thorough dismantling of the shaving mechanism every month or so (extremely simple mechanism)  - great battery life: who cares if it doesn&#x27;t have a battery level indicator. The battery lasts for weeks, and charges quickly  - surdy: I&#x27;ve had this shaver for almost a year, and it works just as new    My take on it: highly recommended.    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJD0UM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve tried in over 25 years, and I have been pleased. It provides a close shave; it is easy to use and maintain; and the ability to wash it each day makes it easy to clean. The quality of the shave is outstanding and compares well to a standard blade razor. However, hard to cut areas do take some extra effort and time; but given the outrageous cost of replacement blades for standard blade razors, the Norelco is a convenient and economical alternative.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one.    It does great job with a clean close shave. I tried Braun but it only lasted  less than a year. This is a good unit and would buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Been using many different electric razors many years. This one is the closet to the shaving cream and the blade. You won&#x27;t be sorry with this one. Try it.</li>
            <li> I have a teenaged special needs child whom I have to assist with shaving.  We are using a blade but thought that an electric might be more convenient and less time-consuming.  He is sensitive to loud noises, so when I heard the purr of this razor, I was very pleased.  However, I did worry that it was a little tinny or cheap-sounding. I tried it on myself first, and was so horribly disappointed. Realizing that it can take an electric a while to acclimate to one&#x27;s face (for reasons I have yet to understand), I still have to put tremendous effort into shaving with it, so much so that it irritates my neck beyond reason.  I am not going to even try this on my son.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product!!  Have used Norelco shavers for many years, and when my last Norelco started to need charging every day, I decided to get another Norelco. Picked this model based on reviews and price-BIG MISTAKE!!  Returned shaver after one week because it did not have enough power to shave properly. Could hear the shaver staraining to cut my light whiskers. I did follow instructions and gave it an initial charge overnight before using fo rthe first time, but it never worked right.  Bought a Braun and am very satisfied now.</li>
            <li> Very good at cutting for a close shave, the only thing I would have liked is a battery indicator to know when the battery is going to die.</li>
            <li> 7810XL perfect shave for 65 devaluated bucks! Better than my Braun.  Yeah, it feels cheap and weak at the beginning, very quite, (I thought: this is not going to do the job!)but the shave it&#x27;s what counts. This is as close as shaving with a blade as you can get with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> It performs as well as any Norelco I have owned over the last 40 years.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver since I was in the Navy! I didn&#x27;t like it, and switched to brush &amp; soap and stayed that way until 35 years later when the wife got me this razor for Christmas last year. I see one here for over $120, but that must come with a replacement head...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I really like this thing, and I only &#x27;dry shave&#x27; with it, meaning not in the shower. I use a pre-shave lotion to clean the grease off my beard, and Nivea makes a great after-shave lotion. I was using Remington&#x27;s Shaver Saver, but am switching to Sterlings. Also, these heads are outrageously expensive, so I&#x27;m going to try the sharpening system made by Vollco. If that saves me from $40 in blades, I&#x27;m a happy guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot, and the size is great-small. It holds a full charge so long, I don&#x27;t even pack the ac/charger. One thing I find useful when the beard gets too long to easily shave with the heads... I use the trimmer on the back to shorten the hair so it can be cleanly shaved with the heads. It&#x27;s actually quite useful! You have to love a multi-tasker in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the thing dry and heads oiled when stored, and I never bring it into the shower, so I can&#x27;t review how well it would work there. I would not want all the water &amp; moisture to affect the metal cutting heads, effectively rusting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money, as long as it isn&#x27;t $120+ for just the shaving unit and it&#x27;s first set up heads!</li>
            <li> This razor worked well while it worked.  I have had Norelco&#x27;s for a number of years and their working life seems to get shorter and shorter with every new razor I buy.  I purchased the 7810XL just 7 months ago.  It dies abruptly when it needs a charge.  The good news is it works well until it abruptly dies.  The bad news is you get no warning it is about to die.  I just charged it and it never turned on again.  I plan to contact Philips Norelco, and hopefully it is in warranty.  But I am getting very discouraged with how quickly their razor are headed for the \\&quot;shaveyard\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best razor I have ever owned!  It shaves close.  It recharges quickly and holds a charge a long time.  And, the price was right.</li>
            <li> Given as a christmas gift to my father in law.  He said it was one of the very best razors he has ever used!</li>
            <li> I am happy with this razor, but I do not find it to be anything wonderful. The shave is close; unfortunately, it seems that the razor misses spots. This causes you to reshave areas you presumed were shaved.  As for the actual razor, it is light and easy to use. I have no complaints in that department. The battery works well.  I have not tried to clean the razor yet, but from what I read, it is easy to do. You can even pour water on the heads to clean it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well on my extermely tough beard.  Much better than the ones made in China.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this shaver, and it also goes a long time between charges.  The only thing he complained about was that when it goes dead, there is absolutely no warning - it just stops cold.  (The previous shavers slowed down to a fizzle and then went dead).</li>
            <li> I have owned numerous other rechargeable battery operated razors in the past but my purchase of the \\&quot;Philips Norelco 7810 Men&#x27;s Cutting System\\&quot; razor is by far the best quality of them  all.  The battery of this razor lasts many shaves longer than my other previously owned razors, the shave is much closer and smoother, and the battery charge takes less that one hour even when the battery is completely discharged.  My only fault with this razor is that it does not come with any kind of a case (soft or otherwise) which would be very handy when traveling.  This item is an excellent value and an excellent quality product.  I would definitely recommend it and would purchase it again myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after the battery on my 67xx series razor started failing.  It&#x27;s nice in that it&#x27;s quieter and easier on my neck than the older razor.  I miss a dedicated charging stand, but otherwise it&#x27;s been a good replacement.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver for my husband a few days ago, and right off the bat, he noticed it didn&#x27;t give him the close shave he was used to with his older Norelco. He has found he needs to go over each area of his face several times before he reaches anything close to an acceptable shave. However, his face (especially his chin) is still quite \\&quot;spikey\\&quot; once he is finished. We didn&#x27;t expect this razor to give him as close of a shave as an actual razor blade, but because of his experience with his last Norelco, we did expect more.     It also seems the product will have issues with durability. As others have mentioned, the shaver has a lot more plastic than previous Norelco shavers, which I think will lead to it cracking more easily if accidentally dropped or somehow placed under too much pressure.     Overall, we are disappointed and think the $60 was a waste of money.     (Just to be clear, my husband doesn&#x27;t have overly stubborn or thick facial hair, so that is not a possible reason the shaver doesn&#x27;t work very well for him.)</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive beard and have used foil razors in the past. Could not shave every day, I always needed a day for my beard to rest. And yes I used electric pre shave. I then returned to standard razors of many types and blade configurations, and gels and salves and still was not able to shave everyday. So I thought I would give this razor a try. I can shave every day now without the irritation. AND it is as close as a standard razor. I know that there are many that have said that there is a trade off in closeness, but for my beard, I find that if I take the time I can get as close as my standard razor. This performance does have its cost however. Number one: GOT TO USE ELECTRIC PRE SHAVE! I did try using the razor without and it did not shave as well. This shaver likes it. Two: TAKE YOUR TIME. If there is any fault to this razor is that to do a good job, it will take longer to shave well. And one needs to pay attention to his beard. Learn your face and the grain and take your time. You will get a close, comfortable shave, every day. And the 21 day beard break in time???? It took my beard about a week to get used to the razor. And even in that time the irritation was not really bad.   I did research other models like the 7310 and 7340 and could not really find major differences other than one review that said that the motor in the 7810 was faster and thus cut better. I would like to do a side by side...... but just know that for me, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Razor is very lightweight but ok...decent shave, grip....but no base charger...give me a break...I like my razor to always be charged up...not plugging it in with the wire hanging out....big disappointment for me...for the price it should come with a barber who can give me a barber shop shave!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about a month, and am very pleased with it.  It has a little trouble getting whiskers on my neck that lay flat, but my chin and cheeks come out very smooth.</li>
            <li> GOT THIS RAZOR ONE MONTH AGO. CHARGED IT ONE TIME ..USE IT EVERYDAY ,AND STILL HAVENT RECHARGED IT..I HAVE NOT USED A REGULAR SHAVER SINCE..THE BEST INVESTMENT MONEY CAN BUY, AWSOME ELECTRIC RAZOR...I GET A CLOSE SHAVE EVERY TIME..HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS RAZOR..5 STARS..</li>
            <li> when shaving the on off button keeps turning off the razor because of the grip i have on it, there needs to be a different on off button</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it. He was in much need of a new shaver and said this one works great and doesn&#x27;t pull at all on his facial hair. Both very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> AS expected, it is good to grip and easy to use.  The shaving is comfortable and the feeling after shaving is good.  It is always good to purchase a product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Good Razor.  My only complaint is that when the batteries are starting to get Low - there is NO Charge Indicator to let you Know that the Razor needs charged (so before you know it - the batteries go completely dead).  Other than that one complaint, I feel that the Razor does a good Job!</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the Norelco #7810XL  Very disappointed in Norelco&#x27;s engineering of this item.  It does not idicate when the battery requires recharging.  Yet, Norelco states in several of their websights under several\\&quot;FEATURES\\&quot;An electronic charging indicator;&amp; a Remaing shaving time indicatorr\\&quot;    What goes! Norelco??</li>
            <li> like the close shave and it is so quite.</li>
            <li> This shaver seems adequate but not exceptional.  The main gripe that I have is that it does not give a real close shave, and you have to work at it and keep going over more difficult spots like your neck and chin.  Your skin needs to be completely dry, and a preshave lotion would no doubt help.  Otherwise the head will stick or bounce a little.  The result cannot compare with a blade, but that is probably a drawback of any electric razor.  It does hold a charge for a LONG time.  I charged mine 3 weeks ago and it still runs well.  All in all, I am reasonably satisfied.</li>
            <li> I cannot heap upon this product more favorable reviews...    I&#x27;ve used a Norelco / Phillips shaver for the 25 years I&#x27;ve been shaving, alternating between years of using razors and electric shavers. Their rotary shavers are legendary for comfort and reliability. I&#x27;ve also used a Braun AA battery powered travel shaver and was duly impressed as well.    This latest 7810 takes it to a new level. My beard is thick. I normally need to shave twice a day. After my first shave with the 7810 my skin felt smoother than it has in as long as I can remember, whether using a 5 blade \\&quot;fusion\\&quot; type razor or electric! We&#x27;re talking wife-shocking smooth!     How can an electric shaver cut me closer than a razor? I do not know! Granted, I&#x27;ve never been one to replace my Norelco blades - I just move on to a new shaver or shaving method - so maybe I&#x27;m just not used to the latest modern rotary heads? This model uses the HQ-8 blades. Apparently, these blades are made of magic.    My hair grows fast, course and dense and the 7310 turned my cheeks into baby soft pillows. Again: the wife is amazed.  I can&#x27;t imagine that this product could dissappoint anyone. I subsequently need to shave less often and when I do shave, it takes a fraction of the time. The shaver is the quietest of any Norelco I&#x27;ve owned... It sounds more electronic than electrical! The washing with water feature seems pretty cool, although cleaning it probably has more to do with personal hygeine and less to do with its performance?</li>
            <li> Very happy with my Norelco 7810 razor.It is everything it is advertised to be. Very happy with the long charge it holds. I have used Norelco razors for the past 40 years and this one seems to be the best of the lot.</li>
            <li> Initially I hated this product as it used to irritate my skin. Now I got used to it and it is sort of ok product, but not great product. It wont properly cut the hair under the chin.</li>
            <li> This mid-range Norelco is budget-friendly and face-friendly.  If you&#x27;re an electric shaver who prefers rotaries to foils this might be a smart choice.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve used various electric models -- mainly Remington, Norelco and Panasonic -- and this performs with the best of them. In my case, it delivers a smooth, comfortable, close and quick shave. And daily cleaning is a snap since you merely flip open the top and rinse it with hot water.  I&#x27;ve had always good luck with Norelco&#x27;s reliability and this model (7810) seems to be well built. Yet, it&#x27;s very light and quiet. Both are pluses in my book.  It also holds a charge well and re-charging only takes an hour. I can get about 2 weeks of shaving between charges. If it runs out of juice during a shave simply use it with the cord. There&#x27;s also a quick-charge feature.  Is it as close as a blade? Of course not. No electric is, but this Norelco is close enough for me and the shave lasts.  I also like the style and shape of the razor. This one&#x27;s a keeper.  I&#x27;m an Amazon Prime member so shipping was free and delivery was fast -- 2 days.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> I am updating my 4-star review from 2009.  I would now give this item zero stars if I could.  The problem?  It won&#x27;t recharge.  This is the second of this specific model that I have owned that won&#x27;t recharge.  The first, reviewed previously, failed for the same reason.  I bought a different model of Philips Norelco (7340), and it failed with the same problem.  So I bought this one again 11 months ago.  Now it has failed, same way.  3 Norelcos in 3 years, all with charging problems.  How many times does it take to convince me to say goodbye to Norelco?  My replacement will be a Braun.  ----  Originally, back in 2009, I had said: \\&quot;Almost perfect\\&quot;.  I retract that.  What I said then:  \\&quot;I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for 40 years, and this one is the best one yet.  The only flaw is that my prior Norelco had 5 LEDs to indicate amount of charge left, and how close it was to fully charged when recharging.  Neat.  But this one has just a single LED to tell you it&#x27;s fully charged.  I took a half star off for that.  \\&quot;Where did the other half star go?  The packaging!  This was the most overpackaged product I have ever seen, and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of bad ones.  The box was 10\\&quot; by 7\\&quot; by 5\\&quot;.  (The shaver&#x27;s longest dimension is about 5\\&quot;.)  A huge, hard plastic bubble was inside the box, with the shaver, a cord, a brush, a small manual, and, mostly, a huge amount of air.  Did I say the plastic was HARD?.  I have never had so much trouble getting to a product as this one, even with a heavy scissors.  Be careful opening this thing.  I dinged the shaver for crummy packaging.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my old Remington. It is very quiet which is a great improvement over my old shaver. It shaves very close and smooth with no nicks or rash. A charge lasts about 3 weeks so you typically won&#x27;t need the charger when traveling. Simply and easy to use. One tip - the shaver does not noticeably slow down as the battery charge gives out - instead it suddenly cuts off completely. So you don&#x27;t get any warning that you need a charge.</li>
            <li> My husband had a Norelco shaver for years, and he&#x27;s always loved using it. This new one is even better than the old one he had.</li>
            <li> THE RAZOR IS SO QUIET I CAN SHAVE WITH MY HEARING AIDS IN GREAT FOR ALL WHO WEAR HEARING AIDS AND FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT</li>
            <li> I bought this item for personal use and it has kept up with my needs for over a year now. This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this in 2013. It’s now 2017. Still works great. No blade changes.</li>
            <li> This razor is not only fun but shaves almost as good as my hand razor.  I like the fact that I can shave in the living room while catching up  on the news.</li>
            <li> I recieved this shaver and the product didn&#x27;t work. I tried contacting the seller and heard no response. I would not recomend buying a product that is not garenteed buy a seller.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;men&#x27;s cutting system\\&quot; unfortunately has all the hallmarks of cheap Chinese-made junk toys. This can barely handle anything more than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and I don&#x27;t recommend it. I bought mine a few months ago and I do not use it now, because it popped open while shaving and the head assembly was reduced to about a dozen parts. Since one of the little pieces of the assembly was lost in the process, this is now a pile of parts in a baggie. I suppose I am just a bad-luck case, but I don&#x27;t understand how users of this product are supposed to cheerfully reassemble the head and all its cheap plastic parts when it needs cleaning. The standard Braun shavers are way better and designed to last years, not months.</li>
            <li> I have used my Norelco 5842 XL for years, I mean like over 20 years.  The battery was not lasting very long anymore and the trimmer finally broke.  I was looking to replace it.  I use the trimmer a lot, as I like the short stubble look and its easy maintainance.  I did a lot of comparing on sites and read a lot of reviews, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $150 for a razor.  This one seemed like the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight.  Not that I ever felt like my last razor was &#x27;heavy&#x27;... I mean, its a razor, we&#x27;re talking ounces here.  I thought that was cool when I read reviews, but its really because its like cheap plastic...The trimmer was a horrible angle and kept closing up when trimming my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it, and that was easy, that&#x27;s the 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I sent my 20year old Norelco to electricshaverstore.com, who cleaned my old one, replaced the battery, and fixed the trimmer.  The thing is like new.  Cost me about $45 total and about 10 days.</li>
            <li> A very smooth shave and it holds enough charge to take a one-week trip without even thinking of recharging.</li>
            <li> You will nerver replace a blade, plain and simple.  This gives a very smooth shave, is light and easy to clean.  I did a lot of homework and this was the winner for the price.  Received it in less time then was quoted.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This razor is pretty basic and just what I was expecting. I owned a Norelco before, and the main on/off button broke so I replaced it with this one. Essential the same razor with no thrills. Cuts smooth, and didn&#x27;t take much time for my skin to adjust to it. My only complaint is that it seems to take longer to get a complete shave than was expecting. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a month now.  The battery life is excellent and the shave is very good.    Don&#x27;t have any complaints really, this shaver just works.  It may not be the closest shave ever, but if you want a close shave get a razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver does an excellent job.  It does feel a little cheap, and I would be careful not to drop it, but you buy it for the function is serves, right?  As long as you use a light touch it does a great job.  I went for a week without shaving and this shaver did a great job.  The charge lasts forever!!  I went three weeks without needing to recharge it.  I finally got nervous it might run out and just charged it.  All in all, a great product for a very good price.</li>
            <li> This electric razor proved to be very disappointing. It was flimsy, sluggish,  seemed to have no power at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver.  I have had 2 other Norelcos in the past a decided to try a Panasonic.  After a month of poor shaves, I ordered the 7810 and have been delighted with the results.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 7810 shaver is a great system.  It is light weight and battery life seems to be good.  I recently upgraded from a different Philips Norelco shaver and this seems to be a much better system.  It is easy to clean for the next use.  Just run it under the sink and done.  I would recommened this shaver system to anybody who is not looking to spend a lot.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Norelco 5825 XL in 1996 and decided to replace it this year (2010) since replacement heads were getting hard to find (I replaced the batteries a few years after I got it). It was an excellent shaver and was going to be hard to replace!! I had been looking at online shaver reviews and was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a good replacement that I would like as much. I had certain features I wanted, cord/cordless, recharge light, held a good charge on battery, washable heads, and a good shave like my 5825XL gives.   I purchased the Norelco 7810XL at the end of August and it is now almost November and I am on the same charge. I can grow a beard in a week so it&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t have to shave, I shave every day and may skip an occasional Saturday.   The 7810XL can work with a cord or cordless-my very first Norelco before the 5825 was cordless but the cord was for charging only and the shaver wouldn&#x27;t run unless it was running on a battery charge.   This has a recharge light and it hasn&#x27;t come on in the 2 months that I have had it. One reviewer said when the recharge light comes on it loses power right away, I say who cares if the charge lasts as long as it does. If my charge runs out next week (2 months and 1 week on a charge), I will know I have to charge it about every 2 months BUT I&#x27;m still not sure if the reviewer is correct when they say there is no advance warning. Bottom line on the batteries; any shaver that holds a charge for 2 months and still going strong holds a good charge.  I didn&#x27;t know if I would like the washable heads and have found out that it is an excellent benefit for a shaver to have. I can shave and wash the heads and it is clean. I sit it on my counter to dry and I&#x27;m done. With my old shaver, I used to dump the hair out every day, and clean with the Norelco brush every couple of days. Once every few weeks, I would take the head apart, go to the garage and use my air compressor to blow the remaining hair out. The washable heads are a great feature.  The 7810XL also shaves great. The one thing that I miss is the reflex head that flexes to the shape of my face and the setting I could make to adjust the depth of the flex of the head.  Other reviewers mentioned that they miss the travel case. My old Norelco case fit the new shaver just fine so this doesn&#x27;t apply to me. I only use the travel case when I am traveling but it is very handy for this and I am glad the old one worked.     FINAL THOUGHTS  I love this shaver, I would recommend the 7810XL to anyone and glad I made the purchase. It also cost a little less than my old shaver did in 1996.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific shaver.  The one thing that is vastly important to me is that the shaver gives a close shave without irritation.  It does.  It cuts quickly and easily and it leaves my skin baby-smooth.  I strongly recommend this shaver.    It&#x27;s easy to clean.  The on/off switch is large and easy to use.  Charging is simple with only two lights for \\&quot;full\\&quot; and \\&quot;charge.\\&quot;      The pop-up trimmer is adequate but I don&#x27;t plan to use it.    If you&#x27;re not sure which rotary shaver to buy, buy this one!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he is happy with it.  Says it&#x27;s much quieter than his old one.  Would have given it 5 stars but since it was a Christmas present don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s longevity.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. this review is years after the purchase Fast delivery. Excellent</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers I am disappointed in the 7810XL. Maybe not poor by today&#x27;s standards, but poor compared to what Norleco used to produce.  I got this for Christmas to replace my 15 year old 3605X. The 3605X was one of the cheapest cordless models at the time, but has performed well over the years. I only decided to get a new one as the NiCad battery had become weak. A couple years I thought to buy a new one and bought their low priced model. It was poor and returned it. This time I selected the higher priced 7810XL. Also thought it might help that is was made in Holland as opposed to the ones from China. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.   The biggest single complaint is the rotational speed of the blades must be about half of the old 3605X. Why does that matter? Ever tried to shave with a low battery? Fully charged the 7810XL blades spin at half of what a fully charged 3605X does. Blades spin slowly and takes forever to get a shave.   I am surprised this is what has become of Philips Norelco razors. At this point I will probably return this one, too.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t for me, yet a gift for my father in-law.  No complaints.  My husband has the same one and likes it well enough, no issues.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for two months and knew from the first shave that it was the best razor I have ever had in about 50 years of shaving. It does what you buy it for: gives you a close shave with minimum effort. It is also very quiet and holds a charge well. The flaw is that the pop-up trimmer hardly cuts at all. Prior to this shaver I had the Braun Pulsonic for 3 years and before that mostly had Norelcos. This one shaves the best for me.</li>
            <li> My husband has always owned Norelco shavers, but by far he likes this one best.  So, much that he ordered another one.  It is a much closer shave, so the additional money is worth it.  Actually he has purchased the top of the line Norelco shavers before and returned them.  So, this one which is a medium price has turned out to be the best.</li>
            <li> I loved the product at first sight, used it and liked the shave it gave, very smooth!    The trouble started when after shaving, I wanted to clean the head and fipped it open. It accidentally fell and the blades scattered.    I tried in vain, too couple it back but no luck!!!     I am totally disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> replaced old norelco (10 yurs) with new.  while a bit noisy it works just like it is supposed to.  does not have fancy add-on and it is just fine for me.  for price unbeatable.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my older Norelco triple head shaver. The new one is lighter but holds a charge much longer and is quieter.  Seems to shave as well, if not better, than my older model.  I have not used water to clean it, as described in the owner&#x27;s materials.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> so far, it&#x27;s getting good reviews. it&#x27;s whisper quiet, which is nice. and shiny new, which makes me happy. shipping was great!</li>
            <li> My first Norelco shaver lasted 30 years.  My second Norelco, model 6865XL  lasted 6 years.  The battery died and I think I may have messed it up trying to solder in a new battery.  It still works but is not dependable.  So, based on the reviews here at Amazon, I decided to try the Norelco 7810.  I was disappointed with it after shaving with it for a week. On the plus side it is nice looking, it&#x27;s quiet, and can be cleaned by rinsing it with water.  However, in the most important category for me, how close it shaves, it comes up short.  I found it took me 3 times longer to shave than it did with the 6865xl model.  I had to go over areas of my face 10 or 12 times to get anything near satisfactory.  Like I said earlier, my 6865XL  still works so I was able to compare them side by side.  There is no comparison. A couple of passes with the 6865XL and I was done, and my skin felt just about as smooth as it does using a hand razor and shaving cream.  After I shaved with the 7810 my skin still felt like very fine sand paper.  I then ran my 6865XL over the same area once or twice and now my skin felt smooth without a trace of roughness.  So, the 7810XL is on it&#x27;s way back to Amazon and my search goes on for another good shaver.</li>
            <li> This was to replace a much cheaper razor of mine that was just not doing the job. This one is great. Not much at all to complain about. I do get a shadow earlier than if I use a straight razor, but that isn&#x27;t much to complain about.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors over the years. I bought an off brand last time and it did not last long and never did give me a good shave. I have been using disposables razors for sometime but decided to try electric again. I am satisfied with my new Norelco. It gives a good shave, easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time. I have has it for about qa month.</li>
            <li> This is a great value shaver. I had gone back to a blade after being disappointed with my last shaver. I wish i had found this shaver before. Great close shave - as good as the blade and a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old and have been shaving with a Remingtom most all of my life. Wanted a change so I thought I&#x27;d try a Norelco. It&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had! Takes half the time and does a perfect job.</li>
            <li> For the price I love this shaver, it&#x27;s been over a year and a half and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and I like the fact that it is water resistant so I can easily clean it without working about the internal parts getting wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and I have recommended this shaver to friends.</li>
            <li> Very light weight.  Very quiet.  Shaves a lot faster than any razor I have had.  I have had numerous other razors, Norelco, Remington, but this one is the best so far.  It gives a quick, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> my 4th noreloco and every one (so far) has lasted for years &amp; years......just replace the blades once a year.  this razor gives a smooth, fast, and close shave...it&#x27;s everything i expected at a great price too!</li>
            <li> My second Norelco shaver. First one lasted over 15 years, so I stayed with what I considered to be a quality product. I am happy to say that after three weeks with the shaver, I am happy I did so. The workmanship and quality is equal to my previous model and it shaves remarkably well for a non-blade shaving system.</li>
            <li> Reading personal reviews is very helpful, thanks to those who take the time to do so!  I read many reviews on different electric men&#x27;s shavers.  I have owned norelco in the past so I did favor them.  This quite operating shaver is surprising me.  Since it runs quite, I felt that is wasn&#x27;t running very fast, but it truly does a great job very close without any grabbing.  And this battery is a  mystery- I thought it was low on charge but it ran no faster when I plugged it in, so I still havent  charged it yet.  Really now on week four and still going.  I do suggest you consider the Norelco 7810 shaver.  Remember it sounds slow and low but it really just works fine this way!!!!! Yippee</li>
            <li> Great shaver quiet but the main negative is the bubble wrap packaging that makes you destroy packaging so that you cannot return the shaver.  Found shaver locally for $10 less within four days of receiving from Amazon and normally would take it back to store but Amazon has no returns and no price match.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have to say, I&#x27;m amazed at how good it is. Kind of wished there was a carrying case with it though.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN SHAVING WITH NORELCO ELECTRIC RAZORS SINCE I WAS IN THE ARMY, STATIONED IN FRANKFURT GERMANY IN 1956.  SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE HAD AT LEAST TEN NORELCO SHAVERS AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT.  THIS LAST ONE IS THE BEST ONE EVER.  AFTER SHAVING, IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE USED A GOOD SHARP BLADE AND SHAVING CREAM TO SHAVE WITH.  I HAVE USED NORELCO PRODUCTS FOR MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ELECTRIC RAZOR TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A FAST, SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth as can be. Easy clean. Long charge life. This model has a long charge battery. Well worth extra cost. Best Norelco yet. I have owned many Norelcos. Razor is well made and should last a long time...</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco razor.  I have been using them for 20 years and love them.  I was forced to purchase another razor when the side burn trimmer and the on/off button on my last razor eventually broke.  This new razor is so weak and has no power. After reading some of the other bad reviews, this is a common complaint!  It takes me twice as long to shave as it did before. I can still manage to use my old Norelco razor by, get this, sticking the eraser end of a pencil into the on/off hole to turn it on.  I love this older Norelco razor and it does a far superior job of shaving and I find myself using it even though the thing is falling apart after ten years. Maybe the higher end models have a better motor but stay away from this model if you are accustomed to the older versions. You will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My son-in-law has the difficult combination of a very thick and tough beard and extremely sensitive skin.  I bought this shaver as a gift for him.  He has been very pleased with it and says he gets a really close shave without tearing his face up.</li>
            <li> Based on the favorable reviews of this shaver, I bought it and began using it in place of a Braun unit.  The 7810 gives a very close shave and runs quietly.  The feature that sold me was that it will run on the cord when the battery is low.  I have yet to use that feature because the shaver keeps on running like the Eveready bunny...</li>
            <li> Ok, this is my first electric shaver since I was a teenager and Kennedy was president.  Back then, my beard wasn&#x27;t so thick and I wouldn&#x27;t turn into a Viking if I forgot to shave for a few days.  I purchased the 7810 as a backup for when I&#x27;m too lazy to do a real shave in the morning.  I guess this was asking too much, and although the 7810 is simple, light, and quiet, I could still sandpaper furniture with my beard after a long session with this product.  I guess, as compared to other similar products, the 7810 works well, but I&#x27;m obviously just not an electric shaving man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve had this product now for 26 months, and it still works the same as it did when purchased (but with replacement blades, of course).  I&#x27;ve found if you use very light pressure, it works better than pressing down on the skin.  It still doesn&#x27;t match a real razor shave, but the unit has held-up very well and still holds a charge as well as when new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric shavers for years. My old one (at least 15 years old) served me well, but the battery died and wouldn&#x27;t recharge anymore. The Norelco 7810 is lighter in weight than my older one. It is much quieter, and it shaves much closer than the old one did. I am very pleased with it (three weeks in service). The floating heads are much better at conforming to your face than my old shaver was. It also had floating heads, but the new one has much more freedom to move around the curvature of the face.     Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and think the flashing green light means it&#x27;s still charging. Counter intuitively, the light is steady green when charging and flashing green when fully charged. I can&#x27;t say how long the battery charge will take after the initial charge, because after three weeks, I&#x27;m still working on the initial charge. I&#x27;ve tried other electric shavers, but Norelco is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver for over a month now and am very happy with both the battery life and the shaving results. I went over three weeks on the initial charge.  I do not have a heavy beard but I usually don&#x27;t shave on the weekends. With other shavers I have owned I would usually shave with a disposable shaver Monday mornings since the electric shaver wouldn&#x27;t do a good enough job. I would then use the electric the rest of the week.   With this shave I have not had to do this and my Monday morning shave takes a little longer but it turns out great.  I also like he fact that if the charge runs low I can still finish shaving with the shaver plugged in. I was not able to do this with my older shavers.  Cleaning the shaver is easy as I just hold the head under the faucet. The Head will pop off if I open it too far but it snaps back in place easily.  I am very pleased with my purchase of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric razors in the past, but they always irritated my skin.  I tried again with the Norelco 7810 and was pleased to experience little to minor irritation.  Shaving and cleaning the razor takes very little time.  This is the first electric razor I use regularly.</li>
            <li> Works as well as you can expect from any rotary electric razor. Well made, affordable, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my father&#x27;s birthday.  He liked it very much, however, it just stopped working after 3 months.  Will now have to investigate the warranty on it, as it is past the return date to Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor, but it took about three weeks for my face to get used to it.  Be patient, and you&#x27;ll like this razor.</li>
            <li> After years of using electric razors, this is the first that I have been unhappy since the first use.    This razor DOES NOT handle a heavy beard. I find that I need to shave twice a day sometimes, which HAS NEVER been before.    I am totally unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase and my husband just loves it. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a good razor at a good price. The shipping came real fast.</li>
            <li> I bought a 7310 model for my son. It was a very good razor. So, I decided to buy one for myself to replace my old 3500 model. On Amazon, I saw a more expensive model 7810 and thought I probably deserved a better one.    Well, 7810 might be slightly lighter and a bit smaller. But, its performance is identical to 7310 which is about 2/3 of the prices of 7810. Both do not sound powerful (being quiet) but do get the job done after a few passes.    So, while 7810 is a good razor, I would recommend you to purchase 7310 to save $25.</li>
            <li> I am a rising freshman in college and this shaver is amazing. For the price, you CAN NOT beat this little guy. It cuts closer than most manual razors and in a fraction of the time. I find that it cuts closest when my face is dry (usually right out of bed). I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone who wants to save time and still get a great shave.</li>
            <li> This is a nice razor, to replace the one I left at a campground.  It is comfortable and shaves well.  I just wish it had a travel case.  If it is for home use only, there should be no problems.</li>
            <li> It cuts my hair on my face. Leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft. I&#x27;m happy. But it takes a few passes to do so. 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This must be the best electric razor that I have used so far.  Very silent and smooth operation. I just love the overall feel of the razor.   The blades appear to be really sharp and long lasting. However it&#x27;s too early to say for sure as I have used it only for 1 month.  Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed; especially by price versus value ratio. I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers since I was 18 years old. I&#x27;m now 68. The price goes up, the quality goes down. For close to $80 I expect a solid case and something that sounds like a shaver instead of a plastic toy. I expect it to tell me when --  and by how much -- the battery charge is decreasing. I expect to be able to use the shaver with the cord as much as I want and still have it charging the battery. The trimmer can&#x27;t be washed like the head? Ridiculous. All in all, I&#x27;ll keep using the thing for what I bought it for; trimming nose, ear and neck hair. I&#x27;ll keep my Gillette razor for the more precise (and comfortable) trimming of my beard. If there were anything better on the market I&#x27;d have returned it, but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet so I guess we guys&#x27;ll just have to struggle on for now.</li>
            <li> this machine was a gift from my wife. I&#x27;m very happy, the machine is very easy to use, clean, recharge the battery. the machine does a very good shave and save so much time and the skin is soft and not irritated. I recommend this product certainly will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time buyer of an electric razor. Razor works good and was a good price .I would recommend this razor for it&#x27;s seemingly good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband&#x27;s birthday to replace the Panasonic that had literally fallen apart.  The razor came fully charged and it gives a nice, close shave.  My husband loves that one charge will last up to 17 days and this electric shavor is much quieter than the last one.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for more years than many readers of this review are old (yeah, I&#x27;m a geezer), and after using my new 7810 for a month I can tell you that this razor is light years better than the 10 year old one it replaced (7865 XL).  When my 7865XL wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more, I considered trying to replace the rechargeable battery.  Forget that idea -- it&#x27;s soldered in and if you do get a new battery in it, you still have an old razor with ten year old technology.  Treat yourself to a new 7810 for a much better shave at a very reasonable price. The shaving heads on the 7810 look similar to the ones on my old razor, but the 7810 gives me a closer shave with absolutely no shaving discomfort (the heads in the old one had been replaced 30 days before the batts gave out).  The 7810 is much lighter weight and quieter as well. It&#x27;s got a quality look and feel to it and the motor chews through a weekend of stubble with no problem.  A battery charge lasts me 3 weeks and takes an hour to fully recharge. Best of all, this no-nonsense razor is a real bargain at $60 (it&#x27;s even cheaper now than the $63 I paid Amazon 45 days ago)!  In short, I&#x27;m sold on this razor.  I should have popped for a new one before I bought the last set of replacement blades (I change them every 12 months).  Use the same logic my wife uses when she needs to convince herself it&#x27;s OK to buy something new -- just say \\&quot;I&#x27;m worth it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL SHAVER.  TAKES MY BEARD OFF WITH VERY LITTLE PULL. MY GOODNESS, I ORDERED IT AND IT WAS AT MY DOORSTEP IN LESS THAN A WEEK.  I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li> Norelco is living on it&#x27;s past reputation, as this is a poor excuse, but a good example of junk.Cuts poorly and the trimmer is worthless in practical use.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 7810XL is a pleasure to use.  I don&#x27;t even put on any pre-shave product and it&#x27;s a completely smooth shave.  So convenient and being it&#x27;s cordless, one can knock that facial growth off without being tied to a wall outlet and with no pull or yank.  The battery seems to hold a very long charge.  7810XL is an excellent choice in cordless shaving !</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco shavers for over 40 years and have never had a problem. Shaving with this one is just like the others, it does a great job. The only problem I have with this is cleaning it. Once the screens come out I have a very hard time putting them back in. Yesterday it took me about 5 minutes to get them in correctly.</li>
            <li> Best used for trimming pubes and under arms. Makes live so easy and clean. Shaving beard is painful as its feel like sharp pricking while shaving. Easy to clean. Wonderful battery life and good grip.</li>
            <li> purchased this item on line from amazon.com the razor arrived as promised and was fully charged ready to use.  Ihave been using norelco for years and this razor is the best I have used. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Norelco shavers. This one&#x27;s not too bad. Quiet, close shave. The most annoying thing about it is, of all the ones I&#x27;ve had, this one leaks shaved beard everywhere. It would be nice if Norelco still built a corded model so you didn&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries.</li>
            <li> I used to use Norelco shavers, but switched to Braun about 2 years ago.  I recently decided that the Braun was not giving me the shave I wanted and bought the Norelco 7810.  I really like the closeness of the shave I am now getting with the 7810 and it is very convenient to just rinse off the cutting blades after using.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this Shaver.  Two previous shavers, very similar, had battery charging problems.  One required an 8 hour charge and the other 1 hour.  Both would only last 2 days, and this was with correct charging for Ni-cad batteries.    The 7810 charges in 1-2 hours and goes 10 days.  They are finally back to the old shaver reliability.  I recommend this Shaver.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING NORELCO RAZORS FOR OVER 20 YEARS. I WOULDN&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE!!!</li>
            <li> My husband received this Razor for Father&#x27;s Day.  The first time he used it, his first words were  \\&quot;How quiet it was\\&quot;. After reveiwing some of the  coments from other people, I was going to order  the newest one out and when I saw the price I   knew that was&#x27;t the one I wanted. I am glad that  I bought the Norelco 7810. It was in my price   range and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> It works great - and better than the remington I had. Funny, the remington cost more too.     Great functionality, low price, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor consistently until I gor this Norelco.  It has far surpassed my expectations,  shaves close, easy to clean, and fits perfectly in my hand.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> A gift for my husband who is on blood thinners and always cutting himself with traditional razors. This has really been a blessing.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about two months, after that, it died, not to be resuscitated.  Absolute GARBAGE! Will never buy a Norelco product again.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for a week or two and I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and performance.  When I received it I had not shaved for a week or so.  The clippers built into the back made short work of the long stuff.  After I got it down to a short length, they blades really make quick work of the stubble.  I have used it daily since and it knocks down daily growth very effectively.  I think my face is now starting to get used to it.  Slightly irritating at first coming from a blade &amp; cream.  Would def recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Every shaver I have tried made in recent years has been a POS.&lt;br /&gt;Same design appearances from 15 years ago but they simply do not work.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe some sleaze bags are buying them, using them for a few months then exchanging them since blades are so expensive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would explain the rave reviews and handful of poor but all I know is, I have a MAN&#x27;S beard when I don&#x27;t shave for a day or two. I will destroy a Schick Hydra 5 in about 8 days and NO, the acclaimed sharperners and sharpening tricks such as swiping on denim can not salvage a razor that has gone up against my whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try replacing the blades since I really hate wet shaving but straight out of the box, this makes shaver 3 or 4 from norelco and remington that were PATHETIC compared to their predecessors.</li>
            <li> Shaver works well and keeps a charge for a long time. Replacement blades are easy to find.  I would recommend it</li>
            <li> This razor was purchased to replace my old 8894 XL. This unit gives a good enough shave, but it is nowhere near as solid a product.   Granted, the 8894 XL was quit a bit more costly.   Also, the location of the on/off button, combined with the body shape, can lead to annoying accidental shut offs  All in all, a good razor but a bit light weight.</li>
            <li> Several reviewers have already noted how quiet this razor is, and I agree wholeheartedly.  This is the quietest electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, thus I have dubbed it the Prius of Razors.  That said,  it seems to be really quiet because it lacks a lot of power- on a full charge you can hear the little blades jut churning away trying to cut those tiny whiskers (and on me they are very tiny). Often I have to cut the same hair two or three times.  I am part Native American and thus I grow very little facial hair- so the Prius Razor works okay for me.  However if you are a full beard person or one of those five o&#x27;clock growth people, I can&#x27;t imagine this is the Razor for you. Other positives- lightweight,  easy to handle and the battery is fantastic.</li>
            <li> D Better shave then my old Norelco (probably 20 years old). Very quite. Seems to hold a charge for at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the 7810 XL, but what was shipped was not an XL, but a plain 7810. I had purchased a Norelco shaver several years ago, a 5845 XL, and have been pleased with it. I felt, after all this time, maybe Norelco had improved the shaver, so I ordered a new one. I was wrong. The old one, the Norelco 5845 XL, is superior to the new one. The only advantage of the 7810 is, it&#x27;s quieter. I&#x27;m left wondering, if I had received the 7810 XL, which is what thought I was ordering, would it have been as good as my old razor. Now,of course, I&#x27;ll always wonder.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dad as it&#x27;s what he&#x27;s always used and loved.  Brand new, works great and was shipped in good order.  Before buying from Amazon, I researched extensively on the internet for the best purchase value.  I was delighted to find Amazon offered that as they are a preferred place for my shopping.</li>
            <li> Having owned Norelco shavers for 40-50 years, the 7810 gets my vote as one of the best. I like the idea that they can now be cleaned with just water. It gives a great shave and the trimmer works better than my last shaver.The battery life is ample and it&#x27;s so quiet you can hardly hear it.Keep it up, Norelco.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shaver for my fiance and he loves it!  He&#x27;s been shaving with disposable razors for the past 4 years, or should I say, occasionally shaving.  He&#x27;s used the shaver 3 times already since it arrived and he said he&#x27;d never go back to disposable razors.  The first shave irritated his skin a bit as the lubricant and Lectric Shave I ordered for him arrived a day after the shaver.  The second shave was closer and did not irritate his skin however...he recommend purchasing Electric Shaver lubricant and Lectric Shave aftershave if you have sensitive skin.  The shaver contours nicely to his hand, is easy to use, cuts great (his skin is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt after using the shaver), and hasn&#x27;t needed to be charged yet.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very nice and lives up to the good reviews that I had read in advance of purchasing it.  It is extremely quiet, cuts very well and has a long battery live - haven&#x27;t recharged it yet.  I have had Norelco Shavers for years, but they keep getting better &amp; better.</li>
            <li> This was my hubby&#x27;s first electric shaver.  So far so good.  He did have some razor burn/irritation at first but that seems to have subsided.</li>
            <li> Have to replace the old one occasionally</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend&#x27;s son, he has cerebral palsy and is wheelchair bound, part of this condition is he has trouble sitting still, and startles easily, all this adds up to me not wanted to try to shave him with a regular razor. We&#x27;ve both been using it for about 6 months, and it&#x27;s gotten slightly duller but it&#x27;s still very comfortable to shave with. It cuts well and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin. it does better than other electric razors around the jawline but I still have to go back over it a few times. The ability to rinse it out after using it is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much lighter and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;sturdy\\&quot; as my old electric, and since the transformer is in the plug and not the razor the cord is more expensive to replace, but if moving the AC voltage components out of the razor means i can wash it out under the faucet, that&#x27;s definitely a good trade for me.</li>
            <li> Razor was priced ok but shaver is not their best. Shaving time takes a bit longer than other models. Holds charge well though.</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;m happy with the performance of this shaver. A fully charged battery cycle is good for plenty of shaves. However, it takes a few minutes to get the job done properly, and the shave is not as close as with blades.</li>
            <li> Purchased two of these for my boys for Christmas.  They have used them and love the car charger.  One is a marine and keeps it in his truck so he can freshen up during the day.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have bought three Phillips Norelco razors in the last few years range $60- $90. The first was superb, the second was O.K.  This last one is inferior (not even as good as the one I threw away). They just don&#x27;t make the cutgters the way they used to. Elder.</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric razors, but this one gives a great close shave quickly. It replaces a higher end Norelco and does a much better job. It&#x27;s trimmer is more sturdy also. Only downside is no warning of low battery power. It just stops and you either recharge or plug it in and shave, which is noy a problem in my case. Very good value for a great shave.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when ordering this shaver as I never seem to like anyone that I buy... this one however is even better than I thought it would... very QUIET compared to my old face-eater. I thought at first it was weak, but realized it was just that good... lol I never been this satisfied with any shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in past. I highly recommend this Shaver to anyone in the market for one...</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric razors since 1989. My last product was the model 6843XL that I bought in 2005, I replaced the cutting heads twice. Recently I bought this model 7810XL an it is awesome. It&#x27;s very noticeable the closer shaving that you get. The speed of the cutting heads is higher and quiet. The design of the cover of the head has different patterns, lines as the former but also little holes that catch the shortest remaining stuble. The capability of to be cleaned with hot water under the faucet is an additional advantage.    I recommend to any that previously own an old model that try this one.</li>
            <li> Made his face red and bumpy every time he used it, so needless to say we don&#x27;t have it anymore</li>
            <li> My trusty Norelco that I had used for 10 years finally would not hold a charge.  I attempted to remove the batteries, but alas, the batteries were soldered onto the printed circuit.  Why couldn&#x27;t Norelco use rechargeable-removable batteries?  I can&#x27;t complain, as the original batteries held a charge for so many years.  It is much quieter than the first one, and shaves equal to or better than the old one.  I viewed the new one with trepidation when unwrapping it due to the light weight.  Fear not.  The newer, lighter weight, quieter Norelco 7810 is a winner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review 2 1/2 years after making the purchase and it still works great, especially considering I shave my entire head. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> If you have a cleft chin, Norekco is the best. This shaver is quieter and does a better job that my previous 7600, which died suddenly only to relive once I bought the new one. Very happy with the 7800 series</li>
            <li> So much for the gold box deal! I got this health care product and it was pre-opened. I returned immediately. I was expecting a deal and something new, not a potential aids death sentence.</li>
            <li> I used the 7810XL for two and a half years before it died.  Prior to that, I owned a Norelco shaver that lasted over 10 years.  Before the 7810XL died, the shaver would shut off and turn on intermittently, on/off button would not shut it off if it was running, and would not turn it on when it wasn&#x27;t running.  Tried to re-charge it, and it was dead...no indicator light, no power whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a terrific shaver while it lasted.  Buyer beware....after the two-year warranty expires, you are on borrowed time.  If you DO buy this shaver, register the warranty at [...] so that if it does die, it can be replaced.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Bought this razor a few weks ago and it is fantastic - a great razor. Shaves much better than the Remington I had before.</li>
            <li> Usually I use these reviews as my guide as to whether or not i&#x27;ll buy the product or not and let me tell you the reviews were all accurate on this shaver. It&#x27;s really great. It makes very little noise which makes you think well is it really doing anything but trust me its doing everything.     If your wondering whether or not to purchase this shaver or not dont wonder anymore. Take it from someome who doesn&#x27;t write a lot of reviews. I had to write a review on this shaver though because its worth every penny.     Oh one more thing. You can clean it right under the running water in your sink because its water proof. I mean what more do you want. Ok stop reading this review and buy the razor :)</li>
            <li> This shaver is better than a double edge razor (I&#x27;ve tried the mecur and edwin).  The braun and other electrics are not as good for neck, upper lip, and facial hairs that might grow in a different direction.  Not perfect but the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Nice razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought it one year ago and it works great. Good to wash with water. Long duration batteries. Good purchase</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT AND HOLDS A CHARGE FOREVER IT SEEMS. LOVE THE WAY THE HEAD OPENS UP AND YOU CAN EASILY RINSE WITH WATER.</li>
            <li> Had one almost identical to this one that lasted about six or seven years. Changed the blades twice on it. It finally gave up the ghost. I really like this one so far. This one is a little more comfortable to hold than the other one. Does a good job. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> price was wonderful, item was everything I thought it would be and more.  This is my third Norelco system, and this is by far the best to date.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric shaver, and I use it for shaving my head.  Overall, it&#x27;s very convenient, and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to spending money on Gillette Blades.  However, one pass is not going to do the trick.  Plan on a solid 5 minutes to make sure you&#x27;re getting all the hairs on your head (if you&#x27;re using this to shave your head)</li>
            <li> My last electric razor died its death some months back. I replaced it with this product--the 7810. There are some real pluses to this: it is light weight; it does a good job, shaving more closely than many other electric razors that I have tried over time. The three razors \\&quot;float,\\&quot; doing reasonably well in following the curves of my face. In addition, the battery charge lasts quite awhile. Once the unit is charged, it lasts quite awhile. The last time I charged it was early July and it is now late September. Not bad! Finally, the price is pretty reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side? When trying to get some of the whiskers out of the unit, the floating heads tend to fall out and they are not always as easy to get back in place as I would like (on the other hand, I tend to be impatient!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line? A pretty good electric razor. Not the best I&#x27;ve ever used, but surely better than average.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and a sensitive skin-a bad combination.Over the past 45 years I have used safety razors as well as Norelco,Braun and Remington electric razors.Since 1980 I have found Norelco to give me the most comfortable shave of all the razors I have tried.    The Norelco 7810 is the best electric shaver I have ever used! It is just awesome! Shaves are fast,smooth,and very comfortable.It is so easy to clean under running water. My face feels smoother than ever and there is no razor burn.It has my highest recommendation! Try it- you won&#x27;t be sorry!

            <li> Over the past five years I brought many electric shavers, none of them were that good.  I even brought the Remingtion electric shaver recommended by Consumer Reports, I didn&#x27;t like it.  I have to admit I was never willing to spend much money for an electric shaver.  Finally, I decided to spend a few bucks and purchased the Phillips Norelco 7810.  Very pleased with this product.  The only thing I ever wanted from an electric shaver was a good close shave, which I get from this product. I highly recommed this product.</li>
            <li> I have no real complaints with this razor.  It gives a quick, easy painless shave.  It&#x27;s battery life is excellent and it&#x27;s quiet.  Obviously it can&#x27;t give quite as close a shave as a manual razor and it&#x27;s clipper feels a little chintzy.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric, i&#x27;ve been using blades ever since I started shaving.  I have odd facial hair in that it grows in about 10 different directions, so blades required multiple passes and often left me with razor burn and in grown hairs.    From day one it was more convenient and less irritation and now that my skin has completely adjusted it is night and day how much better this is.</li>
            <li> Finally!!  A replacement for my 10 yr old Norelco 5603X, which by the way is still giving me 3-4 30 minute shaves per charge, but I know it won&#x27;t be long before they (10 yr old NiCads) finally give up the ghost. That shaver has been such a pleasure to use over the years, with only 3 cutter replacements, I may just pay to have the batteries replaced and keep it as a backup.  But back to this 7810 shaver, it looks like the replacement for my old model, and is priced at exactly the same amount. It&#x27;s much lighter and much more quiet, which I like a lot.  Also, the blinking light when the charge is complete is very handy....I have to watch the clock with my old one...but the head assembly seems to be a bit \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot;.  But I look forward to as many years of comfortable, close shaves with this model as I&#x27;ve had with my old one.  If you recognise my name, you know I bought a Remington a while back and have since trashed it!!  Norelco, in my book, is the only shaver to own!  I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a moderately priced, dependable shaver. Another observation of note is that one reviewer thinks it&#x27;s great to be able to plug this shaver in and \\&quot;shave and charge\\&quot; at the same time...this is NOT the case.  The booklet clearly states that it \\&quot;does not charge\\&quot; if it&#x27;s \\&quot;on\\&quot; while plugged in. And also that doing so will effect the battery life...just so you&#x27;re aware of this.</li>
            <li> This product looks very nice sitting on a shelf in its see-thru box. It is impossible for a senior citizen like myself to actually open the plastic box, so I have no idea whether it shaves or not.  Any further small appliances that I purchase will be from a retail store where the clerk can open the package before payment is made.</li>
            <li> This unit is very light-weight, make sure you hold onto it tight when it&#x27;s wet if you have a tile floor! It shaves great, easy to clean with water, and the parts pop out no problem for better cleaning.</li>
            <li> My Remmington triple head has charging issues, so I replaced it with a Braun in the $50 range, lots of power, stays charged, but just doesn&#x27;t work for me. The Norelco was reasonably priced, holds a charge, doesn&#x27;t sound like a chain saw, and gave a decent shave. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the cordless Norelco 7810 electric shaver for a couple of weeks now and find that, for me, The triple cutting heads are spaced too far apart (unlike the triple heads on my older Norelco shaver which the 7810 replaces). This feature causes missed or incomplete shaved areas on certain parts of my face, resulting in annoyingly longer shave sessions. Why this design change? Norelco should have left a good thing alone. The 7810 is very quiet, though - almost too much so. At times it sounds as if it&#x27;s too weak to be doing a good job. That&#x27;s purely a psychological thing, I know, but, however wrong, it does make that impression.    George Koizumi</li>
            <li> Fell apart after six months. Cheap parts</li>
            <li> What impresses me most about this shaver, as opposed to the Philips/Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve had before, is the battery life. The others were good, but I&#x27;ve gotten over 24 shaves from one charge (Caveat: I have what most people would call a \\&quot;very light\\&quot; beard- I need to shave or I look like a dork). I appreciate that it&#x27;s quieter and lighter than past models, although admittedly at first it felt \\&quot;cheaper.\\&quot; I can hear when the blades are cutting, indicating I need to keep at that spot, and when they&#x27;re not, indicating that I can move on. I disagree with reviewers who miss the docking station- it&#x27;s an unnecessary piece of clutter and landfill waste. As with other Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve found that they work best with a clean, dry, cool face. First thing when I get out of bed is usually fine, but sometimes a quick wash with cool water and then a few moments to dry completely is helpful, like if I&#x27;m in a hot climate. I think the charger could be more travel-friendly, that is, compact, but with this long battery life you&#x27;d need to be on the road for a long time to bother bringing it. I agree with other reviewers who wish a travel case had been included; I&#x27;ll use my old one, but it should still come with one. And as for the cleaning brush, well, you should never need it. You should just dump the scraps in the trash and then give it a quick rinse, shake out the excess water and put it back in \\&quot;its spot.\\&quot; It takes seconds and means it will always be clean the next time you use it. The only other thing to comment upon is that it would be better to have a meter indicating remaining battery life instead of just stopping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for the purpose of on the move shaving.. It has proven to be light weight in the hand, easy to handle and cuts smooth on a not so tough beard.</li>
            <li> The electric shavers we ordered were shipped immediately. If you want a shaver that does not cost an arm and a leg and still gives a reasonably close and comfortable shave, this is a great value!!!</li>
            <li> First time to own/use an electric razor.  Interesting how your skin has to \\&quot;toughen up\\&quot; for any electric razor.  Clean, close shave. Nice feel. Don&#x27;t have to clean up water from all around the sink. Price was right.  Can&#x27;t compare to other razors since this is my first, but I like the results....and what else really matters?</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Norelco electric razor. My first was 7 years old and still worked find but I thought I would upgrade and also help the economy by purchasing some things. This is balanced very well, comfortable to use, and charges very fast compared to the older one. I rate as an excellent buy. The only thing you can&#x27;t do is shave wet with lather. You shave the regular electric way with skin conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Norelco product over the course of about 10 years.  I&#x27;ve also owned a couple of Braun shaving products.  I must say, Philips/Norelco electric shavers have always stood out as far as quality and longevity goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7810XL is no exception.  In fact, I love this shaver.  The battery life is probably the biggest pro of this particular model.  I&#x27;ve taken this badboy with me on long road trips and I also bring it to work when I&#x27;m stuck on overnight shifts.  This electric razor is with me a million times more on the road than at home on the charger and time and time again it keeps my face consistency clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other perks include: very smooth shaving, super quiet motor, the unit itself is lightweight and comfortable in hand.  Oh yeah, the price... for the quality of this product, the price is well worth it.  This shaver is comparable to those higher end models that break the bank.  The only minor gripe I have is I wish this shaver came with a carrying case.  Even low-end $20 shavers come with carrying cases!</li>
            <li> The unit works very well.  I spend half the time needed to shave that I used to.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for years now. This is one of the best. strong, long battery life, and close shave..   I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Processed and delivered much more quickly than anticipated.  Charged the battery overnight, have used it more than three weeks now on the initial charge.  When I first turned it on, it was so quiet I didn&#x27;t think it was working.  It gives a very close shave with almost no pressure.  The best razor I&#x27;ve used of the Norelco brand and I&#x27;ve had Norelco&#x27;s since 1968.  This is showing my wife&#x27;s name on the review, she doesn&#x27;t actually use the razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great, it does a super job.  The only problem I have is that I get only 9 days of shaving instead of 17.  It could be that I take too long to shave. Also, I wish it had a red light that would warn me that I am close to running out of power.  My old Norelco had that feature (Norelco Model: 8151XL). Otherwise, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have had a few different models this one is very good.As with all these shavers its cheaper to buy a new shaver than replace the heads!!!!</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor,</li>
            <li> i am a classic man, i´ve prefered to use the blade shave and philps is an alternative for me, execellent.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. I have used this style for years and I get a close shave</li>
            <li> This Norelco razor is a dud. The motor seems to drive the blades too slowly to get a good shave. I have to keep going over the same place numerous times to get close which causes irritation. There is no battery low indicator and on several occasions, the razor cut off in the middle of a shave, which I had to finish with a blade. Stay away from this model and spend a little more money for a better unit.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son&#x27;s first electric razor. He likes it, and it does a great job. Not sure how it would do on my hardcore cable thick hair, but his baby fine hair comes right off.</li>
            <li> need to order another one...</li>
            <li> Have had the razor for several weeks and am getting great shaves from it.  Very comfortable and fast shaves so far.  Charge is lasting a very long time as advertised.  Would not hesitate to recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver to replace my norelco 7845XL, and I&#x27;ll have to admit it&#x27;s even better than the one it&#x27;s replacing.  It shaves close and it has a nice torque feel when it fires up which is kind of surprising but very welcome.  Excellent battery life and i don&#x27;t miss the low battery led. That was probably a bad idea by Norelco.  You shouldn&#x27;t let the battery get to %20 for a recharge.  Shortens the battery life.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for about a month now, and so far it has been great. I looked into other models, and found this razor to be top quality and within my price range. I have a thick beard, and it trims it very well, with very little (if any) irritation. It also gives me about as close a shave as the razor I used beforehand did! Also, the battery life is amazing. I&#x27;ve only had to recharge it once since owning it (one charge lasts over two weeks). I am overall very satisfied with this product.    One feature that is lacking that would be nice - a battery indicator. Instead of getting a heads-up about whether or not the battery is almost dead, it just immediately stops working. This is no problem when I&#x27;m at home, but if I&#x27;m traveling and don&#x27;t have my charger, I can see it being very annoying.</li>
            <li> It gives a relatively close shave with minimal irritation. The battery life is fantasic and if the battery dies you can just plug it in and still shave (My last razor actually didn&#x27;t ... glad to see this one didn&#x27;t suffer from that). On the plus side it looks nice and feels good in the hand also. The only thing to beware of is that inside the head assembly some of the parts are cheap plastic and appear to be quite fragile, so be careful not to drop it lest you want it your razor to become a paper weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with battery life, and that you can run the shaver corded or battery. It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as I would like, however. Clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaces a 10 year old Norelco that finally wore out. There are some improvements in head design with screens that have both slots and holes (vs just slots) plus 3 floating/tilting heads (vs no tilting). The results for me are a closer shave with fewer passes compared to my old unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature I like is the cordless operation. I was able to get 12 shaves off the initial charge. The recharge is fairly quick at just over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My unit is fairly quiet like my previous Norelco which lets me shave in the morning without waking my spouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I love the easy cleanup . Just pop the top open and rinse under running water. Now I just hope it lasts 10 years like the last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update July, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years of use I can report this shaver is still functioning perfectly. The batteries continue to hold a good charge and I can go at least 2 weeks between charges (it takes me 2-3 minutes to shave each day). I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for replacement blades, which I am changing for the first time.</li>
            <li> A very good electric razor, I have used it for a number of years and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> The price has gone up on these, but this was one of the best Norelco&#x27;s I ever owned, in a lifetime of buying Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco razors for years and they always seem to satisfy me. However, one issue I have with this razor that I didn&#x27;t have for the one this replaced is you get no indication that the batter charge is nearly gone. I can be using this razor and suddenly it stops because the battery is empty. Previously the Norelco Razor I used had an indicator telling me the level of battery charge. In this razor that indicator was removed... probably because of cost. To me that lowered my rating on this razor.</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B001AJD0UM Philips Norelco 7810 Men&#x27;s Cutting System Philips Norelco 7310XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] arrived in great shape and within the estimated delivery time. Directions on initial use were simple and easy to follow. Initial charging was very simple to accomplish and the initial use of my new Norelco was very comfortable and clean cutting. After the first week of using my new Norelco I found cleaning it as directed was surprising easy. Norelco did a great job of designing the 7810. I&#x27;m good for another 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for several weeks now, and I have yet to recharge it.  The battery is amazing.    It shaves very close, with little to no razor burn.  Easy to use and comfortable.    The head is incredibly easy to wash.  It can either flip open or be removed entirely for a thorough cleaning.    The one con is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case.  I&#x27;m using the case from my old razor, but the charger for this one doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Sunday morning a few weeks ago, my electric shaver slipped out of my hand and bounced hard off the tile floor leaving me staring in the mirror with a half-shaven face. Even Amazon&#x27;s fastest order fulfillment system wasn&#x27;t going to get me a new shaver within an hour. As always, I quickly checked Amazon&#x27;s reviews for product selection advice. Then, it was off to the store. There must be something funny about a guy with a half-shaven face purchasing a new electric shaver early on Sunday morning because the clerk couldn&#x27;t stop giggling. It was funny. I enjoyed the moment, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good purchase. Actually, the 7810X is an awesome upgrade over their previous model electric shaver for producing a comfortable close shave. From the sound of it, the cutting heads are rotating faster than the earlier models. In this model, the center of the three cutting heads is flexible which helps the cutting heads stay in contact with my face. The AC charger is a smaller rectangular unit. A travel pouch is not included. Most important feature for me: The 7810XL has a three-minute fast charge feature that works really well on Sunday mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the contour of the handle has a nice fit and grip. With most of the weight located near the cutting heads, the balance point for this light weight shaver is just above the handle. Nice design. Because of the closer shave and improved features, I should have upgraded sooner, way sooner. If your electric shaver is more than a few years old, an upgrade is worthwhile and probably something to consider.</li>
            <li> Have only used this a few times - it&#x27;s more like a backup in the case that i don&#x27;t have time for a blade. Has worked well without too much noise and seems to hold a charge well, too. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to bc I haven&#x27;t own any others and am not an avid electric user, but I would recommend it based on my experience with it so far.</li>
            <li> Feels very cheap compared to my old Norelco razors but it works wery well.  It shaves closer than the older models but I&#x27;m not expecting it to last very long.  First they started making the batteries almost impossible to replace, now the blades get dull faster so you have to buy replacements more often.  The whole thing is a racket that you can&#x27;t get out of.  Anyway, out of a bunch of overpriced crap, this one seems to have decent value.</li>
            <li> I use a Braun self washing razor at home but not when I travel. Thus, I purchased the Philips for my shaving kit. It&#x27;s light, rugged, and gives a satisfactory shave. The charging cord seems flimsy and unlikely to hold up under repeated packing and repacking.</li>
            <li> This shaver is okay for a fairly good shave. It does not do a real close shave. Also, it did not come with a cover or plastic protector for the cutters.</li>
            <li> My husbands norelco of many years died a few months back and he was heart broken. We went looking but almost died ourselves at the price most places wanted for a new one. This one is sorta on the low end of the price range but it does what my husband wants it to and he hasn&#x27;t had to gharge it yet and he&#x27;s had it for over a month now. Great shaver.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver. It has reduced the time I spend shaving significantly and is capable of giving a full and complete shave. You can shave right after getting out of a shower with no diminished performance. The battery holds its charge for over a week. (Thats the longest I went without charging it. it has never died on me) The lack of a low batter light is no disadvantage since the battery lasts so long. I occasionally put the shaver on the charger and it never dies. I fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Lets&#x27;s just keep it simple.  The 7810XL is a darn good product.  I have two just to ovbviate the need to carry one whenever I am in either my summer home or winter home.  There is no need to spend money on top of the line Norelco shaving systems.  Given the Norelco product history I suggest that this model will be discontinued shortly if it has not been discontinued by now.  But this unit if you are looking for an inexpensive effective Norelco electric razor.  It&#x27;s as good as their top of the line units.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s day. He always cut himself with a razor no matter how careful he was. He loves it. And the shave is much smoother than I ever thought it would be. Would buy again, great product for the money!</li>
            <li> Still a year later the razor is working well.  This razor is so  well liked we have recommended this to others.</li>
            <li> The best razor ever ! .Bought this one as a gift but I have had one for about five years just replaced the heads good as new.Close shave does not  irradiate skin. Holds charge. Great razor, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I picked this up as my first electric shaver. I&#x27;ve always just used a traditional Gillette razor over the years (most recently, the Mach4). I decided that it was just getting obscenely ridiculous with how much companies like Gillette are charging for replacement razor cartridges, so I gave this a shot. It took some time to get used to it but this product works pretty well. Norelco, as I understand it, is pretty much the only brand to go with. It&#x27;s easy to use and is easily cleaned.    My only complaint is that to me, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it holds a charge for as long as is advertised. Aside from that, though, it&#x27;s a good shaver and while it&#x27;s not some super-expensive-awesome model, it does the trick. Especially if it&#x27;s your first one. The initial cost of buying the shaver itself is significant (in comparison with a regular old razor blade), but over time I can really see how this will save money and be just as effective.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my other Norelco razor, more expensive one, which was good but battery wasn&#x27;t charging anymore and blades getting dull after one year of use. Since it costs a lot to replace them I&#x27;ve decided to get another one razor. Norelco razors are very quiet so I prefer them to other brands. This razor battery lasted for about 10 days after full charge but shaving is not very close. I&#x27;ll get stubble in afternoon after shaving in the morning and it takes many rounds of shaving the same place. With my previous model it would last until next morning and less passes over my face.  Otherwise it&#x27;s fine razor, good for everyday use and after battery and blades will start to wear off I&#x27;ll just get a new one again. When I need a really good shave I use my old one using electric cord:)</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have owned.  It:  * Holds a charge for an amazing 24 days  * Shaves very quickly  * Cleans up easily (either dry w/ the enclosed brush or w/ water)  * Charges quickly (1 hour)  * Light weight  The only con is that the pop-up trimmer is not as good as other shavers I have owned, but I use a beard trimmer for such things anyway.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband.  He loves it.  Recharges nicely.  Lasts long.  And most of all, it shaves nice and close.</li>
            <li> Razor works really well, is easy to hold, and gets the job done. The only thing I noticed is that is difficult to get every spot.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a Remington model that died and I could not be more satisfied with this Norelco. It shaves closer, is much quieter, and is still running on the original charge after 3 weeks. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> A long lasting battery charge and close shave make this excellent. I have used this shaver with 3-year-old blades to clean up stubble left from a shave with a new Panasonic. After a single charge it seems to go on forever. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. He&#x27;s quite happy with it- says it&#x27;s very good with his tough beard. He&#x27;d buy another if &amp; when he needs a new one.</li>
            <li> I got my first Norelco in Germany in 1954 and have use them since. Got the 7810 model because it was made in Holland, not China and was a $20 off sale. It has Li-Ion battery but still needs to use until runs out and then recharge. When that happens you can wait a few second and turn on and use for a short time or plug it in, use and then leave pugged to recharge - take about an hour and has flashing light when done. First charge takes a long time. Hot water wash is nice - I rest mine on the heads so water drains off.</li>
            <li> I bought the Norelco 7810XL shaver in 2009 and it is my favorite model ever. The one hour full charge and that you can clean it with water are important qualities to me. So i just bought a second one on amazon since their newer models don&#x27;t sound as good as the 7810XL.</li>
            <li> I taught myself to shave, and grew up with multiblade cartridges and electric shavers like this one. For what it is, the Norelco 7810 does a good job. It holds a charge for months, and gets a relatively close cut on my face without nicks and without any type of cream, paste, gel, oil, or other lubricant. I use it when on military maneuvers with the National Guard. We often spend time in a field environment without running water or mirrors and I&#x27;m still expected to have a reasonably hair free face. Having said that, electric shavers are not my shaving device of choice. Rather, I prefer a double edge blade in an old-fashioned heavy handle. If you have the time to pamper your face, do some reading and consider purchasing a DE system instead. Your shave will be closer than you&#x27;ve ever had, and your face will thank you. New shaving systems are designed to be fast, easy and profitable for the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they just don&#x27;t measure up to the old ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:1463595344 Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving - Fifth Edition: Shaving Made Enjoyable]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000JPKLUU Merkur \\&quot;Futur\\&quot; Safety Razor, Satin Finish]]</li>
            <li> I just got my first electric shaved in the mail and  tried it out ...I like it so far don&#x27;t love it because I had to go over my face like 6xs to get all my hairs ...I wet my face first but maybe I just try it dry ...good product...not great disappointed ...but will update my review</li>
            <li> This shaver does *exactly* what I want it to.  It gives a quick, close shave, with no pulling.  It&#x27;s quiet.  It&#x27;s light.  And, it&#x27;s very easy to clean under running water.</li>
            <li> The razor had a bad battery or motor.&lt;br /&gt;I got only 6 shaves when they say 15.&lt;br /&gt;Called Company and was told the problem.&lt;br /&gt;They returned the money and I bought one at Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;Easier to return. This review is not about Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is a great place to buy. The razor was not up to par.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with Norelco for most of my life and I have always gotten good performance and long life from their shavers. I opted for the 7810 model because it charges more quickly than the cheaper model. I read some reviews that said that this one shaves better but I find that hard to believe since they both use the same cutter heads according to Norelco. I find the shave close and comfortable, although I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard. This model is also quieter than my old model. So I get a good shave without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this razor as it shaves close and comfortable. It is even better than the last more expensive Norelco model.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this and LOVE it!! It holds a charge for 2 weeks-nice!!! I use it on my legs and LOVE it! It does a great job and was worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I find many of these reviews to be asinine in that they either expect something for nothing or they break it then blame Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Norelco razor to shave with and I got a Norelco razor to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 23,2012......&lt;br /&gt;WOW!!!!! I just today recharged this razor for the very first time. That&#x27;s right...7 months on the first charge....incredible!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a xmas gift for my boyfriend two years ago, and I STILL have not had to buy a replacement razor head. It works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for a little over a year now and have continued to be impressed by it.  First and foremost, it does a good job shaving.  As others have noted, it is quick, quiet, and cuts the hair to a good length (if I want a closer shave or if I skip shaving for a few days, that&#x27;s what my standalone razor is for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this model (and apparently its successor) excels is in the features. The ability to operate in a corded mode is key.  The charge seems to run out halfway through a shave, so I just plug it in and continue... it takes all of 10 seconds for me to get out the cord, plug it in, and resume.  I&#x27;m not sure why many of the other models do not have this feature, since it means that I don&#x27;t need to continually recharge the battery for fear of it running out mid-shave.  Cleanup is easy as well; I like to brush out the unit each day (no issues with the brushes), but the water option is nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing missing from my perspective is a case to hold the shaver and brushes.  Fortunately, I had one from my previous unit, but that&#x27;s the main thing that I see as missing.</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave for an electric razor. Has metal heads rather than these new ones with plastic heads that fall out all the time.</li>
            <li> Sorry Philips/Norelco - not a fan anymore.  I purchased TWO Philips/Norelco shavers in the past year and was sorely disappointed in both.  This one in particular gives NO warning that it&#x27;s about to die.  Very unhappy - and this one wasn&#x27;t cheap.  I ended up finally switching to a Remington and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> it works well and had no problems.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. the shipping was fast and I am completely satisfied. I need to order a new cord for it from them now as I think I threw the old one away last week. Oops.</li>
            <li> Feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  No indication of when it&#x27;s going to run out of battery power.  I wonder if it&#x27;s authentic.  Hmmm....</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my husband and he loves it. Over the years, he has had several made by Philips and they last for a very long time. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Todo estuvo bien. El producto es el que solicité. Es un producto de calidad y muy funcional. Lo recomiendo. Llegó en el plazo esperado.</li>
            <li> Shaver came charged and worked like a charm until that initial charge died. After that my dead shaver would not charge, not sure if its the actual charger or the shaver, either way it&#x27;s a total waste. I feel screwed out of my 50$.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Norelco.  My lasted one lasted almost 10 years.  They stopped making replacement heads so I purchased this one.  Great razor.  Smooth shave with no pulling of hair.  I do not use it as a wet razor so I don&#x27;t know how well that feature works.  It cuts weekend stubble like hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they switch the flip direction of the trimmer ( sideburn cutter) and it collapses (try&#x27;s to shut) when you use an upward motion.  If not for that I would have given it 5 stars.  First charge on the battery lasted 3 weeks of shaving every day Monday through Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the easy cleanup with the faucet.</li>
            <li> Shaving with an electric razor is all new to me, I have been using a regular razor for 35 years! This razor is almost as good as manually shaving, I love it!! Quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I had been using the same razor for about 7 years and really liked it, but something broke on a recent trip and I had to replace it.  My dad uses this Norelco and thought I might like it too.  Great razor and price!  Very quite and good close shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this so I don&#x27;t have to pack a charger when we go on vacation. I did a test to see how long it will last, It did at least 25 shaves on one charge so that exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I found the same brand same specifications at much lower price at Walmart. same price or less for a higher level of  same band at walmart.</li>
            <li> I love Norelco and have used them for 50+ years.  Never had a problem with them, but this one tends to leak wisker clippings spilling them onto my clothing as I shave.  I&#x27;m going to contact the manufacturer to see what my recourse is.&lt;br /&gt;bill</li>
            <li> I have used norelco shavers since 1985 love them. They give close shave. This one is number 5 and love it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to maintain especially since it can be cleaned by simply washing the cutting heads. Great for quick charges</li>
            <li> I use it veryday！I use it veryday！I use it veryday！so i love it !i will tell my  friends to buy it!</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 7810XL Men&#x27;s Cutting System it is not that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dis not cut hair well or at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy.</li>
            <li> This exceeded my expectations. a great shave in very little time. It holds its charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> the new heads were too expensive.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is one of the best shavers I have bought. I purchaased the shaver because I had a Norelco previously.</li>
            <li> the Norelco 7810 is a good shaver. While it doesn&#x27;t warn you when it is near time to charge, it does have a very long battery life between charges.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my father and my father likes it very much!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in 2010. I use it every day for about 1-3 minutes. The battery lasts at least 2-3 weeks after a full charge (about 15-30 minutes). I have not even changed the blade and it is still sharp and no issues whatsoever mechanically or quality wise. It&#x27;s lightweight, waterproof, easy to clean and can be used dry or wet. It comes with a travel pouch and a 120/220V charger. I can&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> First I have tried electric razors in the past. Very good ones, Braun to be exact, cause I heard all good things about them. And all though the foil razors cut they did not get all of the growth and I had irritation after. In comes this one and I am amazed at how good it&#x27;s working. Low noise,some have complained its loud but I&#x27;m not. Easy to clean,my gosh just run it under warm water and maybe use the brush that comes with it. I found the trimmer to work too. Anyone who had given up on using electric razors. I would say try this one and youll be amazed. A close shave can be had, not as close as a regular one mind you but close enough. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Sturdy. Shave is great. Close cut Highly recommend this shaver. The trimmer is a great feature also.</li>
            <li> This is a good budget electric razor. It shaves close enough, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is really important. I think it&#x27;s good value for the money, and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for a couple of years now and really enjoyed it. It shaves well and the rechargeable battery is really strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to buy one today as a gift and am disappointed to find it discontinued with amazon.com. I bought it at $65 and don&#x27;t want to spend $100 or so with a third-party seller.</li>
            <li> Needed a shaver. Saw this one and read about it and the reviews. It does a great job and holds the charge for quite a long time... about two weeks!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it....could value, great price.....Easy to use, recharges quickly.  Great shave, couldn&#x27;t as for more.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have purchased it.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Norelco over 30 years ago, and loved it.  Eventually it stopped working and I have been struggling to find a decent replacement ever since.  I even went to a Braun for awhile, but the foil guards kept breaking and at $15 a pop I had soon spent more on them than I had on the razor!  The replacement Norelco I tried at $35 gave me terrible razor burn, and left horrible red welts all over my neck.  I went back to using a safety razor for the last ten to fifteen years.  Then I saw a $70 Norelco on sale on Amazon, and I figured it had to be a quality item.  It had to be much better than the cheap $35 razor I had tried many years ago.  I was so wrong.  This $70 razor shaves no differently.  It literally rubs my face RAW.  I thought maybe I was going over my face too many times or too hard, so after a few days I tried it again, going over each area only once and using the lightest touch possible.  Stray hairs were left behind, and my skin was still left with red welts.  It took three days for the welts to heal.  I tried a third time, this time carefully stretching the skin tight and shaving one small area at a time, with the same results. Shaving with this Norelco was like washing my face with coarse sandpaper.  I was forced to return it.  The $35 model didn&#x27;t work.  The $70 model also didn&#x27;t work.  So just how much money does Norelco expect you to pay to get a basic shave?</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this shaver. It gives a close shave, and the shape fits well in my hand. If you can overcome the following caveats, then you will be fine with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the description claims, \\&quot;...one-hour full charge offers up to 17 days of cordless shaving.\\&quot; I get about 8 days. That&#x27;s far better than the 2 shaves I got from an 8 hour charge on old shaver. I realize it says, \\&quot;...up to 17...,\\&quot; but half the advertised shaves is a little disappointing. My 14 year old son could probably get 17 days out of it. Again, it is far better than my previous shaver, so I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second complaint is outright annoying to me. My previous Norelco shaver had a red low battery light. If there was no red light, then I had at least one shave left. If the red light came on, then I could usually finish my last shave. This one just stops with no warning. I have to keep a head count of my total shaves. My head count has some history of malfunctioning (can&#x27;t blame Norelco for that). I really miss that red light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old shaver slowed near the end of the charge, but this one does not. That would be a positive, but without a low battery light, I cannot even rely on a slowing motor to know the battery is low. Can you tell I miss that low battery light?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way I shave while riding a transit bus to work. I cannot use the five minute quick charge option for just one more shave.</li>
            <li> I had a foil razor for a few years, but it just got annoying having to charge it every week.  On top of that, my 5 o&#x27; clock shadow was pretty noticeable.  I looked for other razors and came across this Norelco 7810.  This is my first Norelco, but I am pleased with it so far.  It charges in an hour and has an indicator to let you know when it&#x27;s done.  During my first shave, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was running or not because it was so quiet.  When I put it against my face, I could see it was actually working.  I like how the razor contours to my face, especially under my chin, which I used to always have problems with.  There are little stubs left here and there, but other than that, not much to complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for some time. This is my third, replacing my previous one, which couldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and was less effective even when plugged in. Very happy with the way it works. Good shave, and the trimmer seems to be more effective than on previous models. I dock it one star because it&#x27;s all plastic and we&#x27;ll see how it holds up. It&#x27;s noticeably lighter than the previous model.</li>
            <li> My son convinced me to get this product. He said to stay with it for a few weeks as my beard needed time to get used to being shaved this way. That sounded silly to me and made no sense. Well here I am several months later and I&#x27;m never going back to a blade again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product gives me a close shave with no bleeding and no ingrown hairs. The trimmer works well and the whole thing is easy to clean. A couple of people commented on the noise factor: They must be kidding. Nice product at a nice price giving me a nice shave. Yeah.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric razor for about 6 years. When the battery went bad and I knew I had to replace it, I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t find one as good. Well, this razor is not only as good- but is better than the old one.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts longer hairs way better, it is quieter and lighter. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for some time now and the battery life is quite good.  No complaints with the shave quality.</li>
            <li> Great razor, charges quick, close shave!</li>
            <li> MY older one was so nice , Just wish it stilled worked this one has many problems and I am ready to pitch it.</li>
            <li> I have an old Philips that I purchased in France on 2005, so I wanted a change and I got this shaver, it is very hard to clean it each time after a shave and also this thing is not build for someone like me with a heavy set of facial hair.</li>
            <li> This shaver does an ok job but I seem to have to go over some parts of my face repeatedly to get all the hairs.  It also doesn&#x27;t give you a warning when the battery is almost dead.</li>
            <li> My husband has consistently used this brand and style of shaver for many years!  He has tried others and not been happy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product with no concerns for over a year. This is not an electric plucker but provides a smooth comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Very good object and it works well, We would gladly recommend I would advise my friends to buy it .</li>
            <li> The gentleman I bought it for really likes it. It gives a great shave and is always charged and ready to go.</li>
            <li> already being an owner/user of this brand/model of shaver made the purchasing of it relatively easy. just needed an additional shaver for travelling needs and knew this was the one I needed. received purchase in less than one week, so everything was as expected. longtime shopper on amazon and have never had a negative thing to say on anything.</li>
            <li> This shaver is much better than the previous model of Norelco shaver, and it is easy to clean.  The cut is smooth, and it gets close to the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok....blades dull too fast.</li>
            <li> Thus far, no problems whatsoever. The battery holds a charge f0r many days and the shave is smooth No complaints...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t</li>
            <li> pleasantly pleased-  afraid it would&#x27;t be as good a shave as my very old one. It is light weight and very close shave.  The floating heads make it better than the old one.</li>
            <li> Been a Norelco shaver user for over 25 yrs; this model, with no bells and whistles, does what it made to do : give a close shave at a value.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco shaver as a gift and my son is really happy with it. I had it shipped next day and it got there when it was supposed to!</li>
            <li> I have used my Norelco for several years without a problem, other than the usual maintenance and blade replacements.  Batteries continue to charge without problem.  This is an all around good product.</li>
