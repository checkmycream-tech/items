            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to take better care of my hair.</li>
            <li>This comb works great on wet hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>But then again, I have pretty tangly hair!</li>
            <li>It glides right use the tangles, with out tearing your hair.&lt;br</li>

            <li>If this significantly occurs, you then have to cut the whole beard back.  </li>
            <li>Of course the other good investments for facial hair growth is Grapeseed Oil, Argon Oil, Acure Argon Oil Shampoo and Conditioner and a Berkey shower filter to limit the exposure to chlorine, which is the main cause for hair breakage.</li>
            <li>This comb is well worth it because of the long teeth and staggered teeth that you can&#x27;t see from the picture.</li>
            <li>Most combs pull facial hair out and it takes a real long time to grow it back.</li>
            <li>I have found a better product since (keratin complex wave brush) for detangles.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and curly... very easy to get tangled and not only hard to detangle</li>
            <li>I ran it through my hair and it seemed to work a little better than an average come</li>
            <li>Small combs don&#x27;t work and big combs are only a little better.</li>

            <li> Conair needs to reposition the target market for this comb to also include the long beard segment.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I have never seen a comb actually fluff up a beard to make it look almost double the volume like this comb.  </li>

            <li> this is the BEST comb to use for tangles</li>
            <li> best thing I have found to untangle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this comb! I used it last night to detangle my hair and it was a breeze. I slathered my hair with conditioner and detangled in the shower under running water. I&#x27;m currently 20+ weeks post relaxer and I have thick 4B/4C hair. I&#x27;m used to detangling my hair a few times in order to get the desired results. I was looking for anything to cut frizz, that&#x27;s what my leave ins are for. In terms of detangling, though, this comb did the job!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it said it was a detangling comb and would reduce frizz. I have very thick curly/wavy hair. When my hair is wet (even after a deep conditioning treatment) the comb doesn&#x27;t go through my hair very well. If you have thick curly hair I do not recommend this comb! I also did not see a difference in frizz either :(</li>
            <li> It came the earliest that was predicted to come which was awesome! I ran it through my hair and it seemed to work a little better than an average come (my hair is 4b) My only problems are i wish i knew what color i was gonna get i suppose i miss read it, but i wish u had the color option mine was blue. And the come is like not flat the teeth sort of bend which is fine, its what makes it detangling, but the photo was pretty misleading.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t detangle to well. I was hoping for a better comb. The teeth on it are intertwined so it was difficult to untangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair that gets tangled so easily that I have to wash my hair in sections to avoid knots. Small combs don&#x27;t work and big combs are only a little better. But I must say that this comb works.</li>
            <li> This comb is well worth it because of the long teeth and staggered teeth that you can&#x27;t see from the picture. The teeth are are larger than ordinary combs as you should expect given that it is supposed to imitate finger detangling.</li>
            <li> if you have: thick, curly, frizzy, nappy hair this is the comb for you! my personal regiment i use a little bit of motions brand hair lotion a little bit of water and this comb and i am set for the day.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and curly... very easy to get tangled and not only hard to detangle but it looks frizz when I do it.&lt;br /&gt;I got a comb just like this about  20 years ago and fell in love with it. I eventually lost it and could not find one for a long time. Until I finally saw it at Walmart and got 2.&lt;br /&gt;Love it love it love it... It makes it so easy to detangle and my hair doesn&#x27;t look bad at all after I finish.</li>
            <li> This is the only come I can get through my hair. The ast one lasted 30yrs before the dog got go it</li>
            <li> This comb is easy to hold on to and it works great.  My hair is long, to the middle of my back, and this comb is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I bought it for. Combing my ridiculously long hair when wet. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair.  Like this comb.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair, and a lot of it. This comb works great on wet hair. It glides right use the tangles, with out tearing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It even works on beach hair. Gotta love that.</li>
            <li> Great for thick course hair</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t down vote items...but this just did not work as I wanted it to for my curly hair. It detangles but at the price of ripping out a ton of my hair.</li>
            <li> The reviews made this thing out to be something it was kinda close to. I have found a better product since (keratin complex wave brush) for detangles. But then again, I have pretty tangly hair!</li>
            <li> use this on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> I natural 4c hair all the other combs I used hurt my scalp and broke my hair of but this comb is wonderful. Happy customer. Love this comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to take better care of my hair. Until I got this a couple weeks ago, I had not brushed my hair in over a year. I washed daily and combed with my fingers in the shower but I needed something that would help shape my curls because my mane was out of control. My hair now has tight, semi-contained curls now. Great comb.</li>
            <li> After years of hairdressers telling me combs are healthier for your hair than brushes I finally gave in! I started researching different types of combs and came across this beauty. My hair is very thick which makes it really painful to brush through, but with this amazing detangling tool I never let out an ow! Perfect for my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Conair needs to reposition the target market for this comb to also include the long beard segment.  Most combs pull facial hair out and it takes a real long time to grow it back. If this significantly occurs, you then have to cut the whole beard back.  This comb is by far, the best beard comb on the market. It does not pull hair out. In addition, I have never seen a comb actually fluff up a beard to make it look almost double the volume like this comb.  Of course the other good investments for facial hair growth is Grapeseed Oil, Argon Oil, Acure Argon Oil Shampoo and Conditioner and a Berkey shower filter to limit the exposure to chlorine, which is the main cause for hair breakage.</li>
