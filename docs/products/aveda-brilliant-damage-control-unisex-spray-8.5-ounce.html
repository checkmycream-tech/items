            <li>but I&amp;#34;m trying to let my hair grow out), if you have healthy hair but want protection I would use this every other wash to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>And it has that old witch hazel smell.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few products I even use in my hair besides Moroccan oil/spray, the Aveda Light Elements serum and the Aveda Controlforce hair spray.</li>
            <li>I spray it on right after I towel dry my hair and then blow dry.</li>

            <li> Great product for strengthening hair</li>
            <li> excellen, have used for years!</li>
            <li> This product arrived with a piece of tape over the spray nozzle to protect the bottle from leaking. Great purchase!</li>

            <li> The item I ordered was not the one I received.  After many attempts to have the correct order sent to me, I have given up.  Will not purchase anything from Life N Life again!!!</li>

            <li> This stuff is really amazing, smells wonderful and you simply can&#x27;t use too much of it! I have very thick hair and it really helps protect the ends, especially after lots and lots of hot blow drying and processing. It also helps make my hair shiny and smooth which is a nice added bonus! I would highly recommend using this after every wash if you are trying to let you hair recover from damage (my ends were particularly bad but I&amp;#34;m trying to let my hair grow out), if you have healthy hair but want protection I would use this every other wash to make it last longer.</li>

            <li> Smells lovely and gives my hair nice volume if I spray it on when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I use it as a detangler and it works for that nicely.</li>
            <li> must have for hair. use after showering as a detangler and before blowdrying to minimize breakage damage and heat damage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an aveda junkie and have been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> I hope the product works as described.  I bought it primarily for UV protection.  So far so good but the scent is not to my liking.  I can&#x27;t describe it but to me it&#x27;s a mix between men&#x27;s BO and a musky cologne to cover it up.</li>
            <li> I love alot of Aveda products and this is one of them. It lightly conditions my hair on the days when I only need light coverage. It also smells great! I spray it on right after I towel dry my hair and then blow dry. This is my 4th bottle.</li>

This Adds beautiful volume  to my hair  makes it smooth shiny and smells great. It&#x27;s non greasy and ever since I&#x27;ve added this into my hair regiment I&#x27;ve seen inches grow right before my eyes!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( BTW I have thick natural curly/wavy color treated hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best use with this product I recommended towel drying for about 10min then air drying until barely damp (so it&#x27;s less heat used when blow drying) then applying an even and generous amount for best heat protection then blow drying with a brush then straightening/styling as desired.</li>

            <li> Good job speeding a very good product to me.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Before I write my review, I just want to point at that, as of this writing, this product can be purchased at an Aveda store or salon for $18.95.  I have no idea where they came up with the pricing on this, but the current pricing of $25.99 is ridiculous, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t retail for $83.99.&lt;br /&gt;That being said; I color my hair every 6 weeks and have quite a few gray hairs.  I try not to over wash my hair, but there are still the effects of the sun, and blow drying to contend with. The damage control spray does a great job of protecting my hair from color fade, and helps to maintain the color between coloring times.</li>
            <li> Works really well for blow-drying on 4c natural hair.</li>
