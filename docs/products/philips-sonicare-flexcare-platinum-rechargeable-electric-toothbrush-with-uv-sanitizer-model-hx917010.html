            <li>Love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>However, now that I have both in hand to compare, I realized I like the Plus much better!</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t return my Plus before getting the Platinum to compare!</li>
            <li>(make sure you order the newer version of the Plus that has the backlit display!)</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Most awesome way to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I liked the first two, but this one is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Works amazing.</li>
            <li>Also with the UV light and cover it&#x27;s been a great investment for my teeth and gum health.</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the cheaper, and probably the cheapest electric toothbrushes are just as good.</li>
            <li>Wonderful electric tooth brush unit with what we love the UV light germ killing light .</li>
            <li>I found the Live Chat to be excellent.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased!  </li>
            <li>Love the way my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li>What pleased me was that the speed could be adjusted while brushing and the settings are remembered between sessions.  </li>
            <li>I love the Flexcare Platinum.  </li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush</li>
            <li>love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my Sonicare Elite, which I had for many years, but it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li>You can you most of the sonicare heads for this device.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the latest model.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the latest model (the one sold on the Sonicare website), which is 9170/10.  </li>
            <li>latest</li>
            <li>This is my third electric toothbrush, and it&#x27;s the best yet.</li>
            <li>I like the rubber much better</li>
            <li>You can use the better brush heads like DiamondClean or InterCare on the Plus model too.</li>
            <li>However, I have a feeling that it cleans better between teeth...</li>
            <li>Though, for the surface of your teeth, sonicare cleans way better.    </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s ok to just use a manual brush, but his is a brush that will make you life much much more easier.</li>
            <li>This is very powerful and even after one use there is an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>My teeth were that clean after just two minutes of just brushing!</li>
            <li>- is the closest thing to professional teeth cleaning I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I went yesterday and it is the first time in 5 years they said my teeth looked good and that I was on the right track!</li>
            <li>Bought this along with a pack of the 3 diamond clean brush heads for the better cleaning power than the brush heads included with the unit.</li>
            <li>I love knowing the head is clean each time I use it, too.</li>
            <li>Love the sanitize part also for clean tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Does an amazing job of getting my teeth super clean</li>
            <li>I really liked the first two --</li>
            <li>/&gt;The UV light?  </li>
            <li>The quality and cleaning capability of the Elite was far superior to Flexcare Platinum.</li>
            <li>All together, about $10 worth of parts!</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time in original package.</li>
            <li>A great item with many features a little pricey though</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth tingling and feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>A great product - cleans extremely well, convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Never have my teeth felt so clean.</li>
            <li>I found that there were settings for clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth are SO much more clean and it removed far more plaque and build-up than I knew was even there.</li>
            <li>I can always tell when my teeth are clean, because I can feel the difference in the perceived space between my front teeth after brushing and flossing by testing it with my tongue.</li>
            <li>feel so clean</li>
            <li>Charge lasts a long time - plenty for two people - great product - incredibly satisfied and I highly highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The product also has a timer for brushing teeth, which is cool.</li>
            <li>but I like using full power so this won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Timer is good, but I don&#x27;t feel 2 minutes is enough...</li>
            <li>Unit works super in all modes.</li>
            <li>I tried switching the brushes to make sure I didn&#x27;t get a defective brush head, and every brush I attached still made the toothbrush operation very loud!</li>
            <li>I love the enclosed UV unit for tooth brush heads as opposed to the new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cheaper, higher advertised rpm brushes, but they don&#x27;t even compare in any way to the Sonicare!  </li>
            <li>The Flexcare Platinum is so much louder when turned on!!</li>
            <li>It cleans better than my old model and won&#x27;t trap water in the brush.</li>
            <li>It has different settings for the kind of brushing you want/need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People complain about the price but even if this only prevents 1 cavity then you have pretty much made a wise investment.  </li>
            <li>Just right for packing in a toiletries bag.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned that the battery takes 24 hours to charge the first time it’s used, but once charged is good for around 30x brushing sessions, so if you’re going on a trip for several days you shouldn’t need to pack the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: very stylish, very effective, lots of nice features but at the current price, rather expensive when compared to earlier Sonicare models.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re going to love it&amp;#34;... She apparently uses one herself and said there&#x27;s nothing else like it.</li>
            <li>It is important to maintain normal mouth flora.  </li>
            <li>or so I began visiting the dentist regularly and taking better care of my teeth, which included buying a Sonicare Elite.  </li>
            <li>over rated is funny</li>
            <li>leave out in open  top model they now have.</li>
            <li>The cost is significantly higher, so I presumed the quality would be higher as well.</li>
            <li>Had an Oral B, which was OK, and an earlier Sonicare model.</li>
            <li>I would buy product again brushes very well!</li>
            <li>Turns out the model sent has been discontinued for more than 2 years so currently in the process of jumping through hoops to try to get Philips to honor the warranty.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after my first use.</li>
            <li>They might feel good, but they won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Have noticed a huge difference between this toothbrush and the regular electric toothbrush I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointing in the slightest, in fact, I am surprised at just how much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The operation is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Even my gums are stronger thanks to the gum care setting.</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth so much cleaner, and it feels like I just had a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>In addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth, ‘Sonicare’ electric toothbrushes utilise ultrasonic cleaning, as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments.</li>
            <li>but if you’re on a budget, wait for the price to come down – which it surely will.</li>
            <li>This is the older version/model of  HX9170/10.&lt;br /&gt;HX9110/02:  </li>
            <li>Does not have the UV sanitizer  feature and is an older model (I did not ask what model replaced</li>
            <li>Instead I received the older version, which is 9181/10.  </li>
            <li>I always do hours and hours of research when making just about any purchase, and this came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Sonicare Flexcare</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The product offers different settings: clean, whitening, gum.</li>
            <li>was especially glad it had the hard brushing indicator since I tend to be a hard brusher.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t take very good care of my teeth when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to go ahead and upgrade, instead of buying new heads.  </li>
            <li>My wife LOVES her new toothbrush, and comes up with reasons to go brush again.</li>
            <li>Time to find a new brand.</li>
            <li>I had expected some of these features but the overall experience is better than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, but if I&#x27;m buying a new product, I like to have the latest model.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding technology in a tooth brush without going overboard.</li>
            <li>Even after the first use I could tell my teeth were cleaner than with a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Sonic are brush back in 2002.</li>
            <li>, what does matter is how loud it is with a brush attached!</li>
            <li>On the Platinum model it is all dark gray inside while the Plus has all chrome inside that reflects the UV light all around the brush, not just the front.</li>
            <li>I then bought a new one, a Flexcare Professional model.</li>
            <li>I listed the features I was looking for (sensitive brushing mode, pressure sensor, adjustable Intensity settings &amp; UV sanitizer).  </li>
            <li>I recommend contacting Philips Sonicare directly.  </li>
            <li>My gingivitis cleared up completely within two months of using this.</li>
            <li>old Sonicare Elite was still working</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, these are usually near a sink--bacteria end up being airborne from washing hands, flushing toilets, etc.  </li>
            <li>Philips Sonic are toothbrushes have gone WAY, WAY, DOWNHILL as far as quality is concerned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li>determining whether you are looking at an older model, you cannot tell simply by the sequence of the numbers.  </li>
            <li>Last unit lasted 5-6 years before giving out so well worth money in long run</li>
            <li>A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned properly.</li>
            <li>You don’t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished.</li>
            <li>I have not had a new cavity since--this from someone who had multiple cavities in my 20s.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned about the new design, with the tiny metal post the brush heads mount on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only reason I spent so much money on the toothbrush - so much money that I would be embarrassed to tell anyone that I&#x27;d spent so much for a toothbrush for any reason.</li>
            <li>Definitely not worth the price paid when you can get a new one for only a few dollars more directly from the company.</li>
            <li>Cleans like no other .</li>
            <li>If you turn the intensity level down it gets pretty quiet</li>
            <li>I was really interested in the UV sanitizer, which means the brushes are less likely to harbor germs.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it lasts as long as the old one.</li>
            <li>powerful, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>We’ve used other electric toothbrushes which are promoted as ‘sonic’ in the product description, but few of them actually deploy genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It has different settings for the kind of brushing you want/need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People complain about the price but even if this only prevents 1 cavity then you have pretty much made a wise investment.  </li>
            <li> Just right for packing in a toiletries bag.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned that the battery takes 24 hours to charge the first time it’s used, but once charged is good for around 30x brushing sessions, so if you’re going on a trip for several days you shouldn’t need to pack the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: very stylish, very effective, lots of nice features but at the current price, rather expensive when compared to earlier Sonicare models.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going to love it&amp;#34;... She apparently uses one herself and said there&#x27;s nothing else like it.</li>
            <li> It is important to maintain normal mouth flora.  </li>
            <li> or so I began visiting the dentist regularly and taking better care of my teeth, which included buying a Sonicare Elite.  </li>
            <li> over rated is funny</li>
            <li> leave out in open  top model they now have.</li>
            <li> The cost is significantly higher, so I presumed the quality would be higher as well.</li>
            <li> Had an Oral B, which was OK, and an earlier Sonicare model.</li>
            <li> I would buy product again brushes very well!</li>
            <li> Turns out the model sent has been discontinued for more than 2 years so currently in the process of jumping through hoops to try to get Philips to honor the warranty.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after my first use.</li>
            <li> They might feel good, but they won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a huge difference between this toothbrush and the regular electric toothbrush I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointing in the slightest, in fact, I am surprised at just how much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The operation is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Even my gums are stronger thanks to the gum care setting.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li> It gets my teeth so much cleaner, and it feels like I just had a cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> In addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth, ‘Sonicare’ electric toothbrushes utilise ultrasonic cleaning, as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments.</li>
            <li> but if you’re on a budget, wait for the price to come down – which it surely will.</li>
            <li> This is the older version/model of  HX9170/10.&lt;br /&gt;HX9110/02:  </li>
            <li> Does not have the UV sanitizer  feature and is an older model (I did not ask what model replaced</li>
            <li> Instead I received the older version, which is 9181/10.  </li>
            <li> I always do hours and hours of research when making just about any purchase, and this came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Sonicare Flexcare</li>
            <li> I highly recommend a sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The product offers different settings: clean, whitening, gum.</li>
            <li> was especially glad it had the hard brushing indicator since I tend to be a hard brusher.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t take very good care of my teeth when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to go ahead and upgrade, instead of buying new heads.  </li>
            <li> My wife LOVES her new toothbrush, and comes up with reasons to go brush again.</li>
            <li> Time to find a new brand.</li>
            <li> I had expected some of these features but the overall experience is better than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, but if I&#x27;m buying a new product, I like to have the latest model.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding technology in a tooth brush without going overboard.</li>
            <li> Even after the first use I could tell my teeth were cleaner than with a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Sonic are brush back in 2002.</li>
            <li> , what does matter is how loud it is with a brush attached!</li>
            <li> On the Platinum model it is all dark gray inside while the Plus has all chrome inside that reflects the UV light all around the brush, not just the front.</li>
            <li> I then bought a new one, a Flexcare Professional model.</li>
            <li> I listed the features I was looking for (sensitive brushing mode, pressure sensor, adjustable Intensity settings &amp; UV sanitizer).  </li>
            <li> I recommend contacting Philips Sonicare directly.  </li>
            <li> My gingivitis cleared up completely within two months of using this.</li>
            <li> old Sonicare Elite was still working</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, these are usually near a sink--bacteria end up being airborne from washing hands, flushing toilets, etc.  </li>
            <li> Philips Sonic are toothbrushes have gone WAY, WAY, DOWNHILL as far as quality is concerned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li> determining whether you are looking at an older model, you cannot tell simply by the sequence of the numbers.  </li>
            <li> Last unit lasted 5-6 years before giving out so well worth money in long run</li>
            <li> A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned properly.</li>
            <li> You don’t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished.</li>
            <li> I have not had a new cavity since--this from someone who had multiple cavities in my 20s.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned about the new design, with the tiny metal post the brush heads mount on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only reason I spent so much money on the toothbrush - so much money that I would be embarrassed to tell anyone that I&#x27;d spent so much for a toothbrush for any reason.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price paid when you can get a new one for only a few dollars more directly from the company.</li>
            <li> Cleans like no other .</li>
            <li> If you turn the intensity level down it gets pretty quiet</li>
            <li> I was really interested in the UV sanitizer, which means the brushes are less likely to harbor germs.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it lasts as long as the old one.</li>
            <li> powerful, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> We’ve used other electric toothbrushes which are promoted as ‘sonic’ in the product description, but few of them actually deploy genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> although the last one did not last as long as it should have.  </li>
            <li> so in the long run this toothbrush will likely save you money--not to mention pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is expensive but my recent dentist appointment justified the cost.</li>
            <li> long lasting battery...easy cleaning and nearly no maintenance.</li>
            <li> Two brush heads are supplied (which incidentally do not fit earlier Sonicare models) and the brush has three speed settings and three modes, which might be too much choice for the average user to think about.</li>
            <li> The Plus has a backlit display that you could read in complete darkness, while the Platinum just has a bunch of small green LED&#x27;s with words printed on the handle (hard to read even in the light, let alone in the dark).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> The Plus on the other hand is a quiet hum.</li>
            <li> The pressure sensor was my main reason for wanting the Platinum model, but after using it I realized you had to push so freaking hard to get that pressure sensor to go off</li>
            <li> I would assume the brush overall would get cleaner with the reflective chrome mirror effect than with dark gray plastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really expected to like the Platinum better with the pressure sensor and intensity levels, but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m much less likely to drop the handle if my hands are wet.</li>
            <li> Now, a little over five months later, the UV function no longer works.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  </li>
            <li> The base is just big enough to hold the brush handle and does not include the UV light.  </li>
            <li> It makes the expensive cost well worth it since it is cheaper than a cavatity.</li>
            <li> but my other electric brush just kept on working.  </li>
            <li> Then there are three speeds, which I usually just it&#x27;s the the 3rd level which is the fastest.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with Amazon&#x27;s policies which clearly do not protect the consumer in any way against being ripped-off by unscrupulous suppliers.</li>
            <li> The charger broke less than a month after purchase.</li>
            <li> It lasted nearly ten years, only to finally die when the batteries went bad.</li>
            <li> Was expensive but if it lasts at least a few years than well worth it.</li>
            <li> So now, just a bit after the warranty expired, that little metal post broke.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with the Elite was that the size of the brush made it a bit difficult to reach the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the newer Sonic are brushes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, what I am trying to say is, if you have the patience to brush thoroughly and carefully everyday</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pointless for me to have this pressure sensor</li>
            <li> I use to always brush too hard, the device lets you if you are doing that too.</li>
            <li> I would never ever brush that hard</li>
            <li> really surprised me was the included travel case and charging base.  </li>
            <li> The controls and display are also very hard to read compared to the Plus model.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to brush my teeth with it because it&#x27;s so annoying, so it would actually discourage me to brush!</li>
            <li> some fail and some may weaken the tooth.  </li>
            <li> Now that I know how lousy Philips&#x27; return policy is - how lacking in confidence they are about the quality of their products - I will never buy another Philips product.</li>
            <li> When I travel for work I leave it at home since my wife also uses it and it drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the Platinum unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with the quality of this toothbrush.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the third Sonicare toothbrush I have owned.  I really liked the first two -- although the last one did not last as long as it should have.  Instead of researching to see if it might still be under warranty, I bought this one.  I could not be more pleased!  I liked the first two, but this one is awesome!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!!! This is the second time we purchased one. We recommend Philips Sonicare to everyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding technology in a tooth brush without going overboard. The gum/clean/whitening settings operate very effectively and the UV sanitizer is a great addition.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with a pack of the 3 diamond clean brush heads for the better cleaning power than the brush heads included with the unit. Works amazing. Even after the first use I could tell my teeth were cleaner than with a standard toothbrush. The brush heads never got shipped so I had to call Amazon to replace them. When the representative saw what I had ordered she said &amp;#34;ohhh you&#x27;re going to love it&amp;#34;... She apparently uses one herself and said there&#x27;s nothing else like it.</li>
            <li> When selecting a philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush, I came across different model numbers that seemed indistinguishable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I listed the features I was looking for (sensitive brushing mode, pressure sensor, adjustable Intensity settings &amp; UV sanitizer).  I then went to the Philips Sonicare website &amp; had an online  &amp;#34;Live Chat&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HX9170/10:  Is the current model with my desired features (see above).&lt;br /&gt;HX9181/10:  This is the older version/model of  HX9170/10.&lt;br /&gt;HX9110/02:  Does not have the UV sanitizer  feature and is an older model (I did not ask what model replaced it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In determining whether you are looking at an older model, you cannot tell simply by the sequence of the numbers.  As noted above, HX 9170 is newer than HX9181.  (As an aside,  the last two numbers, &amp;#34;/10&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;//02&amp;#34;, are simply regional codes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  I recommend contacting Philips Sonicare directly.  I found the Live Chat to be excellent.</li>
            <li> Great product and it has made a noticeable difference with hygiene.</li>
            <li> Works just as described.</li>
            <li> all i thought it would be</li>
            <li> Love the way my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li> Never have my teeth felt so clean. My gingivitis cleared up completely within two months of using this. I love knowing the head is clean each time I use it, too. Having the option to set it to tell me when to change quadrants while brushing is great</li>
            <li> Has everything it advertised.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.  No problems with the shipment or product.&lt;br /&gt;I was especially glad it had the hard brushing indicator since I tend to be a hard brusher.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  The operation is better than I expected.  I had wanted the Sonicare type of brush for sum time but my other electric brush just kept on working.  I finally decided to retire it and get this one.  I found that there were settings for clean. white and gum care in addition to speed.  What pleased me was that the speed could be adjusted while brushing and the settings are remembered between sessions.  The brush runs for 2 minutes with an audible announcement every 30 seconds.  I had expected some of these features but the overall experience is better than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really surprised me was the included travel case and charging base.  The base is just big enough to hold the brush handle and does not include the UV light.  Just right for packing in a toiletries bag.  The travel case is a rigid plastic with internal ridges to hold the brush handle and two brush heads.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t take very good care of my teeth when I was younger.  However, 7 years ago or so I began visiting the dentist regularly and taking better care of my teeth, which included buying a Sonicare Elite.  I have not had a new cavity since--this from someone who had multiple cavities in my 20s.  I don&#x27;t dread my cleanings/exams every 6 months.  My only complaint with the Elite was that the size of the brush made it a bit difficult to reach the back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old Sonicare Elite was still working but I wanted to go ahead and upgrade, instead of buying new heads.  I love the Flexcare Platinum.  It cleans better than my old model and won&#x27;t trap water in the brush. The heads are also smaller which allow me to reach my back teeth better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People complain about the price but even if this only prevents 1 cavity then you have pretty much made a wise investment.  Fillings aren&#x27;t perfect--some fail and some may weaken the tooth.  Eventually, they will have to be replaced--so in the long run this toothbrush will likely save you money--not to mention pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV light?  The majority of people have a good point.  It is important to maintain normal mouth flora.  However, I don&#x27;t see why you have to add bacteria from your toothbrush.  As others have mentioned, these are usually near a sink--bacteria end up being airborne from washing hands, flushing toilets, etc.  Hydrogen Peroxide works as others mentioned and is cheaper but I would question if this wouldn&#x27;t damage the brush fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with mine.  Hopefully it lasts as long as the old one.</li>
            <li> A great item with many features a little pricey though</li>
            <li> Philips sells the HX9170/10 for $199.00, how can Amazon allow this supplier to sell the identical product for $300.00? I am not pleased with Amazon&#x27;s policies which clearly do not protect the consumer in any way against being ripped-off by unscrupulous suppliers.</li>
            <li> powerful, but not overwhelming. great for 2 people...travel case is neat. long lasting battery...easy cleaning and nearly no maintenance. Good value... very happy.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a huge difference between this toothbrush and the regular electric toothbrush I have been using for years. My teeth are SO much more clean and it removed far more plaque and build-up than I knew was even there. Even my gums are stronger thanks to the gum care setting. This is very powerful and even after one use there is an amazing difference. I can always tell when my teeth are clean, because I can feel the difference in the perceived space between my front teeth after brushing and flossing by testing it with my tongue. My teeth were that clean after just two minutes of just brushing! Very impressed. I always do hours and hours of research when making just about any purchase, and this came highly recommended. I am not disappointing in the slightest, in fact, I am surprised at just how much I like this brush and how well is performs.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES her new toothbrush, and comes up with reasons to go brush again. I&#x27;m a hero for getting her this for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Good service! Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel great after every brush. Also with the UV light and cover it&#x27;s been a great investment for my teeth and gum health. Would recommend to anyone if you are thinking about purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Gift for husband he loves it ! I now use it !</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush . Cleans like no other . With this and a waterpik you will transform your mouth .</li>
            <li> over rated is funny how it has become a standard .. for almost 200 bucks you get a tooth brush .. hello</li>
            <li> love the toothbrush.  It makes me feel like I came from a dental cleaning every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Was expensive but if it lasts at least a few years than well worth it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful electric tooth brush unit with what we love the UV light germ killing light . I love the enclosed UV unit for tooth brush heads as opposed to the new leave out in open  top model they now have.Unit works super in all modes.Last unit lasted 5-6 years before giving out so well worth money in long run</li>
            <li> Philips Sonic are toothbrushes have gone WAY, WAY, DOWNHILL as far as quality is concerned. I bought my first Sonic are brush back in 2002. It lasted nearly ten years, only to finally die when the batteries went bad. I then bought a new one, a Flexcare Professional model. I was a bit concerned about the new design, with the tiny metal post the brush heads mount on. I bought it anyway. So now, just a bit after the warranty expired, that little metal post broke. It just flops around in the handle. Over $120 bucks (plus brush head costs), and it&#x27;s finished! I&#x27;ll never buy another Sonicrap brush. Time to find a new brand. I have opened these things up and looked inside, and trust me, there&#x27;s nothing in there to justify the cost. Just a battery and an oscillating motor. All together, about $10 worth of parts! This is the biggest scam going today. I&#x27;m sure the cheaper, and probably the cheapest electric toothbrushes are just as good. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the newer Sonic are brushes. They might feel good, but they won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with the quality of this toothbrush. I bought it to replace my Sonicare Elite, which I had for many years, but it would no longer hold a charge. The quality and cleaning capability of the Elite was far superior to Flexcare Platinum. The cost is significantly higher, so I presumed the quality would be higher as well. Not the case with this toothbrush and I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time in original package. The product offers different settings: clean, whitening, gum. Then there are three speeds, which I usually just it&#x27;s the the 3rd level which is the fastest. I use the 2nd level when I use the gum settings. The product also has a timer for brushing teeth, which is cool. I use to always go over 2 minutes. I use to always brush too hard, the device lets you if you are doing that too. You can you most of the sonicare heads for this device. It comes with a travel case and a smaller charger. I would recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Smiley World in May 2014.  This is NOT the latest model.  I thought I was getting the latest model (the one sold on the Sonicare website), which is 9170/10.  Instead I received the older version, which is 9181/10.  I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, but if I&#x27;m buying a new product, I like to have the latest model.  I&#x27;ll be returning this.</li>
            <li> In addition to the physical vibration of the bristles on the teeth, ‘Sonicare’ electric toothbrushes utilise ultrasonic cleaning, as used in hospital sterile service units to clean the gunk off surgical instruments. You don’t need to move or agitate the brush: just hold it to the teeth upper, lower, left, right, inside, outside then rinse when finished. A timer is incorporated which issues an audible signal every 30 seconds, repeated four times to ensure upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right areas are cleaned properly. We’ve used other electric toothbrushes which are promoted as ‘sonic’ in the product description, but few of them actually deploy genuine ultrasonic cleaning technology like these from Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This latest ‘FlexCare Platinum’ variant has an attractive contemporary-aesthetic design and looks like a work of art. Two brush heads are supplied (which incidentally do not fit earlier Sonicare models) and the brush has three speed settings and three modes, which might be too much choice for the average user to think about. It comes with carrying case and travel charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that the battery takes 24 hours to charge the first time it’s used, but once charged is good for around 30x brushing sessions, so if you’re going on a trip for several days you shouldn’t need to pack the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: very stylish, very effective, lots of nice features but at the current price, rather expensive when compared to earlier Sonicare models. My advice: a good choice but if you’re on a budget, wait for the price to come down – which it surely will.</li>
            <li> This is my third electric toothbrush, and it&#x27;s the best yet. Had an Oral B, which was OK, and an earlier Sonicare model. But this brush seems to vibrate even faster and does an excellent job. I was really interested in the UV sanitizer, which means the brushes are less likely to harbor germs.</li>
            <li> Most awesome way to clean your teeth. This is my third one..</li>
            <li> I would buy product again brushes very well! Cleans teeth amazing. Love the sanitize part also for clean tooth brush.</li>
            <li> A great product - cleans extremely well, convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Well made and works well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The charger broke less than a month after purchase. Turns out the model sent has been discontinued for more than 2 years so currently in the process of jumping through hoops to try to get Philips to honor the warranty. Definitely not worth the price paid when you can get a new one for only a few dollars more directly from the company.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! Stays charged forever. Cleans teeth really well.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush over ever used!  This toothbrush has a lot of power and features!  Does an amazing job of getting my teeth super clean - is the closest thing to professional teeth cleaning I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I&#x27;ve used cheaper, higher advertised rpm brushes, but they don&#x27;t even compare in any way to the Sonicare!  Charge lasts a long time - plenty for two people - great product - incredibly satisfied and I highly highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had the Sonicare Flexcare Plus before this and when the price dropped I ordered this one and was going to return the Plus. However, now that I have both in hand to compare, I realized I like the Plus much better! Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Flexcare Platinum is so much louder when turned on!! It&#x27;s so loud I wouldn&#x27;t want to brush my teeth with it because it&#x27;s so annoying, so it would actually discourage me to brush! It&#x27;s so loud I bet it would wake people up in my house if I used it at night! If you turn the intensity level down it gets pretty quiet but I like using full power so this won&#x27;t work for me. The Plus on the other hand is a quiet hum. What I noticed was that with the brush head off it was almost just as quiet as the Plus. Of course that&#x27;s not what matters, what does matter is how loud it is with a brush attached! I tried switching the brushes to make sure I didn&#x27;t get a defective brush head, and every brush I attached still made the toothbrush operation very loud! The brush doesn&#x27;t seem to sit as close to the handle as they do on the Plus, that&#x27;s the only visible difference I noticed between the two that might be causing the noise from the Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The pressure sensor was my main reason for wanting the Platinum model, but after using it I realized you had to push so freaking hard to get that pressure sensor to go off that it was honestly just a gimmick! I would never ever brush that hard so it&#x27;s pointless for me to have this pressure sensor, I&#x27;ll save the $30 and keep the Plus instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The controls and display are also very hard to read compared to the Plus model. The Plus has a backlit display that you could read in complete darkness, while the Platinum just has a bunch of small green LED&#x27;s with words printed on the handle (hard to read even in the light, let alone in the dark).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The UV Sanitizer also is made differently on the inside. On the Platinum model it is all dark gray inside while the Plus has all chrome inside that reflects the UV light all around the brush, not just the front. I would assume the brush overall would get cleaner with the reflective chrome mirror effect than with dark gray plastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The back of the handle on this model is just plastic with bumps in it while the Plus has a blue rubberized back to it. I like the rubber much better, I&#x27;m much less likely to drop the handle if my hands are wet. The handle on the Platinum is bigger than the Plus too (probably because of the pressure sensor inside the handle). I like the slimmer feel of the Plus in my hand compared to this Platinum model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this one now and keeping the Sonicare Flexcare Plus (newer model with backlit display). So glad I didn&#x27;t return my Plus before getting the Platinum to compare! I really expected to like the Platinum better with the pressure sensor and intensity levels, but I was wrong! I highly recommend the Sonicare Flexcare Plus instead of this Platinum model! (make sure you order the newer version of the Plus that has the backlit display!) You can use the better brush heads like DiamondClean or InterCare on the Plus model too. I was very disappointed with the Platinum unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to review this as I wanted to see what my dentist said after using it for a year. I had let my teeth go when I was in college and have been trying to reverse the damage for years. This toothbrush it definitely helping. I went yesterday and it is the first time in 5 years they said my teeth looked good and that I was on the right track! They let me know problem areas on my teeth that they are watching and this trip they actually took some areas off. It makes the expensive cost well worth it since it is cheaper than a cavatity. They actually even asked if I was doing something different because they could tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get used to using this toothbrush your teeth feel so clean you think you just left the dentist everytime you use it. When I travel for work I leave it at home since my wife also uses it and it drives me crazy. A manual toothbrush just won&#x27;t cut it anymore. So warning, once you buy this you will never switch back! It is expensive but my recent dentist appointment justified the cost. I highly recommend a sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! You will never want to use another toothbrush again. Leaves your mouth tingling and feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after my first use. It gets my teeth so much cleaner, and it feels like I just had a cleaning at the dentist. It has different settings for the kind of brushing you want/need. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Everything as advertised for this product. My teeth have never felt cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent pricing and speedy delivery and follow up from this supplier.</li>
            <li> Timer is good, but I don&#x27;t feel 2 minutes is enough... I am always in a rush when brushing with this, so now I just brush for 2 cycles...    I used to use Systema Sonic Toothbrush. It doesn&#x27;t work the same way as sonicare. It basically just vibrates to help a bit on cleaning and I still have to do manual brushing sequence. However, I have a feeling that it cleans better between teeth... Though, for the surface of your teeth, sonicare cleans way better.    Anyway, what I am trying to say is, if you have the patience to brush thoroughly and carefully everyday and you don&#x27;t mind it, it&#x27;s ok to just use a manual brush, but his is a brush that will make you life much much more easier.</li>
            <li> Brush stopped working 13 months after I got it.  Sonicare refused to do anything about it.  Offered me a 15% off coupon.  Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush in October 2014. Now, a little over five months later, the UV function no longer works. I contacted Philips about a refund. The lady I talked to asked for the order number, and I also told her I&#x27;d bought it five months ago. She said she would send the return form via email; I should fill it out and return the device along with the receipt, then it would be 6-8 weeks for my refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took two days for her to send the return form via email. When I got it, it said &amp;#34;90 day return guarantee&amp;#34; so I called Philips again and this time was told that the device was no longer covered and they would not refund my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Philips toothbrush for seven years before I bought this lemon last October. It&#x27;s the only reason I spent so much money on the toothbrush - so much money that I would be embarrassed to tell anyone that I&#x27;d spent so much for a toothbrush for any reason. Now that I know how lousy Philips&#x27; return policy is - how lacking in confidence they are about the quality of their products - I will never buy another Philips product.</li>
