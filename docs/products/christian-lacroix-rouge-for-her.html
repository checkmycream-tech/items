            <li>I replaced it and we&#x27;re both happy again!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until it dawned on me to check Amazon (of course, why didn&#x27;t I think of that before) that I found this beautiful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It was wonderful, my husband loved it on me.</li>
            <li>order came very quickly, and in excellent shape.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>hope the supplier has a good supply</li>
            <li>and I was able to delight myself and others with this gorgeous perfume!  </li>
            <li>I ordered it and it came quickly from one of the best places you will ever order from.</li>
            <li>I am so grateful that I do not have to go without my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this scent !</li>
            <li>so now I can continue to get the fragrance that I love!</li>
            <li>she was thrilled when  i found it for her for christmas</li>
            <li>She is very happy with the Christian Lacroix Rouge, and I plan on continuing to purchase it as she needs it.</li>
            <li>At the most a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my mother as a gift and fell in love with it</li>
            <li>Love how it got here almost immediately</li>
            <li>One of my favorite Avon perfumes...</li>
            <li>Two months ago I lost my precious husband.</li>
            <li>This smells absolutely wonderful and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I am so glad i decided to check Amazon for this product, I first bought this from Avon and really liked it got so many compliments when I wore it, glad I found it again.</li>
            <li>My shipment came very quickly, and my sister was in heaven that she can still get her favorite</li>
            <li>one of my favorite scents originally found in the Avon catalog...</li>
            <li>I was very lucky to have found this at Amazon...</li>
            <li>Prefer Avon to carry it as a permanent perfume available for purchase on going.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3/15/2013  </li>
            <li>light fragrance with a hint of romance...lasts, too...</li>
            <li>Now, I wear perfume everyday, but from the very first time I wore Rouge, my husband asked me what I was wearing and said that I smelled absolutely beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance that this perfume smells like on her, THANKS!</li>
            <li>I guess the Avon crowd just does not understand that some of us really like the designer perfumes that may cost just a bit more because they are worth it.</li>
            <li>Arrived Quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>and the personally written &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; was just an added lovely bonus!  </li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>I first purchased this perfume from Avon and then they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>Much appreciated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not been available for a long time, but you came through!</li>
            <li>This is certainly an aromatic fragrance and, although my wife likes it, I find it a little too strong.  </li>
            <li>My sister and I love this perfume, and now it is very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure and it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell right</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure and it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell right</li>
            <li> I did not open &amp; try to use the Rouge for Her until yesterday-- 3/14/2013 because I still had a little in my old bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it did not seem to be previously opened  when I opened the package the bottle was not  all the way full and definitely did not smell like the real product I&#x27;m not sure if this product was either old or stale and maybe some of the liquid evaporated out of there</li>
            <li> But the only down fall of this scent is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This perfume is classic and hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Thus far Quincey Cosmetics is not willing to replace my order because it is past 30 days since I</li>
            <li> I was extremely vexed when Avon no longer carried this perfume.  </li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on this and was so disappointed to find out that Avon no longer makes it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not paying to ship the product back when I already paid to have the product shipped to me not satisfied</li>
            <li> but it was only 1.7 oz which sucks</li>
            <li> The perfume will not come out because the stem that leads to the nozzle inside the bottle is missing-</li>
            <li> I tried this fragrance a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Product is correct except the size was wrong.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this cologne and it is almost impossible to find anymore.</li>

            <li> I actually stopped someone several months ago and complimented her on her fragrance.  When she told me it was Christian La Croix, I tried unsucessfully to find it in perfume shops, department stores and online. It wasn&#x27;t until it dawned on me to check Amazon (of course, why didn&#x27;t I think of that before) that I found this beautiful fragrance.  I found out on Amazon that it was by Avon! Now, I wear perfume everyday, but from the very first time I wore Rouge, my husband asked me what I was wearing and said that I smelled absolutely beautiful!!!! I am ordering the lotion and shower gel next!</li>
            <li> I was extremely vexed when Avon no longer carried this perfume.  Thank goodness for Amazon sellers!  I am so grateful that I do not have to go without my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, she had been purchasing it at a AVON delership, when AVON discontinued, she was dissapointed, she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I found the perfume with Amazon. She is very happy with the Christian Lacroix Rouge, and I plan on continuing to purchase it as she needs it. I love the fragrance that this perfume smells like on her, THANKS!</li>

            <li> Love the smell of this scent ! But the only down fall of this scent is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. At the most a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this perfume from Avon and then they discontinued it.  probably the best item they ever sold, in my opinion.  Found it on Amazon.com so now I can continue to get the fragrance that I love!</li>
            <li> Arrived Quickly and well packaged. Been looking for quite some time for this scent. My sister is wanting this for Christmas as well.</li>
            <li> This is certainly an aromatic fragrance and, although my wife likes it, I find it a little too strong.  However, I can still recommend it since my wife likes it so well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mother as a gift and fell in love with it I just had to order me some. She loves the scent of this perfume and will continue to order this often.</li>
            <li> This was my Christmas gift to myself so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it anytime soon.  It got here within a couple of days and I was able to delight myself and others with this gorgeous perfume!  Love how it got here almost immediately and the personally written &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; was just an added lovely bonus!  Will definitely recommend, and order from, this company again!  One of the best I&#x27;ve ever done business with!  Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite Avon perfumes...of course the ones you like, the ones they don&#x27;t keep.  My sister and I love this perfume, and now it is very hard to find.  My shipment came very quickly, and my sister was in heaven that she can still get her favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;My order came very quickly, and in excellent shape.&lt;br /&gt;I hope the supplier has a good supply -- I need to stay stocked, and so does my sister!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is classic and hard to find.  Prefer Avon to carry it as a permanent perfume available for purchase on going.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 3/15/2013  I did not open &amp; try to use the Rouge for Her until yesterday-- 3/14/2013 because I still had a little in my old bottle.  The perfume will not come out because the stem that leads to the nozzle inside the bottle is missing- I can not get perfume to spray.  Thus far Quincey Cosmetics is not willing to replace my order because it is past 30 days since I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I will make a second replacement request...to be continued :0(&lt;br /&gt;My order was returned and I received the replacement on 3/25/2013.  I did spray the perfume on this morning...3/26/2013</li>
            <li> I tried this fragrance a few years ago. It was wonderful, my husband loved it on me. As time passed, I could not order it from same distributer. Two months ago I lost my precious husband. I so wanted to find this perfume, it made me feel my husband close to me again. One day while looking on Amazon, there it was. Oh my, I just had to have it. I ordered it and it came quickly from one of the best places you will ever order from. Thank goodness I found OUR fragrance. Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I could no longer purchase it through avon because they&#x27;re no longer carrying it when I received the package it was wrapped in the plastic seal and it did not seem to be previously opened  when I opened the package the bottle was not  all the way full and definitely did not smell like the real product I&#x27;m not sure if this product was either old or stale and maybe some of the liquid evaporated out of there but I&#x27;m not sure and it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell right at all I contacted the seller to get a refund and it took them 3 days to get back to me and they told me that they would only refund me if I ship the product back and I&#x27;m not paying to ship the product back when I already paid to have the product shipped to me not satisfied and I&#x27;m contacting Amazon I guess that&#x27;s why everyone else that was selling it was $10 more expensive than this vendor probably because you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and we had matching his &amp; hers of this until she ran out. I replaced it and we&#x27;re both happy again!</li>
            <li> I was very lucky to have found this at Amazon...one of my favorite scents originally found in the Avon catalog...light fragrance with a hint of romance...lasts, too...</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this cologne and it is almost impossible to find anymore. she was thrilled when  i found it for her for christmas</li>
            <li> This product was requested by one of my Avon customers for a friend who needed some TLC. It&#x27;s not been available for a long time, but you came through! Much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I am so glad i decided to check Amazon for this product, I first bought this from Avon and really liked it got so many compliments when I wore it, glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> Product is correct except the size was wrong. It said I would get a 3.4 oz bottle but it was only 1.7 oz which sucks</li>
