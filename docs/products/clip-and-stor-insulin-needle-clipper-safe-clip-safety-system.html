            <li>great price</li>
            <li>Great to have</li>
            <li>This needle clipper is great for travel and at home usage.  </li>
            <li>This is the best way to safely dispose of used needles that I have found yet.</li>
            <li>I found these by accident, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this and a BD one and it seems like a good product</li>
            <li>: I believe we get good value out of this clipper.</li>
            <li>Reassembled, the gizmo has worked perfectly ever since, clipping off the needle with a authoritative snap.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the hazard dispensers!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>The Clip &amp; Stor is quite handy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best price anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I found this solution to my syringe problem.  </li>
            <li>This is a excellent product, it easily clips the needles right off the syringe and stores them in the attached ontainer.</li>
            <li>It stores easily and is good for many uses.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought more than one.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have had a better idea about how it worked before I made my purchase.</li>
            <li>I feel much better about disposing of the needles after they have been clipped and I remove the plunger.</li>
            <li>I will order more to have on hand.  </li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I ordered myself another one for reserve, and purchased five more for Christmas presents for my friends at work.  </li>
            <li>It facilitates safe recycling of used syringes.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer a better engineered device that could be emptied of needles and had replaceable parts.  </li>
            <li>Will order some more.</li>
            <li>Snaps the needle off of the syringe and stores it safely.</li>
            <li>This makes throwing the syringe in the trash better since it cannot be reused.</li>
            <li>but I like the BD one better.</li>
            <li>Well worth $$$ to just clip off our dogs&#x27; diabetic needle in this container, and throw away the plastic, instead of paying to have &amp;#34;medical waste&amp;#34; disposal!!  </li>
            <li>Works well, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - and easily.</li>
            <li>It is compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The clipper is sturdy and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It will fit easily into a pocket or purse if we are on the go, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about carrying used syringes around with me.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic device</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for one that was becoming full.</li>
            <li>The cost was incredibly reasonable and it is very easy to use and store in the insulin case.  </li>
            <li>A drop or two of super glue works fine</li>
            <li>so much I ordered two more.</li>
            <li>Those sharps containers work well, but what am I supposed to do with them when they&#x27;re full?  </li>
            <li>Now, what to do with the two full ones in the garage...</li>
            <li>This snaps the needle off quickly and has a self contained disposal built in.</li>
            <li>The clipper is easy to use, easy to squeeze, and is easy to see on the shelf next to the box of syringes.  </li>
            <li>It packs nicely and clips clean enough that I have no worries disposing my husband&#x27;s needles in any trash can.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>The box says that it can hold up to two-years worth of needles.     </li>
            <li>It was worth every penny I paid for it, and in all honesty, it was inexpensive to begin with to do the job as needed.</li>
            <li>This little device is so much better than the bulky safe needle storage units I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>This worked well and was shipped very fast; however, I dropped it onto the floor just one time</li>
            <li>I shall immediately order several more.     </li>
            <li>Very convenient!</li>
            <li>I give my dog monthly immuno therapy (read: &amp;#34;allergy&amp;#34;) injections.</li>
            <li>This makes for safe and simple disposal of used syringes.</li>
            <li>Instead of saving syringes in a secure container and disposing when full, can now simply clip off the needle and put the syringe in the trash.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 BD clippers and everyone of them did not work after the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>It works the first time and everytime.</li>
            <li>This item will help me to properly and safely discard my used syringes.</li>
            <li>The seller mailed very, very quickly; I ordered on the 3rd, and received on the 5th (in a first class envelope).</li>
            <li>The only needle clipper I use because it is so easy and convenient</li>
            <li>The needle simply and easily is clipped off, and stays inside the clipper device.  </li>
            <li>The device cannot be readily disassembled.</li>
            <li>I like that because it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my insulin pen case.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and is sharp.</li>
            <li>I have used 3 or 4 of these clippers and other than the latch breaking and several uses it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to make a special trip to the waste collection place for sharps containers!  </li>
            <li>Received much faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>I always stab myself with the needle point and now with this LMP insulin syringe clipper I no long stab myself!!</li>
            <li>The seller&#x27;s product description should make clear how limited this product is.</li>
            <li>and the BD seems to cut off a little closer but not by much.</li>

            <li> I always stab myself with the needle point and now with this LMP insulin syringe clipper I no long stab myself!!</li>
            <li> The seller&#x27;s product description should make clear how limited this product is.</li>
            <li> and the BD seems to cut off a little closer but not by much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and very discreet.</li>
            <li> This product is junk; it simply will not sever a 22 gauge syringe needle, which is only average sized.  </li>
            <li> A little clunky in design and use, but overall convenient.</li>
            <li> When you are finished with the syringe you press the little lever on the back of the Clip &amp; Stor, causing the back end to &#x27;pop&#x27; up; then place the needle into the small hole in the front of the device and squeeze the device; the needle is clipped, and stored inside the unit.</li>
            <li> We no longer run the risk of getting scratched by sharp needles in the trash.</li>
            <li> Just place the needle in and squeeze down to clip.</li>
            <li> But in a year of using this clipper four or five times a day, we&#x27;ve gone through only five clippers, so the breakage rate really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> It takes up way less space than a &amp;#34;sharps container&amp;#34; and you can take it with you when you travel.  </li>
            <li> So I saw this little clipper and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I worked well for a few weeks, then it was hard to cut the needles</li>
            <li> No more used needle storage problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine for about 6 weeks with approximately 175 needles (31 gauge ), until it jammed.</li>
            <li> now no more...</li>
            <li> No more filling a container and shipping off or taking to doctor for disposal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small and would work for travel.</li>
            <li> When I got it  I was how small it is.</li>
            <li> The other three failed earlier, but we still got over almost a month out of the clipper that failed the soonest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I use it for pen needles and it is hard to get them in the recessed hole at the end</li>
            <li> but it takes 4 or 5 pushes at least to clip the needle off.  </li>
            <li> I cleared the jam with a lancet (I did not attempt to clip lancet), but now the clipped needles seem to interfere with the mechanism, and I expect failure soon.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good clipper.  </li>
            <li> The device was working poorly, as described below, and I was about to discard it.</li>
            <li> The design of the clipper has a weak area at the front of the device, where all the pressure of the clipping device is held by a very thin bit of plastic.</li>
            <li> and it broke, rendering it useless.</li>
            <li> These are very thin needles, so I can&#x27;t imagine that was a factor.</li>
            <li> I know this wasn&#x27;t a very expensive gadget, but still ...</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in tem.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s so wonderful !  I wish my ignorance had been discovered sooner. Greatest investment I have every made. It is so simple. Who ever invented this wonderful thing thank you!</li>
            <li> It already broke. I worked well for a few weeks, then it was hard to cut the needles and then the front piece broke off and now it don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My son has the Penmate system for this novolog pens and you cannot clip the needles wit this clipper. The penmate system simplifies giving shots for children. They don&#x27;t see a needle and just push a button to get the shot. We have to use the BD Clipper, as this clipper just won&#x27;t reach the needle.</li>
            <li> So much better than the hazard dispensers!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought more than one.  This product is fantastic!!!!    I wished I would have known about this product before.  I wish I would have had a better idea about how it worked before I made my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this tool twice a day to clip the needle from my dog&#x27;s insulin syringes.  The cost was incredibly reasonable and it is very easy to use and store in the insulin case.  I feel much better about disposing of the needles after they have been clipped and I remove the plunger.</li>
            <li> This is a great product....I will order more to have on hand.  This product eliminates the problem of what to do with used needles.  Just clip them off and throw the rest away.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use. Could not find this product locally.  I can clip the ends off needles and can save space in a &amp;#34;sharps&amp;#34; container.  A tiny sliver of metal is still left when you clip the needle but at lease it doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;point&amp;#34; on it.  I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I shall add my Kudos! The Clip &amp; Stor is PERFECT for traveling purposes, as well as home use. Works for both regular syringes and the Flex Pens. When you are finished with the syringe you press the little lever on the back of the Clip &amp; Stor, causing the back end to &#x27;pop&#x27; up; then place the needle into the small hole in the front of the device and squeeze the device; the needle is clipped, and stored inside the unit. The box says that it can hold up to two-years worth of needles.     Mind, on the syringe there is still a tiny bit of needle, but not enough to do anyone any harm.     The seller mailed very, very quickly; I ordered on the 3rd, and received on the 5th (in a first class envelope). I shall immediately order several more.     UPDATE: I like the Clip &amp; Stor so much I ordered two more. Again, I received my order in three business days. Simply wonderful service.</li>
            <li> Well worth $$$ to just clip off our dogs&#x27; diabetic needle in this container, and throw away the plastic, instead of paying to have &amp;#34;medical waste&amp;#34; disposal!!  Very convenient!</li>
            <li> My wife and I are happy with the Clip and Stor.  We no longer run the risk of getting scratched by sharp needles in the trash.</li>
            <li> This is a excellent product, it easily clips the needles right off the syringe and stores them in the attached ontainer. No more used needle storage problems.</li>
            <li> I found these by accident, and loved it.  I ordered myself another one for reserve, and purchased five more for Christmas presents for my friends at work.  Great product</li>
            <li> update 7/18/15: The device was working poorly, as described below, and I was about to discard it. As a last resort, I pulled up on &amp;#34;guillotine lever&amp;#34; (ie, where the thumb rests and presses in the photo). It popped off: I removed the metal piece into which the needle fits, and rotated it 180 degrees so that the needle would enter the hole from the opposite side. Reassembled, the gizmo has worked perfectly ever since, clipping off the needle with a authoritative snap.  The Clip &amp; Stor is quite handy. It replaces the sharps container (ie, plastic water bottle) I used to carry when traveling. It facilitates safe recycling of used syringes.  I&#x27;ve used mine for about 6 weeks with approximately 175 needles (31 gauge ), until it jammed. I cleared the jam with a lancet (I did not attempt to clip lancet), but now the clipped needles seem to interfere with the mechanism, and I expect failure soon.  This device does not actually clip the needle. Rather it seems to grab and score the needle: some additional force is required to pull the needle off the syringe. The device cannot be readily disassembled. I would prefer a better engineered device that could be emptied of needles and had replaceable parts.  I&#x27;ll update this review when the device gives up the ghost.</li>
            <li> works great..wish I would heave seen this before purchasing the disposal container...wouldn&#x27;t have needed the container!  Needle snaps off and locks inside the clipper...then no need to dispose of in sharps container!</li>
            <li> I bought this to save my fingers and it has!! I always stab myself with the needle point and now with this LMP insulin syringe clipper I no long stab myself!! I have to give 2 shots a day to my dog for her diabetes so 2 times a day i stab my hand or fingers...now no more...everyone should purchase one of these!! Thank you LMP for a great product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - and easily.</li>
            <li> This product is junk; it simply will not sever a 22 gauge syringe needle, which is only average sized.  The seller&#x27;s product description should make clear how limited this product is.</li>
            <li> This needle clipper only lasted through five uses before falling apart. A couple of parts of it fell off and that was that. These are very thin needles, so I can&#x27;t imagine that was a factor. I know this wasn&#x27;t a very expensive gadget, but still ...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic device and I wish I had seen this before I bought the disposable syringe container.  This snaps the needle off quickly and has a self contained disposal built in. No longer do I worry that I will accidently jab myself!</li>
            <li> I give my dog monthly immuno therapy (read: &amp;#34;allergy&amp;#34;) injections. This is the best way to safely dispose of used needles that I have found yet. It&#x27;s small and very discreet.</li>
            <li> This is the quickest, safest way to dispose of syringe needles! Bar none! No more filling a container and shipping off or taking to doctor for disposal.</li>
            <li> This little device is so much better than the bulky safe needle storage units I&#x27;ve tried before. Just clip off the needle which drops inside and throw the rest away. It&#x27;s really small and would work for travel. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> A little clunky in design and use, but overall convenient. This was a replacement for one that was becoming full.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Just snip off the needle and throw the syringe into the recycle bin!  Nifty!  It takes up way less space than a &amp;#34;sharps container&amp;#34; and you can take it with you when you travel.  This is the 2nd time we have ordered this product.  The 1st time was 2 years ago (my hubby takes a daily shot), so you do the math!  Great invention and product.</li>
            <li> Received much faster than I expected. The only needle clipper I use because it is so easy and convenient and I don&#x27;t have to wrry about disposal.</li>
            <li> No need to keep looking.  I have done the homework for you.  Absolutely the best price anywhere.  I will shop here again!!!</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and is sharp. It works just like a nail clipper. Just place the needle in and squeeze down to clip. It saves me from having to store the needles in a container and then dispose. The size also accommodates for travelling as well. Will order some more.</li>
            <li> works great; great price</li>
            <li> This makes for safe and simple disposal of used syringes. Instead of saving syringes in a secure container and disposing when full, can now simply clip off the needle and put the syringe in the trash. Check with your health department for local regulations; this is acceptable and permissible in my area.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 BD clippers and everyone of them did not work after the first week of use.  I bought them because of the BD name. I was very disappointed in tem. I sent a email to the BD company and got no respounse. So I saw this little clipper and decided to try it. When I got it  I was how small it is. I like that because it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my insulin pen case. It works the first time and everytime. I will all ways buy this clipper and NEVER BD CLIPPER!</li>
            <li> I have always been uneasy about throwing syringes in the trash for safety and health reason because someone could get stuck or reuse it. This device eases that. It is compact and easy to use. Snaps the needle off of the syringe and stores it safely. This makes throwing the syringe in the trash better since it cannot be reused. I recommend this to anyone using syringes for medical reasons.</li>
            <li> This worked well and was shipped very fast; however, I dropped it onto the floor just one time and it broke, rendering it useless. If you are going to buy one, buy two, just in case.</li>
            <li> My dog is diabetic, so we are going through lots of syringes around here.  Those sharps containers work well, but what am I supposed to do with them when they&#x27;re full?  I don&#x27;t want to make a special trip to the waste collection place for sharps containers!  I was thrilled when I found this solution to my syringe problem.  The clipper is sturdy and easy to use.  I simply stick the used needle into the hole at the end of the clipper and squeeze.  The needle simply and easily is clipped off, and stays inside the clipper device.  I can then throw away the rest of the syringe, as there is no needle anymore so nobody will get stuck with it.  The clipper is easy to use, easy to squeeze, and is easy to see on the shelf next to the box of syringes.  It will fit easily into a pocket or purse if we are on the go, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about carrying used syringes around with me.  I&#x27;ll never buy another sharps container again.  Now, what to do with the two full ones in the garage...</li>
            <li> thank you. Great to have</li>
            <li> I ordered this and a BD one and it seems like a good product but I like the BD one better. This one does the job well but I use it for pen needles and it is hard to get them in the recessed hole at the end and the BD seems to cut off a little closer but not by much.</li>
            <li> This item will help me to properly and safely discard my used syringes. It was worth every penny I paid for it, and in all honesty, it was inexpensive to begin with to do the job as needed. I will buy this product again, and again!</li>
            <li> This is not a good clipper.  I bought it because it was cheaper but it takes 4 or 5 pushes at least to clip the needle off.  I was really disappointed.  I will definitely go back to the BD clipper which works EVERY TIME.</li>
            <li> This needle clipper works well enough to clip my husband&#x27;s .5 and 1 CC needles. It packs nicely and clips clean enough that I have no worries disposing my husband&#x27;s needles in any trash can.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned that the clipper falls apart, and this has happened to us also. But in a year of using this clipper four or five times a day, we&#x27;ve gone through only five clippers, so the breakage rate really isn&#x27;t that bad. The design of the clipper has a weak area at the front of the device, where all the pressure of the clipping device is held by a very thin bit of plastic. We&#x27;ve completely or almost completely filled the clipper with needle bits on two of the clippers before this part failed. The other three failed earlier, but we still got over almost a month out of the clipper that failed the soonest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I believe we get good value out of this clipper. My husband has vascular dementia and diabetes. He is going to need care for years and years to come, and I need to have tools that simplify that care. We will be buying this clipper again.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 or 4 of these clippers and other than the latch breaking and several uses it works fine.  A drop or two of super glue works fine</li>
            <li> safety way for needle</li>
            <li> This needle clipper is great for travel and at home usage.  It stores easily and is good for many uses.</li>
