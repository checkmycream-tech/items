            <li>I&#x27;d recommend Innocent for daytime wear, and Angel for evening wear.</li>

            <li>Such a beautiful scent.</li>
            <li>and she love it so much that i will buy her some more in the furter</li>
            <li>This is the best parfum for each and everyday to go to work also to walk or going to the gym, it is fresh</li>
            <li>But Innocent is much softer and lighter compared to Angel.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s elegant and classy and every woman in your life will want a bottle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive either, so that&#x27;s always a plus!+++</li>
            <li>and I enjoy this fragrance so much</li>
            <li>They sent what I requested right away.  </li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>I have many days when I can barely walk!</li>
            <li>I loved being in the military!!</li>
            <li>A bit sexy, a bit soft, and very feminine.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Was exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>but when I put on Angle Innocent it takes my mind off the pain and anguish of daily living.</li>
            <li>Angel Innocent smells all day long, upset, about this purchase</li>
            <li>The very 1st time I bought this was in Paris</li>
            <li>i really like it on her</li>
            <li>Both perfumes are very unique, and UNLIKE any other perfume I had ever smelled.</li>
            <li>I was just Medically Metired after 21 years of my whole life being the United States Air Force!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this perfume to everyone that loves to smell fresh every second of the day they have this on!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am at present in touch with amazon who cannot help right now as item not delivered yet</li>
            <li>I will buy this perfume as long as I live!!!!</li>
            <li>In Which Nursing Home Do You Live?  </li>
            <li>Have some self respect, my friend; whatever your age, you are too young for this aroma...</li>
            <li>Angel Perfume reeks of chocolate-scented bathroom air freshener &amp; some kind of orthopedic shoe powder with a Godforsaken undercurrent of nursing home pastries.  </li>

            <li> Such a beautiful scent. I have used Angel, and I have used Innocent, and I love both. But Innocent is much softer and lighter compared to Angel. I&#x27;d recommend Innocent for daytime wear, and Angel for evening wear. I am Thierry Mugler&#x27;s fan forever. Both perfumes are very unique, and UNLIKE any other perfume I had ever smelled. If you&#x27;re into sweet, woodsy, musky, and warm scents, TRY THIS !!! DELICIOUS.</li>

I can Not even work now AT All!! I loved being in the military!! I loved living in Europe for 15 years!!!

            <li> My wife truly enjoyed the scent. I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, fast service!</li>
            <li> The scent is the same but the style of the bottle has changed. It was a little disappointing because I originally purchased it for the style of the bottle and scent.</li>
            <li> The ladies love this stuff! It&#x27;s elegant and classy and every woman in your life will want a bottle! It&#x27;s not expensive either, so that&#x27;s always a plus!+++</li>
            <li> The fragrance of &amp;#34;Innocent&amp;#34; is wonderful, not too strong like &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34;.  Just wish the staying power was longer!!</li>
            <li> I got angel for my wife  and she love it so much that i will buy her some more in the furter i really like it on her</li>
            <li> After browsing for this perfume I pressed by mistake the click/order prompt instead of basket prompt so I could view this product and delivery address, I did not even have to log into my amazon account it just did an order and took payment from my bank,  no order confirmed by myself so all beware of this prompt !! Because of this the item was £20.39  &amp; SHIPPING costs £34.93,  but  the larger bottle of this fragrance 2.6oz  is shown as $92.09  &amp;shipping is $5.70.  How come? I am at present in touch with amazon who cannot help right now as item not delivered yet</li>
            <li> The price was right and I enjoy this fragrance so much, I thought I would treat myself.  It&#x27;s a wonderful light fragrance.</li>
            <li> smell as a real Innocent Angel, but it is not ear de perfume, it is water -water watering ear de toilette,&lt;br /&gt;real Angel Innocent smells all day long, upset, about this purchase</li>
            <li> My favorite eau the parfum</li>
            <li> Angel Innocent is a truly wonderful scent.  A bit sexy, a bit soft, and very feminine.  There is simply nothing else like it! Love love love this fragrence.</li>
