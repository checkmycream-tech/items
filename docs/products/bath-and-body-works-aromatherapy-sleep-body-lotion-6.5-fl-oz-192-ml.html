            <li> Product exactly what I wanted and came quickly</li>
            <li> Arrived early! Love this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> This is no longer sold in the retail stores.  And of course it is my favorite one!!  This has such a nice, relaxing scent that is never overpowering and leaves skin silky soft and not sticky.  I believe the aroma does induce relaxation and sleep.  As long as it is available on Amazon I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I wish that BBW would bring it back.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this Bath and Body Works scent is a restful and relaxing smell.  I use it after showering and it prepares me for a aromatherapy sleep experience. I would buy it again. I hope they will always make this fragrance!</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion, it&#x27;s wonderful to put on just before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It gives me a nice relax smell that help easing you into your nighttime routine.</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find more of this lotion.  My favorite lotion.  I use it on my hands before bed.  Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I was recently given a bottle of Bath &amp; Body Works Aromatherapy &amp;#34;Sleep&amp;#34;  Night Time Tea Body Lotion as a gift.  The calming blend of oils when breathed in helped so well when applied before bed-time, that once it was gone I missed the relaxing effect that it had giving me, so I searched on Amazon to find it. I love the pleasant Cedarwood and Orange Blossom aroma. It&#x27;s long lasting and really is so restful and wonderful, I always take in a long, deep breath after applying before laying down to Sleep.</li>
            <li> Really soothing smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I get so many compliments when I wear it....don&#x27;t know why Bath and Body stopped making it.  I&#x27;m glad I can order it through Amazon...thanks Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy Vumback</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know how to rate this.... i love the product, so much that i was willing to pay 25 $ for a body lotion. but i wouldn&#x27;t buy it from amazon: the bottle arrived cracked and lotion had poured out. disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very pricey but I was running out and can&#x27;t get to sleep without it! So I paid the ridiculous price!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Wish you good get it all year round!</li>
            <li> As an insomniac I have tried almost everything out there. I&#x27;m not going to lie and say it made me fall asleep magically as soon as I out it on. But it did help me relax which lead to me falling asleep eventually (which is quite a feat). It smells wonderful. The warning about sun exposure makes me a little nervous but understandable.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best scents Bath and Body has ever offered.  They discontinued it (like every other scent that we love), but luckily I found more at Amazon.  Don&#x27;t hesitate with this one!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent. I use this lotion throughout the day because I get so many compliments on the smell. It is soothing and calming as well so it does help me to get to sleep faster. I&#x27;m glad amazon sells this since bath and body works discontinued it!</li>
            <li> This smell is absolutely divine.  It&#x27;s long lasting and really does relax me.  I was so glad to find it online!</li>
