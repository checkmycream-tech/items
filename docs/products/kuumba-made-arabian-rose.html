            <li>The Kuumba Made Arabian Rose Fragrance oil smells so wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I just received my Arabian Rose in the mail today!</li>
            <li>Smell like a real rose more than any oil I have used.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This has always been one of my all time favorite smells!</li>
            <li>I fell head over heels in love with!</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>yes, but not like a plucked-from-the-garden rose.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to find something that smelled like a rose and not perfumy.  </li>
            <li>My wife likes rose scents, and she loves this.</li>
            <li>Love the rose oil.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that loves this kind of smell :)</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but a bit strong.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>In fact, it is time to order more.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts the whole day and smells great.</li>
            <li>Favorite scent.</li>
            <li>but I hope to find another scent from this line that&#x27;s more agreeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not flowery at all and is more musky, which I love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>Not the true rose scent that I&#x27;ve been hoping to find.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, but not the intense rose scent I was looking for.</li>
            <li>did have a great deal more luck with Kuumba&#x27;s Tea Rose, which is barely discriminable from rose absolute,</li>
            <li>this is a nice rose scent, good for mixing with the other Kuumba oils, like amber resin and patchouli.</li>
            <li>Most rose scented things smell like old ladies to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this scent does not compare to my rose absolute, and it makes me sneeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes me feel sexy and powerful.</li>
            <li>it is very strong when you apply but gets much softer as you wear it</li>
            <li>(fresh roses from the garden if you may)!</li>
            <li>Smell lasts a long time and amazing for the price!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a fragrance akin to natural, pressed rose petals.</li>
            <li>This has an intensely sweet fragrance with powdery notes.  </li>
            <li>Arabian Rose has a sweet, musky, a moderate strong scent that lasts for a while.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who love a rosy fragrance , but are not yet affluent enough to indulge in pure attar of roses , this is a consistently sweet and affordable substitute.</li>
            <li>It blends nicely with sandalwood and patchouli oils for a whole new scent.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time</li>
            <li>Very strong, only use a bit.</li>
            <li>Also, delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give less stars but the staying power is amazing- washed up twice</li>
            <li>This, at first seems to fit the bill; however, after about 5 minutes, it falls flat and begins to resemble the scent of talcum powder...</li>
            <li>I happen to find this product at \\&quot;whole Foods Market\\&quot; and bought it.  </li>
            <li>They are my favorite and last a long time, true to the smell and prefect in your purse on the go.a</li>
            <li>Just a real subtle scent with a lovely, soft hint of fresh rose</li>
            <li>Absolutely adore.......</li>
            <li>have a bottle of rose absolute, which is what I usually purchase; however, I was looking for something portable and with a roller-ball applicator.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>much like cheap drug store perfumes, as well as, my late great-grandmother&#x27;s Jean Nat&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li>will be buying this oil again and would higly recommend it if your looking for something natural and smells just like</li>
            <li>Bottle is very small in size but the quality of the smell is lovely.</li>
            <li>The velvety dark red roses with their deep, heady scent, the regal long stemmed pinks that smelled a very smooth and delicate tea rose, and the odd Dave Austins that were fruity or spicy.  </li>

            <li> Nice fragrance, but not the intense rose scent I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it is very strong when you apply but gets much softer as you wear it</li>
            <li> Love the rose oil. Arrived right on time</li>
            <li> I love this oil. In fact, it is time to order more. Smell like a real rose more than any oil I have used.</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my all time favorite smells! I have never bought it off line until now. It came quickly and was exactly what I thought it would be. Smell lasts a long time and amazing for the price! I would recommend this to anyone that loves this kind of smell :)</li>
            <li> this is a nice rose scent, good for mixing with the other Kuumba oils, like amber resin and patchouli. The scent lasts a long time</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts the whole day and smells great. Friends have commented on it and bought as gifts. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Smells so good! The scent also seems to last forever. It blends nicely with sandalwood and patchouli oils for a whole new scent.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Favorite scent.</li>

This, at first seems to fit the bill; however, after about 5 minutes, it falls flat and begins to resemble the scent of talcum powder...much like cheap drug store perfumes, as well as, my late great-grandmother&#x27;s Jean Nat&amp;eacute;. Musty, not &amp;#34;Musky&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bottle of rose absolute, which is what I usually purchase; however, I was looking for something portable and with a roller-ball applicator. After reading the reviews for this product, I thought that I had found what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this scent does not compare to my rose absolute, and it makes me sneeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a great deal more luck with Kuumba&#x27;s Tea Rose, which is barely discriminable from rose absolute, does not &amp;#34;mutate&amp;#34;, does not seem to upset my allergies, nor make me feel as if I should pay a visit to the mausoleum.</li>
            <li> Growing up I&#x27;ve had various &#x27;mystery&#x27; rosebushes around the yard.  The velvety dark red roses with their deep, heady scent, the regal long stemmed pinks that smelled a very smooth and delicate tea rose, and the odd Dave Austins that were fruity or spicy.  This oil didn&#x27;t remind me of any of them.  Sadly all I got was a sort of musty potpourri scent.  Rosy yes, but not like a plucked-from-the-garden rose.  I&#x27;d give less stars but the staying power is amazing- washed up twice and I could still smell it on me.  This bottle went into the garbage- I just couldn&#x27;t stand it- but I hope to find another scent from this line that&#x27;s more agreeable.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but a bit strong. Use small dabs.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find anything that smells like roses and isn&#x27;t mixed with other scents. This is perfect. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> For those of us who love a rosy fragrance , but are not yet affluent enough to indulge in pure attar of roses , this is a consistently sweet and affordable substitute.</li>
            <li> I usually hate the way rose scented things smell but this oil....I fell head over heels in love with! Everyone compliments me on this scent. It&#x27;s not flowery at all and is more musky, which I love. Most rose scented things smell like old ladies to me. This makes me feel sexy and powerful. Lol. This will be my signature scent.</li>
            <li> Arabian Rose has a sweet, musky, a moderate strong scent that lasts for a while.  Bottle is very small in size but the quality of the smell is lovely.</li>
            <li> The Kuumba Made Arabian Rose Fragrance oil smells so wonderful.  I wanted to find something that smelled like a rose and not perfumy.  I happen to find this product at \\&quot;whole Foods Market\\&quot; and bought it.  I can say it is a bit cheaper here on Amazon but anyway I am very very happy with the smell.  It is not strong and lasts for a while.  I also suffer from migraines and can say it does not trigger them which some smells can.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this oil again and would higly recommend it if your looking for something natural and smells just like a rose does!!</li>
            <li> This has an intensely sweet fragrance with powdery notes.  It&#x27;s OK, but I don&#x27;t love it.  Too old-lady-ish for my preference.  Not the true rose scent that I&#x27;ve been hoping to find.  However, it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very strong, only use a bit. Smells wonderful. Should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> They are my favorite and last a long time, true to the smell and prefect in your purse on the go.a little will go a long way</li>
            <li> My wife likes rose scents, and she loves this. I like it after it evaporates a little, producing a very subtle rose scent. Also, delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> I adore this perfume. It is amazing and I was very happy to find it.</li>
            <li> I just received my Arabian Rose in the mail today! It smells amazing. My son and nephew think I&#x27;m nuts cause I kept making them come into my room to get a whiff of the smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering, or ancient smelling. Just a real subtle scent with a lovely, soft hint of fresh rose (fresh roses from the garden if you may)! Absolutely adore.......</li>
