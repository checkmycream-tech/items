            <li>Good warmer, though.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t bother to time that it was good to go in the time indicated.</li>
            <li>This roll on wax warmer works good</li>
            <li>The roller is really good and wax gets heated up in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I guess its good since I got it for wife.  </li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this item.</li>
            <li>With this one, I&#x27;m loving to do waxing at home.</li>
            <li>My wife liked this a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practice and easy to use!</li>
            <li>The product rolled very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I would love this product except for the fact that I needed more than 1 cartridge to do my legs.</li>
            <li>would look for a better solution</li>
            <li>This is a very good product for a very convenient price, thank you so much.</li>
            <li>To clean my hands and the device I used cotton balls with baby oil, and for my legs I used my favorite body oil: &amp;#34;Satsuma beautyifying oil&amp;#34; from The Body Shop.  </li>
            <li>Just to give you and idea, with one carthridge I was able to wax my underarms 3 times and wax my full legs</li>
            <li>i loved this wax and this wax is easy to use and no mess at all, Girls out there u should go for it without any hiccup</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and the fact that I am saving so much money by doing it myself.</li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>This was a good deal, but I would recommend buying multiple cartridge warmer.</li>
            <li>The warmer and cartridge both are small, handy and can be carried in your handbag while traveling..!!</li>
            <li>I was very interested in trying a electric wax warmer/roller</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this product!!</li>
            <li>Now is more simple and clean to do it.  </li>
            <li>Wish that I could use the same cartridge for more than 1 use.</li>
            <li>It did not work properly the wax after 30 miutes and even more still was coming so pittifully</li>
            <li>personally I think shaving is faster and much more cleaner</li>
            <li>and I ordered this particular warmer because it had mostly positive reviews and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Makes waxing legs much easier.</li>
            <li>Lets start with the pros:&lt;br /&gt;- kinda does the job, but very poorly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shipment arrived on time, as really all I asked for, but the product is too  sticky</li>
            <li>and it was very easy to remove the little bit of wax that remained on my legs.  </li>
            <li>The only minor complain is that the wax should bit a bit hotter, while is just warm, so you need a bit of strenght to use it.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, dispensed just enough wax to do the job</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the &amp;#34;GiGi cloth epilating strips&amp;#34; (not included).</li>
            <li>, I imagine it will not be easy to take out the empty one to place a new one.</li>
            <li>No problems removing it, or placing the new cartridge.</li>
            <li>But wow!  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t keep it on it&#x27;s head, so the wax will always be near the roller</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth buying if you are not a frequent salon visitor (like me) and want to quickly take off those few inches of growth on your legs and bikini area before leaving for a swimming class!&lt;br /&gt;-Neha</li>
            <li>I left it on for at least 4 hours and the wax was only warm, it wasn&#x27;t hot enough to be used.</li>
            <li>I am an experienced DIY leg waxer -- love the result, hate the mess.  </li>
            <li>I removed the empty cartridge with the help of a butter knife...just a gentle push and voila!</li>

            <li> I removed the empty cartridge with the help of a butter knife...just a gentle push and voila!</li>
            <li> It is difficult to remove the cartridge from the warmer which is an issue and the honey wax is not really good but the green tea much better, so you can try with that one and will get a better result.</li>
            <li> Since the wax is not hot enough, it&#x27;s not flowing enough and it takes forever...</li>
            <li> /&gt;- takes too long to heat up, you have to turn in on an hour before the use, I heat the wax before in microwave to save the time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t get hot enough the allow a thin and even layer of wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you beasicly must hurt yourself and the results were really poor it did not remove the facial hair properly or at all</li>
            <li> No more scraping wax off the bathroom floor, no more second degree burns from overheated wax.  </li>
            <li> ,it was a little bit irritated..</li>
            <li> I usually plug it in and go around doing some other stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I saved the packaging and was prepared to send it back if the product was as poor as the directions.  </li>
            <li> or you can put the roller few minutes on microwave to help or accelerate heating!</li>
            <li> Not at all satisfied.very messy..and the left out wax after waxing on your body is very difficult to wash.</li>
            <li> Its very hard to get off ur skin</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I inserted the wax in the device, plugged it for 30 minutes, and applied thin layers on the skin of my legs along of hair grow direction.  </li>
            <li> ..dont waste ur money buying this stupid product.</li>
            <li> Worst product.. Dont buy this..</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I would love this product except for the fact that I needed more than 1 cartridge to do my legs. Wish that I could use the same cartridge for more than 1 use. Good warmer, though. Makes waxing legs much easier.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this product!! The wax warmer doesn&#x27;t work! I left it on for at least 4 hours and the wax was only warm, it wasn&#x27;t hot enough to be used. I do not recomand this warmer!</li>
            <li> Lets start with the pros:&lt;br /&gt;- kinda does the job, but very poorly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t get hot enough the allow a thin and even layer of wax.&lt;br /&gt;- takes too long to heat up, you have to turn in on an hour before the use, I heat the wax before in microwave to save the time&lt;br /&gt;- you can&#x27;t keep it on it&#x27;s head, so the wax will always be near the roller and you won&#x27;t have to wait for the wax to come back to the applicator. Since the wax is not hot enough, it&#x27;s not flowing enough and it takes forever...&lt;br /&gt;- the cord is short, so you have to be close to an electrical output or use an extension cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would look for a better solution</li>
            <li> Good product!  I inserted the wax in the device, plugged it for 30 minutes, and applied thin layers on the skin of my legs along of hair grow direction.  I highly recommend the &amp;#34;GiGi cloth epilating strips&amp;#34; (not included). To clean my hands and the device I used cotton balls with baby oil, and for my legs I used my favorite body oil: &amp;#34;Satsuma beautyifying oil&amp;#34; from The Body Shop.  Since inserting the cartridge took some effort, I imagine it will not be easy to take out the empty one to place a new one. I will update this review when that happens.  Update 3/31/15:  Winter is over and I need to start waxing again (sigh). I removed the empty cartridge with the help of a butter knife...just a gentle push and voila! It was out. No problems removing it, or placing the new cartridge.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was very impressed about how easy and how great the results are! I began opting to wax instead of shaving but paying over $80 a month at a salon was out of my budget so I wanted to start doing it myself at home. The product arrived within a week. I was so excited to try it out. I plugged it in and was cleaning up as it heated up the wax so I didn&#x27;t bother to time that it was good to go in the time indicated. The product rolled very smoothly. The results were great! I really love this product and the fact that I am saving so much money by doing it myself. Just to give you and idea, with one carthridge I was able to wax my underarms 3 times and wax my full legs (if I had gone to a salon, I would&#x27;ve had to pay $85 not including tip). I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not at all satisfied.very messy..and the left out wax after waxing on your body is very difficult to wash.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for a very convenient price, thank you so much. I would consider it to anyone.</li>
            <li> i loved this wax and this wax is easy to use and no mess at all, Girls out there u should go for it without any hiccup .very happy with the product,Thanx</li>
            <li> I am an experienced DIY leg waxer -- love the result, hate the mess.  I was very interested in trying a electric wax warmer/roller and I ordered this particular warmer because it had mostly positive reviews and the price was right.  When it came I had some hesitation because the directions appear to have been written by someone for whom English was a third language.  I saved the packaging and was prepared to send it back if the product was as poor as the directions.  But wow!  It heated up quickly, dispensed just enough wax to do the job and it was very easy to remove the little bit of wax that remained on my legs.  No more scraping wax off the bathroom floor, no more second degree burns from overheated wax.  I love this product and recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> This is what you can expect for the price. It is difficult to remove the cartridge from the warmer which is an issue and the honey wax is not really good but the green tea much better, so you can try with that one and will get a better result.</li>
            <li> I decided to by the depilatory roll-on because I was warming the wax on the microwave. Now is more simple and clean to do it.  I am happy with it, it was chip and it works good!</li>
            <li> I always used a similar roll on wax warmer in Italy and I was very satisfied. This roll on wax warmer works good and I have tried a couple of time and the results of my wax are great. The only minor complain is that the wax should bit a bit hotter, while is just warm, so you need a bit of strenght to use it.</li>
            <li> I like it!!! The warmer and cartridge both are small, handy and can be carried in your handbag while traveling..!! I used 3/4th of the cartridge to wax my both full legs, which is not even 7 dollars!!!! It is definitely worth buying if you are not a frequent salon visitor (like me) and want to quickly take off those few inches of growth on your legs and bikini area before leaving for a swimming class!&lt;br /&gt;-Neha</li>
            <li> You may to turn on it 30 min before use.. or you can put the roller few minutes on microwave to help or accelerate heating! It&#x27;s practice and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Worst product.. Dont buy this.. And if u want to return it they ask us to pay 9$ for shipping... Its very hard to get off ur skin..dont waste ur money buying this stupid product.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal, but I would recommend buying multiple cartridge warmer.</li>
            <li> No funciona! Es muy dif&amp;iacute;cil retirar los residuos de la cera y adem&amp;aacute;s no quita todos los pelitos y hace el proceso muy doloroso.</li>
            <li> shipment arrived on time, as really all I asked for, but the product is too  sticky also I think that does not work for my skin type ,it was a little bit irritated.. I need someone else, please maybe you can help me,thankd</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this item. The roller is really good and wax gets heated up in about 30 minutes. I usually plug it in and go around doing some other stuff. Wax is a lil too sticky. Had to use baby oil to get rid of it. But stickier the better,, it works!! With this one, I&#x27;m loving to do waxing at home.</li>
            <li> It did not work properly the wax after 30 miutes and even more still was coming so pittifully and you beasicly must hurt yourself and the results were really poor it did not remove the facial hair properly or at all i must say. This was a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> My wife liked this a lot.</li>
            <li> I guess its good since I got it for wife.  personally I think shaving is faster and much more cleaner but wife thinks this is the way to go, I guess women like agonizing tortures bathroom time.</li>
