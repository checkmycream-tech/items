            <li>This stuff is awesome and makes my hair like silk.</li>
            <li>BEST SHAMPOO FOR DYED HAIR --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that the Naturtint Multiplier is so awesome</li>
            <li>It made my hair shiny and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy customer.</li>
            <li>both shampoo and multiplier are really very good products.</li>
            <li>Seems to have made my hair thicker after I color it, however, it still does a good job!</li>
            <li>Smells so good; a great shampoo!</li>
            <li>Very good product , just not as good as the Naturtint Nutrideep Multiplier,</li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>..since I use the naturtint hair color..this works great together...</li>
            <li>It is a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>You have to use a good amount when you wash your hair, or wash your hair twice to work up a good lather.</li>
            <li>shampoo helps your hair hold the color and gives it an incredible shine and healthy feel.</li>
            <li>and it is really good.</li>
            <li>so I might not be fair at this point.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel wonderful but not quite worth the effort</li>
            <li>The packet with the hair color is definitely better, don&#x27;t ask me why!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very mild and perfect fit to the multiplier.</li>
            <li>Having the shampoo is nice.</li>
            <li>its in a league all its own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of pricey for about 1/2 cup of product, too.</li>
            <li>This is a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, am grateful for this product and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>I loved the clean feeling from the shampoo...</li>
            <li>I bought it because I love Naturtint hair colors</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was any better than some department store brands.</li>
            <li>love this shampoo which came with my favorite brand of hair</li>
            <li>Nice sulphate free shampoo to go along with the Naturtint hair dye.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and shiny because I use this product.</li>
            <li>it had separated and the water was on top and the rest on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>It is better than most shampoos in stores.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Good texture, hair loves it, keeps shine and smells fresh</li>
            <li>They said that you don&#x27;t have to use more.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love using this shampoo when I dye my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I fell in love using the shampoo (and cond) with the Naturtint hair dye.</li>
            <li>This does not seem to get my hair very clean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great and appears to be new.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I searched for it on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I already bought two bottles and I am going to buy more of them in the future since the price is really good.</li>
            <li>I feel good when I know that I am putting a natural product on my body, since the skin absorbs the things we put on it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather up like the cheap brands, but leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel quite as rich as the shampoo that comes with the hair tint.  </li>
            <li>While I am very happy with the Nutrideep Multiplier cream (conditioner) I am not pleased with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people said it isn&#x27;t a full bottle.</li>
            <li>Was using the Naturtint Matisse for light tones and was very happy with it and not happy when it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>and I have to use more conditioner than normal.</li>
            <li>I understand that uses more natural products, i just did not like the way my hair felt afterwards.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Product was fine but bottle was only 1/2 full when I opened it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after talking with the Naturtint folks I learned that this shampoo is more organic than the former one was and hence safer.</li>
            <li>Gentle shampoo!  </li>
            <li>It is natural, light and doesnt leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>I am mostly grey with very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I do add a drop of my old biologe shampoo to the mix just because I suppose I need that lather feeling to think my hair is getting clean.  </li>
            <li>I have a straight hair and I have noticed that this shampoo leaves my hair dry up which requires more time in brushing.</li>
            <li>; I expected much more.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle to those who color their hair</li>
            <li>Then I recommend another shampoo for really weather beaten hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this shampoo but did not like it too much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam as much as cheaper shampoos.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product and I will recomment it to buy</li>
            <li>It gives it so much body.  </li>
            <li>and then it runs out fast.</li>
            <li>dye Nutramint - have for years but was still loyal to my usual brand, which used to wash out the color I had put into my hair,  Nutamint should be better</li>
            <li>The product from the seller seems adding the water to it and only 75% full when I received it.</li>
            <li>Love this brand but the shampoo is only half full.</li>
            <li>You need to buy an extra bottle because it goes quick.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all people especially the pregnant women.</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell as marvelous as some but doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li>but you do have to get used to using more shampoo than usual (thats get pricer) and that it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  </li>
            <li>and so it wasted faster and maybe because I am using it more often</li>
            <li>is very soft.  </li>
            <li>I expected it to be full.</li>
            <li>I think it was old??  </li>
            <li>My hair is SOFT using the shampoo with the multiplier too.</li>
            <li>I really have only used it once</li>
            <li>Bottle is half filled only...</li>
            <li>It stays the  rich brown that I get when I use the NaturTint Dark Blonde tint.  </li>
            <li>This new shampoo is in a smaller container so is more expensive</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This left my hair flat.  </li>
            <li> I use it when I use the Naturtint hair color because the packet that comes with the color is not enough for my long hair, but that is the only time that I use it.</li>
            <li> The liquid in the bottle came only a finger above half the bottle as if it was used.</li>
            <li> Same as other products you could buy off the shelf</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps the color in a long time !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be dissappointed using both, unless you have extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> Not much product for the money</li>
            <li> The only con I can think of is that it is such a small amount of shampoo and pretty expensive for the size.  </li>
            <li> It was not full to the very brim but very little missing.</li>
            <li> I expected to get same product what usually the offer in there hair color package and there is nothing even closer.</li>
            <li> like it does when I use other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It has been five weeks since I colored my hair and absolutely no fading!</li>
            <li> However, when I used it on an ordinary day, it lacked the same body infusion.  </li>
            <li> I use the Naturtint hair color and there is a little sample size of this shampoo and hair conditioner included.  </li>
            <li> disappointed in making my hair feel clean</li>
            <li> Big, big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling sort of dried out after I rinse</li>
            <li> Love the product but disappointed with the amount and the price !</li>
            <li> No more dandruff.</li>
            <li> No more allergic response.</li>
            <li> So, after using it a few times I got used to no lather and have discovered to my delight that my color does not fade at all!</li>
            <li> Also the bottle not full !!</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t suds, it is hard to massage it into the scalp.</li>
            <li> The results mean I buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> is very hard and the ingredients did not blend!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that this shampoo arrived not mixed together?  </li>
            <li> but i find it difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> what shampoo I have used (and I have tried plenty of expensive</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find it</li>
            <li> still LIKE it and will use it just difficult to have to purchase this item online</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Will never buy it again.  :(</li>
            <li> Very expensive for what they offer!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all.  Does not lather at all.  Not like the sample that comes with Naturtint hair color.  Big, big disappointment.  Will never buy it again.  :(</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a big fan of not putting parabens in the shampoo but i find it difficult to work with.  you have to use quite a bit to get a lather going and keep adding water.  it seems different than what comes with the hair color.  it makes my hair feel wonderful but not quite worth the effort</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  This left my hair flat.  I bought it because I love Naturtint hair colors and they work well... This does not.</li>
            <li> I have a straight hair and I have noticed that this shampoo leaves my hair dry up which requires more time in brushing.</li>
            <li> This does not seem to get my hair very clean. Since it doesn&#x27;t suds, it is hard to massage it into the scalp. I use it when I use the Naturtint hair color because the packet that comes with the color is not enough for my long hair, but that is the only time that I use it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good; a great shampoo!</li>
            <li> Not much product for the money; I expected much more. I don&#x27;t think it was any better than some department store brands.</li>
            <li> The product from the seller seems adding the water to it and only 75% full when I received it. It has been leaking in the package when I received it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel quite as rich as the shampoo that comes with the hair tint.  I have to use it twice to get any lather.  But my hair color stays longer and doesn&#x27;t fade to red like it does when I use other shampoos.  It stays the  rich brown that I get when I use the NaturTint Dark Blonde tint.  I use it with the NaturTint Hair Moisturizer and my hair is very soft.  I am mostly grey with very fine hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and makes my hair like silk. I would use it even without the dye they make. I don&#x27;t know why people said it isn&#x27;t a full bottle. It was not full to the very brim but very little missing. Same as other products you could buy off the shelf</li>
            <li> Bottle is half filled only...feeling cheated..i should have read reviews before buying..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even closer quality with the one I have used in the hair color package! Very disappointed. I expected to get same product what usually the offer in there hair color package and there is nothing even closer. Very expensive for what they offer!</li>
            <li> love this shampoo which came with my favorite brand of hair dye Nutramint - have for years but was still loyal to my usual brand, which used to wash out the color I had put into my hair,  Nutamint should be better</li>
            <li> Nice sulphate free shampoo to go along with the Naturtint hair dye. The hair dye sometimes includes shampoo and sometimes doesn&#x27;t for reasons that are quite mysterious. Having the shampoo is nice.</li>
            <li> Defferent from the one in the permanent box. No good.</li>
            <li> Seems to have made my hair thicker after I color it, however, it still does a good job!</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy and shiny because I use this product. It feels silky even though I color it every four weeks (also using Naturtint products).</li>
            <li> The shampoo that comes with the hair color is different then what arrived in the bottle.  The packet with the hair color is definitely better, don&#x27;t ask me why!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that this shampoo arrived not mixed together?  I had to shake is very hard and the ingredients did not blend!  it had separated and the water was on top and the rest on the bottom.  I think it was old??  I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> BEST SHAMPOO FOR DYED HAIR -- I COULD GO 2 MONTHS BETWEEN DYE JOBS!</li>
            <li> It is a good shampoo. It is better than most shampoos in stores. You have to use a good amount when you wash your hair, or wash your hair twice to work up a good lather. You need to buy an extra bottle because it goes quick.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle to those who color their hair but you do have to get used to using more shampoo than usual (thats get pricer) and that it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  I do add a drop of my old biologe shampoo to the mix just because I suppose I need that lather feeling to think my hair is getting clean.  Hopefully I can adjust and use this alone.</li>
            <li> I loved the clean feeling from the shampoo...also the shine and the color is holding longer in my hair...great product..since I use the naturtint hair color..this works great together...Judi in Hilton Head</li>
            <li> Very good product , just not as good as the Naturtint Nutrideep Multiplier, both shampoo and multiplier are really very good products. It&#x27;s just that the Naturtint Multiplier is so awesome its in a league all its own.  I recommend both and in fact, I have ordered both just prior to using the products I received in the Naturtint Coloring Box.  if there was a  3.5 I would have given this one that amount of stars.  I don&#x27;t think you will be dissappointed using both, unless you have extremely dry hair. Then I recommend another shampoo for really weather beaten hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this shampoo but did not like it too much. When i used a generous amount of shampoo, i would not feel as if it is cleaning my hair. I understand that uses more natural products, i just did not like the way my hair felt afterwards. I finished the product but do not think will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this. Used in combination the the harcolor, it does wonders for your hair.  Now, I use it between colorings.</li>
            <li> disappointed in making my hair feel clean</li>
            <li> Love this brand but the shampoo is only half full.</li>
            <li> Got a sample packet of this shampoo in my Naturtint coloring kit. I liked it so much I searched for it on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo helps your hair hold the color and gives it an incredible shine and healthy feel. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> No more dandruff. No more allergic response. My hair is SOFT using the shampoo with the multiplier too. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell as marvelous as some but doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It is runny and the bottle design doesn&#x27;t accommodate for that as well as it might. It doesn&#x27;t foam as much as cheaper shampoos. It&#x27;s kind of pricey for about 1/2 cup of product, too. The results mean I buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> I use the Naturtint hair color and there is a little sample size of this shampoo and hair conditioner included.  I really like this shampoo.  The only con I can think of is that it is such a small amount of shampoo and pretty expensive for the size.  Also, my hair color does not seem to fade with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always take it with a grain of salt with anything self-claimed to be &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Nature&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Good texture, hair loves it, keeps shine and smells fresh</li>
            <li> Was using the Naturtint Matisse for light tones and was very happy with it and not happy when it was discontinued. This new shampoo is in a smaller container so is more expensive and I did not like that it doesn&#x27;t lather like I was used to. Felt like you had to use more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after talking with the Naturtint folks I learned that this shampoo is more organic than the former one was and hence safer. They said that you don&#x27;t have to use more. So, after using it a few times I got used to no lather and have discovered to my delight that my color does not fade at all! It has been five weeks since I colored my hair and absolutely no fading! This has never happened no matter what shampoo I have used (and I have tried plenty of expensive ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, am grateful for this product and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> I am using this shampoo since March 14 and it is really good. It is difficult to find it so I tried to buy it from Amazon and this one is the same that is included in the naturtint color box. I already bought two bottles and I am going to buy more of them in the future since the price is really good.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo it keeps the color in. It is formulated to work with the coloring and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The liquid in the bottle came only a finger above half the bottle as if it was used. I expected it to be full.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great and appears to be new.  It made my hair shiny and wonderful.  I will refer this to my friends and relatives.  Received the shampoo in a timely manner.  I am very happy customer.</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps the color in a long time ! Used together with Naturtint color ! I will buy these two products Only !</li>
            <li> Gentle shampoo!  Kept the color longer without fading.</li>
            <li> Product was fine but bottle was only 1/2 full when I opened it.</li>
            <li> we like it a lot - it fits well I really recommend this product and I will recomment it to buy</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very mild and perfect fit to the multiplier. My hair is soft and smooth! Even my husband used it too after we dye our hair. I highly recommend this to all people especially the pregnant women.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  It is natural, light and doesnt leave any residue.  I feel good when I know that I am putting a natural product on my body, since the skin absorbs the things we put on it.</li>
            <li> While I am very happy with the Nutrideep Multiplier cream (conditioner) I am not pleased with the shampoo.  It leaves my hair feeling sort of dried out after I rinse and I have to use more conditioner than normal.</li>
            <li> Love the product but disappointed with the amount and the price ! Also the bottle not full !!</li>
            <li> I love using this shampoo when I dye my hair.  It gives it so much body.  However, when I used it on an ordinary day, it lacked the same body infusion.  I really have only used it once so I might not be fair at this point.  I will definitely give it another couple of shampoos before I totally decide.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t lather up like the cheap brands, but leaves my hair feeling clean. Love it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love using the shampoo (and cond) with the Naturtint hair dye. I bought a bottle and did not quite feel the same using it daily. I had to use alot to get it all through my hair and so it wasted faster and maybe because I am using it more often it didn&#x27;t feel as silky.&lt;br /&gt;I still LIKE it and will use it just difficult to have to purchase this item online and then it runs out fast.</li>
