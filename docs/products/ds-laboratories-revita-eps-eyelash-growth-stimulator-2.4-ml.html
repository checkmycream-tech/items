            <li>It dispense a droplet which I can then dip and apply to the lash line with more control.</li>
            <li>Love the click-button concept (like a writing pen), but sometimes the product is stubborned to come out and inconsistent in amount.</li>
            <li>If you already have nice, full top and bottom lashes, then there is no use to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>It will perfect what you already have and bring your lashes to their full potential, beyond what mine have ever been before.</li>
            <li>I have been using this consistently morning and night with amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I paid over $200 for latisse and could not tolerate the side effects of redness, itchiness, puffy eyes, and a huge increase in under eye circles.  </li>
            <li>Simply put, amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>Absolutely no side effects and great price.  </li>
            <li>They are full and well defined.  </li>
            <li>This really works, I plan on ordering some more</li>
            <li>If you skip applications, you won&#x27;t find success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far, far cheaper than  the physician products, AND can be used safely with light colored eyes.</li>
            <li>While I do not suffer from a lack of eyelashes, mine are very fine and short.</li>
            <li>I even use this on my brows and gaps that were missing hair have filled in quite nicely so that when it&#x27;s time to get them arched every 2 weeks my stylist has plenty of growth to work with.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m wearing mascara again, so I guess this stuff did (finally) work. :-)</li>
            <li>I first purchased this through my Salon.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase more when this current tube runs out, but I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Just use deligently, consistently, and be patient.  </li>
            <li>When you pump the applicator, sometimes nothing comes out first 2 pumps, then BAM...</li>
            <li>The first tube of Revita.</li>
            <li>I now have grown fuller and longer lashes where they were incredibly sparse before and the places where I didn&#x27;t have any are slowly but surely sending out little lashes.  </li>
            <li>I plan on continued use because of positive results.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply and will definitely give you longer lashes.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t see a large change, maybe about a 20% , but It does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I get asked daily who does my extensions, I tell them I was just born lucky!</li>
            <li>This product really Works.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see much difference without makeup because they are stick straight, but I no longer have to fight with mascara.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my lashes...</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I am 29 years old.  </li>
            <li>My upper lashes are far more lush.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>did I noticed more than a few of them fall out as I swiped the tip across.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it since early Febuary</li>
            <li>so far it seems to be working..</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old and my lashes are lacking the fullness they used to have.</li>
            <li>I started pumping into my hand instead of directly onto the lash line.</li>
            <li>Since I am 61 yrs old</li>
            <li>but this product really helps them grow back out.</li>
            <li>the product really does have to be used regularly and as instructed.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I&#x27;ve only had the product a short time, I am waiting to see if there is any growth in the next few weeks.  </li>
            <li>and I will keep on as long as the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>So I was so excited to try something that did not have negative side effects on my lashes.</li>

            <li> I use other similar products and have only had to use once</li>

            <li> I see a big improvement on one eye and some on the other.</li>

            <li> This product has helped every single follicle I have to grow a lash, and for the lashes that already existed they are longer.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it into your eyes.</li>
            <li> Other times I think, &amp;#34;eeh.</li>
            <li> Now my lashes are so long it&#x27;s hard to put mascara on without getting it on my brow bone.</li>
            <li> so I can use at least 1 time a day for as long as I can reach the results I want.  </li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t like the curly crazy lashes it produces) and a variety of the more expensive lash growth stimulators.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly skeptical and have tried multiple lash growers before with no or little results.  </li>
            <li> Applicator is slow to release the product.</li>
            <li> The results have been slow...</li>
            <li> I wanted a less expensive alternative to Grandelash MD and bought this one to try.  </li>
            <li> I want to see long lashes again but had very bad results with the batch from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Sorry ladies, this product doesnt work...</li>
            <li> Something weird to note however, after I used this product for about 2 weeks, a bunch of my eyelashes fell out.  </li>
            <li> afraid I forgot to use it.  </li>
            <li> Then I ordered 3 tubes at discounted price here on Amazon and received very bad results, breaking lashes, shorter now.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on your lases well-tends to clump. Applicator is slow to release the product. I did not see any improvement to my eyelash length.</li>
            <li> I tried this because someone recommended it.  I have now used two tubes and I see no noticeable changes.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry ladies, this product doesnt work... I have been using it since early Febuary and I havent noticed any extra growth at all. It may have lengthened my eye lashes a tiny tiny bit but I would never buy it or use it again.</li>
            <li> While I do not suffer from a lack of eyelashes, mine are very fine and short. This product has helped every single follicle I have to grow a lash, and for the lashes that already existed they are longer. I even use this on my brows and gaps that were missing hair have filled in quite nicely so that when it&#x27;s time to get them arched every 2 weeks my stylist has plenty of growth to work with. And the growth on my brows is accelerated with revita too! I have bought 3 of these and I will keep on as long as the price is reasonable. It doesn&#x27;t burn and lasts a long while, even when using it twice a day. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> afraid I forgot to use it.  i have no idea if it would have worked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks I see a big improvement on one eye and some on the other. I am thinking operator error is probably reason. I plan on continued use because of positive results. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product really Works. I used it for my eyebrows to fill them in. I highly recommend this product. Price is excellent also.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this &amp;#34;twice a day&amp;#34; as recommended, because I thought it would make my makeup bleed. so I just applied it at bed time.The results have been slow... I lost my eye lashes to chemo two years ago, and when they came back, they were just &amp;#34;nubbins&amp;#34; that I couldn&#x27;t put mascara on. Now I&#x27;m wearing mascara again, so I guess this stuff did (finally) work. :-)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t completed the treatment period yet.. so far it seems to be working.. the shopping experience, delivery and everything went great !</li>
            <li> I had to look and look to find the word &amp;#34;Twice&amp;#34;.  I use other similar products and have only had to use once a day.&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, I have not begun on this product.  I want to go back to once a day.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this through my Salon. I was there the day they gave the demo on it. So I was so excited to try something that did not have negative side effects on my lashes. I am 49 years old and my lashes are lacking the fullness they used to have. DS Revita EPS is the bomb! It really does work! It can also be used on your eyebrows as well. Use it 2x a day and your lashes will actually look like they did in your 20&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I dont know if this product is working or not but I guess I have not been using it every day for the time I have been using it it seems like is doing something to my eyelashes</li>
            <li> this stuff works so well, that you begin to see results in a very short time...have had many people comment on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply and will definitely give you longer lashes. I have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!!! within a week I could tell the difference, 2 months I have amazing eyelashes. I get asked daily who does my extensions, I tell them I was just born lucky!</li>
            <li> It works for me, lashes are longer.</li>
            <li> I odered on line to save money from the salon retail price. However the packageing was the same but the results were extremely different.</li>
            <li> Yes it does work. You won&#x27;t see a large change, maybe about a 20% , but It does what it says it will do. I have only been using for 5 weeks so I have a ways to go. I will keep you informed.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use as directed; will give it another try</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It works!</li>
            <li> Really works! I&#x27;m in love with this product &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am overall very happy with this product.  Something weird to note however, after I used this product for about 2 weeks, a bunch of my eyelashes fell out.  I wasn&#x27;t noticeable until I went to put the serum on my eyelid did I noticed more than a few of them fall out as I swiped the tip across.  I am still using this product and occasionally I notice a few, but nothing like the initial fall out.  No pain or discomfort from this product either.  I have experienced increased length and thickness, but it&#x27;s not what I had hoped for. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase more when this current tube runs out, but I would recommend.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I am 29 years old.  I paid over $200 for latisse and could not tolerate the side effects of redness, itchiness, puffy eyes, and a huge increase in under eye circles.  I have been using this consistently morning and night with amazing results.  I literally had maybe 3 lower eyelashes.  I now have grown fuller and longer lashes where they were incredibly sparse before and the places where I didn&#x27;t have any are slowly but surely sending out little lashes.  My upper lashes are far more lush.  You can&#x27;t see much difference without makeup because they are stick straight, but I no longer have to fight with mascara.  They are full and well defined.  The are all over beautiful.  I was incredibly skeptical and have tried multiple lash growers before with no or little results.  I read the research before purchasing and it was legit.  Absolutely no side effects and great price.  I still have over half of the product left and will DEFINITELY be ordering again.  Just use deligently, consistently, and be patient.  If you already have nice, full top and bottom lashes, then there is no use to buy this product.  It is not going to give you tangled skyscraper eyelashes that will eventually fall out like latisse.  It will perfect what you already have and bring your lashes to their full potential, beyond what mine have ever been before.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;ve only had the product a short time, I am waiting to see if there is any growth in the next few weeks.  If not, I will not purchase any additional product.</li>
            <li> Oh gosh...who knows if this works?  I&#x27;ve used Latisse (didn&#x27;t like the curly crazy lashes it produces) and a variety of the more expensive lash growth stimulators. This product was recommended when another leading brand left the market.  I&#x27;ve been using it several months.  Sometimes I think it&#x27;s doing something. Other times I think, &amp;#34;eeh. Is it?&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m going to give it the 12-mo test.  TIP:  When you pump the applicator, sometimes nothing comes out first 2 pumps, then BAM...a big droplet of the milky liquid squirts out on your lid.  I started pumping into my hand instead of directly onto the lash line. 3rd time seems to be a charm. It dispense a droplet which I can then dip and apply to the lash line with more control. Be careful not to get it into your eyes. It stings.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference in my lashes...</li>
            <li> This is some GOOD STUFF!</li>
            <li> I had tried it for 2 weeks and saw no results but now I am going on 4 weeks and &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; am seeing results.  This really works, I plan on ordering some more so I can use at least 1 time a day for as long as I can reach the results I want.  Since I am 61 yrs old my eyelashes have a problem  growing back after that they fall out but this product really helps them grow back out.</li>
            <li> I wanted a less expensive alternative to Grandelash MD and bought this one to try.  I can&#x27;t tell yet if it works because these products take months to make a difference.</li>
            <li> The first tube of Revita.EPS purchased for $50. from my salon at full price gave me great results. I loved it and decided to shop online. Then I ordered 3 tubes at discounted price here on Amazon and received very bad results, breaking lashes, shorter now. I checked expiration and all packaging and appears to be same product but results were very different. I want to see long lashes again but had very bad results with the batch from Amazon.I&#x27;m going to contact DS Labs about results.</li>
            <li> Simply put, amazing! This stuff works, and immediately. Within days I saw a difference. Now my lashes are so long it&#x27;s hard to put mascara on without getting it on my brow bone. It&#x27;s far, far cheaper than  the physician products, AND can be used safely with light colored eyes. The ONLY fault I&#x27;d give is the applicator. Love the click-button concept (like a writing pen), but sometimes the product is stubborned to come out and inconsistent in amount. Otherwise, very, very pleased and will continue to purchase. One note of caution... the product really does have to be used regularly and as instructed. If you skip applications, you won&#x27;t find success.</li>
