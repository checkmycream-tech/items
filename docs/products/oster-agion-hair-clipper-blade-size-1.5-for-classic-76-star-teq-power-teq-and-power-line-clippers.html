            <li>I needed this for my Oster 76 and it works great.</li>
            <li>the blade was great.</li>
            <li>Yes great item</li>
            <li>,told them to try them they will be happy that they did.</li>
            <li>Not at all happy with this sellers shipping.</li>
            <li>great quality.</li>
            <li>Have a very nice day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been working as a barber and using Oster clippers and blades for 45 years, and they always do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good everything.</li>
            <li>Appears to be well made and of good quality.</li>
            <li>This product does work quite well, but the non agion blades are not as good.</li>
            <li>and he is happy and pleased! :)</li>
            <li>I start with this level and add to it to fade to the top !</li>
            <li>oster are the best clippers buy really comes with blades.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and used to use an Wahl clipper, primarily because of price.  </li>
            <li>I then contacted the seller who insisted it was a newer and better technology than the Agio.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is, how many time do you use a 1 1/2 ??</li>
            <li>As A Barber you want the best tools that last and Oyster always delivers with just that.</li>
            <li>Also you can sharpen them many times before you have to replace them</li>
            <li>Nice clean cut...</li>
            <li>I need more time using it to fully be able to say for sure how good it really is.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, the 76 classic seems to cut more evenly on a #1 anyway, so I feel its a superior product above/beyond the convenience of having a 1.5 blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>summer months, I would use a #1 guard against the grain for a light ceasar.  </li>
            <li>This is important if you are doing lots of fades and raking the hair.</li>
            <li>It cuts great, its just not the same.</li>
            <li>Simply put, these are a great pair of blades.</li>
            <li>It was my own fault for mishandling it, but you can find youtube clips for putting it back together if you&#x27;re savy with that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with it so far.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Life is so much easier!</li>
            <li>Comes oiled in the package and ready to go.</li>
            <li>THANKS TO OSTER, THERE&#x27;S ISN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>If you have that much time, if you think that you may take chance,you may try your luck with these seller.</li>
            <li>with everything costing so much</li>
            <li>I received my item reasonably fast</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought my 76 classic, I learned I could get a 1.5 blade and could get a more even cut for my dark ceasar by just going against the grain.  </li>
            <li>They are selling people the normal clipper blade instead of the AgION blade.  </li>
            <li>I was also charged a few dollars more for the cheaper blade.</li>
            <li>When I track it it says it&#x27;s still in New Jersey</li>
            <li>How am I gonna do a 1.5 length haircut with my blade still in New Jersey?</li>
            <li>While the original Oster blades cut just fine, I don&#x27;t appreciate the false advertising.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not a professional barber, I just trim my family member&#x27;s hair, because I have more boys than girls, I thought that I may collect all the blades for later use, if I can not solve this problem, I will have the same size blade in my collection box, or I can not order another blade for a while.</li>
            <li>all the items to them, I then got the label, but I have to pay  nearly $4.00 shipping fee for their mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was surprised to see that I was sent the non-agion blade Oster 1 1/2.  </li>
            <li>They give you an even, professional looking cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I started reading about the durability of the Oster 76 classic, I didn&#x27;t realize there would be a second benefit to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, all metal 1.5 blade will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Blade was on the AgION as shown in the picture and the tips and grooves of this blade are much sharper than my other Oster blades.  </li>
            <li>The blade assembly for 76 classic blades was harder for me to reconfigure than the Wahl clippers, so I ended up buying another.  </li>

            <li> one small caveat to the blade.  </li>
            <li> The point of the agion&#x27;s still blade is not as sharp and also does not rust when cutting wet hair.</li>
            <li> do have a complaint though,</li>

            <li> I cut my own hair and used to use an Wahl clipper, primarily because of price.  When I started reading about the durability of the Oster 76 classic, I didn&#x27;t realize there would be a second benefit to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For summer months, I would use a #1 guard against the grain for a light ceasar.  Cutting against the grain made it easier to ensure an even cut.  During the fall through spring months, I&#x27;d use a #1 with the grain to leave a darker cut, but it was always harder to ensure an even cut.  Wahl didn&#x27;t make a 1.5 guard and the next grade otherwise left too much hair when cutting against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought my 76 classic, I learned I could get a 1.5 blade and could get a more even cut for my dark ceasar by just going against the grain.  Incidentally, the 76 classic seems to cut more evenly on a #1 anyway, so I feel its a superior product above/beyond the convenience of having a 1.5 blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one small caveat to the blade.  I dropped my blade once and altered the assembly.  The blade assembly for 76 classic blades was harder for me to reconfigure than the Wahl clippers, so I ended up buying another.  It was my own fault for mishandling it, but you can find youtube clips for putting it back together if you&#x27;re savy with that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> I needed this for my Oster 76 and it works great. Comes oiled in the package and ready to go.</li>
            <li> THANKS TO OSTER, THERE&#x27;S ISN&#x27;T A HAIR LEFT ON MY HEAD! NOR IS THERE A HAIR ANYWHERE ELSE ON MY BODY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working as a barber and using Oster clippers and blades for 45 years, and they always do a good job.  This clipper is for the professional hair cutter, and it would  be a little expensive for someone who uses it once or twice a month for home use.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy staff from this seller, I bought two blades from them, it took over 10 days to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box, I realized that they wrote the sizes on the envelope was wrong, and they sent me a wrong order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started to contact with them by amazon customer service, by email, but nobody answered my call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got amazon people sent email to me about returnjng all the items to them, I then got the label, but I have to pay  nearly $4.00 shipping fee for their mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok,  I sent the package back to them for a few days, I got the tracking number and delivered information, I noticed them about getting the refund, but still nobody answered my call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to file a claim today, I have sent another email to them again, I am still waiting their  answer. I used a lot of times to deal with this seller, what should I do next?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional barber, I just trim my family member&#x27;s hair, because I have more boys than girls, I thought that I may collect all the blades for later use, if I can not solve this problem, I will have the same size blade in my collection box, or I can not order another blade for a while. Anyway, that means  I have to wait for some days to finish my collection,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have that much time, if you think that you may take chance,you may try your luck with these seller.</li>
            <li> This blade is cutting fine and I am satisfied with it so far. I need more time using it to fully be able to say for sure how good it really is.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the agion blade as indicated by the seller, received the standard blade.&lt;br /&gt;The agion blade is no longer made by oster</li>
            <li> the blade was great. with everything costing so much i had to cut cost some where so i started cutting my own hair. oster are the best clippers buy really comes with blades. this blade was perfect for what i have to do. and it looks like i can out of the barbershop.</li>
            <li> Yes great item and I told everyone that I know about it ,told them to try them they will be happy that they did.</li>
            <li> Blade was on the AgION as shown in the picture and the tips and grooves of this blade are much sharper than my other Oster blades.  This blade can be painful to use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item expecting to get what I paid for. Instead I got a no brand clipper and not the Agion Collection I ordered. I then contacted the seller who insisted it was a newer and better technology than the Agio.  I was not convenience being that the box didn&#x27;t even specify any of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company does bad business by try to sell me something i did not order and a very bad sales pitch by telling me is even better than what I order without even being able to prove it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend who cuts hair, he says it works as expected and he is happy and pleased! :)</li>
            <li> Not at all happy with this sellers shipping. They said I would receive my blade by today oct 9th. It&#x27;s still not here. When I track it it says it&#x27;s still in New Jersey I&#x27;m in Massachusetts. How am I gonna do a 1.5 length haircut with my blade still in New Jersey?.. I placed my order on 9.30.13..all other sellers that I placed orders with on that day and said I would receive by October. 9 I have already received them... What&#x27;s the problem with this one? I don&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good everything. Will recommend for other people. We are very happy with it. Have a very nice day.</li>
            <li> I received my item reasonably fast but I was surprised to see that I was sent the non-agion blade Oster 1 1/2.  This isn&#x27;t a product review but I know this has happened to a few others.  Not sure if its a private seller mistake or amazon.  But it definitely doesn&#x27;t add up and can be classified as false advertising.  I purchased the agion clipper with amazon prime so I wasn&#x27;t going with the cheapest bidder either.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as I expected. Worth the price. Nothing else to say but, I&#x27;m happy! And that is all to me.</li>
            <li> Yes it is, how many time do you use a 1 1/2 ?? I start with this level and add to it to fade to the top ! Life is so much easier! This product is everything you think it is ! Perfect ...</li>
            <li> this product was just as described and instantly changed the look on my haircut. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> They are selling people the normal clipper blade instead of the AgION blade.  I had read about this situation in other reviews thinking this is probably resolved by now - IT ISN&#x27;T.</li>
            <li> No problems at all with this blade. Works very well. Would recommend it. Appears to be well made and of good quality.</li>
            <li> As A Barber you want the best tools that last and Oyster always delivers with just that. Bad tools cost you big.&lt;br /&gt;They stay sharp and last a long time in between required service.  Also you can sharpen them many times before you have to replace them</li>
            <li> I am a licensed barber and I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this product. I also received a non Agion blade. This product does work quite well, but the non agion blades are not as good. I ordered a product that I never received. I was also charged a few dollars more for the cheaper blade. Agion is an antimicrobial coating that prevents the growth of bacteria. The point of the agion&#x27;s still blade is not as sharp and also does not rust when cutting wet hair. This is important if you are doing lots of fades and raking the hair. The cheaper blade has a tendency to pull out the hair follicle. It cuts great, its just not the same. I would recommend sanding the edges down a bit before use.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, all metal 1.5 blade will last a long time. More expensive than other clippers, but there is no comparison to the Oster 76 in terms of quality and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Nice clean cut...great quality. It&#x27;s a 4mm length which might be a # 1 on some brands of hair clippers</li>
            <li> The item shipped to me is NOT what is in the description or the picture. I did not receive an Agion Oster Blade, i instead received a WAHL brand blade.</li>
            <li> Simply put, these are a great pair of blades. They give you an even, professional looking cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a complaint though, but it&#x27;s against the company who shipped the blades and not the blades themselves: The Store Advertise the blades as the AgION series blades. THEY WERE NOT the AgION series blades. While the original Oster blades cut just fine, I don&#x27;t appreciate the false advertising. Hopefully, that company has corrected this inconsistency.</li>
