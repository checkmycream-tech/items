            <li>Great Aveeno product.</li>
            <li>Transitioning to this moisturizer has been great.</li>
            <li>After some research including talking to a couple doctors, I discovered why Vitamins A, C, and E are great for your skin and for the scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No greasy feeling, no chemical smells, just a great product.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>Aveeno does great products and I like a lot of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Price wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>It smells great, makes my skin glow (in a good way) and has SPF.  </li>
            <li>Great for the price and is a really good product.</li>
            <li>Great product and good price.</li>
            <li>It does have a pleasant but strongish fruity/floral fragrance which isn&#x27;t needed in a sunblock.</li>
            <li>but I found it quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>This lotion feels fairly lightweight, not sticky.</li>
            <li>Does not leave sticky film, dries fairly soon after application,  </li>
            <li>After a couple of skin cancer removals (thankfully basal), it occurred to me suncreen might be a good idea too.</li>
            <li>and it fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>loved that it  has vitamins A,C,and E and sunscreen to protect my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Really good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the sunscreen, but it has bonus Vitamin A, C, and E in it, which is so good for the skin.</li>
            <li>I love this and will def keep using it!</li>
            <li>Good product, but the smell is too strong!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of years now and it was great to find it available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This was a great price and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>It is very strongly scented in an attempt to cover up the sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>This scent is strong and LASTS!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite summer moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it might be an okay trade off.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, mostly in the T-zone.</li>
            <li>and I was sure it was from this product since I did not change anything else in my beauty</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am adding that to the top of the review because someone pointed out that this review showed up under some Aveeno night cream -</li>
            <li>:) I tend to get sun baked on my boat and doing outdoor activities.</li>
            <li>What else can I say? :-)</li>
            <li>As in, I can still smell it more than three hours after I&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this day-time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product smells like sunblock and acts like it too.&lt;br /&gt;After wearing it outdoors I felt the need to clean my face off since dirt seemed to be catching in it.  </li>
            <li>I think it was?), and it also has a light scent that I&#x27;m not really sure how to describe but smells nice! :D   </li>
            <li>It has a nice, mild scent that I don&#x27;t mind that often.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then I&#x27;m sure this product is great.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily, but this went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t sit on top of my face.</li>
            <li>What I appreciated about it is that it has a good SPF, and that is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>is the only kind that not only does the absolute best job of moisturizing, but also has a lovely pleasant scent that makes it enjoyable to put on.</li>
            <li>I burn easily but not with this stuff on</li>
            <li>The best moisturizer I used so far with sun block, it keeps my skin glowing and nourished the whole day.</li>
            <li>It has an extremely strong fruity smell.</li>
            <li>really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this any time soon, because no other moisturizer has been this perfect for my face.</li>
            <li>Light, smooth creme - not greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;- Washes off hands easily after application&lt;</li>
            <li>I also use the night cream in this line and also find it light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This stuff sat on my skin, just like cheap sunblock.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that often I do not need foundation-once it&#x27;s all absorbed the two work together to leave a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I had been using Aveeno&#x27;s Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer for years which worked great for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to be walking around with people thinking I smell like I bathed in cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>My skin always looks fresh and healthy now, part of which I think is because of the vitamins in this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Every time I find a light moisturizer for wearing under my makeup, it seems it is discontinued.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to people with sensitive skin looking for superior UV protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile...I started taking some medication that makes me photo sensitive, and already had fair skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it has a clean light scent, it&#x27;s not overly greasy, and for me, it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Contains sunscreen - and claims to be SPF 30 which is higher than many sunscreen doped skin cremes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion has a higher SPF than most daytime face lotions, but without the sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>This may work for some and if you have dry skin I could see that this would be a great face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>(a full pump is more than twice than the amount you need, by the way), I get really, really oily within an hour or two;</li>
            <li>I felt this product was a good facial sunblock, but it wasn&#x27;t what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>When I go out on a boat or golfing, this wouldn&#x27;t be enough for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>When I go out on a boat or golfing, this wouldn&#x27;t be enough for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I can see how it may be strong for some people but it fades away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>If no other review has provided you any information on whether this moisturizer is good for oily skin, let me be the first.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is light for daily use and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick service</li>
            <li>I love the higher SPF, and Aveeno has historically been great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but a little strong, wears off quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze</li>
            <li>But this does seem to help avoid burning in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional note -&lt;br /&gt;For intense sun exposure, I would still use a true sunscreen (like bullfrog 50!)</li>

            <li>Besides the Polish brand called Ziaja, Aveeno smart Essentials is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>What I would like about it, if I could actually use it, is that it smells amazing, and has SPF.</li>
            <li>(But to me, worth it.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>(But to me, worth it.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each person has to find a moisturizer that is right for their skin type.</li>
            <li>Right.</li>
            <li>in all, this moisturizer is okay and comes with a few more annoyances than I&#x27;d prefer.</li>
            <li>I honestly never quite understood what people meant by that until I experienced this.</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes for this Aveeno product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different Aveeno face products, and still have no luck finding any</li>
            <li>I most likely will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And because I found it interfered with the perfumes I was wearing, and I take my perfumes pretty darn</li>
            <li>but this seems like a good everyday product that can help limit exposure.</li>
            <li>but this seems like a good everyday product that can help limit exposure.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause any other problems and seems to work I will be thrilled.</li>
            <li>It is all natural, is absorbed, and you will NOT break out!  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different sunblocks for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>The moisture makes my face feel very smooth and the sunscreen works good enough for me without feeling all thick and pancakey, I would know it works</li>
            <li>And of course, the positive reviews didn&#x27;t hurt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to say something positive here, but I just don&#x27;t know what.</li>
            <li>for my face and the container is large</li>
            <li>This is promising.</li>
            <li>and they also don&#x27;t wash off my hands very well after</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really trust the SPF rating of anything - soon they will have to prove it to label the SPF levels however.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really trust the SPF rating of anything - soon they will have to prove it to label the SPF levels however.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, but I have combo/oily skin</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need that much moisture.</li>
            <li>It seems like no matter how much of this I put on</li>
            <li>This product is oil-free but it leaves you skin very oily.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>The lotion is simply okay, thick and feels nice enough.</li>
            <li>It does blend better than a lot of other moisturizers with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used that many Aveeno products, so I don&#x27;t know how the SPF moisturizer compares to other products from their line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because I really like everything else about this moisturizer - absorbs well, not greasy, high SPF, but the smell is just too much for me to take</li>
            <li>Odor - seems very light - less than any soap or shampoo</li>
            <li>Odor - seems very light - less than any soap or shampoo</li>
            <li>And it would sweat off or wash off too soon to last a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - for what it is designed to be -</li>
            <li>And it would sweat off or wash off too soon to last a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - for what it is designed to be -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The supposed added skin benefits make me feel a little better about using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the little bottle pump is really cute.</li>
            <li>BUT, since it doesn&#x27;t seem to make me oilier than normal</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li>At first, my skin was really smooth and soft, but after a couple of days, my skin was chapped, had dry patches, and was red and burning.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cream because it is very moisturizing, &amp; at the same time the cream has some UV protection.</li>
            <li>Contains Vitamins A, C and E in one creme - hard to find that in one product (at least when I checked)&lt;br /&gt;- Light, smooth creme - not greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;- Washes off hands easily after application&lt;</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like other day-time moisturizers with sun screen, because they were really thick and greasy, but this one is great.</li>
            <li>This review is for Aveeno Smart Essentials Daily Nourishing Moisturizer, 2.5 Ounce.</li>
            <li>so when I was looking for a moisturizer and daily scrub, I decided to try Smart Essentials.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally a fan of Aveeno products since they usually do what they say, however they haven&#x27;t had any products for preventing aging that were okay for combo/oily skin until this.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh/clean scent, which may bother some who are sensitive</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li>#34;you would really benefit from using a daily moisturizing cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who isn&#x27;t sensitive to scented products and even enjoys fragrance in her products.</li>
            <li>Well, it looks like I might be in the minority here, but this moisturizer smells like perfume a 12 year old would wear.</li>
            <li>Having recently moved to Florida, I was really looking for a moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I dont know why, maybe it was the sunscreen or because i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that lightly moisturizes, has a decent SPF factor of at least 20, preferably 30, has antioxidants AND will work well for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>It is easy for me to burn all year round, even in Western NY.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the SPF was only 15 and and I wanted to transition to a product with superior UV protection.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell, which isn&#x27;t a bad smell, but it is strong.  </li>
            <li>This is very thick and moisturizing which I love</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin/lips on your face that reacts to various lotions, this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li>It does the job but just barely.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the sunscreen smell is still present, so you have to live with that and the overly strong perfume scent.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s light, it has a clean light scent, it&#x27;s not overly greasy, and for me, it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Contains sunscreen - and claims to be SPF 30 which is higher than many sunscreen doped skin cremes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion has a higher SPF than most daytime face lotions, but without the sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This may work for some and if you have dry skin I could see that this would be a great face moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> (a full pump is more than twice than the amount you need, by the way), I get really, really oily within an hour or two;</li>
            <li> I felt this product was a good facial sunblock, but it wasn&#x27;t what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> When I go out on a boat or golfing, this wouldn&#x27;t be enough for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> When I go out on a boat or golfing, this wouldn&#x27;t be enough for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I can see how it may be strong for some people but it fades away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> If no other review has provided you any information on whether this moisturizer is good for oily skin, let me be the first.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is light for daily use and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick service</li>
            <li> I love the higher SPF, and Aveeno has historically been great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but a little strong, wears off quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze</li>
            <li> But this does seem to help avoid burning in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional note -&lt;br /&gt;For intense sun exposure, I would still use a true sunscreen (like bullfrog 50!)</li>

            <li> Besides the Polish brand called Ziaja, Aveeno smart Essentials is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> What I would like about it, if I could actually use it, is that it smells amazing, and has SPF.</li>
            <li> (But to me, worth it.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> (But to me, worth it.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each person has to find a moisturizer that is right for their skin type.</li>
            <li> Right.</li>
            <li> in all, this moisturizer is okay and comes with a few more annoyances than I&#x27;d prefer.</li>
            <li> I honestly never quite understood what people meant by that until I experienced this.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this Aveeno product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different Aveeno face products, and still have no luck finding any</li>
            <li> I most likely will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And because I found it interfered with the perfumes I was wearing, and I take my perfumes pretty darn</li>
            <li> but this seems like a good everyday product that can help limit exposure.</li>
            <li> but this seems like a good everyday product that can help limit exposure.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause any other problems and seems to work I will be thrilled.</li>
            <li> It is all natural, is absorbed, and you will NOT break out!  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different sunblocks for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> The moisture makes my face feel very smooth and the sunscreen works good enough for me without feeling all thick and pancakey, I would know it works</li>
            <li> And of course, the positive reviews didn&#x27;t hurt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to say something positive here, but I just don&#x27;t know what.</li>
            <li> for my face and the container is large</li>
            <li> This is promising.</li>
            <li> and they also don&#x27;t wash off my hands very well after</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really trust the SPF rating of anything - soon they will have to prove it to label the SPF levels however.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really trust the SPF rating of anything - soon they will have to prove it to label the SPF levels however.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, but I have combo/oily skin</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need that much moisture.</li>
            <li> It seems like no matter how much of this I put on</li>
            <li> This product is oil-free but it leaves you skin very oily.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> The lotion is simply okay, thick and feels nice enough.</li>
            <li> It does blend better than a lot of other moisturizers with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used that many Aveeno products, so I don&#x27;t know how the SPF moisturizer compares to other products from their line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because I really like everything else about this moisturizer - absorbs well, not greasy, high SPF, but the smell is just too much for me to take</li>
            <li> Odor - seems very light - less than any soap or shampoo</li>
            <li> Odor - seems very light - less than any soap or shampoo</li>
            <li> And it would sweat off or wash off too soon to last a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - for what it is designed to be -</li>
            <li> And it would sweat off or wash off too soon to last a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - for what it is designed to be -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The supposed added skin benefits make me feel a little better about using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the little bottle pump is really cute.</li>
            <li> BUT, since it doesn&#x27;t seem to make me oilier than normal</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> At first, my skin was really smooth and soft, but after a couple of days, my skin was chapped, had dry patches, and was red and burning.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cream because it is very moisturizing, &amp; at the same time the cream has some UV protection.</li>
            <li> Contains Vitamins A, C and E in one creme - hard to find that in one product (at least when I checked)&lt;br /&gt;- Light, smooth creme - not greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;- Washes off hands easily after application&lt;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like other day-time moisturizers with sun screen, because they were really thick and greasy, but this one is great.</li>
            <li> This review is for Aveeno Smart Essentials Daily Nourishing Moisturizer, 2.5 Ounce.</li>
            <li> so when I was looking for a moisturizer and daily scrub, I decided to try Smart Essentials.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a fan of Aveeno products since they usually do what they say, however they haven&#x27;t had any products for preventing aging that were okay for combo/oily skin until this.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh/clean scent, which may bother some who are sensitive</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> #34;you would really benefit from using a daily moisturizing cream&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who isn&#x27;t sensitive to scented products and even enjoys fragrance in her products.</li>
            <li> Well, it looks like I might be in the minority here, but this moisturizer smells like perfume a 12 year old would wear.</li>
            <li> Having recently moved to Florida, I was really looking for a moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I dont know why, maybe it was the sunscreen or because i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that lightly moisturizes, has a decent SPF factor of at least 20, preferably 30, has antioxidants AND will work well for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> It is easy for me to burn all year round, even in Western NY.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the SPF was only 15 and and I wanted to transition to a product with superior UV protection.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell, which isn&#x27;t a bad smell, but it is strong.  </li>
            <li> This is very thick and moisturizing which I love</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin/lips on your face that reacts to various lotions, this product may not be for you.</li>
            <li> It does the job but just barely.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the sunscreen smell is still present, so you have to live with that and the overly strong perfume scent.</li>
            <li> It has a similar thick texture (I actually like the texture a little better) and it hasn&#x27;t caused any stinging like some other moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> It, however, does not properly penetrate and balance the moisture in my combination, sometimes oily sometimes dry skin.</li>
            <li> Next up, looking for a product that evens skin tone and balances moisture for combination skin that gets mostly dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to always use this in the daytime and outside because of my dry skin and sensitivity to sun.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and not only that I woke up with a new pimple and my face was itchy around my jaw line, which is where I break out often.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn my face into a total oil slick a couple hours after putting it on-- major plus!     </li>
            <li> On my upper lip and chin, I had a red rash and small, visible bumps that itched constantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to have found a cheaper alternative to my Dermalogica Smoothing Cream which can get fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be finicky, not quite dry but not oily either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of moisturizers and they either make my face too greasy, too dry, or irritate it.</li>
            <li> Even in dry summer months, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dry skin.</li>
            <li> In warmer weather I would get oily but with dry skin underneath and in the winter I have to sometimes apply it twice after washing to feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it, my skin is noticeably dry</li>
            <li> It moisturizes dry area but doesn&#x27;t leave that shiny/greasy film on the oily area.</li>
            <li> There are only sunscreen ingredients listed as the active ingredients on the bottle and it states that its use is for sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> /peeling again ( I have very dry skin.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few moisturizer brands, as my face has always been very dry, including patches of psoriasis, and prone to getting freckles (hence the need for daily moisturizer with sunblock in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall a waste of money.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use in the morning and evening after cleansing, I find my face feeling dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> got this because at the time it was cheaper than my usual SPF lotion, and I wanted to get some extra benefits to my skin during the day time.</li>
            <li> It also seems to have helped keep away acne (which other moisturizers tend to aggravate for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my usual moisturizer I put it on and within a couple hours my skin is dry and flaking</li>
            <li> Smell gets nauseating after a few uses, and it made my face feel extremely oily when it shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> My skin responds well and my blemishes are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, this product contains an SPF of 30, which my previous moisturizer didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use less than half a pump (I&#x27;m assuming I use about a 1/3 to a 1/4 of a pump)</li>
            <li> and now I have a couple of spares at less cost than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> So hopefully I have helped someone that is looking for a little research on what type of skin this is for and what type it is NOT for.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff regularly everyday.  </li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin) or what, but unfortunately, this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I use it all year round during the day and Ziaja at night.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend anyone to buy this product because it&#x27;s just plain to oily.</li>
            <li> putting foundation powder on top doesn&#x27;t seem to help either, which is shocking to me considering how matte it usually helps me stay for a few hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on a little thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this claims to be oil-free, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d agree.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the scent</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find stuff that isn&#x27;t pancakey.  </li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I was really disappointed in the smell, but figured I could tough it out until I used up the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a THICK moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But I thought about it and decided maybe it wasn&#x27;t such a bad idea since I have to wear this face for the rest of my life</li>
            <li> I tend to break out if using the wrong product and this did not cause that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid  of EVOO.</li>
            <li> and I feel uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t entirely unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very dirty with that \\&quot;greasy,\\</li>
            <li> But I hate them because they make my skin clogged up and greasy</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite summer moisturizer.  It smells great, makes my skin glow (in a good way) and has SPF.  I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Definitely not for me. Made my skin excessively oily and gross which caused more breakouts than usual. Sunscreen did not help either. Overall a waste of money. My skin tends to be finicky, not quite dry but not oily either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that lightly moisturizes, has a decent SPF factor of at least 20, preferably 30, has antioxidants AND will work well for my oily skin. This is promising. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple days now. The scent is pleasant but a little strong, wears off quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze so that&#x27;s acceptable. It doesn&#x27;t turn my face into a total oil slick a couple hours after putting it on-- major plus!     I&#x27;m a bit turned off by the texture it gives my skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb well and sits on my skin-- I honestly never quite understood what people meant by that until I experienced this. BUT, since it doesn&#x27;t seem to make me oilier than normal I&#x27;m thinking it might be an okay trade off. I&#x27;m generally a fan of Aveeno products since they usually do what they say, however they haven&#x27;t had any products for preventing aging that were okay for combo/oily skin until this. I will have to update when I&#x27;ve used this for a while longer; If it doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause any other problems and seems to work I will be thrilled.</li>
            <li> I chose this product without researching, but I&#x27;m happy with it!  It&#x27;s supposed to be a daily moisturizer and sunscreen (30 spf I think it was?), and it also has a light scent that I&#x27;m not really sure how to describe but smells nice! :D   The moisture makes my face feel very smooth and the sunscreen works good enough for me without feeling all thick and pancakey, I would know it works cause I burn easily but not with this stuff on and I have an oily face so it&#x27;s hard to find stuff that isn&#x27;t pancakey.  I love this and will def keep using it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is light for daily use and smells nice. It absorbs into the skin cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. I tend to break out if using the wrong product and this did not cause that. I also use the night cream in this line and also find it light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff regularly everyday.  I have oily skin, mostly in the T-zone. All I have to do is think about zits and end up with a bump on my face.  Though I use this regularly 1 - 2 times a day along with the matching facial scrub, I do not breakout.  My skin responds well and my blemishes are less noticeable. This line of products are a staple in my facial products. Hope it is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> The ingredients aren&#x27;t the best considering it&#x27;s by Aveeno but it isn&#x27;t entirely unpleasant. It does blend better than a lot of other moisturizers with sunscreen. Too fragranced for me. Just give it 10 minutes before you put makeup on over it.</li>
            <li> If no other review has provided you any information on whether this moisturizer is good for oily skin, let me be the first.  I have oil, acne prone skin.  The only reason I purchased this product is because I was researching on the internet what would help with my sebum that is way over produced at that time of the month, and one suggestion was vitamin A.  Well this was the only thing in the store that had vitamin A written on the label.  This may work for some and if you have dry skin I could see that this would be a great face moisturizer.  HOWEVER, if you have oily skin, don&#x27;t bother.  It is very heavy and not only that I woke up with a new pimple and my face was itchy around my jaw line, which is where I break out often.  It does have a strong smell, which isn&#x27;t a bad smell, but it is strong.  So hopefully I have helped someone that is looking for a little research on what type of skin this is for and what type it is NOT for.</li>
            <li> I felt this product was a good facial sunblock, but it wasn&#x27;t what I hoped it would be.  I was looking for a daily moisturizer that contains sunblock.  This product smells like sunblock and acts like it too.&lt;br /&gt;After wearing it outdoors I felt the need to clean my face off since dirt seemed to be catching in it.  This stuff sat on my skin, just like cheap sunblock.  I had higher hopes for this Aveeno product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different Aveeno face products, and still have no luck finding any I am not allergic to. If you have sensitive skin/lips on your face that reacts to various lotions, this product may not be for you. I used this lotion, along with the Aveeno radiant facewash, for 1 week before developing a severe skin reaction around my mouth. On my upper lip and chin, I had a red rash and small, visible bumps that itched constantly. Having had a similar reaction to Aveeno (and Garnier) products before, I suspected this moisturizer (and facewash) were at fault. I discontinued use and it still took over a week for the reaction to go away- and I was sure it was from this product since I did not change anything else in my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product because I figured I wouldn&#x27;t react since it says &amp;#34;HYPOALLERGENIC.&amp;#34; Not the case, at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, then I&#x27;m sure this product is great. What I would like about it, if I could actually use it, is that it smells amazing, and has SPF. However, it also adds lots of oil, so beware of having a shiny face.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I used so far with sun block, it keeps my skin glowing and nourished the whole day.</li>
            <li> Best Moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different sunblocks for my fair skin. It is easy for me to burn all year round, even in Western NY. This lotion feels fairly lightweight, not sticky. My skin is oily, but this went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t sit on top of my face. This doesn&#x27;t have the microbead particles that seem to be a problem in the \\&quot;lifting and firming\\&quot; earlier version from Aveeno. It does have a pleasant but strongish fruity/floral fragrance which isn&#x27;t needed in a sunblock.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive combination skin and I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year with no problems. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of moisturizers and they either make my face too greasy, too dry, or irritate it.This is very thick and moisturizing which I love and it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin or cause any redness. I use it after showering and before applying makeup and my last bottle lasted me 4 months. Great for the price and is a really good product.</li>
            <li> Good product, but the smell is too strong!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I&#x27;m excited to have found a cheaper alternative to my Dermalogica Smoothing Cream which can get fairly expensive. As an added bonus, this product contains an SPF of 30, which my previous moisturizer didn&#x27;t. Yes, there is a fragrance to it. It&#x27;s a fresh/clean scent, which may bother some who are sensitive but I found it quite pleasant. It&#x27;s a THICK moisturizer. I have combination/dry skin and it works well for me. I use less than half a pump (I&#x27;m assuming I use about a 1/3 to a 1/4 of a pump) for my face and the container is large so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Each person has to find a moisturizer that is right for their skin type. It&#x27;s tricky. This works for me....Arrived quickly. Does not leave sticky film, dries fairly soon after application,  I use it during the day to refresh my skin. I also use EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) on my face morning and night . I&#x27;ve found that often I do not need foundation-once it&#x27;s all absorbed the two work together to leave a healthy glow. I then apply a bronzer and eye make-up...good to go. Don&#x27;t be afraid  of EVOO. It is all natural, is absorbed, and you will NOT break out!  Great Aveeno product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to dryness. I had been using Aveeno&#x27;s Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer for years which worked great for my skin. Unfortunately, the SPF was only 15 and and I wanted to transition to a product with superior UV protection. Transitioning to this moisturizer has been great. It has a similar thick texture (I actually like the texture a little better) and it hasn&#x27;t caused any stinging like some other moisturizers do. Even in dry summer months, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dry skin. I would recommend this product to people with sensitive skin looking for superior UV protection.</li>
            <li> It is very strongly scented in an attempt to cover up the sunscreen smell. Unfortunately the sunscreen smell is still present, so you have to live with that and the overly strong perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer when I was traveling and had left my moisturizer at home. It does the job but just barely. What I appreciated about it is that it has a good SPF, and that is what I was looking for. It, however, does not properly penetrate and balance the moisture in my combination, sometimes oily sometimes dry skin. In warmer weather I would get oily but with dry skin underneath and in the winter I have to sometimes apply it twice after washing to feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about seven weeks now and don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s the moisturizer for me. I most likely will not purchase this again. Next up, looking for a product that evens skin tone and balances moisture for combination skin that gets mostly dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> This review is for Aveeno Smart Essentials Daily Nourishing Moisturizer, 2.5 Ounce. I am adding that to the top of the review because someone pointed out that this review showed up under some Aveeno night cream - that&#x27;s an error with Amazon&#x27;s review engine apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so...First off, I&#x27;m a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once got a facial at a resort and they said &amp;#34;you would really benefit from using a daily moisturizing cream&amp;#34;. Right. Throw me the football. Moisturizing creme?! Get me a beer. Let&#x27;s go to the beach. But I thought about it and decided maybe it wasn&#x27;t such a bad idea since I have to wear this face for the rest of my life :) I tend to get sun baked on my boat and doing outdoor activities. So over time, I picked a couple of moisturizing lotions up and tried them - but wasn&#x27;t too impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile...I started taking some medication that makes me photo sensitive, and already had fair skin. After a couple of skin cancer removals (thankfully basal), it occurred to me suncreen might be a good idea too. (Brilliant.) But I hate them because they make my skin clogged up and greasy and they also don&#x27;t wash off my hands very well after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a couple of scars that I wanted to try to minimize over time. After some research including talking to a couple doctors, I discovered why Vitamins A, C, and E are great for your skin and for the scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went looking for a product with sunscreen, vitamins A, C, and E, that was lightweight and not greasy. Also nothing with an effeminant odor or preferably with no odor at all. I found this and it fit the bill perfectly. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years and my gal loves it too so now she uses it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- Convenient pump dispenser&lt;br /&gt;- Contains sunscreen - and claims to be SPF 30 which is higher than many sunscreen doped skin cremes.&lt;br /&gt;- Contains Vitamins A, C and E in one creme - hard to find that in one product (at least when I checked)&lt;br /&gt;- Light, smooth creme - not greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;- Washes off hands easily after application&lt;br /&gt;- Odor - seems very light - less than any soap or shampoo would impart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- About 2x the price of similar products in a drug store. (But to me, worth it.)&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t really trust the SPF rating of anything - soon they will have to prove it to label the SPF levels however. But this does seem to help avoid burning in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional note -&lt;br /&gt;For intense sun exposure, I would still use a true sunscreen (like bullfrog 50!) but this seems like a good everyday product that can help limit exposure. When I go out on a boat or golfing, this wouldn&#x27;t be enough for my fair skin. And it would sweat off or wash off too soon to last a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - for what it is designed to be - I give it 5 stars.)&lt;br /&gt;- Light, smooth creme - not greasy at all&lt;br /&gt;- Washes off hands easily after application&lt;br /&gt;- Odor - seems very light - less than any soap or shampoo would impart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- About 2x the price of similar products in a drug store.

            <li> It&#x27;s light, it has a clean light scent, it&#x27;s not overly greasy, and for me, it works. What else can I say? :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great daily moisturizer. It goes on a little thick then it melts into the skin without leaving residue. I actually like the scent of this moisturizer. I can see how it may be strong for some people but it fades away pretty quickly. The pump is a definite plus as well.</li>
            <li> I came across this product by chance at Target and decided to try it out.  I love the higher SPF, and Aveeno has historically been great for my sensitive skin.  No greasy feeling, no chemical smells, just a great product.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a higher SPF than most daytime face lotions, but without the sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> i bought this product to use as a facial moisturizer....loved that it  has vitamins A,C,and E and sunscreen to protect my face and neck.  After two weeks of use in the morning and evening after cleansing, I find my face feeling dry and tight.  It feels like an abrasive was applied.  Tonight I had to wash it off.  There are only sunscreen ingredients listed as the active ingredients on the bottle and it states that its use is for sunscreen.  I thought i was purchasing a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used that many Aveeno products, so I don&#x27;t know how the SPF moisturizer compares to other products from their line.&lt;br /&gt;I got this because at the time it was cheaper than my usual SPF lotion, and I wanted to get some extra benefits to my skin during the day time. And of course, the positive reviews didn&#x27;t hurt either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to say something positive here, but I just don&#x27;t know what. The lotion is simply okay, thick and feels nice enough. It&#x27;s very moisturizing if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, but I have combo/oily skin so I don&#x27;t need that much moisture. The supposed added skin benefits make me feel a little better about using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Although this claims to be oil-free, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d agree. It seems like no matter how much of this I put on (a full pump is more than twice than the amount you need, by the way), I get really, really oily within an hour or two; putting foundation powder on top doesn&#x27;t seem to help either, which is shocking to me considering how matte it usually helps me stay for a few hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I have with this lotion is the fragrance. Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who isn&#x27;t sensitive to scented products and even enjoys fragrance in her products. This scent is strong and LASTS! As in, I can still smell it more than three hours after I&#x27;ve applied it. It annoys me because I shouldn&#x27;t have to smell my moisturizer on my face... ever. And because I found it interfered with the perfumes I was wearing, and I take my perfumes pretty darn seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this moisturizer is okay and comes with a few more annoyances than I&#x27;d prefer. I&#x27;ll use up my bottle, but will definitely be going back to my tried and trusted Cerave SPF30 AM Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product is oil-free but it leaves you skin very oily. I would not recommend this Aveeno moisturizer for anyone with oily skin like myself. I find myself having to wipe off the excess oil even after applying this moisturizer. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product because it&#x27;s just plain to oily. It leaves my skin feeling very dirty with that \\&quot;greasy,\\&quot; look to it. I definitely would not buy this product ever again.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to always use this in the daytime and outside because of my dry skin and sensitivity to sun. A great product.</li>
            <li> Really good for my skin. If I don&#x27;t use it, my skin is noticeably dry and I feel uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Aveeno products so when I was looking for a moisturizer and daily scrub, I decided to try Smart Essentials.  At first, my skin was really smooth and soft, but after a couple of days, my skin was chapped, had dry patches, and was red and burning.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the scent (I have sensitive skin) or what, but unfortunately, this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and I&#x27;m really satisfied. Aveeno does great products and I like a lot of them.</li>
            <li> Best face cream I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause oily skin or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years now and it was great to find it available on Amazon.  Quick service and now I have a couple of spares at less cost than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love this day-time moisturizer. It has a nice, mild scent that I don&#x27;t mind that often. I use this after I cleanse and tone. It is lightweight, and non-greasy. It soaks into the skin well and goes well under makeup too. I bought it for the sunscreen, but it has bonus Vitamin A, C, and E in it, which is so good for the skin. I didn&#x27;t like other day-time moisturizers with sun screen, because they were really thick and greasy, but this one is great. It moisturizes really well. It&#x27;s great. I would definitely buy it again. And the little bottle pump is really cute.</li>
            <li> With my usual moisturizer I put it on and within a couple hours my skin is dry and flaking/peeling again ( I have very dry skin.) But this kept my skin moisturized all day...will buy again.</li>
            <li> Well, it looks like I might be in the minority here, but this moisturizer smells like perfume a 12 year old would wear. It has an extremely strong fruity smell. When I first put it on, I was really disappointed in the smell, but figured I could tough it out until I used up the bottle. Then this morning about an hour after I had put it on, my husband leaned in to give me a kiss and said \\&quot;What do you have on? You smell awful!\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a shame, because I really like everything else about this moisturizer - absorbs well, not greasy, high SPF, but the smell is just too much for me to take and I don&#x27;t want to be walking around with people thinking I smell like I bathed in cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Smell gets nauseating after a few uses, and it made my face feel extremely oily when it shouldn&#x27;t have. Price wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Besides the Polish brand called Ziaja, Aveeno smart Essentials is my absolute favorite. It moisturizes dry area but doesn&#x27;t leave that shiny/greasy film on the oily area. I use it all year round during the day and Ziaja at night.</li>
            <li> I really like the cream because it is very moisturizing, &amp; at the same time the cream has some UV protection.</li>
            <li> Gift for my sister.  She likes the way it makes her skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few moisturizer brands, as my face has always been very dry, including patches of psoriasis, and prone to getting freckles (hence the need for daily moisturizer with sunblock in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only kind that not only does the absolute best job of moisturizing, but also has a lovely pleasant scent that makes it enjoyable to put on. My skin always looks fresh and healthy now, part of which I think is because of the vitamins in this moisturizer. It also seems to have helped keep away acne (which other moisturizers tend to aggravate for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this any time soon, because no other moisturizer has been this perfect for my face.</li>
            <li> Every time I find a light moisturizer for wearing under my makeup, it seems it is discontinued. Having recently moved to Florida, I was really looking for a moisturizer with sunscreen. Finally, I found this one! It absorbs into my skin well and moisturizes and protects at the same time. I highly recommend it. This was a great price and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> It burned my skin. I dont know why, maybe it was the sunscreen or because i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price.</li>
