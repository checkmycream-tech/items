    <ol>
            <li>This product does an excellent job of softening  up those whiskers before shaving.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaving oil for me</li>
            <li>but this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li>Awesome preshave.</li>
            <li>(AoS has the BEST Sandalwood scent), and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This works great..</li>
            <li>It also smells great</li>
            <li>You will not be happy if you do that.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling too, like peperment candy.</li>
            <li>It feels great, improves a shave and is competitively priced.  </li>
            <li>Putting a layer of this stuff on your skin, then hand applying shaving cream or hand applying soap works great.</li>
            <li>Proraso works for me and makes my face feel great during and after the shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great, smells great and affordable item!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>You might find it works great for you.</li>
            <li>It seems to assist with a smoother shave and it has a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Helps lubricate skin for easier shaves, and moisturizes, pleasant not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it smells great (kind of piney) and leaves your face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>Ok.. the good part...   </li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Not too oily but provides good protection.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Ever since then it has given me consistently good performance</li>
            <li>He has used it before and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil.</li>
            <li>As far as the oil itself; it&#x27;s great and gives a wonderful shave.  </li>
            <li>However, this oil will add that much more to a pleasant shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Combine them for a really nice shave.</li>
            <li>) Wash my face with soap or cleanser and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Has a nice aroma to it too that isnt too overpowering.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li>I would rate this 5 stars but a good lather from a shave is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff already.</li>
            <li>I love shaving with shaving oils..</li>
            <li>So 4.5 stars for shave... could it be better ..</li>
            <li>It seems like the bottle designpictured would be much better.  </li>
            <li>I may try others when this runs out but for now I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I got a bottle of this and was amazed at how much better it works.</li>
            <li>Love this product and gave it a five star rating because I have never had such a great shave without it!!</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>you age, the idea of placing a buffering layer of oil between the blades and your face becomes more appealing.  </li>
            <li>- you can use it by itself, but most people use it in conjunction with shaving cream or soap.</li>
            <li>I love this shave oil.  </li>
            <li>love this product, will order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the flip top cap, but as others have posted, the bottle does leak.</li>
            <li>Better than any gel or foam on the market.</li>
            <li>Too many words needed for this review</li>
            <li>With this shave oil, I am able to shave against the grain</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li>I like a nice, smooth, non-irritating shave.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s how to get the closest, most comfortable shave you&#x27;ll ever experience:  1.  </li>
            <li>I promise you that your shave will be closer and more comfortable than you&#x27;ve ever had it before, and with fewer nicks and bumps.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, works great  and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Them main differences are the smell (American Crew has a very pleasant smell) and the container (King of Shaves&#x27;s container is much better!)    </li>
            <li>The oil also seems to protect the skin much better and has greatly reduced the number of cuts and especially the irritation.  </li>
            <li>I then splash some more hot water and then lather up with shaving cream on top of the oil.  </li>
            <li>and so I ordered a bottle and it has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say, it&#x27;s worth it, but it, buy lots of it and be grateful.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent and the shaving comfort that goes along with</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for shaving.</li>
            <li>Reduces the chances of cuts significantly since my purchase.</li>
            <li>I can get a much closer shave and be a lot more comfortable afterward with this stuff.    </li>
            <li>I ended up putting all the oil into the old bottle, which had a flip top rather than a screw on top.</li>
            <li>my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a pleasant smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am able to get an amazingly close shave with no nicks or cuts and most importantly, no irritation at all.    </li>
            <li>It was if I had switched surfaces and was running my finger along a soft, warm marble.</li>
            <li>it smells clean and fresh..     </li>
            <li>During the summer I shave the sides of my head for a true \\&quot;High and Tight\\&quot; and the shaving oil makes a huge difference in the amount of irritation.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the oil can cause the razor to become \\&quot;clogged\\&quot; easier and so requires more frequent washing under running water during the shave</li>
            <li>do find that in order to get the most comfortable shave possible, I have to apply oil on my face in between passes, not just before I start shaving.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that nothing will guarantee an irritation free shave unless you clean and soften your beard first, plus use a high quality shave cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several highly (4+ stars) and they were pretty good</li>
            <li>Even with a dull razor I got a great shave with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I ideally try to either shower with hot water, use a hot towel on my face, or at the very least splash my face with hot water before shaving to soften up the hairs.  </li>
            <li>Overall though I have been extremely satisfied with this product and with the quality of shave</li>
            <li>Folks, first let me go ahead and say that you should NOT shave with this oil alone.  </li>
            <li>Rather, use this to prep your face first, before using shaving gel/cream.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a shaving oil</li>
            <li>I like to presoak and hot towel and do all the essentials for shaving to give me the safest and closest shave in one application.  </li>
            <li>I tried this oil to save some money over a higher priced oil.  </li>
            <li>I have never found anything better than this American Crew shave oil, for me, but your skin may vary.</li>
            <li>This was the first pre-shave oil I bought, and it reduced my irritation and shaving difficulty</li>
            <li>My grouse is againt the flat top design and not the product (shave oil).  </li>
            <li>I was certainly underwhelmed when I saw the size of the bottle</li>
            <li>One reviewer certainly does, and what do you have to lose, there is probably some in your kitchen</li>
            <li>If you like a good tight shave without the skin irritation, this oil will lubricate your face and those tough neck areas and it smells good to boot.  </li>
            <li>the flat lid design seem to make the liquid go over the lid and it does not drip easily.  </li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>the razor blades glide, and you don&#x27;t bleed as much, even by  Thursday or Friday&#x27;s shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tightened it as much as I dare, which has stopped the leak for now.</li>
            <li>I recommend ordering from the product I linked because the UPC in its description matches the box I got, and I now absolutely recommend that product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blood all over the AoS side, smooth shaving on the American Crew</li>
            <li>Blood all over the AoS side, smooth shaving on the American Crew</li>
            <li>To my chagrin, this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t need much of it to apply on your skin).</li>
            <li>so you end up using a bit more, but the price for such a big bottle still makes it well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am grateful that no one was at home just then as I enjoyed using a considerable string of vulgarisms in praise of the oil and my suddenly baby butt face.</li>
            <li>I have since gone back to my original oil.</li>
            <li>But it keeps my safety razor shiny and clean, and I have never had such a supiror shave!</li>
            <li>I read other reviews complaining about the spout, but I may have received a different style since this one was similar to eye dropper and made dispensing easy and tidy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several shave oils, the same way I&#x27;ve tried several different blades (Feather and Blue Bird work best for me), and several different shave creams (I like Prorasso and Art of Shaving but for the most part I haven&#x27;t found much difference with shave creams).</li>
            <li>The smell is decent and it can be used to shave without any added products.</li>
            <li>reviewers have mentioned that the flip-top bottle leaks compared to an older style screw-on lid.</li>
            <li>reviewers have mentioned that the flip-top bottle leaks compared to an older style screw-on lid.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>I then shave as I normally would.    </li>
            <li>Be sure to use the more expensive Essential Oil, as it seems to lubricate better than their other version.  </li>
            <li>wet your face with hot water first and foremost  2.  </li>
            <li>With a brush, I just put  drop or two of the shave oil directly onto the soap cake, them swirl the brush around as normal.</li>
            <li>Without the help of reviewers here, I wouldn&#x27;t have tried American Crew in the first place.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle shown in the picture on Amazon is not the bottle I received, mine had a flat top which makes getting the oil out a little more messy</li>
            <li>I am the old fashioned person who still uses a straight razor which, as is well known, does produce the smoothest possible shave.</li>
            <li>wait a few minutes until you get a light tingle, allowing the oil to penetrate a bit  4.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin like me but absolutely can not go without a daily (sometimes twice daily) close shave.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to shaving with a safety razor after hearing about how much closer of a shave you get and the much lower long run cost for blades.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I used it (in place of my previous shave oil which ran out), I received a noticeably smoother, closer shave.</li>
            <li>wet your face again with hot water  5.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend American Crew Essential Shave Oil to anyone who wants to prevent razor burn, bumps or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>The down side.. is it really worth more than &#x27;Shave Secret&#x27; ...</li>
            <li>Also per usual, the oil tends to get all over the medicine cabinet, no matter how clean you keep it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money because you use so little.  </li>
            <li>This time I got the new FLAT bottle</li>
            <li>Shave secret works about the same smells a little different but is a lot more cheap...    </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, go ahead and try regular old castor oil or even canola oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different oils and really like American Crew Essential Shave Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day I slathered the oil on, foamed up and tool a &amp;#34;trial pass&amp;#34; down my left cheek.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you give this oil a try, even if you already use some other shave oil.</li>

            <li> the razor blades glide, and you don&#x27;t bleed as much, even by  Thursday or Friday&#x27;s shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tightened it as much as I dare, which has stopped the leak for now.</li>
            <li> I recommend ordering from the product I linked because the UPC in its description matches the box I got, and I now absolutely recommend that product.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Blood all over the AoS side, smooth shaving on the American Crew</li>
            <li> To my chagrin, this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t need much of it to apply on your skin).</li>
            <li> so you end up using a bit more, but the price for such a big bottle still makes it well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I am grateful that no one was at home just then as I enjoyed using a considerable string of vulgarisms in praise of the oil and my suddenly baby butt face.</li>
            <li> I have since gone back to my original oil.</li>
            <li> But it keeps my safety razor shiny and clean, and I have never had such a supiror shave!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews complaining about the spout, but I may have received a different style since this one was similar to eye dropper and made dispensing easy and tidy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several shave oils, the same way I&#x27;ve tried several different blades (Feather and Blue Bird work best for me), and several different shave creams (I like Prorasso and Art of Shaving but for the most part I haven&#x27;t found much difference with shave creams).</li>
            <li> The smell is decent and it can be used to shave without any added products.</li>
            <li> reviewers have mentioned that the flip-top bottle leaks compared to an older style screw-on lid.</li>
            <li> reviewers have mentioned that the flip-top bottle leaks compared to an older style screw-on lid.</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I then shave as I normally would.    </li>
            <li> Be sure to use the more expensive Essential Oil, as it seems to lubricate better than their other version.  </li>
            <li> wet your face with hot water first and foremost  2.  </li>
            <li> With a brush, I just put  drop or two of the shave oil directly onto the soap cake, them swirl the brush around as normal.</li>
            <li> Without the help of reviewers here, I wouldn&#x27;t have tried American Crew in the first place.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle shown in the picture on Amazon is not the bottle I received, mine had a flat top which makes getting the oil out a little more messy</li>
            <li> I am the old fashioned person who still uses a straight razor which, as is well known, does produce the smoothest possible shave.</li>
            <li> wait a few minutes until you get a light tingle, allowing the oil to penetrate a bit  4.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin like me but absolutely can not go without a daily (sometimes twice daily) close shave.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to shaving with a safety razor after hearing about how much closer of a shave you get and the much lower long run cost for blades.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I used it (in place of my previous shave oil which ran out), I received a noticeably smoother, closer shave.</li>
            <li> wet your face again with hot water  5.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend American Crew Essential Shave Oil to anyone who wants to prevent razor burn, bumps or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The down side.. is it really worth more than &#x27;Shave Secret&#x27; ...</li>
            <li> Also per usual, the oil tends to get all over the medicine cabinet, no matter how clean you keep it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money because you use so little.  </li>
            <li> This time I got the new FLAT bottle</li>
            <li> Shave secret works about the same smells a little different but is a lot more cheap...    </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, go ahead and try regular old castor oil or even canola oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different oils and really like American Crew Essential Shave Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day I slathered the oil on, foamed up and tool a &amp;#34;trial pass&amp;#34; down my left cheek.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend you give this oil a try, even if you already use some other shave oil.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of American Crew Essential Shave oil.  </li>
            <li> The Art of Shaving is the closest to using plain old Castor Oil, and is actually the most expensive as well.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to like the FLAT bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy and leaves a greasy feel on your hands, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> it closed when I travel with it because otherwise it could easily open up in my toiletry bag and spill everywhere.</li>
            <li> Plus it lasts a long long time.    </li>
            <li> seems to cause drag on the razor and did the opposite of what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li> I hope that American Crew will get rid of the flat bottle and revert back to the small tip cap.</li>
            <li> Feeling surely this couldn&#x27;t last, I did the rest of my face-no touching-took my slightly moist towel that has a bit of astringent in it, wiped off the bits of foam that always hide-always check behind at least one ear-</li>
            <li> I always got those little white bumps on my neck and irritated skin everywhere else.</li>
            <li> No more red bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes a small amount to cover</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has somewhat of a warming effect not unlike some other pre-shave, warming creams.&lt;br /&gt;Significantly</li>
            <li> Peppermint, mineral and other aromatic oils are combined in this nicely-scented pre-shave product.</li>
            <li> If you wet your face sufficiently - it needs a lot of water to work!</li>
            <li> -- other products seem to vary in their effectiveness with razor type, skin wetness, or other uncontrollable factors.</li>

            <li> I was skeptical, as I&#x27;m a daily shaver</li>

            <li> It is too thick and feels filmy on my facce.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find sometimes, but not at Amazon!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have used it as a base in addition to shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> As others have already stated, the container used is horribly designed!  </li>
            <li> The Amazon pic shows a screw-top but if you order it, it&#x27;ll come with a snap-top, which works horribly.    </li>
            <li> Especially in cold months, protect your face before you remove a dermal layer or two with a steel blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before using this shave oil, I got terrible razor burn when trying to shave against or across the grain on my chin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was certainly underwhelmed when I saw the size of the bottle but I&#x27;m very happy with the product so far. Even with a dull razor I got a great shave with this stuff. Best of all, it smells great (kind of piney) and leaves your face feeling very smooth. So despite the amount you get for the price, you&#x27;re almost getting a shaving oil and aftershave. I love this stuff already.</li>
            <li> Ok.. the good part...   This works great.. I love shaving with shaving oils.. it smells clean and fresh..     The down side.. is it really worth more than &#x27;Shave Secret&#x27; ... Shave secret works about the same smells a little different but is a lot more cheap...    So 4.5 stars for shave... could it be better .. I dunno.. hoping to find a 5 someday.    For price... I dunno .. I guess a 2.5 ... take 5 bucks off and it goes up 2 stars.. but until then .. it gets an overall 3 star rating..</li>
            <li> I recently switched to shaving with a safety razor after hearing about how much closer of a shave you get and the much lower long run cost for blades.  When I started, I was just using shaving cream and I would occasionally get an uncomfortable shave and some skin irritation.  I had heard about shaving oil and decided to give it a try.  I found a few websites that recommended this product and so I ordered a bottle and it has made a huge difference.  I am able to get an amazingly close shave with no nicks or cuts and most importantly, no irritation at all.    I ideally try to either shower with hot water, use a hot towel on my face, or at the very least splash my face with hot water before shaving to soften up the hairs.  I then use just a few drops of this oil, don&#x27;t need much at all, and let it soak into my beard to further soften it.  I then splash some more hot water and then lather up with shaving cream on top of the oil.  I have seen people say you can shave with just the oil but I find that the oil and shaving cream combo makes for a smoother, closer shave.  I then shave as I normally would.    The oil seems to act as a lubricant to allow the blade to slide over the skin and also softens up the hair to allow the blade to cut them easier; I noticed the biggest difference when shaving against the grain.  The oil also seems to protect the skin much better and has greatly reduced the number of cuts and especially the irritation.  It also smells great and I have found that I have no need for aftershave anymore since using this product.  I have noticed that the oil can cause the razor to become \\&quot;clogged\\&quot; easier and so requires more frequent washing under running water during the shave but I don&#x27;t consider that a big deal.  Also, the bottle shown in the picture on Amazon is not the bottle I received, mine had a flat top which makes getting the oil out a little more messy and I usually end up with oil all over the front of the bottle.  It seems like the bottle designpictured would be much better.  Overall though I have been extremely satisfied with this product and with the quality of shave I get by using it.</li>
            <li> Folks, first let me go ahead and say that you should NOT shave with this oil alone.  You will not be happy if you do that.  Rather, use this to prep your face first, before using shaving gel/cream.  Here&#x27;s how to get the closest, most comfortable shave you&#x27;ll ever experience:  1.  wet your face with hot water first and foremost  2.  rub a few drops (some people say 2-3 drops is enough, I liberally use about 7-8 drops) into your beard-area well  3.  wait a few minutes until you get a light tingle, allowing the oil to penetrate a bit  4.  wet your face again with hot water  5.  apply shaving cream/gel of your choice  6.  shave  I promise you that your shave will be closer and more comfortable than you&#x27;ve ever had it before, and with fewer nicks and bumps.  You&#x27;ll never shave without shaving oil again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a shaving oil so I do not have others to compare too.  I have used it as a base in addition to shaving cream.  It seems to assist with a smoother shave and it has a pleasant fragrance.  I read other reviews complaining about the spout, but I may have received a different style since this one was similar to eye dropper and made dispensing easy and tidy.  I may try others when this runs out but for now I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;d used pre-shaving shave oil before to use under my regular shaving cream and it worked well.  American Crew&#x27;s shaving oil is a bit expensive compared to King of Shaves shaving oil, and they both work the same.  Them main differences are the smell (American Crew has a very pleasant smell) and the container (King of Shaves&#x27;s container is much better!)    As others have already stated, the container used is horribly designed!  When putting a couple of drops on my palm the oil leaks a bit on the side making for a slippery bottle next time you use it.  I also have to scotch tape it closed when I travel with it because otherwise it could easily open up in my toiletry bag and spill everywhere. The Amazon pic shows a screw-top but if you order it, it&#x27;ll come with a snap-top, which works horribly.    When I run out of of this shaving oil I&#x27;ll probably go back to the King of Shaves one because of the container.</li>
            <li> I had always used shaving creams and gels and always got my face torn up by the razor. I always got those little white bumps on my neck and irritated skin everywhere else. I got a bottle of this and was amazed at how much better it works. Plus it lasts a long long time.    I use it for both my face and my head in the summer. During the summer I shave the sides of my head for a true \\&quot;High and Tight\\&quot; and the shaving oil makes a huge difference in the amount of irritation. I can get a much closer shave and be a lot more comfortable afterward with this stuff.    I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin like me but absolutely can not go without a daily (sometimes twice daily) close shave.</li>
            <li> Love this product and gave it a five star rating because I have never had such a great shave without it!! I did not know what I was missing out on. Great smelling too, like peperment candy. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that its a bit like soap. It begins to lather and wash off with water. But it keeps my safety razor shiny and clean, and I have never had such a supiror shave! No more red bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of American Crew Essential Shave oil.  I love the product.  This time I got the new FLAT bottle and I don&#x27;t seem to like the FLAT bottle.  When you try to pour a few drops of shave oil the flat lid design seem to make the liquid go over the lid and it does not drip easily.  I have been experimenting with different angles of pouring and still have the problem.  My grouse is againt the flat top design and not the product (shave oil).  I hope that American Crew will get rid of the flat bottle and revert back to the small tip cap.</li>
            <li> .. for a smoother, less irritating shave.  Works well with their shave cream.  Combine them for a really nice shave.</li>
            <li> The Shave oil was on my grandson&#x27;s Christmas list.  He has used it before and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This shave oil has eliminated 80% of the irritation on my neck and face. And this little bottle lasted longer than six months. I knocked out down a star because of the bottle itself. I ended up putting all the oil into the old bottle, which had a flip top rather than a screw on top. Will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have never used a pre-shave product before.  Now I only wish I had.  This product does an excellent job of softening  up those whiskers before shaving.  This, combined with a shaving cream or gel, there is no way you can cut yourself or get razor burn.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I started using a variety of pre-shave oils a couple years ago to prevent ingrown hairs and skin irritation.  I&#x27;ve tried several different oils and really like American Crew Essential Shave Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash my face with soap or cleanser and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply Shave Oil&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply Shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;4) Shave&lt;br /&gt;5) Rinse&lt;br /&gt;6) Apply Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I prefer American Crew Essential Shave Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small amount to cover my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;It also has somewhat of a warming effect not unlike some other pre-shave, warming creams.&lt;br /&gt;Significantly increases the lubrication for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;No razor burn, bumps or ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The Price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend American Crew Essential Shave Oil to anyone who wants to prevent razor burn, bumps or ingrown hairs.  It feels great, improves a shave and is competitively priced.  I&#x27;ve reordered and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Consider the concept of dragging surgically-sharp steel over your face daily.  You are removing one or two of the seven layers of skin with each shave.  Do store-bought gels and foams protect you from cuts and irritation by time Friday&#x27;s shave rolls around?  (One blade cartridge should equal 5-6 shaves in my book.)  No?  Then read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you age, the idea of placing a buffering layer of oil between the blades and your face becomes more appealing.  Then, you do something about it.  Take this Am Crew product.  Peppermint, mineral and other aromatic oils are combined in this nicely-scented pre-shave product. Does not burn. Rub it on your beard...lather up...the razor blades glide, and you don&#x27;t bleed as much, even by  Thursday or Friday&#x27;s shave.  Wisdom and satisfaction.  Especially in cold months, protect your face before you remove a dermal layer or two with a steel blade.</li>
            <li> Helps lubricate skin for easier shaves, and moisturizes, pleasant not overpowering smell. If you wet your face sufficiently - it needs a lot of water to work! - you can use it by itself, but most people use it in conjunction with shaving cream or soap. One problem I had was, I like to use shaving soap and a brush. Putting this stuff on your face and then brushing soap over it doesn&#x27;t work well. Putting a layer of this stuff on your skin, then hand applying shaving cream or hand applying soap works great. With a brush, I just put  drop or two of the shave oil directly onto the soap cake, them swirl the brush around as normal. Thickens and slickens the soap. My current routine is to put a drop or two onto the solid block of Mama bear&#x27;s unscented, then whip up a lather with the brush, use the brush to slap the resulting foam onto my face. Keeps razor burn and ingrown hairs to a minimum, yay!</li>
            <li> I love this shave oil.  I have periodically used regular shaving cream, and it always reminds me why I use this shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Not as oily as similar products</li>
            <li> seems to cause drag on the razor and did the opposite of what it is advertised to do.  I like to presoak and hot towel and do all the essentials for shaving to give me the safest and closest shave in one application.  Sometimes I have to do a second shave but regardless, this is not the product for me.  Proraso works for me and makes my face feel great during and after the shave.</li>
            <li> I tried this oil to save some money over a higher priced oil.  It is too thick and feels filmy on my facce.  I have since gone back to my original oil.</li>
            <li> Essential Oil will enhance your shaving experience a ton.  If you like a good tight shave without the skin irritation, this oil will lubricate your face and those tough neck areas and it smells good to boot.  Be sure to use the more expensive Essential Oil, as it seems to lubricate better than their other version.  It&#x27;s worth the money because you use so little.  Keep in mind that nothing will guarantee an irritation free shave unless you clean and soften your beard first, plus use a high quality shave cream.  Crew Essential Oil can&#x27;t work miracles.  However, this oil will add that much more to a pleasant shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well. Reduces the chances of cuts significantly since my purchase. Makes shaving with a safety razor a breeze</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great, smells great and affordable item!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, will order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  To Amazon, It&#x27;s kind of annoying that for me to leave a feedback for you,  you tell me that I have to use certain amount of words :(</li>
            <li> Why I didn&#x27;t find out about shaving oil until I was past 70 I will never know, perhaps this is supposed to be one of the &amp;#34;good things&amp;#34; that we get as we age. But I&#x27;m a believer and was after only one use. I am the old fashioned person who still uses a straight razor which, as is well known, does produce the smoothest possible shave. Or so I thought. The first day I slathered the oil on, foamed up and tool a &amp;#34;trial pass&amp;#34; down my left cheek. Then felt it. It was if I had switched surfaces and was running my finger along a soft, warm marble. Not even an errant follicle. Another stroke, another swatch of smoothness. Feeling surely this couldn&#x27;t last, I did the rest of my face-no touching-took my slightly moist towel that has a bit of astringent in it, wiped off the bits of foam that always hide-always check behind at least one ear-and then I felt it. I am grateful that no one was at home just then as I enjoyed using a considerable string of vulgarisms in praise of the oil and my suddenly baby butt face. What more can I say, it&#x27;s worth it, but it, buy lots of it and be grateful.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. Home Run!</li>
            <li> I too decided to switch to a safety razor, and on the recomendations of others, I tried a shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose American Crew Essential Shave Oil because I use their Moisturizing Shave Cream and Post Shave Cooling Lotion. I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil. I enjoy the scent and the shaving comfort that goes along with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because of the bottle design. I like the flip top cap, but as others have posted, the bottle does leak. I&#x27;ve tightened it as much as I dare, which has stopped the leak for now. I will be traveling soon and I&#x27;m not very confident that it will hold up. Because of loss due to bottle design, I would say that the price is a little much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but will continue to shop around. Maybe I&#x27;ll just look for another bottle?</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving oil for me I have tried so far. I&#x27;ve tried several highly (4+ stars) and they were pretty good but this one works the best for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome preshave. Not too oily but provides good protection.  Mentholy/bayrum smell. I dig it</li>
            <li> This is a good product. The smell is decent and it can be used to shave without any added products. I would rate this 5 stars but a good lather from a shave is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different shaving products -- razors, creams, oil, etc. Of all of these, none has had the dramatic effect that American Crew shave oil does. The very first time I used it (in place of my previous shave oil which ran out), I received a noticeably smoother, closer shave. Ever since then it has given me consistently good performance -- other products seem to vary in their effectiveness with razor type, skin wetness, or other uncontrollable factors. I would highly recommend you give this oil a try, even if you already use some other shave oil.</li>
            <li> I use this on my beard. Helps to keep it shiny and softens it a bit.  Has a nice aroma to it too that isnt too overpowering.</li>
            <li> works great. Better than any gel or foam on the market. should help prevent ingrown hairs. Too many words needed for this review</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, and ended up receiving the flip-top bottle UPC 738678240472, found on Amazon as [[ASIN:B001GV2P3C American Crew Lubricating Shave Oil, 1.7 Ounce]] If AC really does make another product called Essential Shave Oil, I would hate to get it instead of the one I received. I recommend ordering from the product I linked because the UPC in its description matches the box I got, and I now absolutely recommend that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin and whiskers are different. I have tried several shave oils, the same way I&#x27;ve tried several different blades (Feather and Blue Bird work best for me), and several different shave creams (I like Prorasso and Art of Shaving but for the most part I haven&#x27;t found much difference with shave creams). I have never found anything better than this American Crew shave oil, for me, but your skin may vary. I encourage you to try until you find what works for YOU. Without the help of reviewers here, I wouldn&#x27;t have tried American Crew in the first place. Share and enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, go ahead and try regular old castor oil or even canola oil. You might find it works great for you. One reviewer certainly does, and what do you have to lose, there is probably some in your kitchen right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shave oils specifically, I have tried the above mentioned American Crew UPC 738678240472, [[ASIN:B000I2XL38 The Art of Shaving Sandalwood Pre-Shave Oil]] (AoS has the BEST Sandalwood scent), and [[ASIN:B001HZ8IFG The Body Shop For Men Maca Root Wash Off Shave Oil 0.5 fl oz]]. The Art of Shaving is the closest to using plain old Castor Oil, and is actually the most expensive as well. The Ingredients for AoS are: \\&quot;Castor Seed Oil, Olive Oil, Fragrance, Water, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\\&quot;. I find the AoS Pre-Shave oil to be too thick, and it does NOT protect my skin as well as the American Crew. I have literally compared them side-by-side just to prove I&#x27;m not doing something different from shave to shave. Blood all over the AoS side, smooth shaving on the American Crew side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned that the flip-top bottle leaks compared to an older style screw-on lid. I have only ever had the flip-top bottle and I don&#x27;t have any problem with it leaking or dripping or making any mess when I use it. I have not traveled on an airplane with it, but based on past experience I would squeeze out a litte air so it is \\&quot;dented\\&quot; and then put this in a plastic bag along with any other leak candidates, in case it does leak.shave to shave.

            <li> I was skeptical, as I&#x27;m a daily shaver and I&#x27;m always looking for things to improve the quality of my shave and help in protecting my skin. To my chagrin, this stuff really helps. It&#x27;s a little messy and leaves a greasy feel on your hands, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, works great  and lasts a long time (don&#x27;t need much of it to apply on your skin).</li>
            <li> I shaved with a double-edged safety razor for a year before I decided to purchase a pre-shave oil. This was the first pre-shave oil I bought, and it reduced my irritation and shaving difficulty considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this shave oil, I got terrible razor burn when trying to shave against or across the grain on my chin. With this shave oil, I am able to shave against the grain comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that in order to get the most comfortable shave possible, I have to apply oil on my face in between passes, not just before I start shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this at home and for travel. Unlike some shave oils, it doesn&#x27;t leak. We&#x27;ll probably buy again.</li>
            <li> A little less viscous so you end up using a bit more, but the price for such a big bottle still makes it well worth it.  As far as the oil itself; it&#x27;s great and gives a wonderful shave.  I will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> I like a nice, smooth, non-irritating shave. American Crew shave oil definitely makes it possible. As with all shave oils, it feels a bit pricey, but definitely does the trick: no irritation, even with substantial growth. Also per usual, the oil tends to get all over the medicine cabinet, no matter how clean you keep it. I will most likely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find sometimes, but not at Amazon!!!!  This product is fantastic for shaving. I have been using it for yrs.</li>
