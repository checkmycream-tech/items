            <li>Best detangling brush ever.</li>

            <li>Loved the brush.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush !</li>
            <li>I love it for that use, too!)</li>
            <li>it is amazing</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t magically glide thru my kids tangled hair but it is a good (somewhat weighty) hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes this brush work, as best I can tell, are soft plastic bristles with no \\&quot;balls\\</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this and The No Knot Brush for about two dollars more and this brush is just ok.</li>
            <li>The No Knot Brush is a a much better brush to get knots out without hurting your child head.</li>
            <li>It goes through her hair better.  </li>
            <li>able to brush without pulling my daughter&#x27;s hair out, but it doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out either, so  I would rate it eh.</li>
            <li>and I have very fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>This brush easily gets through the tangles.</li>

            <li>Just a little water (which makes it better) and she brushes happily.  </li>

            <li>the smell is totally worth it .</li>
            <li>Much better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone for letting me in on this!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found many hair brushes that actually detangle.</li>
            <li>We tried many different brushes, but none seemed to help...</li>
            <li>Well imagine my surprise, this brush really does work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that really curly corkscrew type of curls</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>The brush is really light and the  bristles seemed a bit fine and flimsy, but swept through my long thick curlyish hair easily.</li>
            <li>my hair is long and not always easy to brush, I let my 5 year old brush my hair with this!</li>
            <li>I love tangle-free brushes, and there are several types on Amazon that are very similar.</li>
            <li>The slightly more expensive brands come packaged in plastic cases that better protect the bristles.</li>
            <li>I will not be buying this particular brush again.</li>
            <li>I usually pay a few dollars more for a different brand, but love saving money, so that I decided to give this &amp;#34;Add-on&amp;#34; item a try.</li>
            <li>It was so painful for me to brush my hair because my scalp was sore so it got more and more tangled.</li>
            <li>I bought this item as a cart filler, I was a few dollars off for free shipping.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised with it&#x27;s detangling abilities.</li>
            <li>This one was much better, at least for us.</li>
            <li>Small &amp; fits easy in your hand.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter has fine hair that gets is a constant mess of knots.  </li>
            <li>Instead of arguing with her mother every morning, she now gets ready long before the bus arrives.  </li>
            <li>She went from cranky and crying to being ready early.  </li>
            <li>This worked very well on wet and dry hair.</li>

            <li> Functionally, the brush still works, and it&#x27;s not worth the trouble of returning it for a replacement.</li>

            <li> I love this brush. It detangles my daughter&#x27;s hair with ease. I&#x27;ve owned other brushes like this from another company and it caused my daughter to have split ends and made her tangles worse. This is a great product and the price you just can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> My daughter has always hated brushing her hair, until now. This brush easily gets through the tangles. Much better than a regular brush. Highly recommend for tangly hair :)</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a cart filler, I was a few dollars off for free shipping. I mean who couldn&#x27;t use another brush. I didn&#x27;t realize it was a specialized detangling brush when I threw it in the order. my hair is long and not always easy to brush, I let my 5 year old brush my hair with this! it is amazing and I was pleasantly surprised with it&#x27;s detangling abilities. I will be buying another!!!</li>
            <li> My grandaughter told me about this, she has tangling hair like mine. Well imagine my surprise, this brush really does work. No more yanking and pulling out my hair. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this and The No Knot Brush for about two dollars more and this brush is just ok. The No Knot Brush is a a much better brush to get knots out without hurting your child head.</li>
            <li> I love tangle-free brushes, and there are several types on Amazon that are very similar. I usually pay a few dollars more for a different brand, but love saving money, so that I decided to give this &amp;#34;Add-on&amp;#34; item a try. The brush arrived promptly this week, packaged in a torn plastic bag. The bottom 20% of the bristles were crushed. Functionally, the brush still works, and it&#x27;s not worth the trouble of returning it for a replacement. The slightly more expensive brands come packaged in plastic cases that better protect the bristles. Also, and this is a very small point, I do prefer the option of selecting a color when buying a hairbrush, and that was not possible here. I will not be buying this particular brush again.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has very long hair and always had trouble brushing it out after her shower, this brush made it much easier.</li>
            <li> Since using this brush, brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair has been a breeze!</li>
            <li> This does have a weird smell when you first get it.&lt;br /&gt;But the smell is totally worth it . It does dissapate after a while.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best brush for detangling that I&#x27;ve ever used and I have very fine, easily tangled hair. I LOVE this brush !</li>
            <li> It was so painful for me to brush my hair because my scalp was sore so it got more and more tangled. This brush is miraculous! Thanks everyone for letting me in on this! Can&#x27;t wait to get my niece one (or two).</li>
            <li> My saughter used to always complain when i brushed her hair.. The complaints were reduced significantly since i started using this on her</li>
            <li> I have kinky hair.  This brush didn&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a detangling brush for a while, which wasn&#x27;t too expensive. This worked very well on wet and dry hair. The brush is really light and the  bristles seemed a bit fine and flimsy, but swept through my long thick curlyish hair easily. I especially have a problem with the hair at the back of my neck, which gets tangled especially when I wake up, but this made short work of it. I don&#x27;t have that really curly corkscrew type of curls so I don&#x27;t know how well it would perform on &#x27;extreme curls. But for me it performed well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found many hair brushes that actually detangle. This one is awesome. No need to rip through my wet hair anymore. This brush glides through. Even when I don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li> the brush was not quite the texture I had invisioned but it worked out anyway.  It glides thru the hair and it makes the scalp feel good.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter has fine hair that gets is a constant mess of knots.  Every morning, she cried while trying to get the knots out and brush her hair.  Though normally a very happy child, mornings brought her down.  She was always late for the bus and cranky to boot.  We tried many different brushes, but none seemed to help...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until we tried this brush.  She went from cranky and crying to being ready early.  Instead of arguing with her mother every morning, she now gets ready long before the bus arrives.  Really.  I couldn&#x27;t make this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this brush work, as best I can tell, are soft plastic bristles with no \\&quot;balls\\&quot; on the end.  It goes through her hair better.  No more detangling spray.  Just a little water (which makes it better) and she brushes happily.  Even dry, there are no tears, but it takes longer and the outcome isn&#x27;t as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried and the Sharkx brush.  This one was much better, at least for us.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair brush I have ever bought that does not pull my hair when I brush it. When I have tangles like crazy.</li>
            <li> I confess I bought this for the cat.  My silky, long haired flame point Balinese.  It is delightful!  No other brush has come close to getting the loose fur off of him and holding it in the brush.  HE adores it!  So do I.&lt;br /&gt;(And I use the second one myself.  I love it for that use, too!)</li>
            <li> able to brush without pulling my daughter&#x27;s hair out, but it doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out either, so  I would rate it eh.</li>
            <li> Best detangling brush ever.</li>
            <li> Loved the brush.  Small &amp; fits easy in your hand.  I have hair about half way down my back &amp; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t magically glide thru my kids tangled hair but it is a good (somewhat weighty) hairbrush.  I still have to be very careful or they shriek that I am pulling their hair.</li>
