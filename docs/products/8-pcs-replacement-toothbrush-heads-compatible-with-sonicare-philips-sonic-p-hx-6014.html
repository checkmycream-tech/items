            <li>Great replacement heads for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush heads</li>
            <li>Read some reviews that said these were not as good as sonicare brushes</li>
            <li>these fit the phillips sonocare perfectly.  </li>
            <li>As good as the name brand.</li>
            <li>They are just as good as the $20 replacement heads.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to try aftermarket heads make sure they are NOT Paz Generix!</li>
            <li>, these probably aren&#x27;t the amazing value they seem to be but</li>
            <li>They are as good or better than the ones that came with the unit.</li>
            <li>Nice try.</li>
            <li>Very very pleased quality is better</li>
            <li>Will for sure reorder when I need more, can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>But, they will be just fine for the price, they work every bit as good</li>
            <li>They worked perfect to replace my old toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>The price is great and well worth the product.</li>
            <li>As good as the original.</li>
            <li>so far, I&#x27;m happy to have a product that works almost as good as OEM and is saving me a ton of ducats.  </li>
            <li>This flaw makes it vibrate stronger than the OEM version and it does a better job at teeth cleaning because of it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>OK product.</li>
            <li>Were ok for a cheaper substitute.</li>
            <li>Glad I saved money and purchased them.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, quality is just like what described, robustly built nice looking and finishing.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic, has the same tensile strength as the Philips, and the grip on the brush head is perfect!  </li>
            <li>fit and work well mostly</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>was willing to try this because of the excellent price but was extremely thrilled after a few weeks of use and found it cleaning better and perhaps may even surpass the OEM for durability of the bristles.</li>
            <li>Why pay the high prices when these work just as good.</li>
            <li>At first glance, an amazing value.</li>
            <li>The brush is fine but it is a two-piece mold which comes apart when you are switching brushes.</li>
            <li>They fit good, but are very soft.</li>
            <li>fit</li>
            <li>What would I do without you cheap knockoffs?  </li>
            <li>Dont let the cheap price scare you.</li>
            <li>but maybe they are worth it!</li>
            <li>all that said, your teeth will still feel incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>well, come with colored plastic identifiers, metal internal ring, good brush quality.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that you could reasonably expect two months of use out of the Philips heads although I never exceeded more than about a month per head.  </li>
            <li>Not bad but was expecting metal rings on the bottom as pictured.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t come with a brush cap and the original won&#x27;t fit snug as it is too big, but will still be fine just being sat on top.</li>
            <li>But it is OK so far.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are designed in such a way that the edges kind of dig into your gum, while the originals don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>The 4th head in the pack would not even go on the handle as it was not made right.</li>
            <li>I will revise this @ June 1st to see if I&#x27;m right.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other &#x27;compatible&#x27; ones, these are a pretty good fit at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>Fits the same and works fine!</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the real thing!</li>
            <li>Also, you absolutely can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>Price is great and it seems a simple fix to make the brush out of a single mold.</li>
            <li>They bounce along the teeth; vibrating in every which direction so much so that the brush head falls off of the toothbrush - right in your mouth.</li>
            <li>These were just as good as the more expensive ones, had no issues with them.</li>
            <li>Yes it is true that the design of the base where it fits into the handle isn&#x27;t perfectly fitting; it is this very thing that makes this superior to even the original equipment.</li>
            <li>I read in a review on AMZN on one of the other replacement packs that MOST heads will work on most Sonicare brushes as they have the same type of drive motor and shaft that the brush heads attach to.  </li>
            <li>Philips Diamond Clean (used) is on the left, these are on the right.</li>
            <li>For the cost of these brushes which are 1/5 the cost of the name brand I can&#x27;t really find a fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brushes work very well.  </li>
            <li>When I tried to attach the toothbrush heads to the shaft of the motor, the heads would not attach until I realized that the drilled attachment was off center, and after rotating the head, was able to attach to the motor shaft.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these as the Philip brush heads are WAY overpriced!  </li>
            <li>Definitely not the quality product Philips sells but cost considered, very compelling.</li>
            <li>I used the original Flexcare toothbrush head before but decided to use these generic ones because of the price.  </li>
            <li>The generic one works as well as the original.  </li>
            <li>Do note that the coloured-ring on the generic brush cannot be removed but the original one can.</li>
            <li>Similar to my original.</li>
            <li>Well, when we got these, we could tell they were a tiny bit frayed compared to the Original Phillips Sonicare replacement.  </li>
            <li>I am not a hard pressure brushes so this is puzzling?!  </li>
            <li>The whole pack costs less than one of the original!</li>
            <li>Another reviewer had noted that the generic brush heads with the colored rings on the outside and the metal rings on the inside worked better.  </li>
            <li>better than expected, so far.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The brush heads that came with my Sonicare lasted at least a month before any significant fading and the bristles didn&#x27;t significantly wear out or bend during that time</li>
            <li>Also, I ordered 4 packs and they threw in an extra... so worth it.</li>
            <li>They fit fine, however, the brush is very hard on the edges where it was cut</li>
            <li>Came so fast and they did fit my Sonicare Philips toothbrush, could be a little softer though.</li>
            <li>So, I spent the $30.00 for the original Phillips replacement heads and there are no problems</li>
            <li>Only used for a few weeks, but first brush works fine.</li>
            <li>these work as promised, and last as long as the original.</li>
            <li>The only difference is that the generic one doesn&#x27;t fit all the way into the brush, leaving a tiny gap but you can still brush with no problems.  </li>
            <li>HAHAHA generic replacements.  </li>
            <li>only real difference that stands out is that these do not have the fading bristles which tell you when to change brush heads, but that&#x27;s almost purely a gimmick so no real loss.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wave pattern I also like very much as this allows the brush head to glide over my teeth and get down in between them to the gum line as well.</li>
            <li>The reviewer was right - at least on my particular model.  </li>
            <li>fits snug so far but will see how it goes after several uses.</li>
            <li>Three of them have done the same thing so far.</li>
            <li>Since I still have the little coloured-ring from the original toothbrush, I just left it there and then plug in the generic one.  </li>
            <li>do work out to be significantly less than the OEM brush heads even when the higher replacement rate is considered.  </li>
            <li>It does the job at a fraction of the original and will hardly notice the difference,  I have use them for 2 months now and are working well</li>
            <li>Definitely not as long lasting as the OEM Philips brush heads however.</li>
            <li>These brush heads feel a little off from using the real replacement.  </li>

            <li> Definitely not as long lasting as the OEM Philips brush heads however.</li>
            <li> These brush heads feel a little off from using the real replacement.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious that these have less bristles overall than the originals which makes them feel extra soft in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bristles feel the same as name brand but don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Only drawback so far is the bristles are a little firmer than OEM replacements but at such a cost difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they last because I just got them.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple generic heads for Sonicare and the ones with the metal piece in the base and the colored rings have been superior to the ones that are 100% plastic.</li>
            <li> Received these replacement heads and thought I would go generic as the Phillips heads are a lot more expensive,  but these are extremely stiff (hurts the gums) and are not lasting.  </li>
            <li> replaced the head with one of these and within a few days noticed a loud vibration noise.</li>
            <li> I had them a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since purchased other generic replacement heads, and they were as pictured, and were drilled correctly, and work as expected.</li>
            <li> Not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> True they may be slightly hard than, but it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> to compare but the name brand may last slightly longer...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working alright, not sure if it will last as long as the OEM product.  </li>
            <li> Not really a problem.  </li>
            <li> than I expected considering how inexpensive they were.</li>
            <li> Maybe every other head swap them out.</li>
            <li> so I began just pushing it down before brushing.</li>
            <li> but I did have one that did not fit.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and an ordeal in frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave these heads 4 stars for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> Even though they were stiff I continued to use these, they are flaring already after couple weeks.</li>
            <li> My husband says these work as well and last as long as the name brand, expensive ones!</li>
            <li> a little hard to use it.</li>
            <li> maybe, I&#x27;m not sure...</li>
            <li> Not sure how they will hold up.</li>

            <li> I used the original Flexcare toothbrush head before but decided to use these generic ones because of the price.  The generic one works as well as the original.  The only difference is that the generic one doesn&#x27;t fit all the way into the brush, leaving a tiny gap but you can still brush with no problems.  Since I still have the little coloured-ring from the original toothbrush, I just left it there and then plug in the generic one.  It works wonder! Do note that the coloured-ring on the generic brush cannot be removed but the original one can.</li>
            <li> Similar to my original. Fits the same and works fine!</li>
            <li> Came so fast and they did fit my Sonicare Philips toothbrush, could be a little softer though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m as picky as they come when it comes to repeat consumables. Yes it is true that the design of the base where it fits into the handle isn&#x27;t perfectly fitting; it is this very thing that makes this superior to even the original equipment. This flaw makes it vibrate stronger than the OEM version and it does a better job at teeth cleaning because of it!&lt;br /&gt;I was willing to try this because of the excellent price but was extremely thrilled after a few weeks of use and found it cleaning better and perhaps may even surpass the OEM for durability of the bristles. It&#x27;s wave pattern I also like very much as this allows the brush head to glide over my teeth and get down in between them to the gum line as well.</li>
            <li> As good as the original. RW</li>
            <li> The brush head is short and the Brissels wear out within two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Item received was not as depicted in the pictures for this item.  The pictures clearly show a colored ring around the outside base of the brush head along with a metal ring inside the base of the brush head.  The item I received had neither - just white plastic.  Another reviewer had noted that the generic brush heads with the colored rings on the outside and the metal rings on the inside worked better.  I sent these back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Not bad but was expecting metal rings on the bottom as pictured. fits snug so far but will see how it goes after several uses. Can&#x27;t beat price though.</li>
            <li> Read some reviews that said these were not as good as sonicare brushes but I think they are the same. I don&#x27;t know how long they last because I just got them. They do not have the metal in the stem like the sonicare ones. One of the reviews said this was a problem for them. I did not have any problems.</li>
            <li> Comparing this back to back with the name-brand brushes I struggle to find difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to compare but the name brand may last slightly longer...maybe, I&#x27;m not sure...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real difference that stands out is that these do not have the fading bristles which tell you when to change brush heads, but that&#x27;s almost purely a gimmick so no real loss. For the cost of these brushes which are 1/5 the cost of the name brand I can&#x27;t really find a fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit well, come with colored plastic identifiers, metal internal ring, good brush quality.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Best deal around on these replacement brushes. They are as good or better than the ones that came with the unit. Would recommend them and WILL buy them again.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the real thing!</li>
            <li> Brushes work very well.  I actually prefer them to the ones that came packaged with the handle in that they are softer.</li>
            <li> They are pictured with colored rings at the base, and a metal insert in base.  Mine came with neither the colored rings or metal inserts.  Not really a problem.  When I tried to attach the toothbrush heads to the shaft of the motor, the heads would not attach until I realized that the drilled attachment was off center, and after rotating the head, was able to attach to the motor shaft.  However, it was uncomfortable to use, I am use to the brush head being in line on/off switch on the motor barrel.  I&#x27;ve since purchased other generic replacement heads, and they were as pictured, and were drilled correctly, and work as expected.</li>
            <li> these fit the phillips sonocare perfectly.  i had a problem with only one brush in that the base came off but, at this price, these are a great buy.</li>
            <li> Works great for replacment at 1/2 the cost. Will but again</li>
            <li> looks lousy...dont like it at all</li>
            <li> fit and work well mostly but I did have one that did not fit. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Virtually the same as Philips&#x27; replacement brush heads except I now have money in my pocket after buying. Very happy with these.</li>
            <li> Worked as they should have, will buy again.</li>
            <li> very very stiff bristles</li>
            <li> No need to buy the name brand!</li>
            <li> NOTE: This applies to Paz Generix Brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Sonicare toothbrush handle is getting up there in years so rather than spend $30.00 for 3 Phillips replacement heads I figured I&#x27;d give these a try. It was a waste of money and an ordeal in frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the head with one of these and within a few days noticed a loud vibration noise. Initially I thought it was my toothbrush handle (the motor) making the noise. Upon investigation though I noticed the replacement head was working its way off of the handle. It would do this every time I brushed so I began just pushing it down before brushing. This worked for another week then the toothbrush head started coming off as I was brushing. I replaced it with another head thinking one may have been defective. After 2-3 days the pattern repeated with one of them shooting across the room. I just kept replacing them every week. The 4th head in the pack would not even go on the handle as it was not made right. In about 6 weeks I was on the 5th of 8 heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then began to think it was my Sonicare handle that was worn out. So, I spent the $30.00 for the original Phillips replacement heads and there are no problems what so ever. The heads stay on and are quiet. If you&#x27;re going to try aftermarket heads make sure they are NOT Paz Generix!</li>
            <li> They worked perfect to replace my old toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t bet these.</li>
            <li> The are working great wish I had them a long time ago.  The price is great and well worth the product. Will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> You think I would learn by now! Received these replacement heads and thought I would go generic as the Phillips heads are a lot more expensive,  but these are extremely stiff (hurts the gums) and are not lasting.  Even though they were stiff I continued to use these, they are flaring already after couple weeks. I am not a hard pressure brushes so this is puzzling?!  The Phillips heads are softer and lasted months. They are still expensive but maybe they are worth it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Tanga a couple of months back. They fit good, but are very soft. I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> The knock-off manufacturer got these to look like the originals; but not function like them. They are out of balance. They bounce along the teeth; vibrating in every which direction so much so that the brush head falls off of the toothbrush - right in your mouth. Three of them have done the same thing so far.</li>
            <li> Great price,arrived sooner then stated.Fits my toothbrush perfect.</li>
            <li> NOTE: What was shipped is not what is pictured. I have tried multiple generic heads for Sonicare and the ones with the metal piece in the base and the colored rings have been superior to the ones that are 100% plastic. I will give these ones a test, but if (as I suspect) they are the inferior ones, back they go!</li>
            <li> a little hard to use it.</li>
            <li> At first glance, an amazing value. Definitely not as long lasting as the OEM Philips brush heads however. The Philips instructions say to replace after the blue portion of the brush fades. The brush heads that came with my Sonicare lasted at least a month before any significant fading and the bristles didn&#x27;t significantly wear out or bend during that time (I brush 2-3 per day). I suspect that you could reasonably expect two months of use out of the Philips heads although I never exceeded more than about a month per head.  The bristles in this product start to show wear after only about a week or two. Doing the math (Philips heads ~7 dollars each, these ~1 dollar each), these probably aren&#x27;t the amazing value they seem to be but do work out to be significantly less than the OEM brush heads even when the higher replacement rate is considered.  OK product. Definitely not the quality product Philips sells but cost considered, very compelling. I&#x27;ll probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Definitely a cheaper brand. Bristles feel the same as name brand but don&#x27;t last as long. Were ok for a cheaper substitute.</li>
            <li> Very very pleased quality is better than I expected considering how inexpensive they were.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, quality is just like what described, robustly built nice looking and finishing. I buy 10 and owner gives me 12 packs. Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality and price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working alright, not sure if it will last as long as the OEM product.  These brush heads feel a little off from using the real replacement.  But it is OK so far. Rather spend the extra money to get the OEM.</li>
            <li> My husband says these work as well and last as long as the name brand, expensive ones! The name brand are quite a rip off I think!</li>
            <li> Works great. Just as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Work great. As good as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Why pay the high prices when these work just as good. True they may be slightly hard than, but it is hardly noticeable. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If your loking for an alternative to the expense of replacement toothbrush heads try this ones. It does the job at a fraction of the original and will hardly notice the difference,  I have use them for 2 months now and are working well</li>
            <li> I have the Sonicare Platinum Toothbrush and have been using the replacement brushes for almost two (2) weeks now. I can find no difference (except cosmetically) between the knock-offs and the OEM.  Oh yes, they are about 1/3 the price of the OEM.  Since you should be replacing the heads every three (3) months anyway, I don&#x27;t anticipate them failing to perform.  I will revise this @ June 1st to see if I&#x27;m right.</li>
            <li> HAHAHA generic replacements.  So awesome.  I hate the prices of these brushes from the manufacturers.  What would I do without you cheap knockoffs?  Oh I know I would probably by using my fingers or something gross like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes these work as promised, and last as long as the original.</li>
            <li> The head of the brush is detaching from the base.  I guess you get what you pay for,  in this case.</li>
            <li> These were just as good as the more expensive ones, had no issues with them. Will for sure reorder when I need more, can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for my Sonicare. Dont let the cheap price scare you. They are just as good as the $20 replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This product just arrived and I tried it this morning.  It works fantastic, has the same tensile strength as the Philips, and the grip on the brush head is perfect!  I highly recommend these as the Philip brush heads are WAY overpriced!  Also, see the attached photos for a comparison of the brush heads.  Philips Diamond Clean (used) is on the left, these are on the right.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine but it is a two-piece mold which comes apart when you are switching brushes. Price is great and it seems a simple fix to make the brush out of a single mold.</li>
            <li> better than expected, so far.</li>
            <li> Item that I received is not what is shown in the picture. Brushes do not have colored rings nor do they have the metal retainers inside. Not sure how they will hold up. Not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other &#x27;compatible&#x27; ones, these are a pretty good fit at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> My dentist encouraged me to buy from Amazon , saying they come from the same factory .  Well, when we got these, we could tell they were a tiny bit frayed compared to the Original Phillips Sonicare replacement.  But, they will be just fine for the price, they work every bit as good and I would never go back to buying the expensive ones. Also, I ordered 4 packs and they threw in an extra... so worth it.</li>
            <li> I gave these heads 4 stars for a few reasons. The brush heads are designed in such a way that the edges kind of dig into your gum, while the originals don&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s obvious that these have less bristles overall than the originals which makes them feel extra soft in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, your teeth will still feel incredibly clean. They are also very quiet and run just like the originals. They don&#x27;t come with a brush cap and the original won&#x27;t fit snug as it is too big, but will still be fine just being sat on top. Also, you absolutely can&#x27;t beat the price! I&#x27;ll keep using them and MAY grab some originals to use as well. Maybe every other head swap them out.</li>
            <li> Only used for a few weeks, but first brush works fine. Don&#x27;t think you can hardly beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;If the rest work like the 1st, this will last me a couple of years. Give it a try. Like I said, you can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;beat this price, anywhere.</li>
            <li> Just like the more expensive replacement toothbrush heads. I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Works well! Good product give &#x27;em a try! The whole pack costs less than one of the original!</li>
            <li> I just got these and used them only for 2 days. They fit fine, however, the brush is very hard on the edges where it was cut and I am going to throw these away and purchase the Sonicare brand toothbrushes. For the price I thought I would try them but do not like how hard the bristles are. Nice try. If you don&#x27;t mind med/hard bristles they will work for you.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> They ACTUALLY WORK quite well in my Sonicare HX6211 Plaque Removing toothbrush.  I read in a review on AMZN on one of the other replacement packs that MOST heads will work on most Sonicare brushes as they have the same type of drive motor and shaft that the brush heads attach to.  The reviewer was right - at least on my particular model.  Only drawback so far is the bristles are a little firmer than OEM replacements but at such a cost difference AND they&#x27;re NOT damaging my gums and teeth (according to my dentist) so far, I&#x27;m happy to have a product that works almost as good as OEM and is saving me a ton of ducats.  Again, my experience and YMMV.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush heads they are just a like the name brand. Shipping arrived in time. Glad I saved money and purchased them.</li>
