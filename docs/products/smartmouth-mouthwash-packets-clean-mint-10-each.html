            <li> The travel packs are less cumbersome than travelling with the standard smart mouth bottles.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that these on the go packets are so large I can use 1 packet 3 times before it&#x27;s empty, so i try to prop it up in the bathroom to re-use it throughout the day or night or next couple of days.</li>
            <li> As long as I have income, I&#x27;d have this as a priority on my list of consumables.</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t alleviate my dry mouth, which I still have to address (hence, the 4 stars) to protect my gums &amp; teeth.</li>
            <li> They are quite expensive, but I am willing to pay for the convenience.</li>
            <li> We use about half the amount recommended and it provides the benefit we desire for the day.</li>
            <li> My hubby carries a few of these in his briefcase and also packs them in his toiletry kit  for travel.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product if you have a problem with chronic bad breath.</li>
            <li> just wish they were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> And, this size for trips is very hard to find except on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Must have- stops bad breath...</li>
            <li> This is truly the premier mouthwash for the toughest bad breath.</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed that it is not a powder.  </li>

            <li> This is simply the best way to maintain clean breath for an extended period of time.  It really does the job.  We use it every morning prior to leaving the house and it provides protection the entire day (unless we decide to have linguini with lots of garlic for lunch!!  We use about half the amount recommended and it provides the benefit we desire for the day.</li>
            <li> Really works!  I recommend this to everyone.  This is the best mouth wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Smartmouth is the best mouthwash ever! It eliminates morning breath and keeps breath fresh throughout the day, barring an unusually heavy intake of garlic or onions. It works so well, that I can forget I haven&#x27;t brushed my teeth in the morning. It&#x27;s pricey but worth every penny. To save costs, I do two squirts each from the original bottles instead of the recommended three and it works fine.  These travel packets are great for travel, a long day, or an evening out.</li>
            <li> Must have- stops bad breath...just wish they were a little less expensive. My family is hooked on the regular smart mouth mouthwash.

            <li> We get these all the time for travel. They are so effective and easy to pack! Highly recommend this product if you have a problem with chronic bad breath.</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use Smartmouth mouthwash all the time.  These &amp;#34;on-the-go&amp;#34; packets make traveling with Smartmouth easy.  They are quite expensive, but I am willing to pay for the convenience.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Cannot find in stores.</li>
            <li> Travel size is fantastic.  Good price for the quantity.  Amazon Prime shipping is icing on the cake.  This is truly the premier mouthwash for the toughest bad breath.</li>
            <li> Used before and nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  It really works as described!  And, this size for trips is very hard to find except on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I can not find in any stores anymore.</li>

            <li> Great product! Great for travel or anytime!</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS!  I used it daily, and it really does get rid of morning mouth and keep your breath fresh all day!  I love these little packets for traveling!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  You have nice breath all day long.</li>
            <li> They actually do work! You take them at night and you wake up..not minty fresh but also not morning breath.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash ever.  The travel packets are perfect.</li>
            <li> I have found Smart Mouth wash to really work through out the day and keeps my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> We took these on our cruise last year.  These work great, and they&#x27;re light weight so if you&#x27;re checking your luggage they don&#x27;t add any weight at all to it.  Now these are in our travel bags wherever we go.  Also, because the mouthwash is in pre-measured packets, it&#x27;s convenient--open, use, toss.</li>
            <li> It really works.  I have terribly dry mouth which causes halitosis, and this really helped for the whole day.  However, it didn&#x27;t alleviate my dry mouth, which I still have to address (hence, the 4 stars) to protect my gums &amp; teeth.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I am disappointed that it is not a powder.  Hence it needs to be in checked luggage.  I thought it would quality as carry-on.  2 liquids that you mix into one to use surely will upset TSA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Smart Mouth since 2007 and nothing works better for my breath. As long as I have income, I&#x27;d have this as a priority on my list of consumables. Listerine, ACT, etc has nothing on this.  My only preference would be that the bottles were in one bottle (not 2) so that it&#x27;s easier to transport. The packets work but relatively speaking, the cost is a bit more per box compared to the bottles. My wife can attest to my fresh breath!</li>
            <li> Good stuff and this travel size is great for me who works on the road and needs to be sure that no lingering lunch on ones breath.  I also bought the pump bottles for home.  Great product, worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My hubby carries a few of these in his briefcase and also packs them in his toiletry kit  for travel.  The mouthwash itself is a great product, but the convenience of these travel packs are just so practical.</li>
            <li> When I spend a weekend with my boyfriend, I can rest assured I&#x27;ll wake up with the freshest of breath! Nothing compares to this stuff, nothing will give you the results you truly need! My only complaint is that these on the go packets are so large I can use 1 packet 3 times before it&#x27;s empty, so i try to prop it up in the bathroom to re-use it throughout the day or night or next couple of days.</li>
