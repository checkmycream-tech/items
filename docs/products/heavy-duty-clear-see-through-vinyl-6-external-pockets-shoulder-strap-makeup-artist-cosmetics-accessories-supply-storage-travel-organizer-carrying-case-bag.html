            <li> BEST SET BAG EVER!!!!? I&#x27;ve had this for 2 years now and love it soooo much</li>
            <li> I bought this bag to go threw security checkpoints and it seems to be well made shoulder straps could use some work but overall well constructed. Just so people know snaps for the 6 side pouches are magnetic snaps.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all my makeup, mirror and toiletries...</li>
            <li> Plastic is too stiff to easily load anything. Overall not easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this bag, it meets all my needs for travel and I don&#x27;t have to use several bags to put make up and accessories as this bag holds it ALL, plus for ease of access I can see where everything is, that&#x27;s a &#x27;Plus.&#x27; for me</li>
            <li> Love the ability to see what&#x27;s in my bag. I sort all my tech cords,plugs,Chargers all my tech &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; together.  Cool</li>
            <li> What can I say ? The only thing I would change is the little side pockets have zippers instead of magnetic buttons . Other than that , great. Oh , I will tell everyone that you will have to put it in the dryer for 3 minutes to soften the vinyl !</li>
            <li> This bag is very well made!!  It is a little larger then I expected but very easy to spot items.  I could see how a mobile hairdresser would love this bag.  I bought more for travel and use each time but wish it were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> This clear vinyl tote is VERY heavy.  I weighed it on my bathroom scale &amp; it was almost 6 lbs.  The vinyl is also thick &amp; not playable.</li>
            <li> LIGHTENING SPEED SHIPPING!!!!  Lovely case - exactly as pictured and described. VERY SATISFIED.  Highly recommend if interested in a great see thru case</li>
            <li> I use this to take all my hair and makeup supplies to horse shows.  It&#x27;s great to be able to see everything at a glance instead of rummaging through a bag to find something.  It&#x27;s pretty sturdy too!</li>
            <li> I love my bag I can fit all makeup and then some even flat irons and brushes and some wigs I think I need another one for the rest of my stuff big bag</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for a vinyl makeup case to replace an older one.  I went to the two large beauty product stores but could not find it anywhere but on Amazon!  I like that it&#x27;s compartmentalized for purposes of organization, the price was reasonable, it looks like it would be great to use for travel and incidentally it is also available at Amazon in a smaller size.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> This bag is awesome!  Lots of room!  Used to carry supplies for esthetician school. Now i will use it to carry makeup supplies!</li>
            <li> This bag is SO cool and it holds SO MUCH.  It is very sturdy and I packed the heck out of this.  I had ordered two - clearly, I only needed just the one.  I&#x27;m going to assume that after use the stiffness will ease up a bit - but I&#x27;m impressed it is as strong as it is.  It arrived on time and in good order.  I would recommend this bag to anyone looking to easily carry product and samples, as well as any paperwork you may need to carry.</li>
            <li> Larger than expected, and stiff (had to stuff it with towels etc.) and leave it several hours on a heated floor, to soften and take a normal shape, after being rather squashed in shipping. The outer pockets close via snaps, which are hard to use unless the pockets are fairly full and resist. the handles and shoulder straps are well made, wide, and are comfortable and appear strong. The bag can carry a lot of weight without distorting (e.g., 8 kilos). Overall a nice product, recommended.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed everyone&#x27;s asking about it</li>
            <li> I like this see thru bag using it for medication on trips for 2 it is Wonderf</li>
            <li> My daughter is a freelance makeup artist, and she loves this bag, she loves how it is clear and makes it easier for her to find her tools :) Good quality, sturdy, very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great to see through for a car bag but plastic is unwieldy</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these bags for myself and a friend. It is so frustrating to have to dig through a big bag to find your items when you are traveling. I am so excited about the quality! I have had a clear cosmetic bag like this in the past, and I loved it. This bag is much nicer than my last one and The quality is amazing. The clear bags make it so easy to locate anything you need at a glance. The zipper and zipper pull are very heavy duty, as well as the vinyl itself! I am very happy with the quality of this item. I would certainly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very stiff vinyl.  I took it on a trip, but didn&#x27;t stuff it full.  The whole trip I was fighting with the case wanting to go back to it&#x27;s original scrunched up shipping shape.  But the vinyl seems very strong and should be durable.</li>
            <li> I am an extremely picky buyer and it has been difficult to find something I like to contain my collection of makeup and expensive makeup brushes.  I love being able to see inside a bag so I had a smaller clear makeup bag.  My daughter saw this one and it was love at first sight.  The size is perfect, the compartments are perfect, and I can see exactly what I want.  I am now ordering one for my daughter and will use as future gifts.  Perfect for a shower gift or a just because gift.  And what is so nice if something opens inside bag just need a wet cloth to clean up the mess and you are ready to go.  Also was impressed with the handles very sturdy and durable.  Then I was blown away when I saw that it also came with a detachable shoulder strap.  So this picky buyer is still picky but for once completely satisfied.  I hope you order.</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist, this bag organizes all my tools and palettes so nicely and  the see through makes it so easy to find anything I need! I especially love to outside pockets! So useful and organized! I love it!</li>
            <li> Very stiff plastic. Pretty much formed the way it is packed. I even tried a blow dryer to soften and shape with no luck.</li>
            <li> Amazing i loved it. I can fit alot of makeup. Highly reccomend. Has alot of pockets on the sides and also inside</li>
            <li> I really like it and get a lot of comments about it.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Lots of pockets to fit all my makeup artist supplies.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time for the gym. I take it in the shower stall with me, and put it on the towel hook. My shampoo and conditioner are in the outside pocket. My towel is in the main compartment and stays dry. I can see where all my stuff is without searching. No more packing and unpacking. Fits in the locker if the side pockets are not too full.</li>
