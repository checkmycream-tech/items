            <li> I love it when my husband wears this cologne I can&#x27;t help but smile because this cologne smells so wonderful! Would reccommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Cologne for about 18-20 years. I happen to like it on me and so do my female friends (so said) I think that is true. As colognes go this is an excellent brand and the quality and smell has seemed to stay the same, this is important if you like the same thing and want to use it over a long time frame. All Fragrance are expensive to me so I try to get one that works well and a small amount last a long time plus holds it fragrance (smell) also.</li>
            <li> clean smell me and husband both love it</li>
            <li> This is my sons favorite cologne.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you are searching for a great men&#x27;s cologne but can&#x27;t smell the fragrance until after you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;But by then, it&#x27;s too late. You have already bought it, much to your dismay! If that is you, I can say that &amp;#34;Intuition&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;by Estee Lauder is one of the best men&#x27;s colognes I have ever bought. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This smells good. This is definitely a warm/summer smell. This cologne smell classy for real. So if you wanna start feeling like a man, then you need to get one of this.</li>
            <li> All was perfect with this package. It was in good shape, the cologne was fresh and amazing. I have always loved this particular scent. I don&#x27;t use cologne&#x27;s that much anymore so what I have lasts a long time. When I was looking for a replacement I was disappointing to discover that this particular line was no longer available. Thank goodness for Amazon and the companies that use Amazon to sell items like this that are discontinued. Thanks!</li>
            <li> ...it&#x27;s personal taste and substantially overpriced. The bottle &amp; packaging probably costs more than the liquid. That&#x27;s why some celebs have 4 perfumes for sale; that&#x27;s how they make their living off the rest of us.</li>
            <li> The same great product I use to buy in the department stores without the travel and costs.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne,that doesn&#x27;t smell like rubbing alcohol,women seem to like it</li>
            <li> Good service, good product. Liked doing business this way. I&#x27;ve used this cologne for a long time and love it. Must not be very popular...but that&#x27;s OK...nothing wrong with being an individual.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my ex wife 5 years ago and I have been buying it ever since.... Great scent and I never get complaints!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance but I just wish the fragrance lasted a little longer. My friends complement me on it..</li>
            <li> I love all fragrances from Estée Lauder,  the mild sexiness, it is one of those perfumes that a lot of people don&#x27;t where. So it reminds u of one special person....</li>
            <li> Would recommend it for any man. Been using this product for many years. makes me feel great after shaving. can&#x27;t say enough.</li>
            <li> Great cologne. Not too strong, but it will catch everyone attention. You will notice people getting unnecessarily close to you often. Just remember what your wearing.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> was missing about 1/4th of bottle on arrival. bottle not broken in shipping</li>

            <li> I have had several comments on how good I smell. I like it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I get the bad bottle or what. This smells like run of the mill aftershave. It&#x27;s exactly that. I&#x27;m disappointed. I had some hope of it smelling different from the reviews but it can&#x27;t even be called perfume. So plain.</li>
            <li> Great product and price!</li>
            <li> very soft, warm, charming smell. It stays around 5-6 hours. it has anber base. I am happy with it.  I recommend it.</li>
