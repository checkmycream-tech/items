            <li>Love these lipsticks...</li>
            <li>Just layer it on, and the color becomes a LOT more pigmented.</li>
            <li>The darker ones are OK.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really pretty colors and they stay on nice!</li>
            <li>lipsticks are ok</li>
            <li>The purple color was broke when I received my package, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>My favorite color is the Gold shade, because it comes off as a nude tone for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would only buy again if i could find a way to make fhe lipstick crumbs go away because the colors are gorgeous &amp; it has a pleasant floral or fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors, and use one on top of another for unique color combos.  </li>
            <li>great last long I&#x27;m a smoker and it lasted for a good hour before I had to reapply and the colors are great</li>
            <li>Also, the free earrings with these were beyond adorable.</li>
            <li>It is cheap lipstick, that is better than E.L.F essentials lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I love them, the colors are true as they look</li>
            <li>Fortunately when they arrived I was relieved.</li>
            <li>Lipstick goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>what about the free earing?</li>
            <li>The lipsticks are very pigmented and the colors are nice, but they come with a play dough-like scent.</li>
            <li>They are really cheap, like dollar store lipstick.</li>
            <li>I do like the rich colors &amp; the way its scented.</li>
            <li>The kleancolor shades on me, are rich and pop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly smooth to me and the last a good bit through the day.</li>
            <li>Glossy, true to color</li>
            <li>This is good for a teenager who would like to experiment with different lipstick colors.</li>
            <li>and i had fun mixing them, glides on smooth</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad one.</li>
            <li>Love the colors but its very crumbly somehow at the same time it has a lot of moisture, the texture as it glides on isnt very smooth</li>
            <li>i use the rest don&#x27;t look good me, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very vibrant and rich colours.</li>
            <li>They have a fragrance I cannot place right now</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and looks amazingly vibrant.</li>
            <li>NO, they&#x27;re not expensive lipsticks that will stay on throughout the day...</li>
            <li>Smell funny.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can experiment on many different colors without having to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much like a tinted ChapStick.</li>
            <li>and they compliment me very well ...</li>
            <li>Overall not bad.</li>
            <li>I have a slightly darker top lip, but you wouldn&#x27;t know it with this on.</li>
            <li>They are very cheap and do not make your lips feel smooth, which is to be expected for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t normally try and I&#x27;ve discovered a whole new color palette.</li>
            <li>I just looking for inexpensive lipsticks that are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s normal with this</li>
            <li>The texture is what I expected, especially because most of the lipsticks are matte.</li>
            <li>Colors are not so much as expected, The pictures on Amazon are very vibrant but in person they are much duller.</li>
            <li>3 of the lipsticks arrived damaged, 2 of them the actual lipstick was stacked to the lid and another has some black spots on it witch are most definitely not part of lipstick.</li>
            <li>the dark purple would probably make me look like a corpse, but on someone else it would look pretty.</li>
            <li>I am not a makeup artist, so I don&#x27;t necessarily need professional quality, brand name cosmetics.</li>
            <li>only downside to the lipsticks are, the smell and frequent reapplication.</li>
            <li>Not long lasting</li>

            <li> For good result need lip base.</li>
            <li> but they are a little watery which means they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Prior to previous reviews I was truly worried that what I had ordered would turn out to be dollar store barbie lipstick.</li>
            <li> I would give this product five stars, but I ended up with two red lipsticks (two #3s, missing #4).  </li>
            <li> It also won&#x27;t last throughout the day, so you will need to take a few seconds to reapply.</li>

            <li> i don&#x27;t buy expensive lip stick</li>
            <li> This stuff has a weird fragrance that can be headache inducing for some with sensitivities or simply annoying if you don&#x27;t like noticeable scents in your lip products.</li>

            <li> I would buy it again!!</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are fun, and smell good, and I like the majority of the colors- the dark purple would probably make me look like a corpse, but on someone else it would look pretty. It&#x27;s given me the opportunity to try colors I wouldn&#x27;t normally try and I&#x27;ve discovered a whole new color palette.</li>
            <li> Bunch of colors.Smells good.It can dry lips little bit.For good result need lip base.</li>
            <li> love these lipsticks! very smooth and smell amazing!  would definently buy again. 100 percent reccomended!!!!</li>
            <li> None of the colors are good ,but 2! Dont recommend</li>
            <li> They arrived on time but one lipstick was broken and I never received the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; earrings. Some of the colors are really nice but they are a little watery which means they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Excelent Product, 100% recommended...</li>
            <li> I am not very satisfied with this product. 3 of the lipsticks arrived damaged, 2 of them the actual lipstick was stacked to the lid and another has some black spots on it witch are most definitely not part of lipstick. Overall not bad.</li>
            <li> I think, for the money, these are a great buy!  NO, they&#x27;re not expensive lipsticks that will stay on throughout the day...but for this price?!  I love all the colors, and use one on top of another for unique color combos.  They look nice.  They&#x27;re a bit waxy, but again, for the money &#x3D; great!</li>
            <li> Smell funny. Get what you pay for. To bad nice shades too.</li>
            <li> I would give this product five stars, but I ended up with two red lipsticks (two #3s, missing #4).  Otherwise, I like the colors.</li>
            <li> Prior to previous reviews I was truly worried that what I had ordered would turn out to be dollar store barbie lipstick. Fortunately when they arrived I was relieved. They don&#x27;t smell like play dough and aren&#x27;t gritty. They have a fragrance I cannot place right now but it&#x27;s not a bad one. Just smells like makeup to me. The texture is what I expected, especially because most of the lipsticks are matte. It&#x27;s honestly smooth to me and the last a good bit through the day. They&#x27;re very vibrant and rich colours. I fell in love with #12. It&#x27;s beautiful. I am truly happy with my purchase and all the lipstick was intact.</li>
            <li> Colors are great! I work at a restaurant as a server and it lasts all day plus  Applys great. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome pigments great last long I&#x27;m a smoker and it lasted for a good hour before I had to reapply and the colors are great</li>
            <li> Love these lipsticks...</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t buy expensive lip stick so these meat my expectations. i have five i use the rest don&#x27;t look good me, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I just live them very good pigmentation.</li>
            <li> some of the lipsticks arrived dislodged. disappointed</li>
            <li> Love the colors but its very crumbly somehow at the same time it has a lot of moisture, the texture as it glides on isnt very smooth so ive bedn taking off a lot of lipstick crumbs. I do like the rich colors &amp; the way its scented. I would only buy again if i could find a way to make fhe lipstick crumbs go away because the colors are gorgeous &amp; it has a pleasant floral or fruity scent.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is unbeatable. Just layer it on, and the color becomes a LOT more pigmented. Also, the free earrings with these were beyond adorable. I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
            <li> Bought these just to see if I could use them to ombre. These lipsticks are very sheer, so if you are looking for the shade to pop, youbwill need to buy another products! You are not gonna get the pop in the lighter shades. The darker ones are OK. My package came missing shades. The moister in them are great. Much like a tinted ChapStick. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The quality is not the best but I guess it&#x27;s normal with this price.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are still nice and and the texture is great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really pretty colors and they stay on nice!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Lipstick goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Glossy, true to color</li>
            <li> what about the free earing? nerver came with the order. lipsticks are ok</li>
            <li> The lipsticks are very pigmented and the colors are nice, but they come with a play dough-like scent. They are very cheap and do not make your lips feel smooth, which is to be expected for such a low price. I like the fact that you can experiment on many different colors without having to spend a fortune. If you are just beginning to wear makeup, I would recommend, but not otherwise.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, my friends love them.</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors! Goes on smooth and looks amazingly vibrant. The purple color was broke when I received my package, but that&#x27;s ok considering I use a brush to apply my lipstick anyways.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup artist, so I don&#x27;t necessarily need professional quality, brand name cosmetics. I just looking for inexpensive lipsticks that are highly pigmented. This Kleancolor assortment works. It is cheap lipstick, that is better than E.L.F essentials lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a medium brown skin tone and wear Graftobian&#x27;s Winter Wheat or blended Deep Xanthe foundations. The kleancolor shades on me, are rich and pop. I have a slightly darker top lip, but you wouldn&#x27;t know it with this on. My favorite color is the Gold shade, because it comes off as a nude tone for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to the lipsticks are, the smell and frequent reapplication. This stuff has a weird fragrance that can be headache inducing for some with sensitivities or simply annoying if you don&#x27;t like noticeable scents in your lip products. It also won&#x27;t last throughout the day, so you will need to take a few seconds to reapply.</li>
            <li> 3 of the 12 came broken.</li>
            <li> Feels gritty when applying, and leaves a burning sensation on lips</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of this it goes on  watery I&#x27;m definitely not buying this again</li>
            <li> Colors are not so much as expected, The pictures on Amazon are very vibrant but in person they are much duller. I was particularly disappointed with the purple and the pink which were the ones I really wanted. Some of the lipsticks are watery and some are gritty. They are really cheap, like dollar store lipstick. On the contrary the gold color is very nice and I can maybe use it as an eye shadow. This is good for a teenager who would like to experiment with different lipstick colors.</li>

            <li> Beautiful colors, great product and priced fair</li>

            <li> it came in just in time and I love them, the colors are true as they look and i had fun mixing them, glides on smooth and it looks real good when i wear it, I&#x27;m a dark skin girl and they compliment me very well ...I will try to add pics when I get a chance ...but great product ...I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
