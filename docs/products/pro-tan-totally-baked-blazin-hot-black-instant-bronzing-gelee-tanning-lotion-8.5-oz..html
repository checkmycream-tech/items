            <li>it&#x27;s very very strong.</li>
            <li>, it was a good bronzer &amp; smooth in texture.</li>

            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>++FYi ive bought from thus seller and one more amd</li>
            <li>Ok lotion for the price</li>
            <li>so I sure all will</li>
            <li>Tingles for sure..</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful smell, overall i would definately buy again.</li>
            <li>The smell is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>This product is an okay product.  </li>
            <li>I sure  got brown.  </li>
            <li>i do love the results but it does have that &amp;#34;tanning bed&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li>love that the seller gets it to me in goo time and always throws in samples.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more about a Level 6-7.</li>
            <li>I Love it though</li>
            <li>recommend both these last two lotions if you&#x27;re looking for Awesome &amp; affordable bronzing tanning lotions</li>
            <li>Double Awesome !</li>
            <li>really love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d def recommend though for pro tanners like myself :-)</li>
            <li>Most def.</li>
            <li>DO NOT GO MORE THAN 10</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Best lotion I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really smooth and has a really interesting smell to it, that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.  </li>
            <li>but its more a light candy smell.</li>
            <li>I suggest taking it easy.</li>
            <li>They deliver very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it is a bit strong, but</li>
            <li>However, I would not use it on the face, I think that the tingle would be too strong for the face.  </li>
            <li>this is perfectly priced and very red hot tingling if u miss a view days of tanning use this</li>
            <li>Plus the &amp;#34;bronzing black gelee&amp;#34; is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is super-hot, and I got a fantastic color change after one use.</li>
            <li>Never buying cheap tanning lotion again.</li>
            <li>Buy them in your gym or salon where you can sample a packet before you spend $36 to get the free S/H for four lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive any free samples as some people said they did.  </li>
            <li>Just a light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went tanning everyday and brought out awesome color.</li>
            <li>This cheap bronzed works really well!!!</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to tan for a good 2 weeks due to the flu</li>
            <li>I read the reviews an was super excited</li>
            <li>Not only is the tanning lotion affordable and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall for the price, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>Not bad...</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell</li>
            <li>(when I first used it, it was just very mild, if anything at all, after being in the tanning bed a full lengths time)&lt;br</li>
            <li>A mild tingler.</li>
            <li>It has a mild tingle.</li>
            <li>I started turning red as soon as I put it on, and felt very warm, so I was very unsure about the lotion.</li>
            <li>Works great for an even dark tan</li>
            <li>It is a very very hot tingle.</li>
            <li>Super hot and tingles!</li>
            <li>It gets super hot!</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anybody looking to bump up their level of color-anybody that can handle a mid-level hot tingle!&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping this lotion in my line-up!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Always try out your products first!</li>
            <li>This tingle is great for new tanners, the tingle is just enough.  </li>
            <li>a rare occasion for me)</li>
            <li>feel as though a &amp;#34;goodie&amp;#34; bag is exciting in itself to receive.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY</li>
            <li>me right</li>
            <li>But I absolutely loved the texture and how easily, slick, &amp; smoothly it glides</li>
            <li>Solid Black Is Awesome !</li>
            <li>donated the four to the gym so others who wouldn&#x27;t normally buy the lotions could use them for free.</li>
            <li>Also if u take a hot shower right after use it will reactivate.</li>
            <li>Pure Genius !</li>
            <li>the lotion is very &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; so i do make sure i don&#x27;t get it near my face.</li>
            <li>This was my first tingler.  </li>
            <li>If ur a first yime user try it on ur legs first then gauge ur reaction and go from there.</li>
            <li>Overall its an okay product, and I would consider purchasing again because I do like the moisturizing that comes with this product.  </li>
            <li>Hot but not too hot.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using 10 mins at a time when u first start out.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend for when you first start out tho</li>
            <li>This was the first time that I used a tingle tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>But based off its reviews, my expectations were higher than</li>
            <li>Thanks Again Amazon !</li>
            <li>So Much Sun !</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !....</li>
            <li>3 More Minutes Fighting To Get Back In That Refrigerated House !</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li>Mins!&lt;br /&gt;Got hot.</li>
            <li>This stuff is HOT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good slow process isn&#x27;t super tingly</li>
            <li>it was exactly as described, I guess i was ignorant about how much my skin would be affected so yikes</li>
            <li>Nice dark tan.</li>
            <li>def a strong stinging and tingle especially on the face..</li>
            <li>and they all really like this product.  </li>
            <li>the product was always the real deal</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  </li>
            <li>Received relatively fast.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Have to use it a couple of times straight to notice anything.</li>
            <li>However it is very brown</li>
            <li>, it has REAL bronzer in it as well-- DHA (Dihydroxyacetone)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had to jump off of the tanning bed 4minutes in, because i felt like fire ants were biting my whole body.</li>
            <li>and you do feel a sunburn like feeling for about 2 hours afterwards, but gives a really nice bronzing tan after a few uses.</li>
            <li>Never in my 10 years of tanning has a combination of lotions produced such a quick and beautiful color to my naturally pale irish skin.</li>
            <li>I saw a very small amount of redness that turned to a nice golden tan not orange.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s a lot more intense than ProTan&#x27;s Extreme Sizzle Bronzer,) but it doesn&#x27;t specify what Level</li>
            <li>Pro Tan&#x27;s Totally Baked Blazin&#x27; Hot Black Gelee is one amazing tingle lotion.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend that lotion for Advanced/Experienced Tingle lotion</li>
            <li>and wow!!</li>
            <li>Big Hot Flash !</li>
            <li>Totally Baked And Blazing Hot !</li>
            <li>I had a pretty good base tan, but I sure could tell a big difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a first time tanner though might be a bit much for starting off..</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re new to tanning</li>
            <li>even though the back of the bottle towards the bottom left it says Level 3 Advanced.</li>
            <li>The tingle wasn&#x27;t too strong and didn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok it is different you can not stay in the tanning bed too long with it on, it does turn you red but goes away in a couple hours</li>
            <li>I would completely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>IN THESE PRO TAN TINGLE LOTIONS ARE JUST COSMETIC &amp;/OR NATURAL, (riboflavin, caramel color, etc.)</li>
            <li>It has a different texture from normal lotion, hence the \\&quot;Gelee\\</li>
            <li>Personally I think if you are new to tanning this is not a product for you.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re starting off new it would be helpful.</li>
            <li>just ordered ProTan&#x27;s Seriously Hot Extreme Sizzle Bronzer (tingle) tanning lotion, which claims to be a Level 10 tingle</li>
            <li>(Not for a first time tanner, make sure you have a base tan first.)  </li>
            <li>I was red for about an hour afterwards and then my tan was so super dark!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff it a little hot not to bad does leave you read for a few hours from the lotion but gives you a nice tan</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll look a little much at first</li>
            <li>It helped me tan at first, but now I have plateaued and I have only used half of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to any one that wants a really dark tan.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a four star rating because it does tingle a bit, but not long,</li>
            <li>Tingles are only intense until you have a good base tan otherwise only tingly on the face yet.</li>
            <li>Social Potential !</li>
            <li>the same time I also purchased Millenium Tanning&#x27;s Insanely Black Ultra Dark 60x (which reviews claim to be a more extreme tingle!),&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tanned for a week straight and was literally so dark!</li>
            <li>Smell test, it smells really good pre tan like a sugar cookie, ato isn&#x27;t bad either</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They deliver very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it is a bit strong, but</li>
            <li> However, I would not use it on the face, I think that the tingle would be too strong for the face.  </li>
            <li> this is perfectly priced and very red hot tingling if u miss a view days of tanning use this</li>
            <li> Plus the &amp;#34;bronzing black gelee&amp;#34; is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is super-hot, and I got a fantastic color change after one use.</li>
            <li> Never buying cheap tanning lotion again.</li>
            <li> Buy them in your gym or salon where you can sample a packet before you spend $36 to get the free S/H for four lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive any free samples as some people said they did.  </li>
            <li> Just a light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went tanning everyday and brought out awesome color.</li>
            <li> This cheap bronzed works really well!!!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to tan for a good 2 weeks due to the flu</li>
            <li> I read the reviews an was super excited</li>
            <li> Not only is the tanning lotion affordable and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall for the price, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> It has a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> Not bad...</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell</li>
            <li> (when I first used it, it was just very mild, if anything at all, after being in the tanning bed a full lengths time)&lt;br</li>
            <li> A mild tingler.</li>
            <li> It has a mild tingle.</li>
            <li> I started turning red as soon as I put it on, and felt very warm, so I was very unsure about the lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great for an even dark tan</li>
            <li> It is a very very hot tingle.</li>
            <li> Super hot and tingles!</li>
            <li> It gets super hot!</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to anybody looking to bump up their level of color-anybody that can handle a mid-level hot tingle!&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping this lotion in my line-up!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Always try out your products first!</li>
            <li> This tingle is great for new tanners, the tingle is just enough.  </li>
            <li> a rare occasion for me)</li>
            <li> feel as though a &amp;#34;goodie&amp;#34; bag is exciting in itself to receive.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY</li>
            <li> me right</li>
            <li> But I absolutely loved the texture and how easily, slick, &amp; smoothly it glides</li>
            <li> Solid Black Is Awesome !</li>
            <li> donated the four to the gym so others who wouldn&#x27;t normally buy the lotions could use them for free.</li>
            <li> Also if u take a hot shower right after use it will reactivate.</li>
            <li> Pure Genius !</li>
            <li> the lotion is very &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; so i do make sure i don&#x27;t get it near my face.</li>
            <li> This was my first tingler.  </li>
            <li> If ur a first yime user try it on ur legs first then gauge ur reaction and go from there.</li>
            <li> Overall its an okay product, and I would consider purchasing again because I do like the moisturizing that comes with this product.  </li>
            <li> Hot but not too hot.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using 10 mins at a time when u first start out.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend for when you first start out tho</li>
            <li> This was the first time that I used a tingle tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> But based off its reviews, my expectations were higher than</li>
            <li> Thanks Again Amazon !</li>
            <li> So Much Sun !</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon !....</li>
            <li> 3 More Minutes Fighting To Get Back In That Refrigerated House !</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li> Mins!&lt;br /&gt;Got hot.</li>
            <li> This stuff is HOT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good slow process isn&#x27;t super tingly</li>
            <li> it was exactly as described, I guess i was ignorant about how much my skin would be affected so yikes</li>
            <li> Nice dark tan.</li>
            <li> def a strong stinging and tingle especially on the face..</li>
            <li> and they all really like this product.  </li>
            <li> the product was always the real deal</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  </li>
            <li> Received relatively fast.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Have to use it a couple of times straight to notice anything.</li>
            <li> However it is very brown</li>
            <li> , it has REAL bronzer in it as well-- DHA (Dihydroxyacetone)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to jump off of the tanning bed 4minutes in, because i felt like fire ants were biting my whole body.</li>
            <li> and you do feel a sunburn like feeling for about 2 hours afterwards, but gives a really nice bronzing tan after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Never in my 10 years of tanning has a combination of lotions produced such a quick and beautiful color to my naturally pale irish skin.</li>
            <li> I saw a very small amount of redness that turned to a nice golden tan not orange.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s a lot more intense than ProTan&#x27;s Extreme Sizzle Bronzer,) but it doesn&#x27;t specify what Level</li>
            <li> Pro Tan&#x27;s Totally Baked Blazin&#x27; Hot Black Gelee is one amazing tingle lotion.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend that lotion for Advanced/Experienced Tingle lotion</li>
            <li> and wow!!</li>
            <li> Big Hot Flash !</li>
            <li> Totally Baked And Blazing Hot !</li>
            <li> I had a pretty good base tan, but I sure could tell a big difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a first time tanner though might be a bit much for starting off..</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re new to tanning</li>
            <li> even though the back of the bottle towards the bottom left it says Level 3 Advanced.</li>
            <li> The tingle wasn&#x27;t too strong and didn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok it is different you can not stay in the tanning bed too long with it on, it does turn you red but goes away in a couple hours</li>
            <li> I would completely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> IN THESE PRO TAN TINGLE LOTIONS ARE JUST COSMETIC &amp;/OR NATURAL, (riboflavin, caramel color, etc.)</li>
            <li> It has a different texture from normal lotion, hence the \\&quot;Gelee\\</li>
            <li> Personally I think if you are new to tanning this is not a product for you.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re starting off new it would be helpful.</li>
            <li> just ordered ProTan&#x27;s Seriously Hot Extreme Sizzle Bronzer (tingle) tanning lotion, which claims to be a Level 10 tingle</li>
            <li> (Not for a first time tanner, make sure you have a base tan first.)  </li>
            <li> I was red for about an hour afterwards and then my tan was so super dark!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it a little hot not to bad does leave you read for a few hours from the lotion but gives you a nice tan</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll look a little much at first</li>
            <li> It helped me tan at first, but now I have plateaued and I have only used half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any one that wants a really dark tan.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a four star rating because it does tingle a bit, but not long,</li>
            <li> Tingles are only intense until you have a good base tan otherwise only tingly on the face yet.</li>
            <li> Social Potential !</li>
            <li> the same time I also purchased Millenium Tanning&#x27;s Insanely Black Ultra Dark 60x (which reviews claim to be a more extreme tingle!),&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tanned for a week straight and was literally so dark!</li>
            <li> Smell test, it smells really good pre tan like a sugar cookie, ato isn&#x27;t bad either</li>
            <li> First use:  As it says the body does heat up within a few moments, but that doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> *Edit &amp; Updated - (A little long, but Very informative)*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expected it to be hotter, but</li>
            <li> Second use:  barely heated or tingled, slight redness that did lead to a hint of color.</li>
            <li> You feel the burn like crazy with it, make sure you apply evenly..</li>
            <li> The only down fall, it will turn your hands a tint of orange/brown until your next shower.</li>
            <li> but then saw my arm about 10 minutes later, &amp; the spot where I put it had turned a little red.</li>
            <li> Like The Most Expensive Perfume !</li>
            <li> On second review, this does not work like average tanning salon tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> It simply gives a little burn and then it does not turn to tan.</li>
            <li> I was red for a little while after and then turned tan</li>
            <li> Its better than all the expensive tanning lotions I have bought in the past!</li>
            <li> Was kind of afraid that it would be to hot, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not hot at all</li>

            <li> I got dark,</li>
            <li> but the lotion is not at all what I expected it barely tingles not much color after a few tans I jst really don&#x27;t like it:(</li>

            <li> In So Little Time !</li>
            <li> Tingles but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I had to leave the bed early and almost had my husband take me to the doctor because it burned so badly</li>
            <li> this lotion is absolutely for someone with a base tan.  </li>
            <li> A very slight pin and needle feel for maybe an hour afterward, but not one that&#x27;s alarming or painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert by any means, but I would say this lotion is NOT a good choice for a first-time tingle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was afraid it was going to burn me up (other products do)</li>
            <li> My hand immediately got red and burned very badly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need an expensive tanning package with this lotion.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was my first tingler.  I really love it.  You can definitely see what you got almost immediately after tanning.  Smells like cherry chapstick.  I have 4 people tanning in my home and they all really like this product.  Tingles are only intense until you have a good base tan otherwise only tingly on the face yet.</li>
            <li> If i could give it 6 STARS i would. I luv this been using it over all my more expensive products like  JWoWw Mad Hot and my Ed Hardy dont get me right they&#x27;re great but at bout $50 a bottle at the tan salon this is perfectly priced and very red hot tingling if u miss a view days of tanning use this and it erases that missed time. If ur a first yime user try it on ur legs first then gauge ur reaction and go from there. Also if u take a hot shower right after use it will reactivate. So lukewarm to coldish us best plus ull be hot so u will want to anyways. +++++FYi ive bought from thus seller and one more amd the product was always the real deal no water down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years now and I love it! It gives a nice color! The only down fall, it will turn your hands a tint of orange/brown until your next shower. Not bad...but a little.</li>
            <li> The product came all half exploded</li>
            <li> Pro Tan&#x27;s Totally Baked Blazin&#x27; Hot Black Gelee is one amazing tingle lotion.  I hadn&#x27;t tanned for maybe a week (a rare occasion for me) and then I used this.  It was so friggin&#x27; hot, the tingle was wonderful!  Not only that, but when I stepped out of the tanning bed, that week of no tanning was gone because I had a lot of instant color, not just from bronzer.  It has a different texture from normal lotion, hence the \\&quot;Gelee\\&quot; in the name. It&#x27;s not chunky gelee though, it&#x27;s really smooth and has a really interesting smell to it, that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.  I would completely recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff burns like a mother f**ker. It hurts and it makes you all red and then you get bumps and it&#x27;s a legitimate mess on your skin. 5 stars cause it does what it says. The smell it&#x27;s very very strong. Use only for like under 6 minutes. Wash it all off ASAP. Do not recommend using it outside ever.</li>
            <li> This product is like putting bengay on your body with no tan improvement I noticed.  Member again.</li>
            <li> Ok lotion for the price</li>
            <li> Works great for an even dark tan</li>
            <li> You feel the burn like crazy with it, make sure you apply evenly.. it&#x27;ll look a little much at first but after an hr or so the redness goes down and you see your gorgeous tan! One session from pale to bronze but I recommend using this after you already have a base tan or it&#x27;ll burn and tingle pretty bad</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful</li>
            <li> I just received this bottle this atternonn  but am planning on taking it with me tomorrow  to tan.  I heard great things so I sure all will</li>
            <li> Super hot and tingles! Love it!</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was afraid it was going to burn me up (other products do) its acutally not that bad at all! Tingles for sure.. and you do feel a sunburn like feeling for about 2 hours afterwards, but gives a really nice bronzing tan after a few uses. Oh!! the lady that worked at the tanning salon was like man you are red what did you use.. so I showed her this product and she said she was going to try it.</li>
            <li> I love this tingle!! The price is truly a steal! I hadn&#x27;t been able to tan for a good 2 weeks due to the flu and I used this and wow!! It didn&#x27;t look like I missed a day. I was red for about an hour afterwards and then my tan was so super dark! It is a very very hot tingle. Personally I think if you are new to tanning this is not a product for you. The smell is wonderful. Delivery was fast. I would ( and have) totally buy again!</li>
            <li> Excellent Bronzer!!  Fast shipping.  Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert by any means, but I would say this lotion is NOT a good choice for a first-time tingle.&lt;br /&gt;I keep a tingle in my regular lotion rotation and decided to give Totally Baked a try. .. I loved it!! It is super-hot, and I got a fantastic color change after one use. I stayed red for about an hour. No ATO, great scent,  and the lotion goes on really smooth. I would suggest this to anybody looking to bump up their level of color-anybody that can handle a mid-level hot tingle!&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping this lotion in my line-up!</li>
            <li> This tingle is great for new tanners, the tingle is just enough.  It has a wonderful smell, overall i would definately buy again.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have used in a long time. Perfect if you&#x27;re an experienced tanner . The smell is FABULOUS! Reminds me of cotton candy almost. Leaves me skin oh so silky too. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  But if you&#x27;re new to tanning I suggest taking it easy.It has a great tingle factor.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, but returned it immediately. Never ended up using it.&lt;br /&gt;Before going to the salon I tried less than about a pea sized amount on my hand and rubbed it in just to see. My hand immediately got red and burned very badly. I wasn&#x27;t even in a tanning bed yet!&lt;br /&gt;Nope, not for me. Never buying cheap tanning lotion again. You just never know.&lt;br /&gt;Always try out your products first!</li>
            <li> Item burned my skin when I used it</li>
            <li> This product is an okay product.  I gave it a four star rating because it does tingle a bit, but not long, its a nice moisturizer and the color is nice afterward.  First use:  As it says the body does heat up within a few moments, but that doesn&#x27;t last long.  A very slight pin and needle feel for maybe an hour afterward, but not one that&#x27;s alarming or painful. (Not for a first time tanner, make sure you have a base tan first.)  I saw a very small amount of redness that turned to a nice golden tan not orange. Smell test, it smells really good pre tan like a sugar cookie, ato isn&#x27;t bad either but its more a light candy smell. Second use:  barely heated or tingled, slight redness that did lead to a hint of color. Smell, remained the same cookie to candy. Overall its an okay product, and I would consider purchasing again because I do like the moisturizing that comes with this product.  It is not a product that will get you extremely dark in just a few uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good slow process isn&#x27;t super tingly but if you&#x27;re starting off new it would be helpful. Good for its price.</li>
            <li> Would only recommend to experience tanners.  Does leave turn your skin red but within 2 hrs it fades to a tan.  Little tingle not much.  Would not use on the face, haven&#x27;t tried it but don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> I just started tanning with this about 3 weeks ago and I got so dark within days! It&#x27;s excellent and I will always recommend this company&#x27;s tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tingle lotion. You will see results immediately! Plus the &amp;#34;bronzing black gelee&amp;#34; is awesome. I tanned for a week straight and was literally so dark! Plus it smells good!</li>
            <li> Love it for the price! Its better than all the expensive tanning lotions I have bought in the past! This is my favorite tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> On second review, this does not work like average tanning salon tanning lotions. It simply gives a little burn and then it does not turn to tan. I am a hardcore tanner and I happened upon this product line and now know it was a monumental mistake. Stay away. I will never buy lotions on Amazon again. Buy them in your gym or salon where you can sample a packet before you spend $36 to get the free S/H for four lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I donated the four to the gym so others who wouldn&#x27;t normally buy the lotions could use them for free.</li>
            <li> This s*** is wack. Don&#x27;t buy it. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Received relatively fast. I love this product! Hot but not too hot. Tingles but not overwhelming. I would recommend using 10 mins at a time when u first start out. I got dark, I mean really dark after two uses. Awesome lotion! Not a bad smell but it is a bit strong, but that&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it a little hot not to bad does leave you read for a few hours from the lotion but gives you a nice tan and I did go20 mins at a time with it on and ddidn&#x27;t have a problem don&#x27;t recommend for when you first start out tho</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this lotion has a medium level tingle and the fact that it&#x27;s bronzing is a plus. It works really well but the smell is God-awful. It&#x27;s like candy and a vaporizer rolled into one. That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t give it the extra star</li>
            <li> This was the first time that I used a tingle tanning lotion.  Was kind of afraid that it would be to hot, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  The tingle wasn&#x27;t too strong and didn&#x27;t last too long.  I had a pretty good base tan, but I sure could tell a big difference after the first use.  I never did turn red, but I sure  got brown.  Not to crazy about the smell, but can live with it.  I have  already ordered another bottle.  Best tan I&#x27;ve had in along time.  They deliver very quickly.  I would recommend to any one that wants a really dark tan.  However, I would not use it on the face, I think that the tingle would be too strong for the face.  I didn&#x27;t receive any free samples as some people said they did.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive tingle lotion!!!  Does the job!</li>
            <li> this lotion is absolutely for someone with a base tan.  the lotion is very &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; so i do make sure i don&#x27;t get it near my face. i do love the results but it does have that &amp;#34;tanning bed&amp;#34; smell.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was burning, but I don&#x27;t see a difference? Have to use it a couple of times straight to notice anything.</li>
            <li> Great product for price</li>
            <li> A mild tingler. I like it!</li>
            <li> This cheap bronzed works really well!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews an was super excited but the lotion is not at all what I expected it barely tingles not much color after a few tans I jst really don&#x27;t like it:(</li>
            <li> Not only is the tanning lotion affordable and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I love that the seller gets it to me in goo time and always throws in samples.&lt;br /&gt;I feel as though a &amp;#34;goodie&amp;#34; bag is exciting in itself to receive.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> Can you use it indoor and out doors instead of tanning bed?</li>
            <li> This lotion is not hot at all! 0 tingle. However it is very brown so we shall see if it is a good bronzer. ....</li>
            <li> I started turning red as soon as I put it on, and felt very warm, so I was very unsure about the lotion. I laid 15 minutes and got so warm. I was red for a little while after and then turned tan I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> *Edit &amp; Updated - (A little long, but Very informative)*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expected it to be hotter, but even though the back of the bottle towards the bottom left it says Level 3 Advanced. That&#x27;s not referring to the tingle factor. (B/c I have a Level 10 tingle lotion by Pro Tan that has that same thing on the back of the bottle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not hot at all (when I first used it, it was just very mild, if anything at all, after being in the tanning bed a full lengths time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it when it arrived, putting it just on a part of my arm while at home. I didn&#x27;t feel it, so I almost forgot about it- but then saw my arm about 10 minutes later, &amp; the spot where I put it had turned a little red. Nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it as a beginner&#x27;s tingle tanning lotion. If you don&#x27;t or never have used a tingle lotion you&#x27;d probably feel it. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about a Level 2-3 Tingle.&lt;br /&gt; But I absolutely loved the texture and how easily, slick, &amp; smoothly it glides on!!**&lt;br /&gt;Personally though I won&#x27;t purchase it again only because I want something hotter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE*~&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered ProTan&#x27;s Seriously Hot Extreme Sizzle Bronzer (tingle) tanning lotion, which claims to be a Level 10 tingle lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I received it. it I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more about a Level 6-7. I liked it, &amp; recommend it for Intermediate/Advanced Tingle lotion users.&lt;br /&gt;__________________&lt;br /&gt;ATTN:&lt;br /&gt;THE \\&quot;BRONZERS\\&quot; IN THESE PRO TAN TINGLE LOTIONS ARE JUST COSMETIC &amp;/OR NATURAL, (riboflavin, caramel color, etc.) THEY WASH OFF. THESE PRO TAN TINGLE LOTIONS DO NOT CONTAIN DHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ SEE CUSTOMER IMAGES!! *****&lt;br /&gt;I posted photos of the back of the bottle to show ingredients, etc.&lt;br /&gt;(&amp; wrote informative reviews on my other purchases also.)&lt;br /&gt;__________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time I also purchased Millenium Tanning&#x27;s Insanely Black Ultra Dark 60x (which reviews claim to be a more extreme tingle!),&lt;br /&gt;I received this as well. (It&#x27;s a lot more intense than ProTan&#x27;s Extreme Sizzle Bronzer,) but it doesn&#x27;t specify what Level it&#x27;s Tingle factor is. But based off its reviews, my expectations were higher than once I tried it myself. I Love it though, it has REAL bronzer in it as well-- DHA (Dihydroxyacetone)&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend that lotion for Advanced/Experienced Tingle lotion users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp; also Millennium Tanning&#x27;s Black Storm 60x Extreme Silicone Bronzer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ran out of Millennium Paint it Black 50x, it was a good bronzer &amp; smooth in texture. Just a light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend both these last two lotions if you&#x27;re looking for Awesome &amp; affordable bronzing tanning lotions</li>

            <li> it was exactly as described, I guess i was ignorant about how much my skin would be affected so yikes</li>
            <li> The product was as described. And arrived in somewhat of a timely manner</li>
            <li> ooh man ! I used this entire bottle within two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;smells great &amp; really helped me get my tan on!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok it is different you can not stay in the tanning bed too long with it on, it does turn you red but goes away in a couple hours and you do get tan..</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome..I tan a lot and I loved this one..def a strong stinging and tingle especially on the face..I was so dark within days of using this..wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a first time tanner though might be a bit much for starting off..I&#x27;d def recommend though for pro tanners like myself :-)</li>
            <li> Lotion is awesome! The cap on the tanning lotion bottle did have a defect though</li>
            <li> I used this product in combination with &amp;#34;Gilded&amp;#34; by: Australian Gold, and the results I achieved have amazed me. Never in my 10 years of tanning has a combination of lotions produced such a quick and beautiful color to my naturally pale irish skin. A++</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It has a mild tingle. It helped me tan at first, but now I have plateaued and I have only used half of the bottle. The smell isn&#x27;t over bearing. It hasn&#x27;t streaked on me. Overall for the price, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion and tried it once. I had to leave the bed early and almost had my husband take me to the doctor because it burned so badly and I got so red. Even after a shower I was still red and burning. Awful lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a tingler and I did not realize that.  I  did not like the smell .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good tingle for the price! You can&#x27;t beat it. It gets super hot! It has a nice soft scent. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Most def. DO NOT GO MORE THAN 10 Mins!&lt;br /&gt;Got hot. was awesome. felt great.&lt;br /&gt;Noticed Tanner Already 1 use!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked great. I used it once every week looked like. I went tanning everyday and brought out awesome color. One of my favorite products</li>
            <li> This stuff is HOT. I had to jump off of the tanning bed 4minutes in, because i felt like fire ants were biting my whole body. Now im terrified to even apply it again,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need an expensive tanning package with this lotion. I am in a level one bed and tanned for three days in a row and already have great color.</li>
            <li> Works good for the price can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Love it. Nice dark tan.</li>
