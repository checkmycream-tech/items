            <li>I have to say this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll definitely be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This lotion works great and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>and the price is great</li>
            <li>my favorite hand lotion not sold in stores anymore - not greasy!!</li>
            <li>I had been using Vaseline healthy hands and nails for a couple of years and absolutely LOVED it!!</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and it is good for nails.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is good, but I purchased for grandma</li>
            <li>I love it....smells great....</li>
            <li>love love love - makes hands feel wonderful</li>
            <li>My recommendation: stock up on this stuff and you&#x27;ll have hands that will look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, since finding this one I&#x27;ve bought it fairly often, and I haven&#x27;t been able to beat the Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save price.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your nails super strong!!!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, someone recommended this one, and I&#x27;ve found it is a good substitute.  </li>
            <li>It makes my nails feel so strong!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many lotions to counteract the environmental effects of my climate, but this one is BY FAR the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>this will be my 7th tube; i had tried many differ hand cream including the best sellers at sephora such as L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream,Bliss High Intensity Hand Cream; THis is the Best one!!</li>
            <li>I love this hand lotion .</li>
            <li>The scent, though, is what turned me off the most.</li>
            <li>I was being more diligent about using lotion.</li>
            <li>It will forever be my favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hand/nail care product.</li>
            <li>Be sure to rub it into your nails and underneath as well when you have grown your nails out.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Would like a better price, so four stars.</li>
            <li>Of yes, the hands look pretty good, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit lighter than the Rich Moisture was (which, despite its name, wasn&#x27;t very rich), and I find myself using it a bit more often.  </li>
            <li>It works better than the others, and absorbs more quickly.</li>
            <li>If, by chance, you were a fan of the discontinued Avon Rich Moisture Hand and Nail cream, allow me to recommend the Vaseline Healthy Hands and Nails Lotion.  </li>
            <li>Makes my nails strong and grow faster.</li>
            <li>However, it does provide the light, nongreasy, nonslick feel that I like.  </li>
            <li>Wife loves that I can get these for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Overall, my hands and nails are greatly improved using this product.</li>
            <li>These actually work great.</li>
            <li>This cream fit the bill to a T.</li>
            <li>wish they carried a larger size container, but with the Amazon Subscribe and Save price, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, I have found it again, and ordered the pack of three!!!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions, but none of them have been able to compare with Vaseline Healthy Hands and Nails Lotion.  </li>
            <li>Really great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I tend to get really dry hands and cuticles, and this has proven to be a great solution for both.</li>
            <li>She said they were the most beautiful, natural nails she had seen a long time.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Thanks Vaseline Healthy Hands and Nails.  </li>
            <li>It is a very smart product!  </li>
            <li>However, it does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>Nongreasy and absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and live by it.</li>
            <li>Have not used similar products of this kind.</li>
            <li>and it just seemed to have the right consistency, feel, and level of moisturizing my hands and nails needed.  </li>
            <li>Right after dish-duty (and whenever washing hands) I apply a dab of this and rub into my cuticles and tops of hands.  </li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with a generic sweet powdery scent, but this smells like something you&#x27;d get at the hospital.</li>
            <li>I had not been able to find it locally but a quick look on Amazon</li>
            <li>Since I started using it regularly, my hands definitely look nice and my cuticles and nails look healthy.</li>
            <li>It really smooths and lubricates my hands quickly, and you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>My hands were getting aged, however this cream has improved my hands significantly; now they look healthy, however, my skin is still hard/rougher than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>It gets absorbed quite fast and does not leave any greasy goo on my keyboard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>even though the product does exactly what it is supposed to do, I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands more than 20 times daily between my work and household maintaince.  </li>
            <li>This is only hand lotion that keeps my nails strong.</li>
            <li>Also, I have definitely seen a huge difference in the strength of my nails.</li>
            <li>I think that it really has helped to make my nails stronger.</li>
            <li>As much as I detest the scent of this lotion, I wanted to see it really worked.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and does a fantastic job when used regularly with hand, nail and cuticle health.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I don&#x27;t like handling my infant son when I have the lotion on just in case</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>There is a noticeable difference in my nail strength and growth after using this for a few weeks and the smell is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>and I use lotion more frequently since my hands are dry,</li>
            <li>When Avon discontinued the hand cream, I hit eBay and hoarded the available stock for a long time.    </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s difficult to say if they were stronger, they did appear to be more conditioned and healthy.</li>
            <li>And it only has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to heal super dry skin - just provide some temporary moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry hands because of all the hand washing I do and this lotion is my favorite because it actually strengthens my nails!</li>
            <li>I had looked for a long time for a hand cream that would soften the skin, absorb quickly and not leave my palms sticky.</li>
            <li>and I do know the lotion goes on smooth, disappears, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, something I dislike in other hand creams.</li>
            <li>and she did not like the new formula as well as before.</li>
            <li>I hope the Vaseline company will not discontinue it as they did with large size of the same lotion.</li>
            <li>After using this lotion , it is softer and smoother, but I have to reapply quite frequently.</li>
            <li>My hands - even in winter - are properly moisturized thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and believe I really DO notice a difference in my nails, if that&#x27;s possible in so short a time!  </li>
            <li>I am slightly obsessed about moisturizing my hands - I have seen way too many examples where well-used and wrinkled hands of a person look older than the person actually is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Vaseline hand lotions before, but this one really works.</li>
            <li>The fact that I&#x27;m not getting big cracks on my fingers after using this lotion, especially on my thumbs, is worth a little initial discomfort.  </li>

            <li> called addicted to the Rich Moisture cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched brands only to come back to this when my hands dry out,</li>
            <li> In winter, especially my hands tend to get dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I could purchase the Vaseline Healthy Hands and Nails Lotion from my local Walmart for a less expensive price.  </li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands, so they get very dry.  </li>
            <li> Because of the long list of chemical ingredients listed on the product.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate; in the winter, the air literally sucks the moisture out of your skin.</li>
            <li> It is a little slick in the first few minutes after applying, but doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizing lotions but they never worked.  </li>
            <li> I usually just use regular body moisturizer on my hands</li>
            <li> For some reason its hard to come by in the regular drug store.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned that this causes a burning/stinging sensation when applied, and I do feel that effect on any little nicks in my fingers or hand areas.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve got to say...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, pretty bad stuff.</li>
            <li> The alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) in the lotion makes it so effective--AHA sloughs the outer (dead) layer of skin!</li>
            <li> I was what I jokingly (but somewhat seriously)</li>
            <li> If you have paper thin nails and use this lotion at least twice a day, you will notice an appreciable difference in just two weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Just wish I could find it in the pump bottle - expensive per ounce in these small tubes.</li>
            <li> im really addicted too it....</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about the nail strengthening part but after about two weeks of using the product, nails are tougher and don&#x27;t break as often.</li>
            <li> There is a ton of them in the lotion and the weird chemical smell of the product betrays it.</li>
            <li> I started using this when my nails were at their worst; they were discolored, bumpy, cracked and laminated.  </li>

            <li> Really great for dry skin. Shipping took a week, but besides that great product</li>
            <li> This is only hand lotion that keeps my nails strong. I hope the Vaseline company will not discontinue it as they did with large size of the same lotion.</li>
            <li> this will be my 7th tube; i had tried many differ hand cream including the best sellers at sephora such as L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream,Bliss High Intensity Hand Cream; THis is the Best one!!</li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion . I had not been able to find it locally but a quick look on Amazon and there it was. I think that it really has helped to make my nails stronger.</li>
            <li> If, by chance, you were a fan of the discontinued Avon Rich Moisture Hand and Nail cream, allow me to recommend the Vaseline Healthy Hands and Nails Lotion.  I was what I jokingly (but somewhat seriously) called addicted to the Rich Moisture cream.  I used it for years and it just seemed to have the right consistency, feel, and level of moisturizing my hands and nails needed.  When Avon discontinued the hand cream, I hit eBay and hoarded the available stock for a long time.    Fortunately, someone recommended this one, and I&#x27;ve found it is a good substitute.  It&#x27;s a bit lighter than the Rich Moisture was (which, despite its name, wasn&#x27;t very rich), and I find myself using it a bit more often.  However, it does provide the light, nongreasy, nonslick feel that I like.  Incidentally, since finding this one I&#x27;ve bought it fairly often, and I haven&#x27;t been able to beat the Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save price.</li>
            <li> With continued use of this lotion, your nails are supposed to be stronger in two weeks.The lotion itself is white and while not runny, not the consistency I like.However, it does absorb quickly. The scent, though, is what turned me off the most. I&#x27;m okay with a generic sweet powdery scent, but this smells like something you&#x27;d get at the hospital. It&#x27;s not pleasant at all. As much as I detest the scent of this lotion, I wanted to see it really worked. So I used it every time after I had my hands in water in the kitchen. While it&#x27;s difficult to say if they were stronger, they did appear to be more conditioned and healthy. But then again, it&#x27;s winter time and I use lotion more frequently since my hands are dry, so it could just be I was being more diligent about using lotion. What about the condition of my skin?  After using this lotion , it is softer and smoother, but I have to reapply quite frequently. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to heal super dry skin - just provide some temporary moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty bad stuff. Skip it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and live by it. Nongreasy and absorbs so quickly. It will forever be my favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li> my favorite hand lotion not sold in stores anymore - not greasy!!</li>
            <li> Order arrived ahead of time and even in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it I see a difference in the condition of my fingernails.  I like the&lt;br /&gt;product and will probably be ordering more--some of it I&#x27;ll give to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Wife loves that I can get these for such a great price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand/nail care product.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion.  It is not greasy and does a fantastic job when used regularly with hand, nail and cuticle health.  I have been using it for years and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I could purchase the Vaseline Healthy Hands and Nails Lotion from my local Walmart for a less expensive price.  I like the product but will purchase it at the best price.</li>
            <li> Recently switched back to this hand lotion.  Have been applying throughout the day to try and combat the drying effects of the winter.  My nails are not splitting or chipping like they had been.  Another reviewer mentioned that this causes a burning/stinging sensation when applied, and I do feel that effect on any little nicks in my fingers or hand areas.  The fact that I&#x27;m not getting big cracks on my fingers after using this lotion, especially on my thumbs, is worth a little initial discomfort.  It is a little slick in the first few minutes after applying, but doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky feeling.  Overall, my hands and nails are greatly improved using this product.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite hand moisturizer. It makes my nails feel so strong!</li>
            <li> I started using this when my nails were at their worst; they were discolored, bumpy, cracked and laminated.  I massaged the lotion into my hands and nails all around the nail and cuticle.  I use it three-four times a day and massage the nails every time.  Recently a nail technician looking for business asked to see my nails.  She said they were the most beautiful, natural nails she had seen a long time.  Thanks Vaseline Healthy Hands and Nails.  Of yes, the hands look pretty good, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and believe I really DO notice a difference in my nails, if that&#x27;s possible in so short a time!  I use it at night before bed and I do know the lotion goes on smooth, disappears, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, something I dislike in other hand creams.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this lotion in stores anymore so I was very happy to find it here.  This is one of the best hand lotions I&#x27;ve used.  It is not greasy and it is good for nails.  And it only has a mild scent.  This size is great too.  One for the nightstand, one at work, and one extra.</li>
            <li> These actually work great. Was skeptical about the nail strengthening part but after about two weeks of using the product, nails are tougher and don&#x27;t break as often.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST nail lotion ever.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and telling others about it for years.  If you have paper thin nails and use this lotion at least twice a day, you will notice an appreciable difference in just two weeks.  Be sure to rub it into your nails and underneath as well when you have grown your nails out.  Put it on before you leave for work and again just before bed.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand lotion that I use. Love it. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and never thought I&#x27;d be reviewing hand lotion.  I have chronic eczema that returns periodically from hand washing.  I have to say this stuff works great. I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizing lotions but they never worked.  I don&#x27;t know what Ingredient X is (maybe the keratin or vitamin E), but this stuff heals my chapped hands after using it for like twice a day for 2-3 days.  I also use it anywhere on my body I have eczema or irritated skin.  Excellent healing/soothing qualities.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it. For some reason its hard to come by in the regular drug store.  I hope they continue to sell it somewhere.  Try it, you&#x27;ll definitely be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I had looked for a long time for a hand cream that would soften the skin, absorb quickly and not leave my palms sticky. This cream fit the bill to a T. Just wish I could find it in the pump bottle - expensive per ounce in these small tubes.</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands, so they get very dry.  In winter, especially my hands tend to get dry and cracked.  I have tried many different lotions, but none of them have been able to compare with Vaseline Healthy Hands and Nails Lotion.  I&#x27;ve switched brands only to come back to this when my hands dry out, which doesn&#x27;t take long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they carried a larger size container, but with the Amazon Subscribe and Save price, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I absolutely love it.  My nails are just not the same without it.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Makes my nails strong and grow faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Vaseline hand lotions before, but this one really works. It really smooths and lubricates my hands quickly, and you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li> I am slightly obsessed about moisturizing my hands - I have seen way too many examples where well-used and wrinkled hands of a person look older than the person actually is. I usually just use regular body moisturizer on my hands but I pick up hand-specific lotions from time to time. This time it was the vaseline hand lotion. It was a pack of three. I keep one tube on my desk at work and one tube by my bedside. Since I started using it regularly, my hands definitely look nice and my cuticles and nails look healthy. It gets absorbed quite fast and does not leave any greasy goo on my keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why then the 3 star rating instead of a 5 star rating? Because of the long list of chemical ingredients listed on the product. There is a ton of them in the lotion and the weird chemical smell of the product betrays it. So much so that I don&#x27;t like handling my infant son when I have the lotion on just in case it causes a rash on him. So I always wash the lotion off my hands before I touch my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, even though the product does exactly what it is supposed to do, I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I tried this during a renovation project at home during the winter. This lotion works great and is not greasy. My husband and I both use this daily.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion. I tend to get really dry hands and cuticles, and this has proven to be a great solution for both. Also, I have definitely seen a huge difference in the strength of my nails. It smells really good too!</li>
            <li> The product itself is good, but I purchased for grandma and she did not like the new formula as well as before.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all, and Vaseline Hand and Nail is the best.  It works better than the others, and absorbs more quickly.</li>
            <li> I had been using Vaseline healthy hands and nails for a couple of years and absolutely LOVED it!! Then I noticed the stores were not selling it anymore and my heart sank.... Thanks to Amazon, I have found it again, and ordered the pack of three!!!  I&#x27;m SO HAPPY!!!  My hands and nails have never been better!!!</li>
            <li> Best hand lotion ever.  Not greasy.  Dries quickly.  Makes my nails stronger.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry hands because of all the hand washing I do and this lotion is my favorite because it actually strengthens my nails! There is a noticeable difference in my nail strength and growth after using this for a few weeks and the smell is nice and not overpowering. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands more than 20 times daily between my work and household maintaince.  My hands were getting aged, however this cream has improved my hands significantly; now they look healthy, however, my skin is still hard/rougher than it used to be.  Also, this cream does NOT leave a greasy film on my hands.  Would like a better price, so four stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few years now, and I&#x27;ve got to say... this lotion is the best! I live in a very dry climate; in the winter, the air literally sucks the moisture out of your skin. What I&#x27;m left with is chapped, cracked skin on my hands. I&#x27;ve used many lotions to counteract the environmental effects of my climate, but this one is BY FAR the best lotion I have ever used. The alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) in the lotion makes it so effective--AHA sloughs the outer (dead) layer of skin! My recommendation: stock up on this stuff and you&#x27;ll have hands that will look and feel amazing. P.S. This stuff makes your nails super strong!!!</li>
            <li> love love love - makes hands feel wonderful</li>
            <li> Have not used similar products of this kind. This product does not leave any residue on the hands. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I love it....smells great....rubs in real good....im really addicted too it....it does help with my cuticles....and the price is great</li>
            <li> I keep a tube of this next to the kitchen sink.  Right after dish-duty (and whenever washing hands) I apply a dab of this and rub into my cuticles and tops of hands.  It is a very smart product!  My hands - even in winter - are properly moisturized thanks to this product.  Not greasy or lingering...just right.  Check it out.</li>
