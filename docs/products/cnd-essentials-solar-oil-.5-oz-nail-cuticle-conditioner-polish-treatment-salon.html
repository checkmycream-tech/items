            <li>The best cuticle oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product!!  </li>
            <li>The best product ever was made by Vitamin Power, Collagen Protein Nail Treatment, but they have gone out of business</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>I have always wanted beautiful nails but had problems with them breaking.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant almond scent.  </li>
            <li>smalls nice, applies easily but did not notice a difference upon using it.</li>
            <li>Love it - will buy again</li>
            <li>I love this nail oil.  </li>
            <li>After finishing that bottle, I ordered three more.  </li>
            <li>love the smell of it and how it leaves the nails</li>
            <li>Vaseline works better.  </li>
            <li>This smells great and feels like it&#x27;s really going to work</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and not greasy</li>
            <li>In a week&#x27;s time I saw improvement, and now after about two months my natural nails are healthy, and they grow until I cut them or file.</li>
            <li>But also was told by other manicurists that Vaseline petroleum jelly is just as good as a condition/softener for cuticles and</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully when I first got it</li>
            <li>big bottle and has a really light beautifull smell so worth it would recomend this to everyone</li>
            <li>my nails do not seem so brittle and my cuticle looks much better and not so dry.  </li>
            <li>Should be clear, just tells me maybe it wasn&#x27;t as fresh as it should have been.</li>
            <li>oil does not seem to work very well for me as the opi did not work either</li>
            <li>If used regularly, it really does help nail growth/strength.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much improvement.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for my situation.</li>
            <li>Even though I had a weekly manicure and kept them very short, by the end of the week the polish was peeling off right along with my chipped nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this oil daily around each nail and it really helps to keep the cuticle and skin very soft and well cared for.</li>
            <li>Finally, something that makes my cuticles soft and conditioned.</li>

            <li> My manicurist has been using this stuff for years on my nails. I like the idea that the oil moisturize though shellac and regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING!! Helps moisturize my cuticles too!</li>
            <li> Usually buy this in a salon, probably will continue to do that. This one came and it seems to work like the others, but it was very yellow. Should be clear, just tells me maybe it wasn&#x27;t as fresh as it should have been.</li>
            <li> The best cuticle oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> my nails do not seem so brittle and my cuticle looks much better and not so dry.  Easy to apply and not greasy</li>
            <li> smalls nice, applies easily but did not notice a difference upon using it. oil does not seem to work very well for me as the opi did not work either</li>
            <li> I always keep solar oil in stock especially in the dry winter months.  My daughter and I use it on our nails every night.  It keeps them healthier; no more dry brittle nails.  It has a pleasant almond scent.  A great product.</li>
            <li> works great. Love it - will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this nail oil.  If used regularly, it really does help nail growth/strength.  I ran out of it a couple of months ago, and my nails deteriorated dramatically.  It will remain as one of my beauty must-haves.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, peeling cuticles. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to condition them, but nothing has worked. Until I tried this! Finally, something that makes my cuticles soft and conditioned. I apply it every night and rub it in. I have a small one for travel and this size for home. I highly recommend it for my situation.</li>
            <li> big bottle and has a really light beautifull smell so worth it would recomend this to everyone</li>
            <li> I use this oil daily around each nail and it really helps to keep the cuticle and skin very soft and well cared for.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!!  I have always wanted beautiful nails but had problems with them breaking. After I began using the product from a bottle given me by my daughter, my nails began to grow without peeling back and breaking.  I now have to keep filing them back to keep them from getting too long.  After finishing that bottle, I ordered three more.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> love the smell of it and how it leaves the nails.. thumbs up</li>
            <li> After years of having a nail gel process, when I decided to \\&quot;go natural\\&quot; my weakened nails peeled and broke. Even though I had a weekly manicure and kept them very short, by the end of the week the polish was peeling off right along with my chipped nails.&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me to try Solar Oil, and I brushed it on my cuticles and also rubbed it into my nails two to three times/day. In a week&#x27;s time I saw improvement, and now after about two months my natural nails are healthy, and they grow until I cut them or file. This product worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Recommended by manicurists.  But also was told by other manicurists that Vaseline petroleum jelly is just as good as a condition/softener for cuticles and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully when I first got it but I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement in my nails after a few weeks.  Maybe it takes longer, I stopped using it every night after that and just started up again so we&#x27;ll see I guess.  The best product ever was made by Vitamin Power, Collagen Protein Nail Treatment, but they have gone out of business and I&#x27;ve been searching for something similar ever since.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are extremely dry---I have tried everything from olive oil to canola oil....nuts, Huh? Solar oil is not too greasy like others I tried.</li>
            <li> Vaseline works better.  This smells great and feels like it&#x27;s really going to work but even applying 2-3x&#x27;s daily I don&#x27;t see much improvement.  Sorry.</li>
