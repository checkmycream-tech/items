            <li> The fragrance lasts for 5-7 hours,and i think 2 sprays are enough, so it will last a long while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave in a hot car tho it&#x27;ll evaporate as he came to find out the hard way</li>
            <li> It dose not last long</li>

            <li> Not real strong but last a long time.</li>
            <li> I got it faster than expected</li>
            <li> Certainly not Acqua Di Gio by any means, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> i gave a negative review because the smell only lasts a minute or two and this is the reply from the vendor</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing that was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t even used half the bottle yet.</li>
            <li> but the quality sucks.</li>
            <li> please can you remove the negative feedback, because I don&#x27;t do anything wrong,</li>
            <li> : I am sorry if you want to stay longer</li>
            <li> THIS IS EXPENSIVE COLOGNE THRU AVON, BUT COULD NOT BELIEVE THE SAVINGS ON AMAZON.  </li>

            <li> My boyfriend loves his gift. He had a sample of this iron man Cologne from a magazine and I found the bottle here on Amazon. Great product for men, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my husband. So pleased that Amazon carries it also. It smells so good on him.Every chance I get; I tell him how great he smells. Thanks so much! ! Melisa</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.  Not too strong, but a clean outdoors/athletic smell.</li>
            <li> it was perfect just what I wanted</li>

            <li> Certainly not Acqua Di Gio by any means, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I just keep it as a backup in my truck.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my boyfriend as a Christmas present he couldn&#x27;t get enough and neither could I best smelling cologne other than Burberry. Don&#x27;t leave in a hot car tho it&#x27;ll evaporate as he came to find out the hard way but over all was extremely satisfied going to be purchasing another one as a replacement for him ASAP</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item was just as described. Really nice cologne though, I&#x27;d buy it again sometime.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Item as a gift. the person who wanted it was very pleased and enjoyed the smell. The bottle has a nice shape.</li>
            <li> Women really, really, really, like to get close to you when you wear this...I had one woman look me straight in the eye and say&amp;#34; No, You don&#x27;t understand&amp;#34;.....My wife understood perfectly.....lol  This is a really good scent...Good day time / evening, don&#x27;t let the price fool you..I have Cartier I pass over for this....</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend. He loved it so much I ended up buying him two more bottles. We both love the smell.</li>
            <li> More like perfume than Cologne</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it. I can wear this scent whether at work or at play. I feel like this scent is a champion!</li>
            <li> Not a total throwaway. Smells of a pleasant manly fragrance, but with too much alcohol. I later gave it away and the tween recipient seemed to like it.</li>
            <li> I love when my husband where&#x27;s this cologne. Turns me on and smells Awsome!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this great sent accidentally while getting the emissions test done on my car. The tech who did the test, had this great Cologne and I had to ask him what it was. When he told me, I immediately went to Amazon when I got home. For the $12 plus shipping it can compete with most of the higher and colognes out there. More importantly, my wife smelled it and finds it really alluring. She loves hugging me and smelling my neck. I&#x27;ll add a shot or two to freshen up before bed and it generally enhances the whole experience on a sense level.</li>
            <li> It was as good as I expected</li>
            <li> Well this cologne does the trick. It got me laid, and I don&#x27;t think the massive quantities of alcohol consumed by my &amp;#34;partner&amp;#34; was a factor in it,</li>
            <li> Wow this is some good stuff for the price ladies love scent on me and it last for a reasonable time frame.for the price you wont be upset. You should give a try and it was shipped really quick</li>
            <li> Purchased this cologne for my teenage son. At 14 bucks, you can&#x27;t beat this product with a stick. It smells almost as good as his cologne that costs 80 dollars. Winner.</li>
            <li> ..and it still smells great, always get compliments!  I hardly ever wear cologne, obviously, but if I ever run out, it&#x27;s nice to know they still make it. :)</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! My boyfriend smells amazing when he wears it! It is pretty strong so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot at one time. It lasts all day. I bought it for him for Christmas a year ago and he wears it several times a week. Hasn&#x27;t even used half the bottle yet. You&#x27;ll definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> The cologne I&#x27;ve always loved and much cheaper than other places</li>
            <li> Good price,nice smell!</li>
