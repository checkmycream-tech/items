            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for spring and summer.  </li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy at all because in my eyes that made it seemed used.</li>
            <li>Im happy</li>
            <li>It makes a great toe and finger nail polish color.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it&#x27;s great for spring.</li>
            <li>Very popular color with clients for the summer.  </li>
            <li>You could look up color swatches on Google if you want! :P</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks beautiful for weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice color though.</li>
            <li>Pretty great for the cost.</li>
            <li>Love the color love the product.  </li>
            <li>Awesome color when actually on nails, received a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite gel colors.  </li>
            <li>Color is okay but doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly..</li>
            <li>The color is cute and the polish stays on until my nails grow out or until I decide to take it off.  </li>
            <li>My 3 sisters love this color and are all wearing it too.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful as well must have for summer since all of the stores that see gel polish near me are all sold out of the fun bright and neon summer colors finding this online</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;gel nail&amp;#34; stuff and figured I would try IBD out and so far it has been awesome, the brush is great and the color is fabulous.</li>
            <li>So happy with this purchase, the bottle is much larger than most of the gel polishes</li>
            <li>I used it a lot because I love the color teal right now!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and just as expected, thanks!l Great size bottle for price, glad to purchase here!!</li>
            <li>it clumped under light</li>
            <li>I also got this color in a regular polish and I was so happy when I found it in a gel polish.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice getting that much for your money.</li>
            <li>IBD Turtle Bay is a nice shimmery blue-leaning green color, but it does take many coats to build up.</li>
            <li>Wow I love this color.</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m a gelish brand fan, but loving the ibd brand too and since it&#x27;s half the price, well how can I resist!</li>
            <li>I also ordered a bright pink and highlighter yellow and am just as happy with those colors, I can also say the bottle is much bigger</li>
            <li>I usually buy shellac or opi, this brand is great</li>
            <li>Also the shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>The color is more greeny color than blue</li>
            <li>Pretty see through.</li>
            <li>Especially with a glitter coat on top.</li>
            <li>I really like this color!</li>
            <li>I might have wished there was a touch more blue in it, but this color is really pretty</li>
            <li>But if you want a LIGHT sparkly green should be fine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very runny</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a green turquoise.</li>
            <li>It is probably okay with less time than that</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Gel polish.</li>
            <li>I love IBD because the bottle is very big and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It normally starts peeling 24 hours after applying.  </li>
            <li>I generally use between 4 and 6.</li>
            <li>I really like the color though I have found that the polish does&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>Definitely more green than blue (but not fully green and not too dark or too light) with a subtle shimmer to it.</li>

            <li> This product is not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a winter or dark turquoise.  </li>
            <li> , so thick coats aren&#x27;t happening with this baby, and it&#x27;s quite sheer.</li>
            <li> The bottle must have been slightly openned since some of it came off on the paper.</li>
            <li> but i dont like having to re-do them if I mess up.</li>
            <li> I think I usually go with two coats, but three gives a very solid coverage without being too thick.  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t work, really streaky, polish is really runny, looks awful after drying.</li>
            <li> It has a slight shimmer and it goes on really nicely (not too thick or thin).  </li>
            <li> The polish is a little thin.</li>
            <li> You have to at least paint two coats.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crap</li>
            <li> this is crap</li>

            <li> IBD Turtle Bay is a nice shimmery blue-leaning green color, but it does take many coats to build up. I generally use between 4 and 6. YMMV of course, but it&#x27;s very runny, so thick coats aren&#x27;t happening with this baby, and it&#x27;s quite sheer.</li>
            <li> This polish is cheaper for a reason it&#x27;s crap it clumped under light ran all over I would never buy this again you get what u pay for spend the extra cause this is crap</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t work, really streaky, polish is really runny, looks awful after drying. This product is not worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> The color is more greeny color than blue but I like it! You could look up color swatches on Google if you want! :P that&#x27;s what I did</li>
            <li> Very popular color with clients for the summer.  This product met my standards and was delivered in a timely matter. I use these products for my home based business.</li>
            <li> So happy with this purchase, the bottle is much larger than most of the gel polishes this is going to last forever! The color is beautiful as well must have for summer since all of the stores that see gel polish near me are all sold out of the fun bright and neon summer colors finding this online was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a side note...I usually buy shellac or opi, this brand is great but i do cure it longer 3min. It is probably okay with less time than that but i dont like having to re-do them if I mess up.</li>
            <li> Love the color love the product.  Easy to use and looks beautiful for weeks.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Gel polish.</li>
            <li> I never got that far to try it due to the fact the way the person who sent package it, package it poorly. I received it in a piece of paper, instead of bubble wrap. The bottle must have been slightly openned since some of it came off on the paper. Wasn&#x27;t happy at all because in my eyes that made it seemed used.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and just as expected, thanks!l Great size bottle for price, glad to purchase here!! Awesome color when actually on nails, received a lot of compliments.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s like a winter or dark turquoise.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear it as a summer color.  Otherwise it works well if u like the color</li>
            <li> Great product!  This works just as well for me as the more expensive gel polishes.  I cannot tell any difference in wear when applied properly.</li>
            <li> The polish is a little thin. Pretty see through. You have to at least paint two coats. It&#x27;s a nice color though. Especially with a glitter coat on top.</li>
            <li> Color is okay but doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly.. Takes a lot of work. But if you want a LIGHT sparkly green should be fine.</li>
            <li> I really like the color though I have found that the polish does&#x27;t last long.  It normally starts peeling 24 hours after applying.  I have not had that problem with gelish and other gel brands.</li>
            <li> Wow I love this color. It was the color I was hoping for. I search and search for this color Im happy I order it. Also the shipping was super fast it took 2 days.</li>
            <li> The color is cute and the polish stays on until my nails grow out or until I decide to take it off.  However, I had to apply three coats to get the streaks to level out.</li>
            <li> I also got this color in a regular polish and I was so happy when I found it in a gel polish. It makes a great toe and finger nail polish color. I used it a lot because I love the color teal right now!</li>

My 3 sisters love this color and are all wearing it too. :) I&#x27;m a gelish brand fan, but loving the ibd brand too and since it&#x27;s half the price, well how can I resist! It wears just as well. I&#x27;ll try to figure out how to post some pictures!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the &amp;#34;gel nail&amp;#34; stuff and figured I would try IBD out and so far it has been awesome, the brush is great and the color is fabulous.
