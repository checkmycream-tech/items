            <li>Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>All in all, it is a good product when you are travelling or can&#x27;t wash your face for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>The price was good for a bulk item.  </li>
            <li>Also good for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>for the functioning of the product, it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good delivery time too.  </li>
            <li>I love these wipes!</li>
            <li>and I Love them!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t recommend using them to remove your make up.</li>
            <li>I really liked the camomile, triple tea and vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>Great to grab for a quick make-up removal</li>
            <li>I really love these wipes.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>They smell much better and feel much more soothing.  </li>
            <li>The wipes themselves are OK.</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin feels when I go bed.  </li>
            <li>They actually work, and most importantly, they work great!  </li>
            <li>but these wipes make it easy</li>
            <li>Huge fans of the Kirkland wipes.....gentle and easy to use but a fraction of the cost of name brand versions.  </li>
            <li>While they are good on my sensitive skin, they remove makeup including eye makeup quite easily.</li>
            <li>Thought this product would be an easy way to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>but these are more fresh and not as oily.</li>
            <li>It is soft, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin.</li>
            <li>Each form of closure was effective and having the smaller packages prooved handy.</li>
            <li>Now I can enjoy having it sent right to my home in the south, not worrying about how many miles I have to drive to get the product.</li>
            <li>Super easy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>They leave you feeling clean and cool.  </li>
            <li>I wear full coverage foundation and mascara</li>
            <li>This is an industrial cleanser, so toxic that people must wear full body protection just to handle it.  </li>
            <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bees ones leave my skin feeling sticky and sweet (and sometimes even make my skin sting).  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I use two or 3 towelettes to make sure its as clean as possible.     </li>
            <li>I do it right after I get home</li>
            <li>Kirkland has the right blend on this item - touch, smell, feel for your face.</li>
            <li>I liked that they did not leave my skin dry.  </li>
            <li>At first I liked how much dirt and makeup this product seemed to remove, BUT after 3 uses, a red, itchy, blotchy, rash broke out all over my face!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these before and like them very much.</li>
            <li>I was really happy with the turn out of my decision; there are four larger, 30-pack packages with plastic, reclosable lids and two smaller packages of 15 with large sticker closagers.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use a second wipe just to be sure I have gotten all the makeup off.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product!</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and keep going back to this.</li>
            <li>I use these on my feet all the time, because I live in flip-flops and sometime my feet need a quick freshening up before putting on socks.  </li>
            <li>I really like these cleansing towelettes, even better than the regular ones.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient, effective and easy to use; easily removes face and eye make-up without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Large cloths</li>
            <li>My skin was so puckered and wrinkly from the dryness that my face looked 20 years older, overnight!</li>
            <li>However, it really doesn&#x27;t remove all your make up or even oil and impurities from your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for the convenience.</li>
            <li>Premoistened towelettes ready to go!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Product works very well at removing any make-up, including mascara, &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; lipsticks, foundation, etc.</li>
            <li>The sheets are too small and having to use more didn&#x27;t make the transaction as economical as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>; i love that it came with 2 travel pack; i love the closure for the bigger pack; retained the moisture if closed properly.</li>
            <li>These are my new fave!</li>
            <li>I switched back to Kirkland Signature and it cleared right up.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect when traveling or when you are just plain too tired to wash your face and do the normal.</li>
            <li>I have had NO negative skin reaction and I feel good about leaving the green tea extract on my face due to the antioxident qualities.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin avoid this product.</li>
            <li>Do not purchase these if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>These cloths caused me to break out and caused my skin to peel and become so sensitive I could not stand it.  </li>
            <li>I am not an allergy prone person, nor do I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have no problems at all.</li>
            <li>First time I bought a package, I found a dry pack and thought it is just this one and its no biggie ...</li>
            <li>They are packaged in convenient small packages that are easy to take on the go.</li>
            <li>I did quite a bit of looking around amongst different brands of facial towelettes (pre-moistened and not) and decided on this one for economic reasons.</li>
            <li>I have almost sensitive skin, normal to dry.     </li>
            <li>After using these a couple of weeks with my other facial products that I&#x27;d been using for more than a year, one day my entire face turned into a giant, severely dry patch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any reaction to any topical products ever, so I do not consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I barely have make up on my face</li>
            <li>My skin was so taut that it woke me up the first night as I felt like something was tugging my mouth down.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tried the Kirland facial wipes and the Burt&#x27;s Bees ones, and I definitely prefer the Kirkland towlettes.  </li>

            <li> I used to despise taking off my make-up because it seemed like no matter how many times I washed my face and scrubbed, there was always a little makeup left behind.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The flap opening on the package came unglued and allowed the towels to start to dry out.</li>
            <li> Also, although it contains some very nice natural ingredients, it also contains one very nasty, outright toxic chemical:  propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that any form of alcohol can dry the skin.  </li>
            <li> Used them for about 3 months then started to notice that my skin was getting dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered them several times and both times they have arrived early  by at least a day os so.</li>
            <li> or whenever I have limited access to water.</li>
            <li> Costs much less than similar product in stores.</li>
            <li> There is a perfume scent that irritated my friend&#x27;s skin which is very dry and reactive.</li>
            <li> or when you don&#x27;t want to get your hair wet from washing your face in the sink.  </li>
            <li> One thing that made me stop buying these from Costco is I ended up returning two packages because there were basically DRY towelettes instead of moistened!!</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;It would be better if the manufacturer put them in a tupperware type container instead of a bag.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first since I have never found anything that actually works.  </li>
            <li> but all other packages that I bought had at least one pack with absolutely dry towelettes.</li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> It started on my chin and within one day a dry, hard, flaking crust had spread all the way up to my forehead.</li>
            <li> The package has 2 small travel packs with resealable flips and 4 bigger packs with hard plastic lids.</li>
            <li> They leave a residue feeling on the face, not a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I wear quite a bit of makeup and it leave little residue.</li>
            <li> Stopped using them and it went away within a few days.</li>
            <li> It was my tight skin shriveling!</li>
            <li> and it takes less than a minute, even with black eyeliner and tough mascara.  </li>
            <li> Also random patches of itchy, dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Hardly hypoalergenic!  </li>
            <li> It was terrible hot and itchy for over a week.</li>
            <li> you just have to tough it out.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what i did when the package failed.</li>
            <li> Because after cleaning my skin with them, if I use another towel, it gets dirty again.      </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in these cloths to do so much horrific damage to my skin, but I&#x27;m not touching another one!</li>
            <li> Even though the package says it hypo-allergenic I still reacted badly.</li>
            <li> I look terrible and the itch is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These cause redness, rash, and itching that lasts for days and nothing helps the horrible reaction...</li>

            <li> I used to despise taking off my make-up because it seemed like no matter how many times I washed my face and scrubbed, there was always a little makeup left behind.  I have just started using these wipes as a recommendation from my sister.  I was very skeptical at first since I have never found anything that actually works.  I was delighted when I tried these wipes!  They actually work, and most importantly, they work great!  I no longer dread taking my make-up off.  I do it right after I get home and it takes less than a minute, even with black eyeliner and tough mascara.  These wipes are wonderful!  I would recommend these affordable, convenient wipes to anyone who wears even the slightest bit of make-up.</li>
            <li> These cause redness, rash, and itching that lasts for days and nothing helps the horrible reaction... you just have to tough it out.  I&#x27;ve never had any reaction to any topical products ever, so I do not consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really love these wipes. I wear full coverage foundation and mascara and it gets it all. Doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes, doesn&#x27;t smell. They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> My review is based on buying 3 packages from Costco. About one package every two months.     The package has 2 small travel packs with resealable flips and 4 bigger packs with hard plastic lids. It is soft, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin. However, it really doesn&#x27;t remove all your make up or even oil and impurities from your skin. How do I know? Because after cleaning my skin with them, if I use another towel, it gets dirty again.      I use these towelettes when I am out of town, camping, outdoor activities or whenever I have limited access to water. I use two or 3 towelettes to make sure its as clean as possible.     Honestly, I don&#x27;t recommend using them to remove your make up. This can push the make up into your skin pores instead of removing it. I barely have make up on my face and I just use it for cleaning purposes; removing dust, oil, impurities, you know! I have almost sensitive skin, normal to dry.     One thing that made me stop buying these from Costco is I ended up returning two packages because there were basically DRY towelettes instead of moistened!! First time I bought a package, I found a dry pack and thought it is just this one and its no biggie ... but all other packages that I bought had at least one pack with absolutely dry towelettes. I returned two packages and am not sure how many packs were dry there, I just opened one of the small packs.     All in all, it is a good product when you are travelling or can&#x27;t wash your face for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> I used this to take off my makeup a couple weeks ago and within minutes I was getting and itchy feeling on my face and neck. By the next morning I had rashes all over. It was terrible hot and itchy for over a week. Even though the package says it hypo-allergenic I still reacted badly. If you have sensitive skin avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Great price.  Box contains travel size pack and bigger packs.  Great to grab for a quick make-up removal or when you don&#x27;t want to get your hair wet from washing your face in the sink.  I use these on my feet all the time, because I live in flip-flops and sometime my feet need a quick freshening up before putting on socks.  My husband even uses them once in a while.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase these if you have sensitive skin.  These cloths caused me to break out and caused my skin to peel and become so sensitive I could not stand it.  My local Costo stopped carrying the Oil of Olay cleansing cloths, so I decided to give these a try.  They are convienent, but they tore my face up!!</li>
            <li> Advertised as having no alcohol.  Not true.  Contents say it does have a form of alcohol.  I&#x27;ve read that any form of alcohol can dry the skin.  Also, although it contains some very nice natural ingredients, it also contains one very nasty, outright toxic chemical:  propylene glycol.  This is an industrial cleanser, so toxic that people must wear full body protection just to handle it.  Hardly hypoalergenic!  Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this product and wouldn&#x27;t have if Amazon displayed all the actual contents.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes! I&#x27;ve ordered them several times and both times they have arrived early  by at least a day os so. They get all the makeup and oil off your face and leave it feeling refreshed and cleansed.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried the Kirland facial wipes and the Burt&#x27;s Bees ones, and I definitely prefer the Kirkland towlettes.  They smell much better and feel much more soothing.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees ones leave my skin feeling sticky and sweet (and sometimes even make my skin sting).  It removes all my makeup and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before and like them very much.</li>
            <li> I wanted flushable wipes for personal use.  The price was good for a bulk item.  The sheets are too small and having to use more didn&#x27;t make the transaction as economical as I thought it would.  The wipes themselves are OK.</li>
            <li> Great deal; i love that it came with 2 travel pack; i love the closure for the bigger pack; retained the moisture if closed properly. all in all a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product - I recommend it!  Towelettes stay moist if you turn bag over every couple of days.  Also good for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I have used these towelettes for several years. While they are good on my sensitive skin, they remove makeup including eye makeup quite easily. I would never leave home without them! They are packaged in convenient small packages that are easy to take on the go. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try them.</li>
            <li> I bought these at Costco. I had no idea Costco sold their in-house brand items on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Large cloths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Plenty moist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. They leave a residue feeling on the face, not a clean feeling. Perhaps that is moisturizer, though. I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. They left makeup residue on my face, and it was actually tinted moisturizer, not makeup. My toning cotton pads I used to follow-up with always had a lot of the tinted cream on them after I&#x27;d supposedly cleaned it all off with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. After using these a couple of weeks with my other facial products that I&#x27;d been using for more than a year, one day my entire face turned into a giant, severely dry patch. It started on my chin and within one day a dry, hard, flaking crust had spread all the way up to my forehead. My skin was so puckered and wrinkly from the dryness that my face looked 20 years older, overnight! My skin was so taut that it woke me up the first night as I felt like something was tugging my mouth down. It was my tight skin shriveling! I don&#x27;t know what is in these cloths to do so much horrific damage to my skin, but I&#x27;m not touching another one!</li>
            <li> Very convenient, effective and easy to use; easily removes face and eye make-up without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This would have been a five if the product didn&#x27;t leave lint on my face.  I like the pre-moistend towelettes. I really liked the camomile, triple tea and vitamin E.  I liked that they did not leave my skin dry.  I did not like lint over my nose, eyes etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using these wipes for over two months now and I Love them!  I was always skipping washing my face before bed because it seemed like such a pain but these wipes make it easy and I love the way my skin feels when I go bed.  They leave you feeling clean and cool.  Sometimes I use a second wipe just to be sure I have gotten all the makeup off.  I have had NO negative skin reaction and I feel good about leaving the green tea extract on my face due to the antioxident qualities.  I will continue to buy them and share them with my friends.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for the convenience. Premoistened towelettes ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;One towel for face and eye make-up. Super easy. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The flap opening on the package came unglued and allowed the towels to start to dry out. :(&lt;br /&gt;It would be better if the manufacturer put them in a tupperware type container instead of a bag. That&#x27;s what i did when the package failed. There&#x27;s a mini-pack for travelling also.&lt;br /&gt;But I really like the product! Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of looking around amongst different brands of facial towelettes (pre-moistened and not) and decided on this one for economic reasons. I was really happy with the turn out of my decision; there are four larger, 30-pack packages with plastic, reclosable lids and two smaller packages of 15 with large sticker closagers. Each form of closure was effective and having the smaller packages prooved handy. They were portable and just enough for me to give a friend to try out the product.&lt;br /&gt;As for the functioning of the product, it does a good job. I wear quite a bit of makeup and it leave little residue. I have very oily skin and was satisfied with it. There is a perfume scent that irritated my friend&#x27;s skin which is very dry and reactive. She is looking into another brand suited for this (http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Sensitive-4-In-1-Facial-Cloths/dp/B004CQXZ5U/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355112388&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords&#x3D;non+scented+facial+wipes).</li>
            <li> I tried going to the generic brand of wipes and my face broke out.  I switched back to Kirkland Signature and it cleared right up.  Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Thought this product would be an easy way to clean my face.  At first I liked how much dirt and makeup this product seemed to remove, BUT after 3 uses, a red, itchy, blotchy, rash broke out all over my face!  It has been 3 days and the rash is still here.  I am not an allergy prone person, nor do I have sensitive skin.  I look terrible and the itch is uncomfortable. I will be returning this product</li>
            <li> I really like these cleansing towelettes, even better than the regular ones.  I like the included travel packs. .and this was a geat price!</li>
            <li> Huge fans of the Kirkland wipes.....gentle and easy to use but a fraction of the cost of name brand versions.  They are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Kirkland has the right blend on this item - touch, smell, feel for your face. I have tried many brands and keep going back to this. Now I can enjoy having it sent right to my home in the south, not worrying about how many miles I have to drive to get the product. Good delivery time too.  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> These are my new fave! I used to buy the Neutrogena but these are more fresh and not as oily. Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> These are perfect when traveling or when you are just plain too tired to wash your face and do the normal. They are convenient! I have sensitive skin and have no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Product works very well at removing any make-up, including mascara, &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; lipsticks, foundation, etc. Costs much less than similar product in stores.</li>
            <li> Used them for about 3 months then started to notice that my skin was getting dry and itchy. Woke up one morning and my neck had tons of itchy red bumps. Also random patches of itchy, dry skin on my face. Stopped using them and it went away within a few days. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for sensitive skin!</li>
