            <li>It goes on so easily, and I think it smells awesome.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skin guy who took a chance on this</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews for this are really good &amp; that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
            <li>You must apply at bedtime and then shower in the morning because it doesn&#x27;t smell good.  </li>
            <li>Works well on fair skin.</li>
            <li>Good product, good results.  </li>
            <li>So I am fair skinned and ordered this to add some color.</li>
            <li>Does a good job covering spider veins as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product, off and on, for about a year now and find it does a good job in tanning my legs</li>
            <li>It is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used for my light skin</li>
            <li>Some people comment that their color is good until they bathe and that it then washes off.</li>
            <li>I used this product 3 times in 2 weeks and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Got great results and liked the smell (they must have improved it . . .</li>
            <li>I am really fair skinned, it can be 60 degrees out</li>
            <li>I sent a bottle to each of my sister and a couple of friends, and they loved it, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells really good too.</li>
            <li>I loved the color it seemed to be turning my skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe my fair skin just wasn&#x27;t compatible with the formula.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for the face.</li>
            <li>The very first application, I was impressed.</li>
            <li>Also very cute bow earrings</li>
            <li>The color looked great, I recieved many compliments.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s one more person who won&#x27;t buy from the drugstore again!</li>
            <li>and i love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>so when you put it on it shows up, which is nice &amp; when I would wake up in the morning</li>
            <li>but you kind of get used to it...</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>I liked the results so almost bought the lotion at the salon for $45.00.  </li>
            <li>Two applications should give you a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice would reccomend to my mom and sister and daughters</li>
            <li>Great tanner especially for very fair skin.</li>
            <li>goes on great, washes off to leave really even and good colour tan.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Be warned is smells very strong though if you&#x27;re not a fan of self-tanner smell.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best of all of them!  </li>
            <li>By far the best out there!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best self tanner out there!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with this product and it creates a beautiful tan-but be warned, it will wash out the next time you shower.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply evenly, leaves a nice bronze color and even has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite self tanner for my very, very fair skin...make sure to exfoliate very well before applying, would recommend doing at night before bed...</li>
            <li>This is a great tanner i used this tanner for 3 days in a row and it got me pretty tan.</li>
            <li>thought it would be too good to be true when i found this product online after doing a lot of research.</li>
            <li>I go back and forth between this and Flawless.</li>
            <li>but it is perfect for that next day pool party.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, be sure to order gloves to apply this because it will stain</li>
            <li>I decided not to use the included gloves, because I feel like I have better control.</li>
            <li>esp in the summer when more skin is exposed.</li>
            <li>I love the smell (chocolaty), and I love the coloring.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>More to follow...</li>
            <li>; ups look better.</li>
            <li>The gloves that come with it are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions by applying it with the mitt rubbing it in all over.  </li>
            <li>Blends better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use this product 1-2 Times a week to have that healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Everyone has told me how healthy I look with my tan.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Made my pores on my legs where the hairs come out way darker and more visible for stubble.</li>
            <li>When I showered it would mostly come off.</li>
            <li>I will defiantly buy more of this stuff</li>
            <li>glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to wear the enclosed gloved when applying though.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also a lot nicer than you get with most tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use the gloves that are provided.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion-based tanning product.</li>
            <li>Discliamer-I&#x27;ve never been able to tan.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to SO many people after they comment on my tan.</li>
            <li>I was Just OK.</li>
            <li>I found some of the cheaper brands like Loreal and Nutrogena worked better for me.</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly...very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I did 5 more consecutive applications hoping to build the color, but I never built up ANY color.</li>
            <li>It might just be my skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold many sunless tanners well.</li>
            <li>but I have had better luck with Sun Labs tanners.</li>
            <li>And I need my tan :)</li>
            <li>Get this product is you wanna be tan fast!!!!</li>
            <li>Gives great results - realistic color, no streaking, no offensive odor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for tanning lotion and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Very light touch of color but extremely easy to put on and</li>
            <li>Works great only for fair skin, because it is too light.</li>
            <li>Smells good (per my husband) and adds a nice bit of color but still looks natural.</li>
            <li>I also bought a cheap red fitted sheet for my bed to use in the summer so it won&#x27;t discolor my best sheets.  </li>
            <li>lol I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this product and when it runs out, you can bet I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>This helped but also took awhile since I burn easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily (use the gloves).</li>
            <li>The product was easy to use, the instructions easy to follow.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to see resulting in a streak-free tan.</li>
            <li>No streaks, or orange color and with gloves, it is easy to put on.</li>
            <li>At first this lotion smelled kind of like chocolate.</li>
            <li>I never wanted to be super tan because that would not be fitting for the way I look.</li>
            <li>so make sure you rub it in evenly quickly</li>
            <li>I did get the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; because I am so light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sunless tanning products over the last 20 years and this has been the best so far.</li>
            <li>When I got up this morning I instanly inspected my trouble spots and they look awesome.</li>
            <li>I am light olive skinned.  </li>
            <li>No streaks and fabulous</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink like your cheap drug store self tanners but it does smell.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re fair and freckled, nothing is going to look &amp;#34; natural &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Even a tanning junkie loved my natural tone.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and I didn&#x27;t find this to be orange and streaky like some other self tanners I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very dark but goes on good</li>
            <li>they would have made fun of me if they noticed!  </li>
            <li>Remember to be successful with it, exfoliate after several days and then re-apply.</li>
            <li>The chocolatey smell is more pleasant than other products and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful to my niece who recommended it when I commented on how nice her tan looked when she was on her way to an early summer wedding!</li>
            <li>When applied per directions, it creates a very natural color and helped me look nice for a special occasion.  </li>
            <li>Just right!</li>
            <li>I have really fair skin and the only spray tan that seems to work well for me</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make you instantly bronzed and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>first tanning product i&#x27;ve ever tried was Jergons Natural Glow for fair to medium skin.</li>
            <li>The color was nice, but I have extremely fair skin, so all the streaking was very noticeable, even though I exfoliated and was very careful applying it.</li>
            <li>this is not the product for you if you are looking to be as dark as the cast of Jersey Shore, this is going to give you some decent color at best...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also no orange &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; like I have experienced with other self tanners.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for all fair-skinned people wanting a natural looking tan for the warm weather months!</li>
            <li>But, this blended in quickly.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t rub it in quickly you may have some darker streak stains until you bathe.</li>
            <li>The color is the most realistic and isn&#x27;t orangey on me.</li>
            <li>but after reapplying it&#x27;s standards slipped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I am VERY fair, and this actually looked natural, it did not go &amp;#34;orange or yellow&amp;#34;, i used lightly and it lasted for days, wore off pretty well too, not too splotchy.</li>
            <li>After about 3 days I have a very nice glow and use the lotion about every other day to keep it.</li>
            <li>However it actually looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Cakes up and dries so fast, you can tell it will streak!!</li>
            <li>Once I run out I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have super light white skin.</li>
            <li>I am VERY fair - (&amp;#34;pasty white&amp;#34;) - and usually sunless tanners turn me orange.</li>
            <li>I have naturally pale/fair skin, and like many, have gone through A LOT of self-tanner products.</li>
            <li>Lovely natural tan color.</li>
            <li>It may be worth the smell.</li>
            <li>This left a nice, tanned hue.</li>
            <li>This looks more natural, I will keep using.</li>
            <li>None have ever given as good results as fake bake fair.</li>
            <li>It makes the perfect amount of coverage for my light skin without looking fake.  </li>
            <li>It gives the most natural looking tint to your skin with no streaking or blotching.  </li>
            <li>However, I feel like the color is more natural and buildable for people with fair skin with Fake Bake Fair.</li>
            <li>It works great for my naturally pale skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love Fake Bake Fair!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty quick and painless.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is not to wonderful either and is very hard to get rid of the first couple days of wearing.</li>
            <li>I made sure to exfoliate before each use and made sure to put a very minimal amount on the areas that have high/quick absorption.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and it doesn&#x27;t streak if you apply it right.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look like a true tan after everything is said and done but its really as close as your gon</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and gives a natural look.  </li>
            <li>This is the only gradual tan lotion I have ever found that gives a relatively natural color AND smells good.  </li>
            <li>It was very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Fake bake is a awesome self tanner line.</li>
            <li>I love them both for different reasons, but I have and will recommend this to others!</li>
            <li>PURCHASE FAKE BAKE (fair)!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Not orangy and pretty darn even.  </li>
            <li>I woke up with a nice tan color with absolutely NO orange and no streaks.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse the gloves off as well in order to reuse at later date.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go!  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I was expecting, after reading about it.</li>
            <li>Even so, I have no complaints about the color, it gives a fair/pale skin a pretty glow.</li>
            <li>Anyway I followed directions like shivering first and applying at night.</li>
            <li>First time I didn&#x27;t and had orange palms for a day or so.</li>
            <li>I know it says on the instructions to test it first . . .</li>
            <li>I really like the color and smell (chocolate!)</li>
            <li>even my first use was 100% streakless</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wash your hands well, especially between your fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally really pale, and it gave me a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>I use the fair because I am quite pale.</li>
            <li>The only reason I feel I&#x27;ll stick with Flawless is because the self tanner smell in Fake Bake Fair is a little strong in comparison.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells really nice - not like other self tanners that when you wear them, people around you know you&#x27;re wearing self tanner.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really expect to much with a rub on tan but figured it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>You better believe that I will keep a supply of this stuff for a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks like most people have no problem with it, but apparently I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Comes out a very natural tan color, and is completely streak free.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to start off with the original formula fearing it would be too dark for my skin, so I went with the recommended Light version.</li>
            <li>No streaking and smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural looking fake tan lotionI&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t notice much of a tan at all in the whole week I was using it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s to much work for me</li>
            <li>I appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell as much as the Jergen&#x27;s sunless tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>it works really well</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give too much tan at once.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rub it in evenly and carefully and you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li>I expected a better quality</li>
            <li>My legs  don&#x27;t tan very well</li>
            <li>I have been picked on my whole life about it.</li>
            <li>When it starts to build up too much, I just take some apricot body scrub and scrub it off and start the application process all over.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to spend that much</li>
            <li>This would be time consuming to use for the whole body</li>
            <li>The product I received in the past was a dark chocolate brown and worked GREAT!!  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery &amp; so far so good as I&#x27;m pretty pale &amp; am trying to build color!</li>
            <li>Fake Bake Fair is a miracle tanning lotion!  </li>
            <li>If you are super pale and are looking for a lovely sun kissed natural glow.</li>
            <li>I like the fair even though I am not fair</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and even though it is meant for fair skin, it gives a deep, rich color.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake and love it even more.  </li>
            <li>Yummy smell (chocolate pudding?), not sticky, no orange or yellow undertone, dries quickly, does not stain clothes, no stinky smell of tanning, but not moisturizes the skin like another tan lotion.</li>
            <li>The only reason for 4 stars is that the color seems to fade quickly.</li>
            <li>but that wasn&#x27;t my experience with this particular one).</li>
            <li>I was a big fan of the fake bake flawless spray...</li>
            <li>You can build the color up over several applications but the very first use will take the \\&quot;sting\\&quot; out of your blinding paleness.</li>
            <li>Color is very natural and not orange!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also seems to work a little better.</li>
            <li>Afterwards I just enjoyed using it every now and then to give my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; a little pick me up when it started to fade.</li>
            <li>Thru the winter I put a little on my shoulders, chest and arms and love the results, but summer I use all over.  </li>
            <li>Best fake tanning system, however, please be aware you need to use within a certain time or the product turns emerald green.  </li>
            <li>lotion gave me a real, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I really like the natural color that I get from this lotion.</li>
            <li>Fake bake is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this a fun product because it looks and smells like chocolate...</li>
            <li>I have tried several self tanning products without success.</li>
            <li>If you put this gob on your skin and hesitate a second too long to rub it in you will have an unnattractive blotch you won&#x27;t be able to blend out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too much a fan of the scent - in the bottle it kind of smells like chocolate, but once putting it on and letting it dry, it smells like a typical tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>this formula is lighter &amp; looks more natural but it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and am unable to tan, only burn!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just now getting to the point of needing to order a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be trying new products or I am going to have to suffer with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Hurrah - this is a worthwhile little indulgence!</li>
            <li>the Color is very natural.</li>
            <li>This product looks very natural when I use on my legs, but it makes the rest of my body look orange.  </li>
            <li>The color is a very natural bronze-brown, rather than orange.  </li>
            <li>Very natural and brown.</li>
            <li>It completely blended as if it just melted in my skin!</li>
            <li>It looks so natural!</li>
            <li>Surprised!</li>
            <li>looks so incredibly natural once applied!</li>
            <li>But I won&#x27;t use any other type of tanner after using this one, because the color is so true and somehow doesn&#x27;t ever seem to have edges or streaks</li>
            <li>actually tried to combine the lotion and spray to see if it would settle in the skin better and all I got was a mess that rubbed off if you even rubbed the area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smoothly and has a little color so you don&#x27;t get streaks when it dries.</li>
            <li>Probably only 3 full-body uses in this little container, but IMO, it looks better than a Versa spa that costs $12-20 for one use.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is a VERY dark chocolate color, but once you smooth it on and it absorbs, it disappears.</li>
            <li>The color is amazingly natural looking.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a summer glow without laying out in the sun.</li>
            <li>my two year old said it smelled like chocolate.....</li>
            <li>However, this product needs to be put on once every two days (at least), or you can layer it more than once a day for a darker look.</li>
            <li>Natural looking color.</li>
            <li>No streaks, looks natural.</li>
            <li>One of the few products that don&#x27;t turn me orange and goes on smooth without streaks.  </li>
            <li>Natural looking and got lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for an almost natural and what I saw was unnatural and lacking in color.</li>
            <li>It did not seem to me to leave much of a color, even after several applications.</li>
            <li>I am so white and have always been very self conscience about it.</li>
            <li>Old bottle sent to me?</li>
            <li>It gives you that natural tan look without the time and expense of a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>It looks so natural.</li>
            <li>This gives you a natural looking tan &amp; as the bottle states it is gradual</li>
            <li>::very sun-kissed:: it left a couple areas splotchy.</li>
            <li>I have used spray Fake Bake for 2 years and I have loved it.</li>
            <li>so I purchased the Fake Bake for fair skin lotion.</li>
            <li>Just that little bit of tan (not orange) color after the first use and not too overt where people really notice you use tanner.  </li>
            <li>After a few applications my tan began building with that same yellowish tone instead of the golden look it first gave me.</li>
            <li>It went on DARK (it washes off, it&#x27;s only the color guide which is a HUGE help).</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to anyone especially with price being high</li>
            <li>The color lasts really well, I used the same bottle constantly throughout the summer</li>
            <li>It stained my hands and nails black, which I was able to get off after a day and a half of scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I gave up on the gloves and use my bare hands.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to recieve a product that would give me as natural a tan look as possible.</li>
            <li>I put this on last night after my shower, then tonight when I went to get my shower, it completely washed out.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m ever NOT blinding it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m: a) RED - burned to a crisp, or b) PINK.</li>
            <li>It gives me instant tan and feel back to normal everytime</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair, and I can start off with a base of 3 day application, then just use it every 3-4 days to maintain the color.</li>
            <li>Not a single comment or what the *</li>
            <li>I am naturally ghost white, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Fake Bake gives me a lovely, even tan that lasts and looks natural.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll look a little funny, but you&#x27;re just going to sleep so</li>
            <li>Instructions: When you put it on at first, it will be very dark (wear the gloves).  </li>
            <li>If you want a golden color, this is the way to go.. if you want to have a fresh from the beach tan color, you should probably use the regular fake bake.</li>
            <li>I have dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, and a fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am EXTREMELY pale and cannot tan even if I tried (which I don&#x27;t; avid SPF user).</li>
            <li>i used the standard lotion but often got lousy results due to my fair skin.</li>
            <li>However, the inner bends of my arms, my wrists and also certain parts of my ankles (All the tricky parts, basically) were DARK and obvious.</li>
            <li>I am very pale and this Fake Bake fair looks very natural on my complexion.</li>
            <li>but the original seems a little too dark.  </li>
            <li>It took SO long to see color and it turned out to be orangey and blotchy in certain places (even though i was very careful).</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of use the only thing that really tanned on me was my legs slightly.</li>
            <li>It will keep your hands from getting too much tanning lotion and looking like they have had several applications while the rest of you only looks slightly darker.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s smells really good too.</li>
            <li> I loved the color it seemed to be turning my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe my fair skin just wasn&#x27;t compatible with the formula.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good for the face.</li>
            <li> The very first application, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Also very cute bow earrings</li>

            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s one more person who won&#x27;t buy from the drugstore again!</li>
            <li> and i love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> so when you put it on it shows up, which is nice &amp; when I would wake up in the morning</li>
            <li> but you kind of get used to it...</li>
            <li> Nice color.</li>
            <li> I liked the results so almost bought the lotion at the salon for $45.00.  </li>
            <li> Two applications should give you a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice would reccomend to my mom and sister and daughters</li>
            <li> Great tanner especially for very fair skin.</li>
            <li> goes on great, washes off to leave really even and good colour tan.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Be warned is smells very strong though if you&#x27;re not a fan of self-tanner smell.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best of all of them!  </li>
            <li> By far the best out there!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner out there!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product and it creates a beautiful tan-but be warned, it will wash out the next time you shower.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply evenly, leaves a nice bronze color and even has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner for my very, very fair skin...make sure to exfoliate very well before applying, would recommend doing at night before bed...</li>
            <li> This is a great tanner i used this tanner for 3 days in a row and it got me pretty tan.</li>
            <li> thought it would be too good to be true when i found this product online after doing a lot of research.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between this and Flawless.</li>
            <li> but it is perfect for that next day pool party.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, be sure to order gloves to apply this because it will stain</li>
            <li> I decided not to use the included gloves, because I feel like I have better control.</li>
            <li> esp in the summer when more skin is exposed.</li>
            <li> I love the smell (chocolaty), and I love the coloring.</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> More to follow...</li>
            <li> ; ups look better.</li>
            <li> The gloves that come with it are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions by applying it with the mitt rubbing it in all over.  </li>
            <li> Blends better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product 1-2 Times a week to have that healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Everyone has told me how healthy I look with my tan.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Made my pores on my legs where the hairs come out way darker and more visible for stubble.</li>
            <li> When I showered it would mostly come off.</li>
            <li> I will defiantly buy more of this stuff</li>
            <li> glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to wear the enclosed gloved when applying though.  </li>
            <li> The smell is also a lot nicer than you get with most tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use the gloves that are provided.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion-based tanning product.</li>
            <li> Discliamer-I&#x27;ve never been able to tan.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to SO many people after they comment on my tan.</li>
            <li> I was Just OK.</li>
            <li> I found some of the cheaper brands like Loreal and Nutrogena worked better for me.</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly...very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I did 5 more consecutive applications hoping to build the color, but I never built up ANY color.</li>
            <li> It might just be my skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold many sunless tanners well.</li>
            <li> but I have had better luck with Sun Labs tanners.</li>
            <li> And I need my tan :)</li>
            <li> Get this product is you wanna be tan fast!!!!</li>
            <li> Gives great results - realistic color, no streaking, no offensive odor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for tanning lotion and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Very light touch of color but extremely easy to put on and</li>
            <li> Works great only for fair skin, because it is too light.</li>
            <li> Smells good (per my husband) and adds a nice bit of color but still looks natural.</li>
            <li> I also bought a cheap red fitted sheet for my bed to use in the summer so it won&#x27;t discolor my best sheets.  </li>
            <li> lol I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this product and when it runs out, you can bet I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> This helped but also took awhile since I burn easily.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily (use the gloves).</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use, the instructions easy to follow.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to see resulting in a streak-free tan.</li>
            <li> No streaks, or orange color and with gloves, it is easy to put on.</li>
            <li> At first this lotion smelled kind of like chocolate.</li>
            <li> I never wanted to be super tan because that would not be fitting for the way I look.</li>
            <li> so make sure you rub it in evenly quickly</li>
            <li> I did get the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; because I am so light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunless tanning products over the last 20 years and this has been the best so far.</li>
            <li> When I got up this morning I instanly inspected my trouble spots and they look awesome.</li>
            <li> I am light olive skinned.  </li>
            <li> No streaks and fabulous</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink like your cheap drug store self tanners but it does smell.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re fair and freckled, nothing is going to look &amp;#34; natural &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Even a tanning junkie loved my natural tone.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and I didn&#x27;t find this to be orange and streaky like some other self tanners I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very dark but goes on good</li>
            <li> they would have made fun of me if they noticed!  </li>
            <li> Remember to be successful with it, exfoliate after several days and then re-apply.</li>
            <li> The chocolatey smell is more pleasant than other products and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful to my niece who recommended it when I commented on how nice her tan looked when she was on her way to an early summer wedding!</li>
            <li> When applied per directions, it creates a very natural color and helped me look nice for a special occasion.  </li>
            <li> Just right!</li>
            <li> I have really fair skin and the only spray tan that seems to work well for me</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make you instantly bronzed and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> first tanning product i&#x27;ve ever tried was Jergons Natural Glow for fair to medium skin.</li>
            <li> The color was nice, but I have extremely fair skin, so all the streaking was very noticeable, even though I exfoliated and was very careful applying it.</li>
            <li> this is not the product for you if you are looking to be as dark as the cast of Jersey Shore, this is going to give you some decent color at best...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also no orange &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; like I have experienced with other self tanners.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for all fair-skinned people wanting a natural looking tan for the warm weather months!</li>
            <li> But, this blended in quickly.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t rub it in quickly you may have some darker streak stains until you bathe.</li>
            <li> The color is the most realistic and isn&#x27;t orangey on me.</li>
            <li> but after reapplying it&#x27;s standards slipped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I am VERY fair, and this actually looked natural, it did not go &amp;#34;orange or yellow&amp;#34;, i used lightly and it lasted for days, wore off pretty well too, not too splotchy.</li>
            <li> After about 3 days I have a very nice glow and use the lotion about every other day to keep it.</li>
            <li> However it actually looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Cakes up and dries so fast, you can tell it will streak!!</li>
            <li> Once I run out I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have super light white skin.</li>
            <li> I am VERY fair - (&amp;#34;pasty white&amp;#34;) - and usually sunless tanners turn me orange.</li>
            <li> I have naturally pale/fair skin, and like many, have gone through A LOT of self-tanner products.</li>
            <li> Lovely natural tan color.</li>
            <li> It may be worth the smell.</li>
            <li> This left a nice, tanned hue.</li>
            <li> This looks more natural, I will keep using.</li>
            <li> None have ever given as good results as fake bake fair.</li>
            <li> It makes the perfect amount of coverage for my light skin without looking fake.  </li>
            <li> It gives the most natural looking tint to your skin with no streaking or blotching.  </li>
            <li> However, I feel like the color is more natural and buildable for people with fair skin with Fake Bake Fair.</li>
            <li> It works great for my naturally pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake Fair!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty quick and painless.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion is not to wonderful either and is very hard to get rid of the first couple days of wearing.</li>
            <li> I made sure to exfoliate before each use and made sure to put a very minimal amount on the areas that have high/quick absorption.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and it doesn&#x27;t streak if you apply it right.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look like a true tan after everything is said and done but its really as close as your gon</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and gives a natural look.  </li>
            <li> This is the only gradual tan lotion I have ever found that gives a relatively natural color AND smells good.  </li>
            <li> It was very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is a awesome self tanner line.</li>
            <li> I love them both for different reasons, but I have and will recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> PURCHASE FAKE BAKE (fair)!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not orangy and pretty darn even.  </li>
            <li> I woke up with a nice tan color with absolutely NO orange and no streaks.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rinse the gloves off as well in order to reuse at later date.</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go!  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was expecting, after reading about it.</li>
            <li> Even so, I have no complaints about the color, it gives a fair/pale skin a pretty glow.</li>
            <li> Anyway I followed directions like shivering first and applying at night.</li>
            <li> First time I didn&#x27;t and had orange palms for a day or so.</li>
            <li> I know it says on the instructions to test it first . . .</li>
            <li> I really like the color and smell (chocolate!)</li>
            <li> even my first use was 100% streakless</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wash your hands well, especially between your fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally really pale, and it gave me a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> I use the fair because I am quite pale.</li>
            <li> The only reason I feel I&#x27;ll stick with Flawless is because the self tanner smell in Fake Bake Fair is a little strong in comparison.</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells really nice - not like other self tanners that when you wear them, people around you know you&#x27;re wearing self tanner.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really expect to much with a rub on tan but figured it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> You better believe that I will keep a supply of this stuff for a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks like most people have no problem with it, but apparently I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Comes out a very natural tan color, and is completely streak free.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to start off with the original formula fearing it would be too dark for my skin, so I went with the recommended Light version.</li>
            <li> No streaking and smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural looking fake tan lotionI&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t notice much of a tan at all in the whole week I was using it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s to much work for me</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell as much as the Jergen&#x27;s sunless tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> it works really well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give too much tan at once.</li>
            <li> Make sure you rub it in evenly and carefully and you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> I expected a better quality</li>
            <li> My legs  don&#x27;t tan very well</li>
            <li> I have been picked on my whole life about it.</li>
            <li> When it starts to build up too much, I just take some apricot body scrub and scrub it off and start the application process all over.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend that much</li>
            <li> This would be time consuming to use for the whole body</li>
            <li> The product I received in the past was a dark chocolate brown and worked GREAT!!  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery &amp; so far so good as I&#x27;m pretty pale &amp; am trying to build color!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Fair is a miracle tanning lotion!  </li>
            <li> If you are super pale and are looking for a lovely sun kissed natural glow.</li>
            <li> I like the fair even though I am not fair</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and even though it is meant for fair skin, it gives a deep, rich color.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake and love it even more.  </li>
            <li> Yummy smell (chocolate pudding?), not sticky, no orange or yellow undertone, dries quickly, does not stain clothes, no stinky smell of tanning, but not moisturizes the skin like another tan lotion.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 stars is that the color seems to fade quickly.</li>
            <li> but that wasn&#x27;t my experience with this particular one).</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of the fake bake flawless spray...</li>
            <li> You can build the color up over several applications but the very first use will take the \\&quot;sting\\&quot; out of your blinding paleness.</li>
            <li> Color is very natural and not orange!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also seems to work a little better.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I just enjoyed using it every now and then to give my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; a little pick me up when it started to fade.</li>
            <li> Thru the winter I put a little on my shoulders, chest and arms and love the results, but summer I use all over.  </li>
            <li> Best fake tanning system, however, please be aware you need to use within a certain time or the product turns emerald green.  </li>
            <li> lotion gave me a real, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I really like the natural color that I get from this lotion.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this a fun product because it looks and smells like chocolate...</li>
            <li> I have tried several self tanning products without success.</li>
            <li> If you put this gob on your skin and hesitate a second too long to rub it in you will have an unnattractive blotch you won&#x27;t be able to blend out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too much a fan of the scent - in the bottle it kind of smells like chocolate, but once putting it on and letting it dry, it smells like a typical tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> this formula is lighter &amp; looks more natural but it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and am unable to tan, only burn!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just now getting to the point of needing to order a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be trying new products or I am going to have to suffer with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Hurrah - this is a worthwhile little indulgence!</li>
            <li> the Color is very natural.</li>
            <li> This product looks very natural when I use on my legs, but it makes the rest of my body look orange.  </li>
            <li> The color is a very natural bronze-brown, rather than orange.  </li>
            <li> Very natural and brown.</li>
            <li> It completely blended as if it just melted in my skin!</li>
            <li> It looks so natural!</li>
            <li> Surprised!</li>
            <li> looks so incredibly natural once applied!</li>
            <li> But I won&#x27;t use any other type of tanner after using this one, because the color is so true and somehow doesn&#x27;t ever seem to have edges or streaks</li>
            <li> actually tried to combine the lotion and spray to see if it would settle in the skin better and all I got was a mess that rubbed off if you even rubbed the area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and has a little color so you don&#x27;t get streaks when it dries.</li>
            <li> Probably only 3 full-body uses in this little container, but IMO, it looks better than a Versa spa that costs $12-20 for one use.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is a VERY dark chocolate color, but once you smooth it on and it absorbs, it disappears.</li>
            <li> The color is amazingly natural looking.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a summer glow without laying out in the sun.</li>
            <li> my two year old said it smelled like chocolate.....</li>
            <li> However, this product needs to be put on once every two days (at least), or you can layer it more than once a day for a darker look.</li>
            <li> Natural looking color.</li>
            <li> No streaks, looks natural.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that don&#x27;t turn me orange and goes on smooth without streaks.  </li>
            <li> Natural looking and got lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for an almost natural and what I saw was unnatural and lacking in color.</li>
            <li> It did not seem to me to leave much of a color, even after several applications.</li>
            <li> I am so white and have always been very self conscience about it.</li>
            <li> Old bottle sent to me?</li>
            <li> It gives you that natural tan look without the time and expense of a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> It looks so natural.</li>
            <li> This gives you a natural looking tan &amp; as the bottle states it is gradual</li>
            <li> ::very sun-kissed:: it left a couple areas splotchy.</li>
            <li> I have used spray Fake Bake for 2 years and I have loved it.</li>
            <li> so I purchased the Fake Bake for fair skin lotion.</li>
            <li> Just that little bit of tan (not orange) color after the first use and not too overt where people really notice you use tanner.  </li>
            <li> After a few applications my tan began building with that same yellowish tone instead of the golden look it first gave me.</li>
            <li> It went on DARK (it washes off, it&#x27;s only the color guide which is a HUGE help).</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone especially with price being high</li>
            <li> The color lasts really well, I used the same bottle constantly throughout the summer</li>
            <li> It stained my hands and nails black, which I was able to get off after a day and a half of scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I gave up on the gloves and use my bare hands.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to recieve a product that would give me as natural a tan look as possible.</li>
            <li> I put this on last night after my shower, then tonight when I went to get my shower, it completely washed out.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m ever NOT blinding it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m: a) RED - burned to a crisp, or b) PINK.</li>
            <li> It gives me instant tan and feel back to normal everytime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair, and I can start off with a base of 3 day application, then just use it every 3-4 days to maintain the color.</li>
            <li> Not a single comment or what the *</li>
            <li> I am naturally ghost white, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake gives me a lovely, even tan that lasts and looks natural.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll look a little funny, but you&#x27;re just going to sleep so</li>
            <li> Instructions: When you put it on at first, it will be very dark (wear the gloves).  </li>
            <li> If you want a golden color, this is the way to go.. if you want to have a fresh from the beach tan color, you should probably use the regular fake bake.</li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, and a fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY pale and cannot tan even if I tried (which I don&#x27;t; avid SPF user).</li>
            <li> i used the standard lotion but often got lousy results due to my fair skin.</li>
            <li> However, the inner bends of my arms, my wrists and also certain parts of my ankles (All the tricky parts, basically) were DARK and obvious.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this Fake Bake fair looks very natural on my complexion.</li>
            <li> but the original seems a little too dark.  </li>
            <li> It took SO long to see color and it turned out to be orangey and blotchy in certain places (even though i was very careful).</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of use the only thing that really tanned on me was my legs slightly.</li>
            <li> It will keep your hands from getting too much tanning lotion and looking like they have had several applications while the rest of you only looks slightly darker.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle were bigger for the price, but a little really does go a very long way.</li>
            <li> It also has a really sweet smell &amp; it&#x27;s kind of sickening!</li>
            <li> I  wear long pants in the summer because my legs are so white.</li>
            <li> This stuff absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any dewiness, or moisturizing feel, just like a matte feel.</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake and will try other products by this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a tad self conscious about it because you can see every little bruise, scar, cut, etc.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this to someone who has had problems with self tanners in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was using a tanning mousse that had chemicals that were harsh on my sensitive skin and caused rashes.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The lotion does not have a strong smell initially, but once it absorbs into your skin and the DHA takes action, it smells just like any other bad tanning lotion smell.</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars because like I said gives a nice soft tan that you can build but was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that the instructions tell u to use all their other products just to use this properly</li>
            <li> Also I do not recommend this product for anyone who does not have a couple hours to spare because the process of applying this product is very long and drawn out.</li>
            <li> The only drawn back about the spray is it is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Product does give a nice color tan to my see-thru pale skin but STINKS.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the color just wasn&#x27;t dark enough for me</li>
            <li> No streaking, very little if any odor, does not rub off on sheets at night or white pants the next day.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it since, but with winter coming and my legs less likely to be seen, I may try it again and edit this review.</li>
            <li> Only had half a bottle</li>
            <li> I ended up with a ton of streaks, and was disappointed in the orange hue that came out of this considering the Fake Bake Flawless Tanning Liquid.</li>
            <li> A week and a half later I am still itching like</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have any dry skin spots or pimples it will probably make them darker.</li>
            <li> in all, I feel like continuing to use this product will give me a super fake, &amp;#34;Snooki&amp;#34; type appearance.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake original for years and loved it, but very being fair-skinned, found it a little messy and a shocking difference when applied.  </li>
            <li> red little \\&quot;goosebumps\\&quot; all over my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I do like to have a little color in the summer and am always on the hunt for a sunless tanning product that won&#x27;t turn me Snooki-orange or jaundiced yellow.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really careful around my elbows, ankles and knees.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no orange.</li>
            <li> My tips for this tanning lotion is to exfoliate before putting it on because it definitely will hold on to dead skin and make it look crappy.</li>
            <li> This tanner is not very forgiving to water</li>
            <li> I have a really pink undertone to my skin</li>
            <li> And yes, this does seem disappointing at first, but the tan gets darker after several applications.</li>
            <li> then tried other products from Nivea and Dove.</li>
            <li> The girl who quit using it due to the odor didn&#x27;t know how to apply or she would have stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> Must apply every other day and wear gloves.</li>
            <li> This is due to the organicity of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> the orange look I&#x27;ve had from other tanners.</li>
            <li> I wanted to seem as if I didn&#x27;t appear allergic to the sun (as my friends call it due to</li>
            <li> smell isn&#x27;t like other tanning lotions; this one smells like vanilla frosting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> on the other products.</li>
            <li> Also, if ONE drop of water splashes on a part of your body the same night you apply it, you will have a random white spot in that area after your shower the next morning.</li>
            <li> color!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to someone who is pale and needs a tan before summer!</li>
            <li> That is majorly disappointing especially with how nice the results came out to be and due to the price of this, it would probably be a little too expensive for my budget to have to buy this 6 oz bottle every two weeks or so to maintain my tan, as 6 oz is not a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It rubs on fine but smells bad.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it lasts yet,</li>
            <li> This lotion was definitely not worth the money, time, or hassle, and I will not be using or buying it again.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s dark brown</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying an applicator glove (5 bucks or so) because it will stain your hands dark brown</li>
            <li> The lotion is dark brown</li>
            <li> so you control how dark you get.</li>
            <li> It goes on dark</li>
            <li> but there is no way you could know that it would cause problems 3 weeks down the road.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs quickly and you&#x27;re not left with a sticky residue, which I hate.</li>
            <li> Then I took a shower and watched my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; wash completely down the drain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a few other people to try this product.  </li>
            <li> The resulting color when I woke up in the morning was no darker than what I have gotten previously from a gradual tanning lotion, like Jergen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves a mess on my sheets in the morning, but it comes out in the wash.</li>
            <li> It manages to give a fairly dark and even tanned appearance without making the pale person, e.g. me, look like I got beaten all over with carrots for a week.</li>
            <li> I add a little lotion to it</li>
            <li> My skin is like Casper and now im dark!</li>
            <li> The lotion is very very dark when you put it on so don&#x27;t get scared.</li>
            <li> Wind burn, crying, being in the sun for 4.7 seconds...etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use the gloves that come with the product or your palms will be tanned for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This went on well around my trouble spots feet, hands, elbows.</li>
            <li> I know alot of people who swear by Fake Bake and I have seen their results on them which looked natural.</li>
            <li> I am naturally so pale.</li>
            <li> People comment on how pale I am all the time....</li>
            <li> Pale skin + sunless tanning &#x3D; Oompa Loompa.</li>
            <li> I am pale.</li>
            <li> Just need to be careful not to apply behind ankles or knees, the area will get too dark.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is so very pale, I always stayed away from self-tanners, fearing a streaky orange mess.</li>
            <li> The 2 bottles of fake bake were green in color and left a green appearance.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say it really smells bad.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re lazy like me</li>
            <li> I used it at instructed and since I shower at night, it usually has about 24 hours to set in before I shower again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used alot of tanners over the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> But the odor is a SMALL price to pay to get a tan like this.  </li>
            <li> Again, small price to pay.  </li>
            <li> I can apply a small amount each evening, while I want to keep my legs tan and it builds up gradually.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply the lotion at night and when I wake up, I have a sun-kissed glow.</li>
            <li> Can I mix it with plain lotion to get a slow building tan?</li>
            <li> I am very pale and thought this would give me some sort of color.</li>
            <li> I am very pale &amp; this does not turn me orange at all.</li>
            <li> I am very VERY pale and this, nor the spray did me any justice.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, kind of angry</li>
            <li> Little dramatic?</li>
            <li> actually that I even wasted money on this crap.</li>
            <li> The idea of skin cancer was not a pleasant thought either.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and tanning has always been difficult for me.</li>
            <li> crazy - hydrocortisone does little to relieve it.</li>
            <li> I have always been addicted to tanning at my tanning salon.</li>

            <li> (NOT ATTRACTIVE)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, but it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Fake Bake even encloses a plastic glove to apply the product with so the palms of your hands don&#x27;t \\&quot;tan.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but sadly I did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fake Bake for years and never had it turn an orange color.</li>
            <li> Fake bake never does that it doesn&#x27;t look fake at all.</li>
            <li> and I dont look fake, orange, or like a freak.</li>
            <li> I got a spray tan and they used Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> You have to re-apply Fake Bake about once a week</li>
            <li> The product does not look orange or fake.</li>
            <li> Will definetly purchase fake bake again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Fake Bake self tanner two times this summer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely...I will continue to buy Fake and Bake and stop wasting my&lt;br /&gt;$$</li>

            <li> There is a small blotch on my foot (my bad!)</li>
            <li> This stuff smelled like chocolate (I&#x27;ve heard Fake Bake usually smells awful</li>
            <li> It does continue to darken a little as you re-apply, but never do you see those horrible streaks and orange</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t turn you orange and it won&#x27;t leave you looking artificially tan.</li>
            <li> Not to me, it stinks.</li>
            <li> With tanning beds being so dangerous I opted for a safer alternative.</li>
            <li> Fake Bake met all my expectations!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even commented on how bad it smelled</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t look all that bad...</li>

            <li> No lines and the smell is not too bad.</li>
            <li> bottle lasts me about a month, which isn&#x27;t a bad investment at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always been addicted to tanning at my tanning salon. I have really fair skin and the only spray tan that seems to work well for me is the Mystic HD booth using &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. Everything else makes me look orange. I got this product and was amazed at how simple it was to use. The color is amazingly natural looking. I tried the at home self spray tans and it did not go on as even as this lotion. It completely blended as if it just melted in my skin!</li>
            <li> I am very pale and thought this would give me some sort of color. I put it on faithfully for a week because it&#x27;s a gradual tan. you&#x27;re suppose to put it on until you reach the level of tan you desire. Then after that it says to use once a week to keep that level of tan. But I didn&#x27;t notice much of a tan at all in the whole week I was using it. And it&#x27;s to much work for me lol. I Just want to be tan over night bc I do not feel like applying it every day. Fake bake is a awesome self tanner line. But if you&#x27;re lazy like me I suggest getting an overnight product they have. It was very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Used this product to get tan skin for my wedding.  I am Very Fair and it worked Great!!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t smell as much as the Jergen&#x27;s sunless tanning lotion. It also seems to work a little better. I used it at instructed and since I shower at night, it usually has about 24 hours to set in before I shower again. I do notice some color wash off, but I think that is just the color guide as my tan is still there. After about 3 days I have a very nice glow and use the lotion about every other day to keep it. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a summer glow without laying out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, but it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores.  Gives great results - realistic color, no streaking, no offensive odor.</li>
            <li> i used the standard lotion but often got lousy results due to my fair skin. a base tan helps.but this formula is lighter &amp; looks more natural but it doesn&#x27;t last as long. still beats sitting in the sun 4 hours a day just to look flesh tone.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use. It gives the appearance of a week at the beach.no orange tint... the Color is very natural.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product to make you look tan without the sun damage, this is one I would recommend. It won&#x27;t turn you orange and it won&#x27;t leave you looking artificially tan. Fake Bake even encloses a plastic glove to apply the product with so the palms of your hands don&#x27;t \\&quot;tan.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between this and Flawless. I have very fair skin, and I didn&#x27;t find this to be orange and streaky like some other self tanners I have used. The only reason I feel I&#x27;ll stick with Flawless is because the self tanner smell in Fake Bake Fair is a little strong in comparison. The difference between the spray and the lotion applications was negligible. However, I feel like the color is more natural and buildable for people with fair skin with Fake Bake Fair. I love them both for different reasons, but I have and will recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> Because my skin is so very pale, I always stayed away from self-tanners, fearing a streaky orange mess. This product is easy to apply evenly, leaves a nice bronze color and even has a nice smell. A little goes a long way and even though it is meant for fair skin, it gives a deep, rich color. You can build the color up over several applications but the very first use will take the \\&quot;sting\\&quot; out of your blinding paleness. lol I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this product and when it runs out, you can bet I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skin guy who took a chance on this and I was impressed! Just that little bit of tan (not orange) color after the first use and not too overt where people really notice you use tanner.  Take your time during application and follow the directions and it will work (comes w/ gloves). Not sure how long it lasts yet, but it is perfect for that next day pool party. Probably only 3 full-body uses in this little container, but IMO, it looks better than a Versa spa that costs $12-20 for one use. Will probably be buying again soon.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, be sure to order gloves to apply this because it will stain but I never notice streaks, orange coloration of spots!</li>
            <li> I have naturally pale/fair skin, and like many, have gone through A LOT of self-tanner products. Given the rave reviews of this product, I though that I would give it a try. I wish I would have saved my money!!! After properly exfoliating in the shower, I went to apply the lotion starting from my legs up. I decided not to use the included gloves, because I feel like I have better control. The lotion itself is a VERY dark chocolate color, but once you smooth it on and it absorbs, it disappears. This stuff absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any dewiness, or moisturizing feel, just like a matte feel. The lotion does not have a strong smell initially, but once it absorbs into your skin and the DHA takes action, it smells just like any other bad tanning lotion smell. It stained my hands and nails black, which I was able to get off after a day and a half of scrubbing. The resulting color when I woke up in the morning was no darker than what I have gotten previously from a gradual tanning lotion, like Jergen&#x27;s. There also was some spotting/staining/blotchiness/unevenness that I could see. This lotion was definitely not worth the money, time, or hassle, and I will not be using or buying it again.</li>
            <li> I am naturally so pale. I&#x27;ve always been a tad self conscious about it because you can see every little bruise, scar, cut, etc. I  wear long pants in the summer because my legs are so white. its practically blinding! People comment on how pale I am all the time....esp in the summer when more skin is exposed. I never wanted to be super tan because that would not be fitting for the way I look. I have Blonde hair and Blue eyes so lighter skin fits me but not paper white!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tanning product i&#x27;ve ever tried was Jergons Natural Glow for fair to medium skin. It took SO long to see color and it turned out to be orangey and blotchy in certain places (even though i was very careful). I gave in and started going to tanning beds. This helped but also took awhile since I burn easily. I only stayed in a tanning bed for 3-5 minutes at a time. The idea of skin cancer was not a pleasant thought either.  I stopped that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried other products from Nivea and Dove. Both of which, turned me orangey and streaking looking. So, I started doing some research and came across reviews for this product! I nervously purchased it. In my mind, it was going to make me orange and blotchy but I figured I&#x27;d try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT arrived within 2 days. The product comes with gloves for application. When I started putting it on, I got a tad scared because the product was a deep milk chocolate looking brown (it also smells like chocolate to me) But, this blended in quickly. Within minutes I noticed the color developing. I applied at night and when I woke up the next morning...I HAD THE SUN KISSED GLOW I&#x27;VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF! There is a small blotch on my foot (my bad!) But It does not look orange. There is not a streak on my body. It looks so natural! You better believe that I will keep a supply of this stuff for a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO sum it up...If you are super pale and are looking for a lovely sun kissed natural glow. PURCHASE FAKE BAKE (fair)!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. However, if you&#x27;re fair and freckled, nothing is going to look &amp;#34; natural &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> no streaks, perfect color.  put it on at night and somethimes in the morning.  i would highly recommend this to someone who has had problems with self tanners in the past.  great smell too!  my two year old said it smelled like chocolate.....and it does!</li>
            <li> I will buy this in a bigger size if they can. I love the smell (chocolaty), and I love the coloring. It works great for my naturally pale skin tone. I cannot give it enough praise. Be prepared that the glove they ship with it last only about two uses. However, this product needs to be put on once every two days (at least), or you can layer it more than once a day for a darker look. I gave up on the gloves and use my bare hands. With the amount of hand washing I do in a day, it comes off after four time of washing.</li>
            <li> Love love love it works really well but you do have to be carful applying bc it starts staining your skin with the tan as soon as you put it on so make sure you rub it in evenly quickly</li>
            <li> Great tanner especially for very fair skin. Doesn&#x27;t give too much tan at once. Lovely natural tan color. No orange!</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews for this are really good &amp; that&#x27;s why I bought it. I do have to say that it didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s a brown color so when you put it on it shows up, which is nice &amp; when I would wake up in the morning it seemed like the color got darker. But once I got in the shower all the color rinsed away! It also has a really sweet smell &amp; it&#x27;s kind of sickening! The gloves they send don&#x27;t work well either. It all went through &amp; you can&#x27;t reuse them!</li>
            <li> Surprised! I am VERY fair, and this actually looked natural, it did not go &amp;#34;orange or yellow&amp;#34;, i used lightly and it lasted for days, wore off pretty well too, not too splotchy. Even a tanning junkie loved my natural tone. Will definitely use this spring/summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(it will stain the sheets, but if you have darker sheets, not noticeable at all.)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery &amp; so far so good as I&#x27;m pretty pale &amp; am trying to build color!</li>
            <li> Smells good (per my husband) and adds a nice bit of color but still looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using Fake Bake original for years and loved it, but very being fair-skinned, found it a little messy and a shocking difference when applied.  I just discovered the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; Fake Bake and love it even more.  It doesn&#x27;t need all the rubbing to blend with my skin, it smells a lot nicer and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my bedding so noticeably.</li>
            <li> Product does give a nice color tan to my see-thru pale skin but STINKS. Thought the smell would fade but didn&#x27;t. My boyfriend even commented on how bad it smelled so I stopped using it as often as I&#x27;d like. Gave it 3 stars because like I said gives a nice soft tan that you can build but was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used alot of tanners over the past 15 years.  I don&#x27;t lay in the sun and want to be tanned.  This is by far the best of all of them!  The girl who quit using it due to the odor didn&#x27;t know how to apply or she would have stuck with it.  You must apply at bedtime and then shower in the morning because it doesn&#x27;t smell good.  You can&#x27;t apply it and then start your day.  But the odor is a SMALL price to pay to get a tan like this.  Never orange.  Never streaks.  It&#x27;s the best.  I also bought a cheap red fitted sheet for my bed to use in the summer so it won&#x27;t discolor my best sheets.  Again, small price to pay.  By far the best out there!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really expect to much with a rub on tan but figured it was worth the try. However it actually looked pretty good.  Not orangy and pretty darn even.  I was actually impressed. I wore shorts around trying to see if any of the family would make comments.  Trust me they would have made fun of me if they noticed!  Not a single comment or what the ***** happened to your legs?</li>
            <li> This. Stuff. Is. Awesome. Little dramatic? Yes. Overly awesome? YES! I am WHITE...like, blinding.  Always. If I&#x27;m ever NOT blinding it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m: a) RED - burned to a crisp, or b) PINK. Wind burn, crying, being in the sun for 4.7 seconds...etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion gave me a real, natural looking tan. There is NOTHING orange about this. It goes on so easily, and I think it smells awesome. My husband HATES the smell - what does he know? It smells like coconuts to me. I initially bought it for our trip to Maui so I wouldn&#x27;t embarass us on the beaches. Afterwards I just enjoyed using it every now and then to give my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; a little pick me up when it started to fade. The color lasts really well, I used the same bottle constantly throughout the summer and I&#x27;m just now getting to the point of needing to order a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor fellow pasty-people: order this. You&#x27;ll be happy. The eyes of others around you will be happy. Win-win.</li>
            <li> Natural looking color. Goes on evenly. Smells like chocolate. Must apply every other day and wear gloves.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!!!!  Does not look orange....I have olive skin and the FAIR was great for me.  Remember to be successful with it, exfoliate after several days and then re-apply.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of use the only thing that really tanned on me was my legs slightly. I have very pale skin and tanning has always been difficult for me. I hoped with this product I could get the look I wanted but sadly I did not. The smell of the lotion is not to wonderful either and is very hard to get rid of the first couple days of wearing. Also I do not recommend this product for anyone who does not have a couple hours to spare because the process of applying this product is very long and drawn out. I think next time I will just go with a spray lotion.</li>
            <li> I am very fair and this product is great for me! No streaks, no orange look.  Just right!</li>
            <li> I discovered this a couple of years ago at a local cosmetic shop.  Best price at Amazon.  Love it!  No streaks, looks natural.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Only product that doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange.  Exfoliation is a must though!</li>
            <li> I have used spray Fake Bake for 2 years and I have loved it. Highly recommend to everyone. The only drawn back about the spray is it is a bit messy. So I thought I would try the lotion to see if it was any different. I am very fair so I purchased the Fake Bake for fair skin lotion. I just received it today and I have to say it really smells bad. One reviewer said it smelled like chocolate. Not to me, it stinks. I do not know why they could not make it smell like the spray which is coconut tropical. Oh well, live and learn. I am going to see how it looks in the morning. It may be worth the smell. More to follow...</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says, it goes on flawless, it even comes off flawless, allows you to do touch ups, and make your  !@&amp;#62;&amp;#34;:&amp;#62; ups look better. This a guarantee tan. I buy this every month!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my white legs while I was in Las Vegas for a bachelorette party. LET ME TELL YOU - this product made me look like I actually get sun! I use the gloves every time and I&#x27;m really careful around my elbows, ankles and knees. I&#x27;ve NEVER had a problem with streaks or unevenness because I PAY ATTENTION when I put it on. That&#x27;s a big one - PAY ATTENTION when you put it on. Make sure you rub it in evenly and carefully and you won&#x27;t have a problem. Plus, it smells really nice - not like other self tanners that when you wear them, people around you know you&#x27;re wearing self tanner.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been so excited to post a review in my life!!!!  I&#x27;ve tried sunless tanners on and off for years and I have never found one that wasn&#x27;t orange until NOW!!!  I did get the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; because I am so light but it worked like a dream.  I woke up with a nice tan color with absolutely NO orange and no streaks. The gloves that come with it are fantastic!</li>
            <li> One of the few products that don&#x27;t turn me orange and goes on smooth without streaks.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tanning lotion I have ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t look orange and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Best self-tanning lotion for fair skin! Added the warmth I was looking for without turning me orange.</li>
            <li> Best self-tanner ever! Yummy smell (chocolate pudding?), not sticky, no orange or yellow undertone, dries quickly, does not stain clothes, no stinky smell of tanning, but not moisturizes the skin like another tan lotion. Works great only for fair skin, because it is too light. I love Fake Bake and will try other products by this brand.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!  No streaking, very little if any odor, does not rub off on sheets at night or white pants the next day.  Natural looking and got lots of compliments.  People could not believe it came out of the bottle.  Make sure you follow the directions by applying it with the mitt rubbing it in all over.  I bought another bottle to use this winter.</li>
            <li> Works well on fair skin. Blends better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  Can put on in morning with skirt for some color.</li>
            <li> Best fake tanning system, however, please be aware you need to use within a certain time or the product turns emerald green.  This is due to the organicity of the ingredients. I have been using for years and never had any issues.  Instructions: When you put it on at first, it will be very dark (wear the gloves).  You sleep in it (some may rub off on clothes or sheets, but this will wash out).  Make sure to rinse the gloves off as well in order to reuse at later date. Wash off in shower in the morning and you are ready to go!  No streaking and smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am naturally ghost white, especially in the winter. I use this product 1-2 Times a week to have that healthy glow. The chocolatey smell is more pleasant than other products and I like that it&#x27;s dark brown so I can see where it&#x27;s going. I would recommend buying an applicator glove (5 bucks or so) because it will stain your hands dark brown and if you don&#x27;t rub it in quickly you may have some darker streak stains until you bathe. If you want a golden color, this is the way to go.. if you want to have a fresh from the beach tan color, you should probably use the regular fake bake. I&#x27;ve been using Fake Bake for years and never had it turn an orange color. Also I&#x27;ve this product at some beauty stores for 30+ dollars so it&#x27;s a great deal here.</li>
            <li> I am VERY fair - (&amp;#34;pasty white&amp;#34;) - and usually sunless tanners turn me orange. This left a nice, tanned hue. I like the gloves it came with, I reuse them each time. I wish the bottle were bigger for the price, but a little really does go a very long way. I bought this for my December trip to Mexico, and my mom said &amp;#34;your legs already look tan!&amp;#34; - SCORE! I&#x27;ll buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and every product I have tried before gave me an orange look. Fake bake never does that it doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. Everyone has told me how healthy I look with my tan. I have turned my fair skinned friends and family into tropical tan beauties!!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was expecting, after reading about it. It&#x27;s a great product. Color is very natural and not orange!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self tanner for my very, very fair skin...make sure to exfoliate very well before applying, would recommend doing at night before bed...I add a little lotion to it so it absorbs well...it does have a funky odor to it but you kind of get used to it...it doesn&#x27;t look like a true tan after everything is said and done but its really as close as your gonna get getting a tan/color from a bottle...this is not the product for you if you are looking to be as dark as the cast of Jersey Shore, this is going to give you some decent color at best...not looking like you took a Bahamian vacation...</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping. No streaks, and perfect glow. I&#x27;m naturally really pale, and it gave me a gorgeous color. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s one more person who won&#x27;t buy from the drugstore again! Not only is this a fun product because it looks and smells like chocolate...but it truly works. It manages to give a fairly dark and even tanned appearance without making the pale person, e.g. me, look like I got beaten all over with carrots for a week. Hurrah - this is a worthwhile little indulgence!</li>
            <li> The color was nice, but I have extremely fair skin, so all the streaking was very noticeable, even though I exfoliated and was very careful applying it. I haven&#x27;t tried it since, but with winter coming and my legs less likely to be seen, I may try it again and edit this review.</li>
            <li> Pale skin + sunless tanning &#x3D; Oompa Loompa. I&#x27;ve tried many sunless tanning products over the last 20 years and this has been the best so far. The color is the most realistic and isn&#x27;t orangey on me. Use the gloves that come with the product or your palms will be tanned for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Goes on easily (use the gloves). Nice color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 days in a row, and can immediately tell a difference. Comes out a very natural tan color, and is completely streak free. I&#x27;m not too much a fan of the scent - in the bottle it kind of smells like chocolate, but once putting it on and letting it dry, it smells like a typical tanning lotion. Even so, I have no complaints about the color, it gives a fair/pale skin a pretty glow. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This gives me color that looks like I have a tan, not the orange look I&#x27;ve had from other tanners. This looks more natural, I will keep using.</li>
            <li> Only had half a bottle</li>
            <li> I really like the natural color that I get from this lotion.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this Fake Bake fair looks very natural on my complexion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> The 2 bottles of fake bake were green in color and left a green appearance.  The product I received in the past was a dark chocolate brown and worked GREAT!!  I&#x27;d like  to try another order.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to recieve a product that would give me as natural a tan look as possible. The day I put it on it didn&#x27;t look all that bad...but after reapplying it&#x27;s standards slipped tremendously. I was hoping for an almost natural and what I saw was unnatural and lacking in color. I would not recommend this to anyone especially with price being high I expected a better quality</li>
            <li> This product looks very natural when I use on my legs, but it makes the rest of my body look orange.  My legs  don&#x27;t tan very well so it does the job for what I need.</li>
            <li> Didnt work. Made my pores on my legs where the hairs come out way darker and more visible for stubble. Blah. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good product, good results.  I thought it came with the application glove that is supposed to make the difference but the glove it came with was just a plastic one to protect the hand.  When applied per directions, it creates a very natural color and helped me look nice for a special occasion.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Worked great!!  Did not turn my skin orange or streak!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> So I am fair skinned and ordered this to add some color. I didn&#x27;t realize that the instructions tell u to use all their other products just to use this properly so I didn&#x27;t have their lotion or scrub. Anyway I followed directions like shivering first and applying at night. It did not seem to me to leave much of a color, even after several applications. When I showered it would mostly come off. I don&#x27;t know if the color just wasn&#x27;t dark enough for me but if I order again I will get a darker shade I guess.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this stuff! I am so white and have always been very self conscience about it. I have been picked on my whole life about it. I have tried a bunch of self tanners and also been sprayed at a salon and have tried versa spa. None have ever given as good results as fake bake fair. I tried it last night before bed. This went on well around my trouble spots feet, hands, elbows. When I got up this morning I instanly inspected my trouble spots and they look awesome. I finally have a tan and I dont look fake, orange, or like a freak. I will defiantly buy more of this stuff so I am never without!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and am unable to tan, only burn!  This is the best natural looking fake tan lotionI&#x27;ve ever used.  It makes the perfect amount of coverage for my light skin without looking fake.  It is not orange at all.  Does a good job covering spider veins as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a lot of hype.  I turned orange on my arms, and it caked up on my legs.  Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product, off and on, for about a year now and find it does a good job in tanning my legs (the only area I use it on).  It is a perfect color for me.  I am light olive skinned.  I can apply a small amount each evening, while I want to keep my legs tan and it builds up gradually.  Just need to be careful not to apply behind ankles or knees, the area will get too dark.  When it starts to build up too much, I just take some apricot body scrub and scrub it off and start the application process all over.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use before I left out on my trip to the Dominican Republic so that I didn&#x27;t seem to be Edward Cullen&#x27;s sister in a place where everyone loves the sun! I wanted to seem as if I didn&#x27;t appear allergic to the sun (as my friends call it due to actually I have been dealing with melanoma) so I am so white, I refuse to wear white t-shirts. This product has given me that sun kissed look that I have been wanting.</li>
            <li> I was using a tanning mousse that had chemicals that were harsh on my sensitive skin and caused rashes. Fake Bake gives me a lovely, even tan that lasts and looks natural. No orange; no rashes.</li>
            <li> This did NOT turn out well. I ended up with a ton of streaks, and was disappointed in the orange hue that came out of this considering the Fake Bake Flawless Tanning Liquid. I know now to stick with the mitt and the spray. This lotion was a bust.</li>
            <li> I got a spray tan and they used Fake Bake.  I liked the results so almost bought the lotion at the salon for $45.00.  Didn&#x27;t want to spend that much so thought I would check on Amazon...glad I did.  It was $15.00!  Easy to apply and gives a natural look.  Make sure to wear the enclosed gloved when applying though.  First time I didn&#x27;t and had orange palms for a day or so.</li>
            <li> This THE best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! No streaks and fabulous color!&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t like other tanning lotions; this one smells like vanilla frosting.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Fake Bake Fair is a miracle tanning lotion!  It gives the most natural looking tint to your skin with no streaking or blotching.  The color is a very natural bronze-brown, rather than orange.  The smell is also a lot nicer than you get with most tanning lotions.  You have to re-apply Fake Bake about once a week but it&#x27;s pretty quick and painless.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for tanning lotion and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered my second bottle!  I&#x27;ve got a few other people to try this product.  It is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used for my light skin</li>
            <li> OMG! Everyone this stuff is absolutely amazing!!!!!! Im so tan and not Orange at ALL!!! Im a red head and have NEVER been tan and i love it! My skin is like Casper and now im dark! Get this product is you wanna be tan fast!!!!</li>
            <li> I am pale. I have dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, and a fair skin tone. I do not tan. I burn. With tanning beds being so dangerous I opted for a safer alternative. At first this lotion smelled kind of like chocolate. It doesn&#x27;t stink like your cheap drug store self tanners but it does smell. I don&#x27;t think that it is a bad smell. I can&#x27;t describe what it is but it isn&#x27;t DHA. This is a GRADUAL self tanner. It won&#x27;t make you instantly bronzed and gorgeous. Two applications should give you a nice glow. Make sure to use the gloves that are provided. Cheeto fingers are not attractive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very dark but goes on good</li>
            <li> Fake Bake met all my expectations! Great product!! No lines and the smell is not too bad. It was very easy to apply and dried quickly.  I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion-based tanning product. Be warned is smells very strong though if you&#x27;re not a fan of self-tanner smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanner i used this tanner for 3 days in a row and it got me pretty tan. The smell is great, it smells just like chocolates.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and find that this works well for me. Some people comment that their color is good until they bathe and that it then washes off. One has to remember that you have a color guide from the product and then it develops a tan in several hours. What you are washing off is the color guide. And yes, this does seem disappointing at first, but the tan gets darker after several applications.</li>
            <li> The product does not look orange or fake.Goes on nice would reccomend to my mom and sister and daughters Also very cute bow earrings they stand out with my short hair.</li>
            <li> Great sunless tanner! East application, doesn&#x27;t smell, and no orange color!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend to someone who is pale and needs a tan before summer!</li>
            <li> I used this product 3 times in 2 weeks and LOVED it. Having had a squamous cell carcinoma (skin cancer) 2 years ago I don&#x27;t dare go in the sun. Got great results and liked the smell (they must have improved it . . . smelled like cookies). But then, about 4 days after my third application I got red little \\&quot;goosebumps\\&quot; all over my legs and arms. A week and a half later I am still itching like crazy - hydrocortisone does little to relieve it. Antihistamines don&#x27;t seem to work either. I know it says on the instructions to test it first . . . but there is no way you could know that it would cause problems 3 weeks down the road. It looks like most people have no problem with it, but apparently I have sensitive skin. So just a heads up.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to use, the instructions easy to follow. Will definetly purchase fake bake again. The color looked great, I recieved many compliments.</li>
            <li> Discliamer-I&#x27;ve never been able to tan. I am really fair skinned, it can be 60 degrees out and if i am in the sun, I will burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would be too good to be true when i found this product online after doing a lot of research. I&#x27;ve tried Jergens but that just left me orange and streaky. I&#x27;ve tried countless others with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works wonders. I&#x27;ve never had a tan before, and this gives me enough of a sun kissed glow that I don&#x27;t look pasty but I don&#x27;t look like a cast member of jersey shore, it&#x27;s perfect. There&#x27;s no streaking, it looks tan and not orange, and I am so happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The except part?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washes out. I put this on last night after my shower, then tonight when I went to get my shower, it completely washed out. That is majorly disappointing especially with how nice the results came out to be and due to the price of this, it would probably be a little too expensive for my budget to have to buy this 6 oz bottle every two weeks or so to maintain my tan, as 6 oz is not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product and it creates a beautiful tan-but be warned, it will wash out the next time you shower.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to self tanner, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. It smells great (like chocolate),and there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;developing&amp;#34; scent. There&#x27;s also no orange &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; like I have experienced with other self tanners. It also absorbs quickly and you&#x27;re not left with a sticky residue, which I hate. I&#x27;m pretty fair, and I can start off with a base of 3 day application, then just use it every 3-4 days to maintain the color. A 6 oz. bottle lasts me about a month, which isn&#x27;t a bad investment at all. I highly recommend this for all fair-skinned people wanting a natural looking tan for the warm weather months!</li>
            <li> Cakes up and dries so fast, you can tell it will streak!! Can I mix it with plain lotion to get a slow building tan?</li>
            <li> I ended up orange anc not happy.&lt;br /&gt;I used frack bake in the past but never had the issues I did this time very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t looking for a build a tan kind of product when I bought this, but if that is what you want then go for it!</li>
            <li> Left streaks and clumped up on my skin. Old bottle sent to me?</li>
            <li> I really like the color and smell (chocolate!) of this brand. Absolutely no orange. The only reason for 4 stars is that the color seems to fade quickly. But I won&#x27;t use any other type of tanner after using this one, because the color is so true and somehow doesn&#x27;t ever seem to have edges or streaks - I do use a mitt though. I have recommended this to SO many people after they comment on my tan. I bought this on the recommendations here and have to say it lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> This is the best of these type of lotions that I have found. No need to look further, for ME! I sent a bottle to each of my sister and a couple of friends, and they loved it, too. I&#x27;m grateful to my niece who recommended it when I commented on how nice her tan looked when she was on her way to an early summer wedding!</li>
            <li> This is the only gradual tan lotion I have ever found that gives a relatively natural color AND smells good.  I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> Fake bake is a great product.  It gives you that natural tan look without the time and expense of a tanning bed.  It&#x27;s super easy to apply.  I&#x27;m so happy my sister told me about this product!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smoothly and has a little color so you don&#x27;t get streaks when it dries. I like the fair even though I am not fair but the original seems a little too dark.  It lasts for a day or two after application but it you use it for a couple days in a row you get a deeper tan.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have used. I used a foam applicator mitt and gloves to apply it....worked well!  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is awesome for fair skin. It&#x27;s such a natural.bronze people will think that you have been just laying out in the sun all day. It&#x27;s smells really good too. The lotion is very very dark when you put it on so don&#x27;t get scared. My tips for this tanning lotion is to exfoliate before putting it on because it definitely will hold on to dead skin and make it look crappy. I also like to moisturize my skin with just regular lotion before putting it on because it lets the tan go on smoother.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a more expensive brand. I was Just OK. It rubs on fine but smells bad. Even after I exfoliated prior to application, it didn&#x27;t stay on but two days tops. I found some of the cheaper brands like Loreal and Nutrogena worked better for me.</li>
            <li> This product is really great. It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and it doesn&#x27;t streak if you apply it right. Once I run out I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Works great.  No streaking</li>
            <li> I have purchased Fake Bake self tanner two times this summer. This is by far the best self tanner out there! No streaking, or smell. I use the fair because I am quite pale. It looks so natural. I won&#x27;t be without it again!&lt;br /&gt;  Package arrived quickly...very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very light touch of color but extremely easy to put on and even my first use was 100% streakless</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, and have had skin cancer, so can never go out in the sun. I have tried several self tanning products without success. They have always streaked, or turned orange-ish in color. This product is amazing. Thru the winter I put a little on my shoulders, chest and arms and love the results, but summer I use all over.  This product gives instant results, you actually see what the end result is as you apply. It does continue to darken a little as you re-apply, but never do you see those horrible streaks and orange spots.&lt;br /&gt;It looks so incredibly natural once applied! Just make sure you wash your hands well, especially between your fingers.</li>
            <li> Great self tanner for those of us with fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;Builds gradually without looking orange.&lt;br /&gt;Best result, apply before bed, then shower in morning, keep applying for desired color.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend? Absolutely...I will continue to buy Fake and Bake and stop wasting my&lt;br /&gt;$$ on the other products.</li>
            <li> I know alot of people who swear by Fake Bake and I have seen their results on them which looked natural. However, it didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I am EXTREMELY pale and cannot tan even if I tried (which I don&#x27;t; avid SPF user). I do like to have a little color in the summer and am always on the hunt for a sunless tanning product that won&#x27;t turn me Snooki-orange or jaundiced yellow. I didn&#x27;t want to start off with the original formula fearing it would be too dark for my skin, so I went with the recommended Light version. This stuff smelled like chocolate (I&#x27;ve heard Fake Bake usually smells awful but that wasn&#x27;t my experience with this particular one). It went on DARK (it washes off, it&#x27;s only the color guide which is a HUGE help). I loved the color it seemed to be turning my skin. Very natural and brown. Not orange at all. Then I took a shower and watched my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; wash completely down the drain. I did 5 more consecutive applications hoping to build the color, but I never built up ANY color. I gave it to a friend because I hate throwing stuff away. It might just be my skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold many sunless tanners well. You can try to see if it works for you but I have had better luck with Sun Labs tanners.</li>
            <li> I love Fake Bake Fair! I am very pale &amp; this does not turn me orange at all. The lotion is dark brown so it is easy to see resulting in a streak-free tan. Be sure to exfoliate before hand &amp; put lotion on your knees, feet, elbows and hands before applying Fake Bake. This gives you a natural looking tan &amp; as the bottle states it is gradual so you control how dark you get. I usually apply the lotion at night and when I wake up, I have a sun-kissed glow. Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to add that you should wear gloves like the one they provide when applying this product. I keep a box on hand. It will keep your hands from getting too much tanning lotion and looking like they have had several applications while the rest of you only looks slightly darker.</li>
            <li> goes on great, washes off to leave really even and good colour tan. used baby oil on elbows etc and worked brilliantly.</li>
            <li> I was a big fan of the fake bake flawless spray... until  I took a shower the next morning and it all washed off. I wanted to try the lotion as people said it lasts longer then the spray. My ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. I used the mitt from the spray and I still ended up with blotches, but no tan. I didn&#x27;t see any color guard so I didn&#x27;t know what I had applied or anything. I am very VERY pale and this, nor the spray did me any justice. I am very disappointed, kind of angry actually that I even wasted money on this crap. If you put this gob on your skin and hesitate a second too long to rub it in you will have an unnattractive blotch you won&#x27;t be able to blend out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually tried to combine the lotion and spray to see if it would settle in the skin better and all I got was a mess that rubbed off if you even rubbed the area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying new products or I am going to have to suffer with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The very first application, I was impressed. The color guide was helpful and it looked like I had an overnight one week vacation to Hawaii. ::very sun-kissed:: it left a couple areas splotchy. I made sure to exfoliate before each use and made sure to put a very minimal amount on the areas that have high/quick absorption. However, the inner bends of my arms, my wrists and also certain parts of my ankles (All the tricky parts, basically) were DARK and obvious. They weren&#x27;t tan though, they had a very yellow undertone. After a few applications my tan began building with that same yellowish tone instead of the golden look it first gave me. Also, if ONE drop of water splashes on a part of your body the same night you apply it, you will have a random white spot in that area after your shower the next morning. This tanner is not very forgiving to water accidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I feel like continuing to use this product will give me a super fake, &amp;#34;Snooki&amp;#34; type appearance. (NOT ATTRACTIVE) Maybe my fair skin just wasn&#x27;t compatible with the formula. I have a really pink undertone to my skin so FakeBake put emphasis on any yellow undertone there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this and it is great!  No streaks, or orange color and with gloves, it is easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have super light white skin. I use this at night on my face and neck and use the spray fake bake on my body. This would be time consuming to use for the whole body but it&#x27;s good for the face. I apply it with the blue gloves that come with it. It goes on dark so you&#x27;ll look a little funny, but you&#x27;re just going to sleep so who cares. When you shower it off in the morning it looks great! Not orange looking at all. Be careful if you have any dry skin spots or pimples it will probably make them darker.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It gives me instant tan and feel back to normal everytime I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a mess on my sheets in the morning, but it comes out in the wash. And I need my tan :)</li>
