            <li>I bought this for my eyebrow pencils and it works great.  </li>
            <li>After I saw the great reviews for this brand I decided to buy it</li>
            <li>This is a good sharpener.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that collect the residues and has two size holes.</li>
            <li>This is really a nice sharpener.  </li>
            <li>sharpens nice - and seems durable - i would purchase it again&lt;</li>
            <li>Not having a good point defeats the purpose of so many eye makeup pencils ...</li>
            <li>It sharpens nice and easy.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>I really love this sharpner.  </li>
            <li>brand sharpener for $10, which works so much better.</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>This is actually the best sharpener I have owned.</li>
            <li>I use a liquid pencil eyeliner and this is the only sharpener that sharpens my eyeliner perfectly!</li>
            <li>I really do love this sharpener.  </li>
            <li>one makes smooth cuts and perfectly sharpens my regular-sized, wooden pencils.  </li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Both sizes work nicely, and the scraps are caught right in the lid.  </li>
            <li>Wipes clean easily so pencils sharpen cleanly and to a nice point.</li>
            <li>It works extremely well, sharpens perfectly well without ever breaking my eyeliner pencils or lipliner pencils.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The door opens just fine for dumping the shavings.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this sharpener, it is so smooth and quick to sharpen.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my make-up pencils.</li>
            <li>I have just one fat pencil that doesnt fit though.</li>
            <li>It is easy to tell that the blades are of excellent quality -- no dragging and no shredding of the pencil; but no matter which makeup pencil I try, I cannot sharpen to a point (on the small side).</li>
            <li>It sharpens all kinds of cosmetic pencils very easily without leaving bits of wood or product hanging off the end of the pencil and has never broken off the tip of a pencil instead of sharpening it.</li>
            <li>and, I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This sharpener is great for regular eye brow pencils, but what I especially like is the larger sharpener which is perfect for lipsticks and lip glosses that need to be sharpened.</li>
            <li>I could tell the difference in quality right away...such a smooth sharpener, it works so well.</li>
            <li>- just be sure to remove the attachment on the large side if you want to use it for a large pencil.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it will be to empty and clean since you can see when it fills up with shavings.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>And it was SO worth it.</li>
            <li>was right.</li>
            <li>Works great on both my small and large size pencils.</li>
            <li>So I finally decided to spend a little more and get one that was a brand I knew was good.</li>
            <li>Wait, I can&#x27;t, because it has a plastic block to smooth the tip near the end of the cone.</li>
            <li>I love all Tweezerman products and this sharpener is definitely on of their items.  </li>
            <li>This one does the job the first time and has saved me money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to spend the extra dollar or two and get this sharpener.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife says this little sharpener is amazing and well worth the extra couple of dollars, like most Tweezerman products.</li>
            <li>I have ordered previously and very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie Buscemi</li>
            <li>It is amazing, but it MAY be too sharp for your softer pencils</li>
            <li>Makes nice sharp points for my pencils.</li>
            <li>I did not try the large hole sharpener.</li>
            <li>So I really like it, although it doesn&#x27;t work on self-sharpening liners in plastic cases.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and u don&#x27;t need to sharpen it above the trash</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about this destroying my eyeliners or creating potentially hazardous wood chips/flecks from some eyeliners.</li>
            <li>2 different size holes is nice, I use the larger one for my crayon lip line filler.</li>
            <li>This sharpener worked very smoothly and never once broke any of my pencils, but they were never sharp enough for me.</li>
            <li>All of the debris collects in the cover - which was slightly difficult to open the first time around, but once I figured it out, everything was wonderful!!</li>
            <li>I admit, I thought a normal pencil sharpener would work for this... not without getting splinters!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work any better than any other sharpener</li>
            <li>I have large pencils from Smashbox and other makeup companies and none of them fit into the large hole.</li>
            <li>I use the small side of this sharpener for my urban decay 24/7 eyeliner and the large side for my benefit eye bright pencil.  </li>
            <li>Still sharp after a year of light use for cosmetic pencils.</li>
            <li>I spent double the money on a MAC sharpener and it stopped working properly pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>It completely chews up the products as its sharpening.</li>
            <li>The little reservoir for shavings is secure and doesn&#x27;t leak, and makes it so much easier to use while she is getting ready in the morning because she doesn&#x27;t have to interrupt her routine and carry the pencil  and sharpener over to a trash can and try to contain the shavings that go everywhere with other sharpeners.</li>
            <li>At first I thought $10 was ridiculous just for a sharpener, but now I realize that it&#x27;s not a bad price at all.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed that a great company like Tweezerman put out a product that doesn&#x27;t seem to fit any standard large pencils.</li>
            <li>no less - so I ordered this.</li>
            <li>It had the same problems as my 5+ year old sharpener!!  </li>
            <li>had to replace my old trusty sharpener that I had for years when it finally gave up on me and started crushing the tips of my regular-sized eyeliner pencils off and making uneven cuts.</li>
            <li>But once you open it once then its much easier to open it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I wear eyeliner every day, I quickly ran out and got a Wet n Wild sharpener from my local Walgreens (it was the only stand-alone sharpener I could find there).  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about this sharpener - I&#x27;ve been using awful drugstore ones for the past 10 years and love Tweezerman&#x27;s tweezers, so I figured the blade must be superior.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much on a silly sharpener, and I was kind of shocked to find Tweezerman (I have a $30 pair of Tweezerman tweezers that I love, but definitely spendy) - with free add-on shipping,</li>
            <li>So, no matter how you turn, the soft makeup tips just push against the back of the sharpener and never get to the point that they are usable.</li>
            <li>I can put a point on the cubbies and so far the thin pencils are pointing fine.  </li>
            <li>It definitely is - my normal-sized eyeliner (Stila Kajal) is extremely soft and usually tough to sharpen without ruining, but this sharpener does a fantastic job in only a few quick turns.</li>
            <li>Cheap (I have seen ridiculous prices at cosmetic retailers).</li>
            <li>Yup, high quality, does the job without splinters, and the little shield allows me to sharpen my pencils in the morning quickly without having to make a mess in my makeup bag or run to the trash every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I felt like I wasted a lot of product and money on this when I should have just gotten the quality sharpener the first time.</li>
            <li>Have used it a few times as I just received it and so far it appears to be the same high quality you would expect from Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>Then my daughter showed me that the little plastic piece that sticks out of the large hole could be removed to make a larger size, which was big enough for my chubby sticks.  </li>

            <li> Then my daughter showed me that the little plastic piece that sticks out of the large hole could be removed to make a larger size, which was big enough for my chubby sticks.  </li>
            <li> Side-note, the top plastic lid pops open to empty the shavings but it may be a little difficult to open at first</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve already made the mistake of purchasing crappy cosmetic sharpeners that cost less, and I completely trust Tweezerman&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and the &#x27;standard&#x27; sized sharpener works terrific.</li>
            <li> Mr. Tweezer clearly never uses eyeliner.</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed that the large side wasn&#x27;t big enough for the chubby sticks that I like from Origins.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of money and not worth the time or cost of sending back.</li>
            <li> This small-hole sharpener did not fit standard eye pencils well enough to sharpen without breaking the point off.  </li>
            <li> It has stayed sharp for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The cover stays closed and doesnt spill the shavings out.</li>
            <li> Since the negative reviews only referred to jumbo size eye pencils not getting sharp, and I only use the thinner eye pencils, I thought: \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> It is sharp.</li>
            <li> Now they are so sharp I could hurt my eye.</li>
            <li> Too small for big pencil,we can not use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was getting tired of wasting so much of my standard size wooden eye pencils sharpening them with sharpeners that just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Blade is very sharp and pencil comes to a sharp point every time.</li>
            <li> It seems sharp andI like that it contains the sharpenings and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> This little sharpener has worked so well.  </li>
            <li> but they do not fit into the jumbo sharpening hole.</li>
            <li> For larger pencils, I have had to purchase a grocery store version that unfortunately has a duller blade.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, which is a relief, because I suffer from chronically dull pencils.</li>
            <li> I sharpen and sharpen and sharpen and haven&#x27;t gotten beyond a dull point.  </li>
            <li> I have always bought cheap sharpeners that do a horrible job sharpening and either break themselves or break my eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I sharpen mineral eyeliners and eyeshadow sticks - chubby and thin pencils.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this was completely useless, but if you care about your eye or lip pencils, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep the sharpener for my normal-sized eyeliner, but I&#x27;m way disappointed that I still have to buy ANOTHER one just for the jumbo eyeliners.</li>

            <li> I use the small side of this sharpener for my urban decay 24/7 eyeliner and the large side for my benefit eye bright pencil.  It works great - just be sure to remove the attachment on the large side if you want to use it for a large pencil.</li>
            <li> It is sharp. It is versatile (3 hole sizes). It is easy to clean. Easy to hold. Not always dropping it. Cheap (I have seen ridiculous prices at cosmetic retailers). Did I mention it sharpens? It does what it is supposed to do, which is a relief, because I suffer from chronically dull pencils. Now they are so sharp I could hurt my eye. Wait, I can&#x27;t, because it has a plastic block to smooth the tip near the end of the cone. So I really like it, although it doesn&#x27;t work on self-sharpening liners in plastic cases. You have to twist those up.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this sharpener - I&#x27;ve been using awful drugstore ones for the past 10 years and love Tweezerman&#x27;s tweezers, so I figured the blade must be superior. It definitely is - my normal-sized eyeliner (Stila Kajal) is extremely soft and usually tough to sharpen without ruining, but this sharpener does a fantastic job in only a few quick turns. However, one of the reasons I bought this pricey sharpener was for my jumbo pencils - I just bought a bunch of jumbo shades (Sephora brand) but they do not fit into the jumbo sharpening hole. I&#x27;ll keep the sharpener for my normal-sized eyeliner, but I&#x27;m way disappointed that I still have to buy ANOTHER one just for the jumbo eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I am using this for sharpening wooden lip- and eyeliner pencils. The blades are sharp and the &#x27;standard&#x27; sized sharpener works terrific. It is the larger hole that gives me problems. For some reason, that place where the tip of the pencil rests inside the sharpener is too blunt. So, no matter how you turn, the soft makeup tips just push against the back of the sharpener and never get to the point that they are usable. For larger pencils, I have had to purchase a grocery store version that unfortunately has a duller blade.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sharpener, it is so smooth and quick to sharpen. I don&#x27;t have to worry about this destroying my eyeliners or creating potentially hazardous wood chips/flecks from some eyeliners. All of the debris collects in the cover - which was slightly difficult to open the first time around, but once I figured it out, everything was wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my make-up pencils. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Have used it a few times as I just received it and so far it appears to be the same high quality you would expect from Tweezerman. Will update after I have had it for a while.</li>
            <li> Still sharp after a year of light use for cosmetic pencils. It&#x27;s nice that collect the residues and has two size holes.</li>
            <li> I love all Tweezerman products and this sharpener is definitely on of their items.  It is amazing, but it MAY be too sharp for your softer pencils</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was getting tired of wasting so much of my standard size wooden eye pencils sharpening them with sharpeners that just didn&#x27;t work.  After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this one.  Since the negative reviews only referred to jumbo size eye pencils not getting sharp, and I only use the thinner eye pencils, I thought: \\&quot;No problem!\\&quot;.  Well, it is.  I sharpen and sharpen and sharpen and haven&#x27;t gotten beyond a dull point.  And, hey, this one ain&#x27;t even made in China - it&#x27;s made in Germany!  Maybe I just got a dud.......</li>
            <li> great purchase and so happy with the quality!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve already made the mistake of purchasing crappy cosmetic sharpeners that cost less, and I completely trust Tweezerman&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;I was right. It works extremely well, sharpens perfectly well without ever breaking my eyeliner pencils or lipliner pencils. I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that a great company like Tweezerman put out a product that doesn&#x27;t seem to fit any standard large pencils. I have large pencils from Smashbox and other makeup companies and none of them fit into the large hole. A complete waste of money and not worth the time or cost of sending back.</li>
            <li> I really love this sharpner.  It sharpens just perfectly without chopping up the pencil whether it be an eybrow or lipstiick pencil.  It holds the shavings so you do not have to stand over the wastbasket and sharpen.  2 different size holes is nice, I use the larger one for my crayon lip line filler.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this was completely useless, but if you care about your eye or lip pencils, don&#x27;t get this. It completely chews up the products as its sharpening. I felt like I wasted a lot of product and money on this when I should have just gotten the quality sharpener the first time. I have replaced this with &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brand sharpener for $10, which works so much better.</li>
            <li> Must have tool for the ladies.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice sharpener.  I just love it.  It has stayed sharp for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  Blade is very sharp and pencil comes to a sharp point every time. l&#x27;ll buy again when the time comes. Higjly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using liquid for years, and finally decided to start using pencil. I admit, I thought a normal pencil sharpener would work for this... not without getting splinters! So I decided to order this... I didn&#x27;t want to pay too much on a silly sharpener, and I was kind of shocked to find Tweezerman (I have a $30 pair of Tweezerman tweezers that I love, but definitely spendy) - with free add-on shipping, no less - so I ordered this. Yup, high quality, does the job without splinters, and the little shield allows me to sharpen my pencils in the morning quickly without having to make a mess in my makeup bag or run to the trash every time I use it. Definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I admit I haven&#x27;t tried the jumbo sharpener, as I don&#x27;t use any makeup that would require it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered previously and very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie Buscemi</li>
            <li> sharpens nice - and seems durable - i would purchase it again&lt;br /&gt;i have not used the bigger side yet</li>
            <li> This sharpener does a great job - it gets my eyeliners sharpened to a perfect point.  This is actually the best sharpener I have owned. I spent double the money on a MAC sharpener and it stopped working properly pretty quickly.  The Tweezerman Deluxe Cosmetic Sharpener is a great tool to have in your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I have always bought cheap sharpeners that do a horrible job sharpening and either break themselves or break my eyeliner! So I finally decided to spend a little more and get one that was a brand I knew was good. And it was SO worth it. I could tell the difference in quality right away...such a smooth sharpener, it works so well. At first I thought $10 was ridiculous just for a sharpener, but now I realize that it&#x27;s not a bad price at all. I would recommend this to anyone looking for one. Side-note, the top plastic lid pops open to empty the shavings but it may be a little difficult to open at first, you just need to push up. But once you open it once then its much easier to open it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best. It is cheap and u don&#x27;t need to sharpen it above the trash can either. It is convenient!!</li>
            <li> This little sharpener has worked so well.  Both sizes work nicely, and the scraps are caught right in the lid.  It sharpens beautifully and I&#x27;m very happy with how it&#x27;s worked on all my eye and lip pencils.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is great for regular eye brow pencils, but what I especially like is the larger sharpener which is perfect for lipsticks and lip glosses that need to be sharpened.</li>
            <li> This small-hole sharpener did not fit standard eye pencils well enough to sharpen without breaking the point off.  I did not try the large hole sharpener.</li>
            <li> Best sharpener ever!  I use a liquid pencil eyeliner and this is the only sharpener that sharpens my eyeliner perfectly!</li>
            <li> Works great on both my small and large size pencils.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is uber efficient. I&#x27;ve had difficulty with sharpeners as they chew up the Le Crayon Poudre. Tweezerman does the perfect sharpening job on ALL pencils, powder or otherwise, and catches the shavings in its ample size catch-all. Love it!</li>
            <li> It is easy to tell that the blades are of excellent quality -- no dragging and no shredding of the pencil; but no matter which makeup pencil I try, I cannot sharpen to a point (on the small side). Not having a good point defeats the purpose of so many eye makeup pencils ... so the search for the best sharpener continues.</li>
            <li> I really do love this sharpener.  It takes two size pencils.  It sharpens nice and easy.  The door opens just fine for dumping the shavings.  It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this sharpener for over a year.  Before I purchased this one, I was using the sharpeners I bought from the drugstore but they kept eating up my eyebrow pencils and they would break off when I started to use them which made me keep sharpening them over and over.  This one does the job the first time and has saved me money.</li>
            <li> I sharpen mineral eyeliners and eyeshadow sticks - chubby and thin pencils.  I can put a point on the cubbies and so far the thin pencils are pointing fine.  I like the Tweezerman and will recommend to anyone considering for the same sharpening jobs I do.</li>
            <li> I really like this. Makes nice sharp points for my pencils. I have just one fat pencil that doesnt fit though. The cover stays closed and doesnt spill the shavings out.</li>
            <li> This sharpener has been reliable and never clogs.  Wipes clean easily so pencils sharpen cleanly and to a nice point.</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed that the large side wasn&#x27;t big enough for the chubby sticks that I like from Origins.  And this of course was the reason I ordered it.  Then my daughter showed me that the little plastic piece that sticks out of the large hole could be removed to make a larger size, which was big enough for my chubby sticks.  So you can use this with 3 different sizes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than any other sharpener but it lasted longer. Got it a year ago and just now threw it away.</li>
            <li> This is a good sharpener.  I bought this for my eyebrow pencils and it works great.  I think it would also work well for larger pencils.  It seems sharp andI like that it contains the sharpenings and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> This is a blunterer, not a sharpener. It destroyed two of my pencils. Not up to Tweezerman standards. Mr. Tweezer clearly never uses eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I bought a cosmetic sharpener by another brand awhile back and it just caused my pencils to break off. At one point I thought it was just the brand of the pencil I was using but turns out that it was the sharpener. After I saw the great reviews for this brand I decided to buy it and, I am not disappointed. It gets the job done!</li>
            <li> My wife says this little sharpener is amazing and well worth the extra couple of dollars, like most Tweezerman products. It sharpens all kinds of cosmetic pencils very easily without leaving bits of wood or product hanging off the end of the pencil and has never broken off the tip of a pencil instead of sharpening it. The little reservoir for shavings is secure and doesn&#x27;t leak, and makes it so much easier to use while she is getting ready in the morning because she doesn&#x27;t have to interrupt her routine and carry the pencil  and sharpener over to a trash can and try to contain the shavings that go everywhere with other sharpeners.</li>
            <li> Too small for big pencil,we can not use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to spend the extra dollar or two and get this sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace my old trusty sharpener that I had for years when it finally gave up on me and started crushing the tips of my regular-sized eyeliner pencils off and making uneven cuts. How annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wear eyeliner every day, I quickly ran out and got a Wet n Wild sharpener from my local Walgreens (it was the only stand-alone sharpener I could find there).  It had the same problems as my 5+ year old sharpener!!  What a waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one makes smooth cuts and perfectly sharpens my regular-sized, wooden pencils.  I love how easy it will be to empty and clean since you can see when it fills up with shavings.</li>
            <li> This sharpener worked very smoothly and never once broke any of my pencils, but they were never sharp enough for me. I went back to using my 1$ E.L.F sharpener.</li>
