            <li>I guess, for me it would be ideal to use it only at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very useful thing.</li>

            <li>other than that i love this and cant wait to see how it would shrink my pores, and refine my skin :)</li>
            <li>thing i didnt like with this size and packaging, though its good for travelling, is that it has no dropper, u have to be extra careful not to accidentally dispense too much or spill any drop of this goody.</li>
            <li>The one that I really want.</li>
            <li>i first tried in the morning, but noticed that my face was a bit oily after a few hours, but then again i live in tropic country and also tried a new brand of moisturizer and sunblock (olay regenerist and avene sunblock), but after i blotted, my face looks fresh again.</li>
            <li>It was runny and did not do much for me unless I used half the bottle.</li>

            <li> A gift for some Chinese friends. Estee Lauder is the Gold Standard for cosmetics in China, and my friends are so beautiful, it must be working!</li>
            <li> with just one application, u can see and feel the difference. your skin looks hydrated. i first tried in the morning, but noticed that my face was a bit oily after a few hours, but then again i live in tropic country and also tried a new brand of moisturizer and sunblock (olay regenerist and avene sunblock), but after i blotted, my face looks fresh again. I guess, for me it would be ideal to use it only at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing i didnt like with this size and packaging, though its good for travelling, is that it has no dropper, u have to be extra careful not to accidentally dispense too much or spill any drop of this goody. other than that i love this and cant wait to see how it would shrink my pores, and refine my skin :)</li>
