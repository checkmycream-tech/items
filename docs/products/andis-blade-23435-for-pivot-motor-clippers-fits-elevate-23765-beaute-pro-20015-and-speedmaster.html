            <li>2 philip screws &amp; easy does it &amp; POW we&#x27;re trimming again!</li>

            <li>It works great, and it&#x27;s exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>seem to be off enough that blade doesn&#x27;t attach perfectly.</li>
            <li>Easy to change out the blades.</li>
            <li>Amazon, keep doing a great job providing your clientele with necessary items in  a timely manner.</li>
            <li>and they fit my trimer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>

            <li>good to have a back up!</li>
            <li>Super did just what it was suppose to</li>
            <li>Better than NEW, cuz I&#x27;m comfortable w/ current machine &amp; cuts good as new!</li>
            <li>Priced right &amp; Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut any better than my blades that are 3 years old.</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>The blades pull peoples hair, somehow they work better with the small blade in plastic like the original blades.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to return this item to CBS Express, and the person said &amp;#34;That can&#x27;t be, the blade is new!</li>
            <li>went to walmart and bought a brand new shaving unit instead!</li>
            <li>Buy a new blade!  </li>
            <li>Over the years, the cutters just havent worked the way the once did, and I was almost ready to buy a new trimmer kit all together.</li>
            <li>Blade did not cut my dog&#x27;s hair,I ordered the same blade directly from Andis,paid a little more and it works fine.</li>
            <li>I recommend them and Amazon if you need some new blades.</li>
            <li>saved me from buying a new trimmer or having to ship my blade for sharpening and not having a trimmer while I wait.</li>
            <li>We will use this brand every time we need new ones.</li>
            <li>Purchase the cutters new in 2008 to trim the border collie.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and do a fine job.</li>
            <li>This blade set works great for cutting my dog&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Simple, straight forward replacement part.</li>
            <li>Blade recommended by Andis customer service as a fit for my PM-3 model but couldn&#x27;t get blade to attach and tighten down w/o being crooked.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant that it looked a little bit different than the the original blade</li>
            <li>Fits easily and was cutting right away.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using my andis speedmaster clippers, but my blades were dull and would not cut properly.</li>

            <li> I really enjoy using my andis speedmaster clippers, but my blades were dull and would not cut properly. I found the Andis  Speedmaster  Replacement Blade Set on -line and ordered them. They work perfectly. Very sharp and do a fine job. I recommend them and Amazon if you need some new blades. Amazon, keep doing a great job providing your clientele with necessary items in  a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Thought about getting &amp;#34;new clipper&amp;#34;  Just replace the blades...Glad I did! Better than NEW, cuz I&#x27;m comfortable w/ current machine &amp; cuts good as new! 2 philip screws &amp; easy does it &amp; POW we&#x27;re trimming again!

            <li> Blade recommended by Andis customer service as a fit for my PM-3 model but couldn&#x27;t get blade to attach and tighten down w/o being crooked. Trimmer works but screw holes seem to be off enough that blade doesn&#x27;t attach perfectly.</li>

            <li> I bought this blade from CBS Express here at amazon.com. It&#x27;s supposed to be &amp;#34;BRAND NEW&amp;#34;. But I opened it, installed, expecting it to be sharp. VERY DULL. I&#x27;m trying to return this item to CBS Express, and the person said &amp;#34;That can&#x27;t be, the blade is new! Unfortunately, it is very dull, so how am I supposed to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to walmart and bought a brand new shaving unit instead! Cost me $10+ tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller where to return it, no response where to ship it back!</li>

            <li> I purchased the used clippers but it didn&#x27;t have the bottom blade. So I was thrilled when I was able to order these for my clippers. They were the exact product I needed and work perfectly! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
