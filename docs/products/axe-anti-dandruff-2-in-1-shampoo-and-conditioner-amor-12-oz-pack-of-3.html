            <li>But it would be sort of awesome</li>
            <li>Use this in combination with the body wash for a wonder fragrance that is not overpowering, but smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pleasant and makes a very nice shampoo as well as body wash.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s happy with the shampoo insofar as how it cleans.</li>

            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>They smell great.</li>
            <li>We also use the Axe hair spray, glues and powders to flip his hair, great styling line for boys/men.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>The shampoo did not seem to build up with that sticky feeling, and I could notice a pleasant trace of the odor for some time after I showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning your hair.</li>
            <li>I have found that shampoos like this are even good as a body wash.</li>
            <li>An all-round good shampoo for a guy (or a girl, for that matter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well, cleans good.............</li>
            <li>He loved the smell (and so do I)</li>
            <li>A good product, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Axe.</li>
            <li>My college son is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very nice way to start any morning with a refreshing body wash made for a man.</li>
            <li>There were too many choices!</li>

            <li>I have a nice wife that loves me.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>

            <li>My girlfriend likes Axe &amp; commented it smelled nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice cologne smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering</li>
            <li>He likes the scent and the fact that it thoroughly cleans his hair, he is a Metro-sexual in so many ways, I think this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers well, rinses clean, and smells great.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great, lathers well and leaves your hairy squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>However, I will probably keep looking for something better, something that will attract the girls better!</li>
            <li>I used to the cheap but quite good Gillette men&#x27;s thickening shampoo.</li>
            <li>As the name implies it seems as if they are using aromatherapy to make sure I get out of the shower feeling relaxed.</li>
            <li>Lathering up my hair with this product is refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of most Axe products.</li>
            <li>Nor did I believe that the scent of a hair product would attract stampeding hordes of sexy ladies.</li>
            <li>Did you expect more?</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems there but find it OK otherwise.</li>
            <li>is one of the better Axe shampoos IMO.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite smell for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have no issues with most Axe deodorant, gel, shampoo, etc scents.  </li>
            <li>(I keep popping it open and trying to pinpoint the delightful, aromatic notes).</li>
            <li>one is a genuine winner!</li>
            <li>but that’s ok –</li>
            <li>He smells incredible for his age and the shampoo has not dried out his hair</li>
            <li>Leaves hair nice, clean, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I find it seems to work pretty good and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair as dry and fly away as many others.</li>
            <li>After shampooing, your hair feels clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is not in and of itself excessively strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice lather, rinses out easily, and leaves hair super clean (and smelling awesome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair smells fine.</li>
            <li>Quite simply, Axe Shampoos give you great hair.  </li>
            <li>A great addition to the Axe line-up - I&#x27;ll definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li>It will make you more fun to talk to at parties.</li>
            <li>So does really cheap shampoo from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>It lathers easily and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>While I was not crazy about the scent of the Peace Body-Wash, I LOVE the fragrance of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a great addition to the Axe shampoo lineup of products, with a fresh clean &amp;#34;green grass&amp;#34; kind of scent, and a groovy peace sign on the package, sure to appeal to adolescent and young adult customers.</li>
            <li>Just like the new body wash, hours after your shower you can still smell the scent, I love it!</li>
            <li>He was excited when this shampoo came out.  </li>
            <li>I also feel, well, more peaceful after using it.</li>
            <li>This body wash is rich and thick creates a great lather and has an amazing scent that stay with you all through the morning.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s hair looked clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>hair is clean.</li>
            <li>She does care that my hair is clean and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>hair is clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that Axe products tend toward the more potent masculine fragrances.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant scent reminiscent of fruit.</li>
            <li>All I could think was that they wanted to make sure you didn&#x27;t confuse the two, although I&#x27;ve found the shampoo without conditioner form Axe works about as well as shower gel for your whole body.  </li>
            <li>Lathers well, so I say if it&#x27;s good enough for my head, it&#x27;s good enough for the rest of me.</li>
            <li>Simply put, nothing else comes close to being as good at this price point.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad item.</li>
            <li>Axe makes great products in general and would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I really do prefer fragrant free products, but this was free</li>
            <li>The citrus, ginger, and pepper create a slightly masculine fragrance but also is still a nice fresh scent that could be used by a woman as well.</li>
            <li>They all mostly the Axe like, but yet tweaked to be noticeable new.  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice fragrance, and left my hair feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes the hair feel clean and ready to tackle the day!</li>
            <li>But we do the little things to keep them happy.</li>
            <li>I may be particularly susceptible since I have a strong sense of smell to begin with.</li>
            <li>Huge Axe fan and these new scents do not disappoint!</li>
            <li>The new &amp;#34;peace&amp;#34; scent is very pleasant, if not a bit hard to describe.</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li>I tried this out for the first time, and could not quite grasp the smell</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and citrusy and smells appropriately masculine, but be aware that it is not a faint scent.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this shampoo is the smell, which is very manly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a masculine scent, lightly sweet, but without being overpowering or obnoxious.  </li>
            <li>but it made my hair little bit dry, and smell good !</li>
            <li>; from the previous sentence and replace with &amp;#34;Target.&amp;#34; Yes, Target is respectable, right?</li>
            <li>If I did I might wonder whether I really want to put that in my hair.</li>
            <li>shampoo itself is thick and pearlescent and bright gold in color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottle design, flared at the top, prevents it from slipping from one&#x27;s hand in the shower.</li>
            <li>Shampoo works really well.</li>
            <li>I really couldn’t smell one of the distinctive smells Axe is known for</li>
            <li>but if this thing really makes women flock to you, it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.</li>
            <li>A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way as it lathers up really well, and it rinses out pretty easy and leaves your hair looking fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>This one smells citrus and sweet at the same time.</li>
            <li>Cleverly crafted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the perfume/fragrance is quite strong and not really what I need.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>the Axe shower gel / shampoos normally are almost identical in color, smell, consistency, etc.  </li>
            <li>For some reason the shampoo is golden yellow?!?</li>
            <li>This Axe shampoo is a new scent called Peace and everyone here likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>For those that like to try new Axe products, give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and subtle while not being</li>
            <li>My 10 year old loves Axe sprays and hair products!</li>
            <li>As with all Axe shampoos, they never dry out your hair too much.</li>
            <li>Mildly because I never really believed a hair product would bring me up form a 6.3 to a 9.9 on the sexiness scale.</li>
            <li>It has a masculine scent, leaves hair soft and manageable (his words), and seems to last longer than most other shampoos.</li>
            <li>&quot; He had complained about the girlie shampoos in the shower (coconut, cherry blossom ginseng, ocean breeze) but was disinclined to choose a more masculine one for himself.</li>
            <li>If you believe it will, seek professional help.</li>
            <li>masculine but playful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little dab goes a very long way, the lather is super thick and creamy, and the new &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; scent is quite nice.  </li>
            <li>My sons are big fans of the Axe line of grooming products and I am, too, since some of them live with me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my fragile hair and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive scalp either, Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I was surprised that these seemed quite different from one another  in color - considering</li>
            <li>, it has left it soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li>The yellow viscosity of the shampoo is a bit odd, but the lid is efficient, and can easily close when wet.  </li>
            <li>Dense enough to use just a little at a time, the Axe Shampoo, Peace, 12 Ounce  has a nice smell that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>He has very thick curly hair that we need to keep short on the sides, but the shampoo keeping it soft helps us flip the front easily.</li>

            <li> As with all Axe shampoos, they never dry out your hair too much.</li>
            <li> Mildly because I never really believed a hair product would bring me up form a 6.3 to a 9.9 on the sexiness scale.</li>
            <li> It has a masculine scent, leaves hair soft and manageable (his words), and seems to last longer than most other shampoos.</li>
            <li> &quot; He had complained about the girlie shampoos in the shower (coconut, cherry blossom ginseng, ocean breeze) but was disinclined to choose a more masculine one for himself.</li>
            <li> If you believe it will, seek professional help.</li>
            <li> masculine but playful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little dab goes a very long way, the lather is super thick and creamy, and the new &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; scent is quite nice.  </li>
            <li> My sons are big fans of the Axe line of grooming products and I am, too, since some of them live with me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my fragile hair and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive scalp either, Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that these seemed quite different from one another  in color - considering</li>
            <li> , it has left it soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li> The yellow viscosity of the shampoo is a bit odd, but the lid is efficient, and can easily close when wet.  </li>
            <li> Dense enough to use just a little at a time, the Axe Shampoo, Peace, 12 Ounce  has a nice smell that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> He has very thick curly hair that we need to keep short on the sides, but the shampoo keeping it soft helps us flip the front easily.</li>
            <li> I personally like it enough to use daily, so no real complaints here!</li>
            <li> The smell is quite different than anything I&#x27;ve smelled before but not really objectionable and rinses away in the rinse process.</li>
            <li> It’s a little pricey at 50 cents an ounce, but as I said above a little bit goes a long way: in other words, you don’t have to use as much of this one as you would some of the discount brands like Tre Sem you see at your local retailer so I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> But I would discourage a person from using this shampoo along with other Axe products at the same time.</li>
            <li> Ok product, bad smell.</li>
            <li> Much like a very subtle men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend because he uses other Axe products and he doesn&#x27;t like to use my &amp;#34;girl-smell&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> Which means if you use this shampoo AND other deodorants</li>
            <li> My son has been using Axe shampoo and other Axe products for years.</li>
            <li> Also works well in tandem with the other two items in the Axe Peace line, the face wash and the shower gel.</li>
            <li> -- the scent fades within a few minutes -- and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Axe&#x27;s Peace shampoo has a slightly orange color about it that I find distinctive.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it was harder to get at my local stores</li>
            <li> As usual Axe has done it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> My wife still loves/hates me at the usual level</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m personally not thrilled with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least, not over in this corner.</li>
            <li> At about $6 a bottle, it seems a little expensive for 12 oz. of shampoo.</li>
            <li> and/or body sprays you end up with an unpleasant combination of competing scents that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have thin (but not thinning) hair.</li>
            <li> You will smell it throughout the day so if you don&#x27;t care for it, you&#x27;ll be unhappy all day</li>
            <li> Nor is it actually unpleasant by itself.</li>
            <li> I was mildly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of this though.</li>
            <li> The color is awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As the name implies it seems as if they are using aromatherapy to make sure I get out of the shower feeling relaxed. Lathering up my hair with this product is refreshing. As usual Axe has done it again.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of most Axe products. Quite simply, Axe Shampoos give you great hair.  A little dab goes a very long way, the lather is super thick and creamy, and the new &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; scent is quite nice.  A good value for the money for sure.  The new &amp;#34;peace&amp;#34; scent is very pleasant, if not a bit hard to describe. It&#x27;s definitely a masculine scent, lightly sweet, but without being overpowering or obnoxious.  Much like a very subtle men&#x27;s cologne.  Leaves hair nice, clean, and manageable.  A great addition to the Axe line-up - I&#x27;ll definitely be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to the Axe shampoo lineup of products, with a fresh clean &amp;#34;green grass&amp;#34; kind of scent, and a groovy peace sign on the package, sure to appeal to adolescent and young adult customers. My son&#x27;s hair looked clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend because he uses other Axe products and he doesn&#x27;t like to use my &amp;#34;girl-smell&amp;#34; shampoo. Which I find funny since I usually buy generic scents or gender-neutral shampoos. But we do the little things to keep them happy. He&#x27;s happy with the shampoo insofar as how it cleans. But I&#x27;m personally not thrilled with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not in and of itself excessively strong. Nor is it actually unpleasant by itself. But it does linger and it is noticeable. Which means if you use this shampoo AND other deodorants and/or body sprays you end up with an unpleasant combination of competing scents that lasts a long time. I may be particularly susceptible since I have a strong sense of smell to begin with. But I would discourage a person from using this shampoo along with other Axe products at the same time.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice fragrance, and left my hair feeling soft and clean.  The shampoo did not seem to build up with that sticky feeling, and I could notice a pleasant trace of the odor for some time after I showered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> The yellow viscosity of the shampoo is a bit odd, but the lid is efficient, and can easily close when wet.  But the perfume/fragrance is quite strong and not really what I need.  I really do prefer fragrant free products, but this was free so I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind fragrance, then you can get this product.  It&#x27;s not a bad item.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t resist getting this product for my husband when I read the instructions for use: \\&quot;Wash, attract, repeat.\\&quot; He had complained about the girlie shampoos in the shower (coconut, cherry blossom ginseng, ocean breeze) but was disinclined to choose a more masculine one for himself. There were too many choices! That&#x27;s when I got Axe, and it&#x27;s perfect for men. It has a masculine scent, leaves hair soft and manageable (his words), and seems to last longer than most other shampoos. A small amount goes a long way. As an additional plus, the packaging looks manly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo. It cleans your hair. It does a good job of cleaning your hair. Some people don&#x27;t like the smell. It didn&#x27;t bother me. It might bother you. Check at the store if it think it might bother you. Or quit being a sissy and get over your fear of manly smelling shampoo. Does this stuff smell manly? I&#x27;m not sure. I think it might. Axe says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, I have valid reasons not to trust Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product I was not overwhelmed by the ladies seeking my affections. My wife was relieved. I was mildly disappointed. Mildly because I never really believed a hair product would bring me up form a 6.3 to a 9.9 on the sexiness scale. Nor did I believe that the scent of a hair product would attract stampeding hordes of sexy ladies. But it would be sort of awesome if did. It doesn&#x27;t. If you believe it will, seek professional help. No, keep on believing. It will make you more fun to talk to at parties. But only if you wash your hair with Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is clean. My hair smells fine. I have a nice wife that loves me. She doesn&#x27;t care what shampoo I use. She does care that my hair is clean and doesn&#x27;t stink. Axe does the job. So does really cheap shampoo from Wal-Mart. Did I just admit I sometimes shop at Wal-Mart? No I did not. Omit &amp;#34;Wal-Mart&amp;#34; from the previous sentence and replace with &amp;#34;Target.&amp;#34; Yes, Target is respectable, right? I hope so. Because that&#x27;s where I shop. Target. Not Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is clean. My hair smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> If it were only that simple. lol. I like the scent and the thickness of the shampoo. I&#x27;ve noticed that Axe products tend toward the more potent masculine fragrances. I wish that smell could last all day. But even colognes dissipate in a couple of hours. Bottom line: it cleans your hair. Did you expect more? I have found that shampoos like this are even good as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Nice product but it made my hair little bit dry, and smell good !</li>
            <li> The description says the girls will be attracted to a man using this. I haven&#x27;t had any problems there but find it OK otherwise. The smell is quite different than anything I&#x27;ve smelled before but not really objectionable and rinses away in the rinse process. The color is awful so I just don&#x27;t look at it. If I did I might wonder whether I really want to put that in my hair. Otherwise I find it seems to work pretty good and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair as dry and fly away as many others. However, I will probably keep looking for something better, something that will attract the girls better!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product from the folks at Axe.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent and got my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the better Axe shampoos IMO.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers well, rinses clean, and smells great. The citrus, ginger, and pepper create a slightly masculine fragrance but also is still a nice fresh scent that could be used by a woman as well. Use this in combination with the body wash for a wonder fragrance that is not overpowering, but smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Product as described an shipped in timely matter</li>
            <li> Huge Axe fan and these new scents do not disappoint! This shampoo smells great, lathers well and leaves your hairy squeaky clean. Just like the new body wash, hours after your shower you can still smell the scent, I love it! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my fragile hair and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive scalp either, Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My sons are big fans of the Axe line of grooming products and I am, too, since some of them live with me. This Axe shampoo is a new scent called Peace and everyone here likes it a lot. The scent is fresh and citrusy and smells appropriately masculine, but be aware that it is not a faint scent. You will smell it throughout the day so if you don&#x27;t care for it, you&#x27;ll be unhappy all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is thick and pearlescent and bright gold in color. It lathers easily and rinses cleanly. It doesn&#x27;t strip your hair but it also doesn&#x27;t leave a build-up. An all-round good shampoo for a guy (or a girl, for that matter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars? At about $6 a bottle, it seems a little expensive for 12 oz. of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tried this out for the first time, and could not quite grasp the smell, I thought it smelled like hay from the field or something, then it hit me....weed! No wonder they have the &#x27;peace symbol&#x27; on it...lol. Not my favorite smell for my hair. My days of smelling like that have passed. It works well, cleans good.............but unless you want your boss staring at you, be forewarned.</li>
            <li> As with all Axe shampoos, they never dry out your hair too much. They smell great. This one smells citrus and sweet at the same time. It lathers well and because of the scent, it leaves you feeling refreshed. I would always follow up with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have thin (but not thinning) hair. I used to the cheap but quite good Gillette men&#x27;s thickening shampoo. Sadly, it was harder to get at my local stores so I was in need of another shampoo. I tried the Axe Peace Shampoo and I believe I have found a replacement. The scent may take some time getting used to but this shampoo adds body and yes, thickens my hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have no issues with most Axe deodorant, gel, shampoo, etc scents.  They all mostly the Axe like, but yet tweaked to be noticeable new.  This is no different.  My girlfriend likes Axe &amp; commented it smelled nice.  So she noticed the change immediately. I actually got the matching shower gel as well.  I was surprised that these seemed quite different from one another  in color - considering the Axe shower gel / shampoos normally are almost identical in color, smell, consistency, etc.  For some reason the shampoo is golden yellow?!? instead of blue like the shower gel.  All I could think was that they wanted to make sure you didn&#x27;t confuse the two, although I&#x27;ve found the shampoo without conditioner form Axe works about as well as shower gel for your whole body.  For those that like to try new Axe products, give it a shot.  I personally like it enough to use daily, so no real complaints here!</li>
            <li> This shampoo may not cause women to drop at my feet in reverence, but it cleans well and I like the fragrance. What else can I ask for?</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this shampoo is the smell, which is very manly. It&#x27;s very pleasant and makes a very nice shampoo as well as body wash. Lathers well, so I say if it&#x27;s good enough for my head, it&#x27;s good enough for the rest of me.</li>
            <li> While I was not crazy about the scent of the Peace Body-Wash, I LOVE the fragrance of this shampoo. (I keep popping it open and trying to pinpoint the delightful, aromatic notes). My boyfriend says it smells like a citrus-y pastry. And, it reminds me a touch of that old-school cologne Drakkar Noir ... masculine but playful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design, flared at the top, prevents it from slipping from one&#x27;s hand in the shower. Cleverly crafted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice lather, rinses out easily, and leaves hair super clean (and smelling awesome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a genuine winner! Well done, Axe!</li>
            <li> This body wash is rich and thick creates a great lather and has an amazing scent that stay with you all through the morning. Very nice way to start any morning with a refreshing body wash made for a man.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works really well. I hated the smell of this though. It smells like a mens locker room. Yuck. Ok product, bad smell.</li>
            <li> My son has been using Axe shampoo and other Axe products for years. Simply put, nothing else comes close to being as good at this price point. You&#x27;d have to get salon products at twice the price, and even then in my experience Axe is still comparable. Nice cologne smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering -- the scent fades within a few minutes -- and a little goes a long way. He likes the scent and the fact that it thoroughly cleans his hair, he is a Metro-sexual in so many ways, I think this is a good thing.</li>
            <li> My college son is very pleased with this product. Dense enough to use just a little at a time, the Axe Shampoo, Peace, 12 Ounce  has a nice smell that is not overwhelming. Makes the hair feel clean and ready to tackle the day!</li>
            <li> Husband loves this product. He loved the smell (and so do I) Axe makes great products in general and would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way as it lathers up really well, and it rinses out pretty easy and leaves your hair looking fresh and clean.  I really couldn’t smell one of the distinctive smells Axe is known for but that’s ok – I’d rather not walk around and smell like I’ve been bathed in cologne.  It’s a little pricey at 50 cents an ounce, but as I said above a little bit goes a long way: in other words, you don’t have to use as much of this one as you would some of the discount brands like Tre Sem you see at your local retailer so I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old loves Axe sprays and hair products! He was excited when this shampoo came out.  He smells incredible for his age and the shampoo has not dried out his hair, it has left it soft and shiney.  He has very thick curly hair that we need to keep short on the sides, but the shampoo keeping it soft helps us flip the front easily. We also use the Axe hair spray, glues and powders to flip his hair, great styling line for boys/men.</li>
            <li> Axe&#x27;s Peace shampoo has a slightly orange color about it that I find distinctive. It also has a pleasant scent reminiscent of fruit. Very nice. After shampooing, your hair feels clean and healthy. I also feel, well, more peaceful after using it. A good product, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Axe.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and subtle while not being overly fragrant wish is a big plus but if this thing really makes women flock to you, it hasn&#x27;t happened yet. At least, not over in this corner. My wife still loves/hates me at the usual level so no change there. Also works well in tandem with the other two items in the Axe Peace line, the face wash and the shower gel.</li>
