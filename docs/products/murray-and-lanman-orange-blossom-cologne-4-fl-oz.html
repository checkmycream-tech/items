    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Good perfume!!</li>
            <li>and it is excellent to perfume my crepes!&lt;br</li>
            <li>; So I guess that&#x27;s a great</li>
            <li>This smells like a Grandma, and not my Grandma, she smelled great.  </li>
            <li>Great product and the order was shipped to me immediately.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;As perfume, it is very nice too.  </li>
            <li>the scent is very nice for sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li>Nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend!</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL orange blossom scent, which isn&#x27;t easy to find.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this perfume.</li>
            <li>nice fragrance smells clean very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>The aroma of the orange blossom cologne is lovely!  </li>
            <li>My favorite scent!</li>
            <li>The orange trees in my neighborhood smell amazing when they&#x27;re in bloom</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to find this.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t, it smells like orange blossoms (kind of)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled to have found this.  </li>
            <li>However, if you love that soapy floral note that orange blossom gives, you can&#x27;t beat this for the money.</li>
            <li>May be more for medicinal use than for it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to know and love.  </li>
            <li>, then it&#x27;ll bring back wonderful memories and your husband will ask you why you&#x27;re wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be a lot better if there was more of a citrus scent to it, though.</li>
            <li>I prefer the glass bottle, but I guess they don&#x27;t make it like that any more.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Orange blossom flowers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it in pastries (used in North Africa)</li>
            <li>Gosh, love it.  </li>
            <li>This is potent stuff</li>
            <li>It arrived today, great seller, by the way, New Age Botanica, and it smells just about as I remember from my childhood visit to Florida!</li>
            <li>wise, it is very</li>
            <li>I smell a bit of orange blossom, but that&#x27;s through the overwhelming wave of old lady musk masking anything pleasant.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a great orange blossom perfume, this is definitely not it.  </li>
            <li>It was mailed in a sealed plastic bag in a cardboard carton with plenty of paper packing it securely and break proof, spill proof.</li>
            <li>When it first is applied it is very strong and a bit medicinal, but after about ten minutes it smells very nice and just like fresh orange blossoms.</li>
            <li>It would be so much better if it came in a glass container so that it could sit out on the counter, but the product itself is exactly what I was searching for.</li>
            <li>So nice to smell this all these decades later. :-)</li>
            <li>For the most part, and if you don&#x27;t have the nose of a bloodhound, this is pure orange blossom fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nice to find something that smells real, lasts, and is VERY inexpensive!</li>
            <li>but I do capture a whiff of sandalwood within the orange blossom, but the orange blossom absolutely is the top note.  </li>
            <li>We love the spring  as much because the weather is tolerable as because of the scent of orange blossoms.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is as fresh and gently sweet as the scent of orange blossoms.</li>
            <li>Lovely soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product was right on the money.</li>
            <li>you are left with lovely orange blossom.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you want THE orange blossom perfume, go with Jo Malone Orange Blossom, it smells like the real deal (and I&#x27;ll review that tomorrow!)</li>
            <li>Orange blossoms are light and natural.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s still positively lovely 4 hours later.  </li>
            <li>I would imagine that if I put this on all my pulse points, maybe even invest in an atomizer, that I&#x27;m going to smell exactly like you&#x27;re driving by an orange tree in March in Arizona.  </li>
            <li>Please - if you are under 70, don&#x27;t believe the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It was really strong going on, but after I left it for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Every year, we&#x27;d make the trek up to Webb&#x27;s Citrus Candy Factory and buy candy and orange blossom perfume (we would save our allowance because it cost a whole seventy-five cents!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the very essence of orange blossoms, this is your product.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to now.  </li>
            <li>My thanks to the reviewer who said this has just a hint of sandalwood.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as sophisticated as other OB fragrances</li>
            <li>or so it seemed to settle down to a more reasonable scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you were raised in a small citrus town and thought this was a very big deal (buying our own perfume!)</li>
            <li>but it holds its own in being subtle soon after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One afternoon, about 15 minutes after I applied it, I was at my kid&#x27;s school and another mom was near me saying, &amp;#34;who&#x27;s wearing orange blossom?!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of orange blossoms but the scent is usually hard to find or doesn&#x27;t smell like the flower.  </li>
            <li>You literally have to dump this in your hands to apply or reuse an old spray perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>I live in a city near Phoenix and we actually live about 2 miles from commercial orange orchards.  </li>
            <li>I expected a real whiff of Florida orange blossoms.</li>
            <li>Like, BARELY,</li>
            <li>It comes out a little pungent at first, but once the cologne-ish alcohol smell goes away (2 minutes tops)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I just has a faint orane blossom scent.</li>
            <li> This leaves a nasty old cologne smell and made me sick.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.</li>

            <li> If you are looking for a citrus scent, this is not the product for you. However, if you love that soapy floral note that orange blossom gives, you can&#x27;t beat this for the money. It comes out a little pungent at first, but once the cologne-ish alcohol smell goes away (2 minutes tops) you are left with lovely orange blossom.  One afternoon, about 15 minutes after I applied it, I was at my kid&#x27;s school and another mom was near me saying, &amp;#34;who&#x27;s wearing orange blossom?! It smells fantastic!&amp;#34; So I guess that&#x27;s a great endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the scent lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of a commercial restroom deodorizer.  How anyone could think of using it as cologne boggles the imagination!</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing. Not what i expected. May be more for medicinal use than for it&#x27;s fragrance. I expected a real whiff of Florida orange blossoms.</li>
            <li> Please - if you are under 70, don&#x27;t believe the positive reviews. This smells like a Grandma, and not my Grandma, she smelled great.  This does not.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL orange blossom scent, which isn&#x27;t easy to find.  I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> The aroma of the orange blossom cologne is lovely!  It&#x27;s so hard to find orange blossom and I was thrilled to find this.  The fragrance was just what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> it was not a sweet smelling as another i have smelled</li>
            <li> Lovely soft fragrance. Reminds me of the Mock Orange tree that grew in my garden when I was a child</li>
            <li> The orange trees in my neighborhood smell amazing when they&#x27;re in bloom and I look forward to that time of year.  Unfortunately, this does NOT smell anything like the orange blossoms I&#x27;ve come to know and love.  DId I get a &amp;#34;bad bottle&amp;#34; or does it really smell this bad??  I wish I could return this - but alas they don&#x27;t take returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think twice before purchasing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and lasts a long time. Good perfume!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up in a small citrus town in south Florida. Every year, we&#x27;d make the trek up to Webb&#x27;s Citrus Candy Factory and buy candy and orange blossom perfume (we would save our allowance because it cost a whole seventy-five cents!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for sentimental reasons and got exactly what I thought I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great orange blossom perfume, this is definitely not it.  If you were raised in a small citrus town and thought this was a very big deal (buying our own perfume!), then it&#x27;ll bring back wonderful memories and your husband will ask you why you&#x27;re wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want THE orange blossom perfume, go with Jo Malone Orange Blossom, it smells like the real deal (and I&#x27;ll review that tomorrow!)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of orange blossoms but the scent is usually hard to find or doesn&#x27;t smell like the flower.  This product was right on the money.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of the perfumed air of Florida when the orange blossoms are blooming.  Great product and the order was shipped to me immediately.    Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Weird plastic bottle that reminds me of my late grandfathers old aftershave.You literally have to dump this in your hands to apply or reuse an old spray perfume bottle. When it first is applied it is very strong and a bit medicinal, but after about ten minutes it smells very nice and just like fresh orange blossoms. The scent lasts all day and I get loads of compliments on it! Nice to find something that smells real, lasts, and is VERY inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled orange blossoms before, but for some reason I was expecting this to smell like oranges themselves.  But it doesn&#x27;t, it smells like orange blossoms (kind of) just like is says.  It was really strong going on, but after I left it for 10 minutes or so it seemed to settle down to a more reasonable scent.&lt;br /&gt;It would be a lot better if there was more of a citrus scent to it, though.</li>
            <li> Awful..I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I drive by blooming orange groves every fall on my way home. This stuff is nothing like orange blossoms. Orange blossoms are light and natural. This leaves a nasty old cologne smell and made me sick.</li>
            <li> Smells almost like Coppertone Suntan Lotion.  I prefer the glass bottle, but I guess they don&#x27;t make it like that any more.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent! I put it in a little spray bottle. Nothing is as fresh and gently sweet as the scent of orange blossoms.</li>
            <li> nice fragrance smells clean very pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the very essence of orange blossoms, this is your product. It would be so much better if it came in a glass container so that it could sit out on the counter, but the product itself is exactly what I was searching for.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like a nursing home, this is the stuff for you. I smell a bit of orange blossom, but that&#x27;s through the overwhelming wave of old lady musk masking anything pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Orange blossom flowers.&lt;br /&gt;I love it in pastries (used in North Africa) and it is excellent to perfume my crepes!&lt;br /&gt;As perfume, it is very nice too.  I am using it to perfume by bedsheets. the scent is very nice for sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;Price wise, it is very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;The package (of 3) came in due time and with a thank you handwritten note from the seller. Nice touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend!</li>
            <li> Like, BARELY, but I do capture a whiff of sandalwood within the orange blossom, but the orange blossom absolutely is the top note.  I&#x27;m so thrilled to have found this.  I live in a city near Phoenix and we actually live about 2 miles from commercial orange orchards.  We love the spring  as much because the weather is tolerable as because of the scent of orange blossoms.  Gosh, love it.  And I decided I need to smell like that.  Fast forward to now.  This bottle arrived today.  I immediately put A LITTLE dab on my wrist.  And it&#x27;s still positively lovely 4 hours later.  I would imagine that if I put this on all my pulse points, maybe even invest in an atomizer, that I&#x27;m going to smell exactly like you&#x27;re driving by an orange tree in March in Arizona.  Which was my goal.</li>
            <li> This truly is the essence of Orange Blossom.</li>
            <li> This took well beyond the last date it was supposed to arrive. I just has a faint orane blossom scent. Not worth the price at all. I put some on a hour ago a lot as it spilled when I opened it. I can no longer smell it at all. I was hopefull I had found a source for orange blossom scent</li>
            <li> My thanks to the reviewer who said this has just a hint of sandalwood. I didn&#x27;t recognize what was in there along with the orange blossom. For the most part, and if you don&#x27;t have the nose of a bloodhound, this is pure orange blossom fragrance. I had thought of it over the years, and had a sudden impulse for it last weekend, and just like that I found this on Amazon and was looking forward to it. It arrived today, great seller, by the way, New Age Botanica, and it smells just about as I remember from my childhood visit to Florida! This is potent stuff so I just used a tiny dab on the insides of my wrists and it&#x27;s still on 3 hours later. I&#x27;m very pleased with this perfume. It was mailed in a sealed plastic bag in a cardboard carton with plenty of paper packing it securely and break proof, spill proof. So nice to smell this all these decades later. :-)</li>
            <li> I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as sophisticated as other OB fragrances but it holds its own in being subtle soon after application.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s a gem.</li>
