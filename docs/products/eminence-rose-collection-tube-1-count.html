            <li>Eminence is a wonderful collection of skin care products!</li>
            <li>Excellent seller &amp; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eminence products are the best!</li>
            <li>They are all incredible.</li>
            <li>This is a great incentive to continue shopping with them.</li>
            <li>great product, great quality.</li>
            <li>great product and price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great value</li>
            <li>It is great on my skin, but the eye burning made it</li>
            <li>They all make my skin look and feel amazing, but the Rose collection smells the best.</li>
            <li>They all smell amazing and are great for my skin.</li>
            <li>however, it may not be good for acne prone skin, as it made me and my sister break out.  </li>
            <li>They smell good, my skin feels good</li>
            <li>and I feel good.</li>
            <li>Gift, recipient loved it.</li>
            <li>What a great way to sample their rose</li>
            <li>Very pleased with every item.</li>
            <li>Really softens your skin and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The Couperose-C serum works WONDERFULLY on my skin; it&#x27;s reduced the acne significantly, and the sweet rose cleanser is FANTASTIC, as are the rosehip whip moisturizer and the rosehip maize exfoliant (both of which I already knew when ordering).&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad they have sample sizes</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>and I seem to look better because of it.  </li>
            <li>Also, it smells mildly lovely.  </li>
            <li>My skin has such a nice feel after using this set!!!</li>
            <li>we love this products</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>and she has fallen in love with them now as well.</li>
            <li>Enclosed chart was most helpful in knowing what to use and when.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li>It turns out, I&#x27;m in love with the cleanser, the serum,</li>
            <li>Tube is packaged with easy travel size product.  </li>
            <li>This is such great stuff.  </li>
            <li>skin has been looking and feeling great for the last week (since I started using these products with my evening cleaning routine).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been (successfully) using Eminence products for a little over a month now, and have been hemming and hawing over the Rose 6 Piece Collection Tube.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this originally because I wanted travel size of Rosehip whip moisturizer as well as the rosehip maize exfoliant *</li>
            <li>Can not say enough good things about Eminence products.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long, it feels good on my skin</li>
            <li>These small collections are a great way to try the products and decide which full sized ones to order.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>I have liked every single product I have purchased and loved every single product in this combo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The remaining moisturizer (Sweet Red Rose Whip Moisturizer) is just a little too much for my face, but works AMAZINGLY WELL on my hands and smells divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much better after a short time.</li>
            <li>So if you are not sure what do you need, or you never used any skin product before, it can be a good buy for you.</li>
            <li>so you can try it our before buying large sizes.</li>
            <li>I found such fantastic results with this regimen.  </li>
            <li>Everything else, I would definitely purchase full size.</li>
            <li>All natural, organic and makes my face look soooo much brighter.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few of the Eminence lines and love them all.</li>
            <li>They shipped fast and included a 20 percent off coupon for next time.  </li>
            <li>Products promote natural improvement to skin.  </li>
            <li>:) The sample of the product is very small, but it has everything in it.</li>
            <li>The only complaint would be that the red rose treatment stings my eyes.</li>

            <li> Products promote natural improvement to skin.  Tube is packaged with easy travel size product.  Enclosed chart was most helpful in knowing what to use and when. The only disadvantage was locating where it was sold.  It required contacting the company and them telling me where to locate a supplier in my area.  Very pleased with every item.</li>
