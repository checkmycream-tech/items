            <li>The product is good, but the company is great.</li>
            <li>and it takes a bit to get a good lather going.</li>
            <li>Good way to save those soap slivers.</li>
            <li>and you get a good scrub without being to abrasive.</li>
            <li>and you want to get a good &#x27;scrub&#x27; on those fingernails.</li>

            <li>LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more as we speak!).</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I will purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>It made great lather and it was lightly exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Saves your soap while giving you a nice scrub.</li>
            <li>I repaired it with my own zip tie</li>
            <li>Suds up nice.</li>
            <li>I get a nice lather each shower.</li>
            <li>and I ordered these hoping it was the ones I liked.</li>
            <li>It lathers nice and exfoliates.  </li>
            <li>The colors are nice.</li>
            <li>The bar of soap lasts longer, and works into a nice lather when in use.</li>
            <li>Each has its own time and place.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about having a four pack is that when one wears out, you have another.  </li>
            <li>and I liked having a choice of styles.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li>But now my soap sack is becoming worn out and I needed to find a good replacement.</li>
            <li>I use it for my kids to bath and they get a good clean scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with these mesh soap savers.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for and great price too.</li>
            <li>excellent replacement for same thing worn out.</li>
            <li>if things work well I&#x27;ll be ordering a lot more :)</li>
            <li>Gave many as gifts.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and while some praised it others felt it could have been better.</li>
            <li>I could use a littler more \\&quot;umph\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Then there&#x27;s that issue that many consumers have, you find something that works for you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for about 3 years and love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like using just the bar of soap any more after using one of these.</li>
            <li>These are even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought  these before and give them away to friends who love them also.</li>
            <li>Used to buy these at the container store for about $2 each, so this seemed like a better deal.</li>
            <li>Love these mesh bags for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I bought these last fall and they were great!  </li>
            <li>the version last fall was great!  </li>
            <li>I love these and will buy more once they get all fraid and warn out.</li>
            <li>and I love that they are separate</li>
            <li>and I think they will do much better.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Fill with your favorite soap</li>
            <li>I have bought another brand of these that is better</li>
            <li>These are &#x27;softer&#x27; and I like the ones that are more abrasive.</li>
            <li>Surely does keep me from dropping the soap which is a blessing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll be able to use all 4 though.</li>
            <li>I love the mesh soap saver bag for traveling.  </li>
            <li>and I was purchasing more for the rest of the house.</li>
            <li>It seems the top layer starts to separate at the bottom and</li>
            <li>I love these things but they kept falling apart.</li>
            <li>Many layers of mesh.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>If the colors were prettier, I would buy more for gifts.</li>
            <li>These have too many layers</li>
            <li>I use this product to get the most out of my home made soap.</li>
            <li>AND I ARE BOTH SATISFIED WITH THEM</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I have some made with a thicker mesh purchased in Japan that lather up better.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of these mesh soap savers on my skin and saving the expense of buying cake soap often</li>
            <li>Found anther brand from Aquasenials on Amazon and like these better.  </li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>These are better than body washes.</li>
            <li>I still love soap.</li>
            <li>One problem though, is the drawstring at the top.</li>
            <li>- these have held up much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have paid more for a better product but can&#x27;t seem to find it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(very satisfied)</li>
            <li>My parents use these and they love them</li>
            <li>It sat there for good number of years until I decided when the time was right to use it.</li>
            <li>LOVE the texture, it is very soft and makes a great lather.</li>
            <li>A good value and fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>This leads to better soap performance and significantly increased bar life.   </li>
            <li>It fell apart too easily</li>
            <li>Makes holding a bar of soap in your hand so easy.  </li>
            <li>if they held up longer, they&#x27;d get an A....nice and easy.</li>
            <li>If you need a strong exfoliater, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>The soap savers themselves are fine - they do what they need to do and hold up well.  </li>
            <li>I got them for myself and my mother and they are great at saving that last part of soap</li>
            <li>Thanks for a nice stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>Also, the customer service was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Works great as a way to use up tiny soap fragments that would otherwise be unusable!</li>
            <li>and they immediately sent me another four pack free of charge</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I would have much rather paid more money for better quality.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found them for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought something like this at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>I originally found them at a Dollar Tree Store in 2004 or 2005 in Newport News, Virginia, but have never seen them in Dollar Tree again.  </li>
            <li>and if they weren&#x27;t right I would have heard about it!  :0)</li>
            <li>The 2 being used by my husband and myself have lasted a full year.</li>
            <li>The price is right (cheap) also.</li>
            <li>Needs a little bit more texture, but it is what I ordered and the value is good.</li>
            <li>fell apart rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding out these bags fall apart fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>1 broke fairly quickly but it was used by my 6 year-old son.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as ordered.</li>
            <li>Helps grip the soap and gets really foamy!!  </li>
            <li>Would have liked a little more texture.  </li>
            <li>How could I not have known how useful this item was.</li>
            <li>To my surprise they are smaller than the one I already own.</li>
            <li>I love the lather it makes and the soft exfoliating feel..  </li>
            <li>I expected the bags to have more layers of mesh, but they are okay for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>They are on the soft side, but that can be enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Still a great little money saver!</li>
            <li>Great way to be green!</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re the type that wants something with a littler more scrubbing action; but not to the point of tearing piece of flesh off then this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li>Also the colors are not what I would have liked, white would be so much nicer.</li>
            <li>These work very well and are super inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big man with larger hands, but the string is a great length to put around my wrist.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it worked as well as it should and because the price was also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Material seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li>Bought some more this January, and the size is now much smaller</li>
            <li>and they started coming undone and falling apart the first time they were used.  </li>
            <li>I found the first one I purchased at wal-mart</li>
            <li>The soap bags are as advertised but the first one came apart within a week of me using it.  </li>
            <li>The mesh ripped from the zip tied bottom when i used the 1st soap saver for the first time.</li>
            <li>love these for my Big POSH Chucks</li>
            <li>The netting came undone either just before or just after the first bar of soap was finished.</li>
            <li>I am only writing more so that I can meet the minimum requirements to warn others.</li>
            <li>However, the layers started coming out from the bottom before the first bar of soap was used up.</li>
            <li>This product fell apart after the first use.  </li>
            <li>These work well and provide great lather but do not last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and exactly as described and shown in the photo.  </li>
            <li>Better than your standard soap-on-a-rope</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first one I got fell apart, however.  </li>
            <li>I felt clean and scrubbed but compared to my old one...</li>
            <li>The colors are really pretty, and match my bathroom perfectly, but the first time I used it part of the mesh pulled out of the bottom, making it loose around the soap, so it was really hard to use.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to throw those little soap leftovers away any more!</li>
            <li>The string comes untied too easily, so I have to tie it before I hang it back up.</li>
            <li>Less plastic...just put your bar of nice soap in there</li>
            <li>Good value and last long time.</li>
            <li>A regular size bath soap fits just fine and it lathers a lot.</li>
            <li>These held up as expected but eventually do come loose and must be replaced, all and all a great value.</li>
            <li>They make a good lather with soap even with hard water.   </li>
            <li>I stash all my soap bits and pieces in one or even a whole bar of soap.</li>
            <li>However, this is the only item like this available and if does do the job.   </li>
            <li>They do seem very well assembled.</li>
            <li>This four pack deal was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than liquid body wash.</li>
            <li>Great to use up the last slivers and also big enough to store a whole bar.</li>
            <li>Cheap enough.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of handmade soap and these work really well as exfoliators and to stop the soap from melting or sticking.  </li>
            <li>After I ordered them, we received them very promptly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really blame the breakage on the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>The soap sacks are very convenient.</li>
            <li>But these are too stretchy, can&#x27;t even wash with them because the exterior layer moves too much to scrub the skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need four, so I gave a couple to my mom.  </li>
            <li>After the second use I discovered why they are so cheap on price.  </li>
            <li>I would have been willing to pay a little more for nicer quality materials.</li>
            <li>Stay together better than other brands.  </li>
            <li>The type of rope they use works better than the other brands also.  </li>
            <li>I put several pieces of soap slivers into it and it stretches to accommodate much more or even several whole bars of soap.</li>
            <li>The four I purchased didn&#x27;t last a full two months.</li>
            <li>closed broke on two of the mesh bags requiring an easy replacement of the Cable Tie.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna try melting the plastic mesh to the plastic ring on my second one to keep it from falling apart so quickly.</li>
            <li>However, after using one of these for a week,  these soap savers appear to be of decent quality.</li>
            <li>I get more lather from my soaps with these soap savers, plus I don&#x27;t have the mess of cleaning up from laying soap in a tray.</li>
            <li>Material feels a little more flimsy than a typical loofa or whatnot, but seems like it&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li>But these are not that bad, they&#x27;re perfect for anyone that has sensitive skin or wants to use it on their face.</li>
            <li>I love these, but after a few months, they fall apart.</li>
            <li>They are replacements for my husband, assume the product is working as it is supposed to be as he had not complained - - -</li>
            <li>they are so nice for not having soap scum in the shower.</li>
            <li>Some years ago; walking down the toiletry aisle of my local grocery store, I came across a funny contraption that goes by many names but for the now let&#x27;s just use, \\&quot;soap sack\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love these not only for exfoliating my skin, but use up the soaps that are too small to handle easily and they scrub well enough to act as a cleaning aid when cleaning up the skin; the tub - or removing labels and price tags.  </li>
            <li>Made me feel like a new person.</li>
            <li>I love to use these for all those small pieces of soap that end up breaking off when your bar is at the end.  </li>
            <li>(Most people go ahead and replace them, but I usually forget or get distracted when I&#x27;m shopping.</li>
            <li>The third one I&#x27;m on didn&#x27;t break, and it works pretty well now.</li>
            <li>The first one out of the package fell apart on the second day.  </li>
            <li>I just throw a new bar into the soap saver and the new bar and the old bar</li>
            <li>Nice to see a product that is hard to find in stores, product could probably use a little thicker material so is softer and &amp;#34;foams&amp;#34; more but overall works well.</li>
            <li>the bag is too small to fit a large size bar of soap</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap if they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>I put mine in a zip-lock bag if it is not dry when I am ready to move on.  </li>
            <li>The mesh on these are a little finer than I like, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>But the scrubbing experience is kind of \\&quot;weak sauce\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating the item four stars instead of five because they seem to be a little on the cheap side.</li>
            <li>A myriad of uses - great for dirty hands after working with greasy product or painting</li>
            <li>They are really soft against the skin...</li>
            <li>Fast forward to 2013, when I&#x27;d finally use it the way it was meant to be used.</li>
            <li>I think the issue lies in the material that it&#x27;s too soft</li>
            <li>These scrubbers are so soft they have no exfoliating properties at all.  </li>
            <li>You bar of soap last so much longer</li>
            <li>Not too abrasive,,,,,,, kinda soft.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t hold up a month without completely falling apart.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I really like them and use them daily.</li>
            <li>Fabric is soft but not too soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old fashion...</li>
            <li>My young son tends to go through bars of soap about 3 a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a keeper so far.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t last long but still well worth it</li>
            <li>I will be the first to tell you that these will not last forever (nor do I want them to (gross!)).</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and it really saves the soap from melting.  </li>
            <li>It has a plastic tie which, can really hurt if your soaping up (think scratching a very sensitive part of your body with sharp plastic).</li>
            <li>There are other products that are much more sturdy than this little thing.</li>
            <li>The cost a little more but the other brand are thicker.  </li>
            <li>first one didnt last long before it came apart!</li>
            <li>They are really thin, too soft to really scrub, and they fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using bar soaps because of the messy gunk left behind...difficult to clean off the shower or tub soap holder...</li>
            <li>If you just want a little exfoliation for sensitive skin, this works pretty well for that.</li>
            <li>There I just roll the mesh back a bit and rub the soap directly on the clothes.</li>
            <li>I had the same experience that others have called out and the bags would fall completely apart in the span of a week or 10 days.</li>
            <li>Bar soap is a lot cheaper and seems to go farther than liquid soap, but who wants the mess that bar soaps can leave in your tub/shower?</li>

            <li> Item as stated and very nice mesh.</li>
            <li> Was very happy when I was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice Product!</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the company is great.</li>
            <li> and it takes a bit to get a good lather going.</li>
            <li> Good way to save those soap slivers.</li>
            <li> and you get a good scrub without being to abrasive.</li>
            <li> and you want to get a good &#x27;scrub&#x27; on those fingernails.</li>
            <li> Well built, great quality, nice colors.</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> plus they do a good job of exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Still good though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for travel and the four pack here is a pretty good</li>
            <li> Love it and great price</li>
            <li> Perfect - it came timely and looks exactly like the picture&lt;</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more as we speak!).</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> I will purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It made great lather and it was lightly exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Saves your soap while giving you a nice scrub.</li>
            <li> I repaired it with my own zip tie</li>
            <li> Suds up nice.</li>
            <li> I get a nice lather each shower.</li>
            <li> and I ordered these hoping it was the ones I liked.</li>
            <li> It lathers nice and exfoliates.  </li>
            <li> The colors are nice.</li>
            <li> The bar of soap lasts longer, and works into a nice lather when in use.</li>
            <li> Each has its own time and place.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about having a four pack is that when one wears out, you have another.  </li>
            <li> and I liked having a choice of styles.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> But now my soap sack is becoming worn out and I needed to find a good replacement.</li>
            <li> I use it for my kids to bath and they get a good clean scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with these mesh soap savers.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for and great price too.</li>
            <li> excellent replacement for same thing worn out.</li>
            <li> if things work well I&#x27;ll be ordering a lot more :)</li>
            <li> Gave many as gifts.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and while some praised it others felt it could have been better.</li>
            <li> I could use a littler more \\&quot;umph\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Then there&#x27;s that issue that many consumers have, you find something that works for you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 3 years and love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like using just the bar of soap any more after using one of these.</li>
            <li> These are even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought  these before and give them away to friends who love them also.</li>
            <li> Used to buy these at the container store for about $2 each, so this seemed like a better deal.</li>
            <li> Love these mesh bags for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I bought these last fall and they were great!  </li>
            <li> the version last fall was great!  </li>
            <li> I love these and will buy more once they get all fraid and warn out.</li>
            <li> and I love that they are separate</li>
            <li> and I think they will do much better.  </li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Fill with your favorite soap</li>
            <li> I have bought another brand of these that is better</li>
            <li> These are &#x27;softer&#x27; and I like the ones that are more abrasive.</li>
            <li> Surely does keep me from dropping the soap which is a blessing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll be able to use all 4 though.</li>
            <li> I love the mesh soap saver bag for traveling.  </li>
            <li> and I was purchasing more for the rest of the house.</li>
            <li> It seems the top layer starts to separate at the bottom and</li>
            <li> I love these things but they kept falling apart.</li>
            <li> Many layers of mesh.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> If the colors were prettier, I would buy more for gifts.</li>
            <li> These have too many layers</li>
            <li> I use this product to get the most out of my home made soap.</li>
            <li> AND I ARE BOTH SATISFIED WITH THEM</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I have some made with a thicker mesh purchased in Japan that lather up better.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of these mesh soap savers on my skin and saving the expense of buying cake soap often</li>
            <li> Found anther brand from Aquasenials on Amazon and like these better.  </li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> These are better than body washes.</li>
            <li> I still love soap.</li>
            <li> One problem though, is the drawstring at the top.</li>
            <li> - these have held up much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have paid more for a better product but can&#x27;t seem to find it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(very satisfied)</li>
            <li> My parents use these and they love them</li>
            <li> It sat there for good number of years until I decided when the time was right to use it.</li>
            <li> LOVE the texture, it is very soft and makes a great lather.</li>
            <li> A good value and fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> This leads to better soap performance and significantly increased bar life.   </li>
            <li> It fell apart too easily</li>
            <li> Makes holding a bar of soap in your hand so easy.  </li>
            <li> if they held up longer, they&#x27;d get an A....nice and easy.</li>
            <li> If you need a strong exfoliater, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> The soap savers themselves are fine - they do what they need to do and hold up well.  </li>
            <li> I got them for myself and my mother and they are great at saving that last part of soap</li>
            <li> Thanks for a nice stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Also, the customer service was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Works great as a way to use up tiny soap fragments that would otherwise be unusable!</li>
            <li> and they immediately sent me another four pack free of charge</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I would have much rather paid more money for better quality.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found them for such a great price.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought something like this at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I originally found them at a Dollar Tree Store in 2004 or 2005 in Newport News, Virginia, but have never seen them in Dollar Tree again.  </li>
            <li> and if they weren&#x27;t right I would have heard about it!  :0)</li>
            <li> The 2 being used by my husband and myself have lasted a full year.</li>
            <li> The price is right (cheap) also.</li>
            <li> Needs a little bit more texture, but it is what I ordered and the value is good.</li>
            <li> fell apart rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding out these bags fall apart fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> 1 broke fairly quickly but it was used by my 6 year-old son.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as ordered.</li>
            <li> Helps grip the soap and gets really foamy!!  </li>
            <li> Would have liked a little more texture.  </li>
            <li> How could I not have known how useful this item was.</li>
            <li> To my surprise they are smaller than the one I already own.</li>
            <li> I love the lather it makes and the soft exfoliating feel..  </li>
            <li> I expected the bags to have more layers of mesh, but they are okay for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> They are on the soft side, but that can be enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Still a great little money saver!</li>
            <li> Great way to be green!</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re the type that wants something with a littler more scrubbing action; but not to the point of tearing piece of flesh off then this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> Also the colors are not what I would have liked, white would be so much nicer.</li>
            <li> These work very well and are super inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big man with larger hands, but the string is a great length to put around my wrist.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it worked as well as it should and because the price was also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Material seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li> Bought some more this January, and the size is now much smaller</li>
            <li> and they started coming undone and falling apart the first time they were used.  </li>
            <li> I found the first one I purchased at wal-mart</li>
            <li> The soap bags are as advertised but the first one came apart within a week of me using it.  </li>
            <li> The mesh ripped from the zip tied bottom when i used the 1st soap saver for the first time.</li>
            <li> love these for my Big POSH Chucks</li>
            <li> The netting came undone either just before or just after the first bar of soap was finished.</li>
            <li> I am only writing more so that I can meet the minimum requirements to warn others.</li>
            <li> However, the layers started coming out from the bottom before the first bar of soap was used up.</li>
            <li> This product fell apart after the first use.  </li>
            <li> These work well and provide great lather but do not last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and exactly as described and shown in the photo.  </li>
            <li> Better than your standard soap-on-a-rope</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first one I got fell apart, however.  </li>
            <li> I felt clean and scrubbed but compared to my old one...</li>
            <li> The colors are really pretty, and match my bathroom perfectly, but the first time I used it part of the mesh pulled out of the bottom, making it loose around the soap, so it was really hard to use.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to throw those little soap leftovers away any more!</li>
            <li> The string comes untied too easily, so I have to tie it before I hang it back up.</li>
            <li> Less plastic...just put your bar of nice soap in there</li>
            <li> Good value and last long time.</li>
            <li> A regular size bath soap fits just fine and it lathers a lot.</li>
            <li> These held up as expected but eventually do come loose and must be replaced, all and all a great value.</li>
            <li> They make a good lather with soap even with hard water.   </li>
            <li> I stash all my soap bits and pieces in one or even a whole bar of soap.</li>
            <li> However, this is the only item like this available and if does do the job.   </li>
            <li> They do seem very well assembled.</li>
            <li> This four pack deal was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than liquid body wash.</li>
            <li> Great to use up the last slivers and also big enough to store a whole bar.</li>
            <li> Cheap enough.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of handmade soap and these work really well as exfoliators and to stop the soap from melting or sticking.  </li>
            <li> After I ordered them, we received them very promptly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really blame the breakage on the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The soap sacks are very convenient.</li>
            <li> But these are too stretchy, can&#x27;t even wash with them because the exterior layer moves too much to scrub the skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need four, so I gave a couple to my mom.  </li>
            <li> After the second use I discovered why they are so cheap on price.  </li>
            <li> I would have been willing to pay a little more for nicer quality materials.</li>
            <li> Stay together better than other brands.  </li>
            <li> The type of rope they use works better than the other brands also.  </li>
            <li> I put several pieces of soap slivers into it and it stretches to accommodate much more or even several whole bars of soap.</li>
            <li> The four I purchased didn&#x27;t last a full two months.</li>
            <li> closed broke on two of the mesh bags requiring an easy replacement of the Cable Tie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try melting the plastic mesh to the plastic ring on my second one to keep it from falling apart so quickly.</li>
            <li> However, after using one of these for a week,  these soap savers appear to be of decent quality.</li>
            <li> I get more lather from my soaps with these soap savers, plus I don&#x27;t have the mess of cleaning up from laying soap in a tray.</li>
            <li> Material feels a little more flimsy than a typical loofa or whatnot, but seems like it&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li> But these are not that bad, they&#x27;re perfect for anyone that has sensitive skin or wants to use it on their face.</li>
            <li> I love these, but after a few months, they fall apart.</li>
            <li> They are replacements for my husband, assume the product is working as it is supposed to be as he had not complained - - -</li>
            <li> they are so nice for not having soap scum in the shower.</li>
            <li> Some years ago; walking down the toiletry aisle of my local grocery store, I came across a funny contraption that goes by many names but for the now let&#x27;s just use, \\&quot;soap sack\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love these not only for exfoliating my skin, but use up the soaps that are too small to handle easily and they scrub well enough to act as a cleaning aid when cleaning up the skin; the tub - or removing labels and price tags.  </li>
            <li> Made me feel like a new person.</li>
            <li> I love to use these for all those small pieces of soap that end up breaking off when your bar is at the end.  </li>
            <li> (Most people go ahead and replace them, but I usually forget or get distracted when I&#x27;m shopping.</li>
            <li> The third one I&#x27;m on didn&#x27;t break, and it works pretty well now.</li>
            <li> The first one out of the package fell apart on the second day.  </li>
            <li> I just throw a new bar into the soap saver and the new bar and the old bar</li>
            <li> Nice to see a product that is hard to find in stores, product could probably use a little thicker material so is softer and &amp;#34;foams&amp;#34; more but overall works well.</li>
            <li> the bag is too small to fit a large size bar of soap</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap if they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I put mine in a zip-lock bag if it is not dry when I am ready to move on.  </li>
            <li> The mesh on these are a little finer than I like, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> But the scrubbing experience is kind of \\&quot;weak sauce\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating the item four stars instead of five because they seem to be a little on the cheap side.</li>
            <li> A myriad of uses - great for dirty hands after working with greasy product or painting</li>
            <li> They are really soft against the skin...</li>
            <li> Fast forward to 2013, when I&#x27;d finally use it the way it was meant to be used.</li>
            <li> I think the issue lies in the material that it&#x27;s too soft</li>
            <li> These scrubbers are so soft they have no exfoliating properties at all.  </li>
            <li> You bar of soap last so much longer</li>
            <li> Not too abrasive,,,,,,, kinda soft.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t hold up a month without completely falling apart.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I really like them and use them daily.</li>
            <li> Fabric is soft but not too soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old fashion...</li>
            <li> My young son tends to go through bars of soap about 3 a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a keeper so far.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last long but still well worth it</li>
            <li> I will be the first to tell you that these will not last forever (nor do I want them to (gross!)).</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and it really saves the soap from melting.  </li>
            <li> It has a plastic tie which, can really hurt if your soaping up (think scratching a very sensitive part of your body with sharp plastic).</li>
            <li> There are other products that are much more sturdy than this little thing.</li>
            <li> The cost a little more but the other brand are thicker.  </li>
            <li> first one didnt last long before it came apart!</li>
            <li> They are really thin, too soft to really scrub, and they fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using bar soaps because of the messy gunk left behind...difficult to clean off the shower or tub soap holder...</li>
            <li> If you just want a little exfoliation for sensitive skin, this works pretty well for that.</li>
            <li> There I just roll the mesh back a bit and rub the soap directly on the clothes.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience that others have called out and the bags would fall completely apart in the span of a week or 10 days.</li>
            <li> Bar soap is a lot cheaper and seems to go farther than liquid soap, but who wants the mess that bar soaps can leave in your tub/shower?</li>
            <li> Nice for finally doing something with all those small pieces of soap too small to wash with and too many to discard without feeling like a bad enviromental steward.</li>
            <li> Really functional to use as an exfoliating scrub or to collect and use small pieces of soap up.  </li>
            <li> I had a different one that I cannot find again that lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last too long before they start to unravel, but I like using them to efficiently use soap shards.</li>
            <li> However, these don&#x27;t last even that long.</li>
            <li> They do the trick but don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> These are fantastic for bathing, no more bits of soap wasted and it feels wondeful against your skin as you bath!</li>
            <li> In their quest to make more money, they have cheapened the product so much that it&#x27;s worthless now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m actually going to use these little guys for because I rarely use bar soap.  </li>
            <li> This can be difficult to find in my local stores and I was excited to see them online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy, but I love these things.</li>
            <li> I also ordered two sets of assorted colors and ended up with six pink and two blue.</li>
            <li> I modified the last batch by turning them inside out, sewing the end closed with a needle and thread, and turning them rightside out.</li>
            <li> The closure stays closed and leaves enough string to hang it if you want to.</li>
            <li> There is a plastic ring that holds the bag closed and the layers are starting to slip out of mine.  </li>
            <li> I secured the bottom of the bag with a hair tie and kept using it, but eventually that stopped working since the material stretched out.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for these for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was using a more expensive cloth mess bag where the soap would NOT stay in.</li>
            <li> They have lasted a really long time!</li>
            <li> I was a tad reluctant to make this purchase due to the very low price.</li>
            <li> a little to thin and cheaply made</li>
            <li> The way they hang allows the soap to dry thoroughly betweens uses.</li>
            <li> I like the mesh as it helps to scrub away dirt and dry</li>
            <li> For me personally these were not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s either poorly made or the company that made the first one went out of business.</li>
            <li> The zip tie at the bottom tore loose.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it exfoliate the skin, but it stays lathered up and keeps my soap from turning into a gooey mess.</li>
            <li> I hate having to add more words when I am through saying what I want to say !</li>
            <li> I purchased a different type (also from Amazon) that are little rougher that I use on my feet and elbows</li>
            <li> Never holds it closed.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not what I expected did not work to my expectations</li>
            <li> Plus mine is starting to come apart after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Not as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The bottom pulls out after only using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall apart like other ones I have bought.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks of use, the outer layers have come undone and stretched out rendering them unusable.  </li>
            <li> The little plastic clasp that they use to hold the bottom closed</li>
            <li> Hard to find similar product in retail store.</li>
            <li> I get so angry when I loose a new bar of soap because the crappy thing just falls apart while i&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Not worth the bye</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more annoying than finding little soap chips on the shower.</li>
            <li> Keeps my artisan soaps less soggy as every shower  my family takes doesnt soak em</li>
            <li> Therefore, before I use a new one, I always turn it wrong side out and sew across the bottom with my sewing machine to reinforce it.  </li>
            <li> The material is woven a little tighter</li>
            <li> They seem a little courser, might be my memory, but seem sturdier.</li>
            <li> Holds bits and pieces of soap bars so that you can use up every little bit of soap.</li>
            <li> I like the little slip lock that keeps the soap</li>
            <li> And I can use ever bit of soap without having to deal with that pesky little speck of soap when you get to the end of the bar.</li>
            <li> You can save those little bits of hotel soap.  </li>
            <li> Also have one in my home shower for those little pieces of soap</li>
            <li> Not too harsh but a little invigorating.</li>
            <li> They do eventually fall apart but for near daily use for two months, not too bad.  </li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t go to waste, so it saves money again.</li>
            <li> (I picked the green.)</li>
            <li> well contained, no more gunk left behind and it doesn&#x27;t fall apart like some mesh bags do after a week of use...</li>
            <li> These mesh soap savers were a little lighter weight than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> and it lasted an incredibly long time but eventually wore thin.  </li>
            <li> No more slippery soap or wasted soap.</li>
            <li> does what it should, holds soap, but doesnt last long before it fails!</li>
            <li> Sometimes, it&#x27;s a little hard to get a lather going, though.</li>
            <li> Plus you put your small pieces of soap in side it</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> These do the trick though of using up small bits of soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about them being small.</li>
            <li> We use these to save our small pieces of soap.  </li>
            <li> Once a month I toss it in a small mesh laundry bag with my laundry and it hasn&#x27;t broken down or lost it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> Hard to get lather up &amp; feels like using a brillo pad on your skin.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the soap lather through.</li>
            <li> They are soft enough to not be terribly exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> and we now have no more soap chips laying around!</li>
            <li> (except for hair...that&#x27;s pretty annoying and creepy too).</li>
            <li> The soap savers uses chap quality mesh, and they are poorly made.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t terrible, but when you want to put in a new bar of soap, they want to just come unraveled.</li>
            <li> I give this a four because the reddish colors are dull and ugly.  </li>
            <li> Bottom closure failed after I used it about 4 times.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought 2 packs.  </li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that there were not at least one each of four colors.</li>
            <li> Too bad...</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The quality is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> When I did the price was outrageous.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent replacement for same thing worn out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE!! You don&#x27;t have to throw those little soap leftovers away any more! Just stick it in the pouch and voila! They are really soft against the skin...buy them you wont regret!</li>
            <li> Perfect - it came timely and looks exactly like the picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered several for my hand made soaps I hope to sell&lt;br /&gt;So if things work well I&#x27;ll be ordering a lot more :)</li>
            <li> Good value and last long time. Hard to find similar product in retail store. Gave many as gifts.</li>
            <li> These work so well! It is great for my skin and we now have no more soap chips laying around!</li>
            <li> Some years ago; walking down the toiletry aisle of my local grocery store, I came across a funny contraption that goes by many names but for the now let&#x27;s just use, \\&quot;soap sack\\&quot;. I bought it on a whim, took it home and tossed it under the cabinet. It sat there for good number of years until I decided when the time was right to use it. After coming back into my fitness phases I eventually broke it out. How could I not have known how useful this item was. Fast forward to 2013, when I&#x27;d finally use it the way it was meant to be used. Saves your soap while giving you a nice scrub. Made me feel like a new person. But now my soap sack is becoming worn out and I needed to find a good replacement. So I happened across this set. I read the reviews and while some praised it others felt it could have been better. So I decided to  purchased them. I got them in yesterday. To my surprise they are smaller than the one I already own. The material is woven a little tighter but it&#x27;s not as coarse. So I decided to try one of them out last night. I didn&#x27;t see any flaws and the soap fits with no problem. But the scrubbing experience is kind of \\&quot;weak sauce\\&quot;. I felt clean and scrubbed but compared to my old one... I could use a littler more \\&quot;umph\\&quot;. I think the issue lies in the material that it&#x27;s too soft and it takes a bit to get a good lather going. Then there&#x27;s that issue that many consumers have, you find something that works for you and then when it&#x27;s time to find a replacement, you find one but it doesn&#x27;t replicate the same usage. Because it&#x27;s either poorly made or the company that made the first one went out of business. Yep, we&#x27;ve all been there. But these are not that bad, they&#x27;re perfect for anyone that has sensitive skin or wants to use it on their face. Heck, even a kid can use it. But if you&#x27;re the type that wants something with a littler more scrubbing action; but not to the point of tearing piece of flesh off then this is not the one for you. So you decide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 3 years and love them. I stash all my soap bits and pieces in one or even a whole bar of soap. they exfoliate great and lather up real good. I run through one about every three to five months, but then I use them daily. For the price you can&#x27;t expect them to last forever. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer. Don&#x27;t like using just the bar of soap any more after using one of these. I tried two that were made of different material but prefer this type.</li>
            <li> These scrubbers are so soft they have no exfoliating properties at all.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It fell apart too easily</li>
            <li> Holding up after a month. Keeps my artisan soaps less soggy as every shower  my family takes doesnt soak em</li>
            <li> Hard to get lather up &amp; feels like using a brillo pad on your skin.</li>
            <li> I get more lather from my soaps with these soap savers, plus I don&#x27;t have the mess of cleaning up from laying soap in a tray.</li>
            <li> I love these, but after a few months, they fall apart. They are so neat, I fix them and keep using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with these mesh soap savers. They make a good lather with soap even with hard water.   The way they hang allows the soap to dry thoroughly betweens uses. This leads to better soap performance and significantly increased bar life.   I&#x27;m rating the item four stars instead of five because they seem to be a little on the cheap side. I would have been willing to pay a little more for nicer quality materials. However, this is the only item like this available and if does do the job.   I also ordered two sets of assorted colors and ended up with six pink and two blue. I&#x27;m disappointed that there were not at least one each of four colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for a while. BBB, Target, etc. I&#x27;d had a similar product about 10 years ago and missed using it. These are even better. They seem a little courser, might be my memory, but seem sturdier. I just wish they had different colored slide beads or something so family members could tell them apart.&lt;br /&gt;Since I ordered the multipac the vendor has started making the mesh bags various colors so either they heard my review or had already decided the same thng. Since they didn&#x27;t color the beads they probably had already made this change it just hadn&#x27;t been implemented when I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I love the lather it makes and the soft exfoliating feel..  Makes holding a bar of soap in your hand so easy.  Hangs up with string helps drain it for the next use.  I&#x27;ve bought  these before and give them away to friends who love them also.</li>
            <li> Bottom closure failed after I used it about 4 times.  I had to find a way to close it.</li>
            <li> Keeps all my sons soaps separate.</li>
            <li> hubby likes. Helps grip the soap and gets really foamy!!  I hate having to add more words when I am through saying what I want to say ! ;)</li>
            <li> So far so good. Used to buy these at the container store for about $2 each, so this seemed like a better deal. Material feels a little more flimsy than a typical loofa or whatnot, but seems like it&#x27;ll be okay. They&#x27;re cheap if they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  They are soft enough to not be terribly exfoliating.  I got them for myself and my mother and they are great at saving that last part of soap so it does not have to be thrown away.  Saves money.</li>
            <li> Well I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough...so I shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.  I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m actually going to use these little guys for because I rarely use bar soap.  They do seem very well assembled.</li>
            <li> These soap savers are a great way to save on body wash by using soap in it&#x27;s entirety.  They do fall apart after a month or two but at around a buck a piece they are a great value.  Great for travel too.</li>
            <li> It is excellent for washing with and reduces the number of wash rags in the laundry.  Plus you put your small pieces of soap in side it and they don&#x27;t go to waste, so it saves money again.</li>
            <li> Love these mesh bags for use in the shower.  Holds bits and pieces of soap bars so that you can use up every little bit of soap.</li>
            <li> fell apart rather quickly.  The plastic ring used to home the ends together is totally inaffective.  I&#x27;m embarrassed.  I gave them as gifts!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s started to come apart after just a couple of weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy, but I love these things. Good way to save those soap slivers. Material seems pretty durable. Not too harsh but a little invigorating. The white cord started to fray a bit but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I bought these last fall and they were great!  Bought some more this January, and the size is now much smaller and they started coming undone and falling apart the first time they were used.  In their quest to make more money, they have cheapened the product so much that it&#x27;s worthless now.  Too bad...the version last fall was great!  I hope they revert back to their originaly quality design.</li>
            <li> I love these and will buy more once they get all fraid and warn out. They have lasted a really long time! You bar of soap last so much longer and you get a good scrub without being to abrasive. LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> The string comes untied too easily, so I have to tie it before I hang it back up. Also, the mesh doesn&#x27;t exfoliate well. I have had mesh soap savers before, but these must be lower quality. I didn&#x27;t care for them.</li>
            <li> These things help make soap last longer. Sometimes, it&#x27;s a little hard to get a lather going, though. Still a great little money saver!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used these things before they are great.  I found the first one I purchased at wal-mart and it lasted an incredibly long time but eventually wore thin.  I looked on amazon to see if I could find them and you can&#x27;t beat the price for a 4-pack.  I use one for my soap and one for soap for my feet and I love that they are separate, I&#x27;ve also given these as stocking stuffers and everyone loves them.</li>
            <li> The soap bags are as advertised but the first one came apart within a week of me using it.  The zip tie at the bottom tore loose.  I repaired it with my own zip tie but they shouldn&#x27;t fall apart after 5 or 6 showers.  I am reinforcing the others with another heavier zip tie before use and I think they will do much better.  The one I repaired is still doing well after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love these! just wish I could find them in the stores. But I now have extra&#x27;s</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for bathing, no more bits of soap wasted and it feels wondeful against your skin as you bath!</li>
            <li> Love these. I was using a more expensive cloth mess bag where the soap would NOT stay in. Here you get 4 and pay less.&lt;br /&gt;_ I like the mesh as it helps to scrub away dirt and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;_ I like the little slip lock that keeps the soap in.&lt;br /&gt;_ I also like the different colors as I use them for different laundry soaps as well. There I just roll the mesh back a bit and rub the soap directly on the clothes. Keeps the hands from getting all slippery.&lt;br /&gt;_ I bought extras cuz they will make a low cost stocking stuffer. (Or wedding gift)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hang Tuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Joe</li>
            <li> I love these not only for exfoliating my skin, but use up the soaps that are too small to handle easily and they scrub well enough to act as a cleaning aid when cleaning up the skin; the tub - or removing labels and price tags.  A myriad of uses - great for dirty hands after working with greasy product or painting and you want to get a good &#x27;scrub&#x27; on those fingernails.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised Thank You</li>
            <li> Needs a little bit more texture, but it is what I ordered and the value is good. Have been looking for these in stores and could not find them.</li>
            <li> The soap savers uses chap quality mesh, and they are poorly made. The mesh ripped from the zip tied bottom when i used the 1st soap saver for the first time. I thought it may be a defective product. However, all 4 of them ripped after 1st or 2nd use! What a waste of my money! Do not buy it!</li>
            <li> Will not be buying again. I was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to purchase soon because there were four to begin with but they are falling apart.</li>
            <li> I originally bought something like this at Wal-Mart. This four pack deal was much cheaper. I use Dove soap, and each bar of soap lasts me longer than a month! Much cheaper than liquid body wash. Suds up nice. I get a nice lather each shower. And I can use ever bit of soap without having to deal with that pesky little speck of soap when you get to the end of the bar. I just throw a new bar into the soap saver and the new bar and the old bar kinda mush together!!!</li>
            <li> Not too abrasive,,,,,,, kinda soft.  Would have liked a little more texture.  Fill with your favorite soap and it is a great shower tool.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these but they will served their purpose of holding leftover soap bars. I have bought another brand of these that is better and I ordered these hoping it was the ones I liked. These are &#x27;softer&#x27; and I like the ones that are more abrasive. These don&#x27;t even feel as abrasive as a washcloth in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Surely does keep me from dropping the soap which is a blessing. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll be able to use all 4 though.</li>
            <li> Nice to see a product that is hard to find in stores, product could probably use a little thicker material so is softer and &amp;#34;foams&amp;#34; more but overall works well.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 of the 4 I purchased and the bottom of both fell out within 2 weeks usage.</li>
            <li> I love to use these for all those small pieces of soap that end up breaking off when your bar is at the end.  It lathers nice and exfoliates.  Great way to be green!</li>
            <li> I love the mesh soap saver bag for traveling.  You can save those little bits of hotel soap.  It provides both the soap and \\&quot;wash cloth\\&quot;.  I put mine in a zip-lock bag if it is not dry when I am ready to move on.  They make great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> love these for my Big POSH Chucks</li>
            <li> They look just as described can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> great product! I use it for my kids to bath and they get a good clean scrub.</li>
            <li> The little plastic clasp that they use to hold the bottom closed Never holds it closed. I brought the 4 pack and only got 1 use out of 3 of them. the last on lasted for a week.  There are other products that are much more sturdy than this little thing. I take it to the gym. I get so angry when I loose a new bar of soap because the crappy thing just falls apart while i&#x27;m using it. No Bueno!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> great deal on the mesh soap bags , my son loves to use them in the shower! Thanks for a nice stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I expected the bags to have more layers of mesh, but they are okay for my purposes.  The colors are nice.</li>
            <li> The netting came undone either just before or just after the first bar of soap was finished. I went on to buy another brand that did not have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Poorest quality possible. My sister had given me one that literally lasted years and I was purchasing more for the rest of the house. They didn&#x27;t hold up a month without completely falling apart.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time.  They are replacements for my husband, assume the product is working as it is supposed to be as he had not complained - - - and if they weren&#x27;t right I would have heard about it!  :0)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding out these bags fall apart fairly quickly.  It seems the top layer starts to separate at the bottom and then another and another.  I had a different one that I cannot find again that lasted a long time.  Also the colors are not what I would have liked, white would be so much nicer.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last too long before they start to unravel, but I like using them to efficiently use soap shards.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar item at Walgreens months ago and then could not find them again.  These are well made and seem durable to me.  Both my husband and I really like them and use them daily.</li>
            <li> Well built, great quality, nice colors. Lathers very nice. Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not what I expected did not work to my expectations and I would not buy this product again</li>
            <li> I love these things but they kept falling apart. I modified the last batch by turning them inside out, sewing the end closed with a needle and thread, and turning them rightside out. Now they last LONGER without falling apart.</li>
            <li> Really functional to use as an exfoliating scrub or to collect and use small pieces of soap up.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase.  These are great bags.  Used for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Great keeps soap from getting soggy.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> they are so nice for not having soap scum in the shower. The bar of soap lasts longer, and works into a nice lather when in use.</li>
            <li> Many layers of mesh. Hard to get the soap lather through.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It lasts a long time and it really saves the soap from melting.  It is definitely worth the investment.  I work out at the gym 5 to 6 days per work and this is the idea Soap Saver for my soap.  I can just hang it on the wall hanger when I am through and there are no germs on my Soap Saver.  If you forget your shower sponge, you can use this bag.  I won&#x27;t buy anything else to put my soap in.  The string works perfectly as well.  Without  a doubt, what a winner for the durability and price!</li>
            <li> A great find! The soap bags are perfect, tho the colors are not the best. I give this a four because the reddish colors are dull and ugly.  However, the bags themselves are just what I wanted. Fabric is soft but not too soft. The closure stays closed and leaves enough string to hang it if you want to. A regular size bath soap fits just fine and it lathers a lot. If the colors were prettier, I would buy more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these in the package 4 or 5 times and the mesh has already ripped from the gathered part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using one and my hubby is using one. These have too many layers so they don&#x27;t lather as well as others we have had. Plus mine is starting to come apart after a few weeks of use.  There is a plastic ring that holds the bag closed and the layers are starting to slip out of mine.  I&#x27;m gonna try melting the plastic mesh to the plastic ring on my second one to keep it from falling apart so quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent job delivering just what we where looking for!!</li>
            <li> I was a tad reluctant to make this purchase due to the very low price. However, after using one of these for a week,  these soap savers appear to be of decent quality.</li>
            <li> The quality is AWFUL. They fall apart. Enough said. I am only writing more so that I can meet the minimum requirements to warn others.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  Softer than others, doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin.  Stay together better than other brands.  The type of rope they use works better than the other brands also.  I will buy again!!</li>
            <li> My mom stocked my bathroom with one of these when I came to visit. What a perfect idea. Not only does it exfoliate the skin, but it stays lathered up and keeps my soap from turning into a gooey mess. I bought these for all my house mates as well. There&#x27;s nothing more annoying than finding little soap chips on the shower. (except for hair...that&#x27;s pretty annoying and creepy too). We no longer have a soap dish in the bathroom.  When my soap gets low, I just add another bar. The draw string bead keeps the soap inside the pouch while it lathers. I spray mine with white vinegar at the end of my shower because I&#x27;m a freak about bacteria. Once a month I toss it in a small mesh laundry bag with my laundry and it hasn&#x27;t broken down or lost it&#x27;s shape. (Most people go ahead and replace them, but I usually forget or get distracted when I&#x27;m shopping. LOL... not now though. I&#x27;m buying more as we speak!). I&#x27;ve also painted the bead with nail polish to distinguish between them incase someone has a duplicate color pouch. It&#x27;s perfect for travel and the four pack here is a pretty good deal- comes to about $2 a piece when you include S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> I use this product to get the most out of my home made soap. Great to use up the last slivers and also big enough to store a whole bar. Great to hang in the shower</li>
            <li> For sanitary reasons, I believe you are supposed to replace loofas/sponges every month. However, these don&#x27;t last even that long. They are really thin, too soft to really scrub, and they fall apart quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> LOVE the texture, it is very soft and makes a great lather. However, the layers started coming out from the bottom before the first bar of soap was used up.</li>
            <li> Love these! Cheap enough. Don&#x27;t fall apart like other ones I have bought.</li>
            <li> They work.  What else need to be said.</li>
            <li> This product fell apart after the first use.  So no I don&#x27;t recommend it.  I had to make shift away to keep the soap from falling out of the bottom by using a rubber band and praying that it stays.</li>
            <li> THESE MESH SOAP SAVERS ARE EXCELLENT FOR PUTTING BARS OF SOAP OR SLIVERS OF SOAP IN THE POUCH AND THEN USE THE SAVERS AS A WASHCLOTH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY MOTHER AND I ARE BOTH SATISFIED WITH THEM</li>
            <li> These work okay. I have some made with a thicker mesh purchased in Japan that lather up better. These do the trick though of using up small bits of soap.</li>
            <li> ..!!Not worth the bye they fall apart</li>
            <li> I use a lot of handmade soap and these work really well as exfoliators and to stop the soap from melting or sticking.  I can&#x27;t seem to find them in any stores.</li>
            <li> The colors are really pretty, and match my bathroom perfectly, but the first time I used it part of the mesh pulled out of the bottom, making it loose around the soap, so it was really hard to use. I then switched it out with another one, and that one broke in the same fashion. The third one I&#x27;m on didn&#x27;t break, and it works pretty well now. If you need a strong exfoliater, this isn&#x27;t it. If you just want a little exfoliation for sensitive skin, this works pretty well for that. I just wish two didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> These work well and provide great lather but do not last a long time.  Within a few weeks of use, the outer layers have come undone and stretched out rendering them unusable.  I secured the bottom of the bag with a hair tie and kept using it, but eventually that stopped working since the material stretched out.</li>
            <li> the bag is too small to fit a large size bar of soap</li>
            <li> These soap saver bags work great.  My family loves them.  Also, the customer service was fantastic.  After I ordered them, we received them very promptly.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected.  Very thin.</li>
            <li> 1 broke fairly quickly but it was used by my 6 year-old son.  I can&#x27;t really blame the breakage on the manufacturer.  The 2 being used by my husband and myself have lasted a full year.</li>
            <li> These things are great!  No more slippery soap or wasted soap.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to get away from buying shower gels. Less plastic...just put your bar of nice soap in there and you are set. The mesh on these are a little finer than I like, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Even though these soap sacks are not too durable, I like them and I will continue to purchase them.  The bottom pulls out after only using it a few times.  Therefore, before I use a new one, I always turn it wrong side out and sew across the bottom with my sewing machine to reinforce it.  The soap sacks are very convenient.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of these mesh soap savers on my skin and saving the expense of buying cake soap often</li>
            <li> They are only held together by a zip tie at the end. They started falling apart after about 4-5 uses each.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last long but still well worth it</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the one I have been using. (I picked the green.) I haven&#x27;t had any problem with the construction or the bead closure. I don&#x27;t know about them being small. They&#x27;re big enough for my soap, so that&#x27;s all that matters to me. They are on the soft side, but that can be enjoyable. I purchased a different type (also from Amazon) that are little rougher that I use on my feet and elbows and it is very nice also. Each has its own time and place. Will buy again to give as gift with my homemade soap.</li>
            <li> Item as stated and very nice mesh.</li>
            <li> Thought they would be like the terry cloth ones, except stretchy. But these are too stretchy, can&#x27;t even wash with them because the exterior layer moves too much to scrub the skin. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and exactly as described and shown in the photo.  I didn&#x27;t really need four, so I gave a couple to my mom.  I like to use lavender glycerin soap from the local farmer&#x27;s market.  I just use these bags for my soap slivers as it makes it easier to hang on to them and scrub in the shower.  A good value and fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> These mesh soap savers were a little lighter weight than what I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Found anther brand from Aquasenials on Amazon and like these better.  The cost a little more but the other brand are thicker.  Arrived quickly and as ordered.</li>
            <li> I will be the first to tell you that these will not last forever (nor do I want them to (gross!)). These held up as expected but eventually do come loose and must be replaced, all and all a great value. 4 out of 5 stars, if they lasted just a bit longer then 5 outta 5.</li>
            <li> The also lather &amp;#34;a lot better&amp;#34; than a regular bar of soap plus they do a good job of exfoliating.  I originally found them at a Dollar Tree Store in 2004 or 2005 in Newport News, Virginia, but have never seen them in Dollar Tree again.  Was very happy when I was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> first one didnt last long before it came apart! does what it should, holds soap, but doesnt last long before it fails!</li>
            <li> a little to thin and cheaply made</li>
            <li> Fell apart after lead than one weeks use.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using bar soaps because of the messy gunk left behind...difficult to clean off the shower or tub soap holder...but i have found that the mesh bags keeps the soap well contained, no more gunk left behind and it doesn&#x27;t fall apart like some mesh bags do after a week of use...I gave it 4 stars because it worked as well as it should and because the price was also very reasonable. 4 bags for 1 low price , should last quite awhile</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last very long.  I bought the 4 pack and each one seems to start falling apart after about 2 bars of soap. I&#x27;ll try another brand next time.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for and great price too. I will purchase more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought these for use at the gym.  The nice thing about having a four pack is that when one wears out, you have another.  They do eventually fall apart but for near daily use for two months, not too bad.  Also have one in my home shower for those little pieces of soap and it&#x27;s great for that.  As for the gym, you&#x27;re not lugging a big bottle of shower gel with you and it has a &amp;#34;rope&amp;#34; so you don&#x27;t drop your soap.  For a grade, I&#x27;d give them a &amp;#34;B&amp;#34;...if they held up longer, they&#x27;d get an A....nice and easy.</li>
            <li> Nice Product! The Cable Tie which kept one end closed broke on two of the mesh bags requiring an easy replacement of the Cable Tie.</li>
            <li> This can be difficult to find in my local stores and I was excited to see them online. Bar soap is a lot cheaper and seems to go farther than liquid soap, but who wants the mess that bar soaps can leave in your tub/shower? The Soap Saver hangs in your tub/shower eliminating the caked on soap, which save time and money!</li>
            <li> Works great as a way to use up tiny soap fragments that would otherwise be unusable!</li>
            <li> Items softer than others tried. Will buy from again.</li>
            <li> Simply, but well made.  We use these to save our small pieces of soap.  Better than your standard soap-on-a-rope and it&#x27;s perfect for exfoliating!</li>
            <li> I love these.  These are better than body washes. I&#x27;m old fashion...I still love soap.</li>
            <li> These work very well and are super inexpensive. One problem though, is the drawstring at the top. It has a plastic tie which, can really hurt if your soaping up (think scratching a very sensitive part of your body with sharp plastic). I simply cut off the plastic part then retied it but of course, now the bag doesn&#x27;t close. Still good though.</li>
            <li> Love it and great price</li>
            <li> They do the trick but don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a &amp;#34;Soap Saver&amp;#34;. My young son tends to go through bars of soap about 3 a week. I happened to need a shower as soon as they were delivered, so I tried one of these out. Was great! I&#x27;m a big man with larger hands, but the string is a great length to put around my wrist. I put several pieces of soap slivers into it and it stretches to accommodate much more or even several whole bars of soap. It made great lather and it was lightly exfoliating. It&#x27;s a keeper so far. ;) Great product!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for these for a long time.  I was so excited when I found them for such a great price.  After the second use I discovered why they are so cheap on price.  The first one out of the package fell apart on the second day.  Unfortunately, I bought 2 packs.  I guess I will use them until they all fall apart.  For me personally these were not worth the price.  I would have much rather paid more money for better quality.</li>
            <li> There is no way I can recommend these to anyone. I had the same experience that others have called out and the bags would fall completely apart in the span of a week or 10 days. The four I purchased didn&#x27;t last a full two months.</li>
            <li> The soap savers themselves are fine - they do what they need to do and hold up well.  The first one I got fell apart, however.  I contacted the company about it and they immediately sent me another four pack free of charge - these have held up much better.  The product is good, but the company is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have paid more for a better product but can&#x27;t seem to find it. These aren&#x27;t terrible, but when you want to put in a new bar of soap, they want to just come unraveled.</li>
            <li> These are the soap pockets you are looking for</li>
            <li> I prefer bar soaps and this works well. The price is right (cheap) also. Recommend this to others who like bar soaps.</li>
            <li> I was having difficulty locating this item locally. When I did the price was outrageous. The product I bought on Amazon  is great and I liked having a choice of styles.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;John Abbott&lt;br /&gt;(very satisfied)</li>
            <li> Nice for finally doing something with all those small pieces of soap too small to wash with and too many to discard without feeling like a bad enviromental steward.</li>
            <li> My parents use these and they love them</li>
    </ol>
