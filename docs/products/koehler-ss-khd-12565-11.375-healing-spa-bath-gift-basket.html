            <li>I am into healthy spa products and these seemed sketchy at best.  </li>
            <li>My friend loved this basket and the beauty products.</li>
            <li>The gift recipient loved it and now I&#x27;m tempted to get one for myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She said is was very pretty and smelled wonderful!</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and was in great condition!</li>
            <li>It was a Gift to the Bride, she liked it.</li>
            <li>Of all the gifts she got this one was the one she liked the most.&lt;br /&gt;She said she would be ordering again.</li>
            <li>The products were not sealed except in the plastic covering the basket itself and the products are very cheap.  </li>
            <li>All made in China and very cheap.  </li>
            <li>But it is attractive and comes in a good looking solid basket.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased</li>
            <li>An ideal gift for a friend who was had recent surgery.</li>
            <li>A great foundation to add personal embellishments making it a thoughtful gift for someone at work or home.</li>
            <li>The basket would not close, the hinges were really cheaply made.</li>
            <li>We gave this to my wife for Mother&#x27;s day - from the kids - and she has enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li>The basket is cute and the size is exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>My daughter said she loved it, especially the foot pumis</li>
            <li>It is a gift, so I haven&#x27;t tried it, but it looks better than one I recently purchased that was more money.  </li>
            <li>This is not a gift worth the money; and a gift I would be embarrassed to give.  </li>
            <li>Body Products Therapy Gift Basket]]This is the second time I have purchased this for a gift, both recipients love the basket.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have taken time to write but was so dissatisfied</li>
            <li>The products are not really very large, but it is a nice gift to give to someone and the basket can be used for other things which is a cute idea.</li>
            <li>Shame on you for charging this much for product you can get at any dollar store.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s very &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Be warned that the packaging it comes in is a inferior cardboard box with the words MADE IN CHINA very clearly and largely displayed.</li>
            <li>I was appreciative of the thoughtfulness from the givers, and would never spoil their efforts by telling them how poor quality the products really were.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not worth the cost - cheap products and not spa quality.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to wait the full business days before I would receive it, but I got it in a bundle with the other things I bought a week ago, so it was only 3 days wait or so.</li>
            <li>The people who wrote in that liked it are most likely the ones that gave them as a gift, and unlikely to know the truth of the poor quality.</li>

            <li> [[ASIN:B002PA8GUY Healing Spa Bath And Body Products Therapy Gift Basket]]This is the second time I have purchased this for a gift, both recipients love the basket.</li>
            <li> I was cautious after reading a negative review of this item.  But it is attractive and comes in a good looking solid basket.  It is a gift, so I haven&#x27;t tried it, but it looks better than one I recently purchased that was more money.  I am pleased</li>
            <li> An ideal gift for a friend who was had recent surgery.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to wait the full business days before I would receive it, but I got it in a bundle with the other things I bought a week ago, so it was only 3 days wait or so.</li>
            <li> My friend loved this basket and the beauty products.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so I don&#x27;t have an opinion about each product.  I was surprised at the small sizes</li>
            <li> This is definitely not worth the cost - cheap products and not spa quality. Once I removed the tape surrounding the cloth, the cloth shredded in my hand, now a rag.  Shame on you for charging this much for product you can get at any dollar store.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday gift for my mom FROM my son. She absolutely loves it! She says it&#x27;s very &amp;#34;Fresh&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Relaxing.&amp;#34; She uses it to unwind.</li>
            <li> I received this gift basket for my birthday, ordered by family out of state who are traveling and ordered on-line.  The website photo and overview are quite deceiving.  The basket itself is not even re-giftable, it is not something I would give away. The products were not sealed except in the plastic covering the basket itself and the products are very cheap.  My husband threw out the sponge after one use, said it was horrible, and he is low maintenance!  I am into healthy spa products and these seemed sketchy at best.  All made in China and very cheap.  I was checking back on-line hoping my parents had only spent about 20 dollars and was so surprised to see the cost.  This is not a gift worth the money; and a gift I would be embarrassed to give.  The amount you pay and the picture do not reflect the gift itself.  This is the first review I have taken time to write but was so dissatisfied felt compelled to do so; hoping I can spare another consumer from being deceived and sending this as a gift!</li>
            <li> The basket was cheep looking and the products inside were not good enough to give as a gift.  I was disappointed with this product.[[ASIN:B002PA8GUY Healing Spa Gift Basket]]</li>
            <li> Got this for my Daughter-in law for Xmas. Haven&#x27;t heard from her yet on the products, but they are in the coolest basket.</li>
            <li> The products are not really very large, but it is a nice gift to give to someone and the basket can be used for other things which is a cute idea.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected. It shipped fast and was in great condition! The gift recipient loved it and now I&#x27;m tempted to get one for myself.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and was everything I wanted. Used as a gift.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift. I was appreciative of the thoughtfulness from the givers, and would never spoil their efforts by telling them how poor quality the products really were.

            <li> It was a Gift to the Bride, she liked it. Of all the gifts she got this one was the one she liked the most.&lt;br /&gt;She said she would be ordering again.</li>
            <li> We gave this to my wife for Mother&#x27;s day - from the kids - and she has enjoyed it very much. The basket was repurposed for hand towels in a guest room and the supplies decorate the bathtub when not in use.</li>
            <li> A great foundation to add personal embellishments making it a thoughtful gift for someone at work or home. The gift was appreciated and looked expensive.</li>
            <li> This was a great gift.  The basket is cute and the size is exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> This product is not at all what one would expect by the description, except perhaps the size and ingredients. There is nothing quality about it. I had ordered two, one to a location where I was present the other to a distant location. Thank goodness I opened the one I could look at. UGH! I immediately took it to the thrift shop and called the other recipient in embarrasment not to open it but to return to me. Be warned that the packaging it comes in is a inferior cardboard box with the words MADE IN CHINA very clearly and largely displayed. The basket would not close, the hinges were really cheaply made. Overall it was the worse product I have ever ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent gift, the basket is a little small and it seems like it is a bit &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34;  I was buying this for a friend for her birthday but since it&#x27;s kinda small I&#x27;m going to have to buy her something additional to compensate so she doesn&#x27;t think I cheaped out on her!</li>
            <li> happy with product and seller</li>
            <li> the item is quite chincy.  certainly not worth the price paid. i was quite dissapointed whe I opened the box.</li>
            <li> My daughter said she loved it, especially the foot pumis stone.&lt;br /&gt;She said is was very pretty and smelled wonderful!</li>
