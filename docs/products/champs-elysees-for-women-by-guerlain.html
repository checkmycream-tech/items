            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>I got so many compliments.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll never tire of this lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>The perfume is amazing and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Refined, lightly floral, so clean and transparent that everytime I wear it, I receive many compliments and of course, many ask what perfume is this...  </li>
            <li>No longer available in stores</li>
            <li>Its an evening scent for sure, too strong and pretty for daywear.</li>
            <li>I read about it in a novel about rich women and had to try it.  </li>
            <li>This scent is light, clean, floral and very feminine, I get many compliments about this scent, and it truly helps me get my \\&quot;lady\\&quot; on for the day.</li>
            <li>I have received so many positive comments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, classic and elegant.</li>
            <li>but this time it had a strong acohol smell when first sprayed when that smell disapated</li>
            <li>This perfume smelled great on my boss,a nd other people I know, but didn&#x27;t work as well on me.  </li>
            <li>Service was quick and efficient.</li>
            <li>I remember my mom really taking a liking to this fragrance back in the 90&#x27;s, so I was very pleased when amazon not only had this in stock but also at a great purchase price.</li>
            <li>thanks very much :)</li>
            <li>This perfume is smells so nice, clean ,fresh ,elegant,long lasting</li>
            <li>Have made this my favorite; not heavy and overpowering.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Just a class above most other fragrances with pleasant ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is not too sweet, not too spicy and not too musky, but has characteristics of them all with a gentle hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>It has a very floral/nutty smell which when aired out smells lovely.</li>
            <li>My first visit to Amazon.com produced the desired results.</li>
            <li>Thank you much !</li>
            <li>I have often purchased a scent only to find that it smelled much better on my friend.  </li>
            <li>Great scent and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Bought this fragrance when it first came on the market in Martinique.  </li>
            <li>I got the Eau De Toilette spray very soon after  I ordered, I love this french smell very much.</li>
            <li>This scent is a classic that has proven it is fresh each and every time it is worn.</li>
            <li>The eau de toilette is pretty much equivalent to eau de perfume.</li>
            <li>Luckily I browsed through Amazon, and found it at a cheaper price than in Europe, and from a reliable, professional merchant.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it is a long lasting , but more importantly this scent is compatible with my skin..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Smells like real flowers ....</li>
            <li>Very feminine</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This perfume is A classic ...</li>
            <li>I was horrified when I moved back to the States, and I could not purchase my favorite, one and only, perfume.</li>
            <li>good amount for the price, but  scent did not last as long on your body as the origional sample did from store back once upon a time.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am buying these bottles more often than I used to, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to be lasting as long</li>
            <li>Long lasting and very rich for the classy lady.</li>
            <li>The scent has been haunting me since the first time my neighbor sported it several years ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a very long time, but lately I&#x27;ve notices it doesn&#x27;t quiete smell as good.</li>
            <li>I order a large bottle several times a year, and delivery is always expedient.</li>
            <li>I know perfumes are really a matter of individual taste</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft yet lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This scent is not too heavy, is fresh, feminine, and balanced; and men comment favorably!</li>
            <li>This is a subtle fragrance and lasts longer than most.  </li>
            <li>I do have a hard time finding scents that are compatible with my body chemistry, but if your someone that can wear a large variety of scents, then go for it!!!</li>
            <li>It is elegant and subtle and has lasting power.  </li>

            <li> After a long hit and misses, finally I found my perfume.  </li>
            <li> Amazon had, low price and free Prime shipping, can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
            <li> She loves it, she ran out of her last bottle, which we picked up at Epcot Center on our last vacation.</li>
            <li> Apparently, this scent is not easily available in America.</li>
            <li> This perfume that  I received is not that I was expected, it smell different that one I had previously.</li>
            <li> This is not a very well known fragrance.</li>
            <li> Have had trouble finding it locally.  </li>
            <li> I believe that the other one was the eau de perfume and this is the toilette.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> When she ran out she was sad to find it was no longer stocked in our area and had to settle for a second choice.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past with no problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the notes are but its heavenly.</li>
            <li> If you like scents that are hard to pinpoint, you will like this scent.</li>
            <li> Too bad that it&#x27;s discontinued, there are only a few places where you find it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing that Amazon lets this</li>
            <li> Horrible I will return</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance and great value!</li>
            <li> I love that Amazon had this fragrance at an affordable price. The cheapest I could find the 3.4oz Champs Elysees anywhere was for $76.00. I saved a bunch buying this online. Oh, and did I mention that this fragrance smells so beautiful, and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> My wife love&#x27;s this perfume (so do I). When she ran out she was sad to find it was no longer stocked in our area and had to settle for a second choice. Since the holidays were approaching I decided to try and locate it. My first visit to Amazon.com produced the desired results. I FOUND the perfume, placed the order and received it when promised from the vendor. I was the \\&quot;HERO\\&quot; and became the benefichary of many thankful nights.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past with no problem but this time it had a strong acohol smell when first sprayed when that smell disapated there was no fragrance left??? Horrible I will return it was I can find some extra time.  This also happened to be a valentines present to myself ! No stars</li>
            <li> I got the Eau De Toilette spray very soon after  I ordered, I love this french smell very much. thanks very much :)</li>
            <li> This perfume is smells so nice, clean ,fresh ,elegant,long lasting I get compliments all the time ! Very good price,also! Highly recommend it ! Thank you much !</li>
            <li> This is not a very well known fragrance. I bought it for my future wive. The eau de toilette is pretty much equivalent to eau de perfume. The scent is more in the tradition of channel number 5 - good for business, but not of the sweet kind. It is definitely more of a distinguished scent well suited for business.</li>
            <li> This perfume smelled great on my boss,a nd other people I know, but didn&#x27;t work as well on me.  I do have a hard time finding scents that are compatible with my body chemistry, but if your someone that can wear a large variety of scents, then go for it!!!</li>
            <li> This scent is not too heavy, is fresh, feminine, and balanced; and men comment favorably!</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrances ever. Long lasting and very rich for the classy lady. Not sporty, but elegant! Just a class above most other fragrances with pleasant ingredients.</li>
            <li> 1 bottle will last for years! Its an evening scent for sure, too strong and pretty for daywear. I&#x27;m not sure what the notes are but its heavenly. A definite must. I always get complimented by both sexes when I spray this on. It lasts until washed off. Buy!</li>
            <li> Genuine perfume, super awesome price, magnificent scent!  Packaging was well-cared for as well. This is Guerlain after all. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> While the packaging looks the same and the bottle looks the same and it smells almost the same, it is a knock off product.  Very disappointing that Amazon lets this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marsha Stern</li>
            <li> I have worn Champs Elysees for years! Customers have stopped and walked back to ask what I had on! A man said \\&quot;I want to buy this for my wife!\\&quot; A connection with the Tour de France when I wear this perfume! Cheers!</li>
            <li> This fragance has become one of the big classics.  Refined, lightly floral, so clean and transparent that everytime I wear it, I receive many compliments and of course, many ask what perfume is this...  The fragance is a gift to the senses so the name Champs Elysees makes honor to itself.</li>
            <li> good amount for the price, but  scent did not last as long on your body as the origional sample did from store back once upon a time.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift and she was absolutely delighted. She had run out quite a while ago and it has always been her favorite.</li>
            <li> This perfume is A classic ... Elegant.... Sophisticated ....it has a nice touch of mimosa. Smells like real flowers ....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is a long lasting , but more importantly this scent is compatible with my skin.. I have often purchased a scent only to find that it smelled much better on my friend.  I always receive compliments when I am wearing Champs Elysees.  I now have my daughters using this and the same as I do</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s favorite, what more can I say about it. She loves it, she ran out of her last bottle, which we picked up at Epcot Center on our last vacation. Amazon had, low price and free Prime shipping, can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  It is elegant and subtle and has lasting power.  When I wear it I get compliments.</li>
            <li> Ever since my brother gave this to me as a gift years ago (10+yrs?), it still is the only perfume I prefer to wear.</li>
            <li> Good price for the size of it...I recommended to my girlfriend too....I like the scent..It last long if you spray on your clothes.</li>
            <li> This perfume that  I received is not that I was expected, it smell different that one I had previously. I believe that the other one was the eau de perfume and this is the toilette. This is the problem of buying online. I have not open it because I tried to return it to change it but I cannot. According the instructions, as perfume contains explosive ingredients, then it cannot be returned. Now, I have a perfume in a  box to keep in my closet.</li>
            <li> Great scent and long lasting.  Too bad that it&#x27;s discontinued, there are only a few places where you find it.</li>
            <li> Its a huge bottle of Goodness! Ive loved this fragrance for years. Im glad to find it in this size and for this price</li>
            <li> I feel like I am buying these bottles more often than I used to, the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to be lasting as long so I am constantly reapplying.  It is still my favorite and not a deal breaker.  The scent is light, classic and elegant.</li>
            <li> Many years ago my daughter bought this perfume for me because she said it reminded her of who I am.  Champs Elysees has become my signature scent, and get so many compliments.  This scent is a classic that has proven it is fresh each and every time it is worn.</li>
            <li> My Favorite purfume!!!! I have been wearing this since 2000 i always get compliments when i wear it and it last all day. Very feminine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a very long time, but lately I&#x27;ve notices it doesn&#x27;t quiete smell as good. It looks like they&#x27;ve changed the formula.</li>
            <li> The perfume is amazing and arrived quickly. Service was quick and efficient. Champs Ellysee by Guerlain is an amazing perfume!!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance since the 80&#x27;s.  I have received so many positive comments whenever I wear it. This will be my favorite for many more years to come.</li>
            <li> The scent has been haunting me since the first time my neighbor sported it several years ago.  I had stopped wearing perfumes until now; I love the compliments that tell me others love the scent, too.</li>
            <li> Bought this fragrance when it first came on the market in Martinique.  Have had trouble finding it locally.  This perfume has delivered the most compliments from others.  Have made this my favorite; not heavy and overpowering.</li>
            <li> Yes I am satisfied with my product. The only problem was the delay of delivery because of my Adress since it is the one I always use For my shopping st Amazon and never had a problem. Final y everything ok.  Thanks</li>
            <li> No longer available in stores so THANK GOODNESS for amazon.com! This is what heaven must smell like. 5 STARS all the way.</li>
            <li> After a long hit and misses, finally I found my perfume.  Now this is my signature perfume.  I got so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I remember my mom really taking a liking to this fragrance back in the 90&#x27;s, so I was very pleased when amazon not only had this in stock but also at a great purchase price. It has a very floral/nutty smell which when aired out smells lovely. Definitely give this a try!</li>
            <li> This is a subtle fragrance and lasts longer than most.  I read about it in a novel about rich women and had to try it.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I know perfumes are really a matter of individual taste and I know that perfumes react differently on people,  but this perfume is wonderful. It is a clean refreshing scent that is good for any time of day or year. It is not too sweet, not too spicy and not too musky, but has characteristics of them all with a gentle hint of citrus.If you like flowery scents this one is not for you. If you like scents that are hard to pinpoint, you will like this scent. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never tire of this lovely scent.  I&#x27;ve tried plenty of perfumes but nothing lives up to this one. It&#x27;s soft yet lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I started using this scent in Berlin about 15 years ago. I wear it faithfully and only substitute Bulgari for it,  if I run out. I was horrified when I moved back to the States, and I could not purchase my favorite, one and only, perfume. Apparently, this scent is not easily available in America. Luckily I browsed through Amazon, and found it at a cheaper price than in Europe, and from a reliable, professional merchant. I order a large bottle several times a year, and delivery is always expedient. This scent is light, clean, floral and very feminine, I get many compliments about this scent, and it truly helps me get my \\&quot;lady\\&quot; on for the day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne. I use it everyday. I wish it was cheaper.  Everyone should try it time and time again</li>
