            <li>This product is amazing, it truly is helping my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin will be well moisturized unless you over use the product as hyaluronic acid is a very strong humectant</li>
            <li>It did not do any damage to my skin, but it surely didn&#x27;t activate &#x27;youth cells&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I have used this Lancôme product several times and love  it!!!!</li>
            <li>it better tap dance and sing and give me results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I use their Huile Doceur and love their Definicils mascara</li>
            <li>Or better yet, buy some Olay from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>This product worked better than advertised.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I think I like it better than Bienfait Aquavital and lighter for my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist approved it which is the most important thing to me.</li>
            <li>so I can spot it easily when I am travelling.</li>
            <li>however that being said I see no change in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>After a moth of use, my fine likes on my forehead are still these.</li>
            <li>It does provide wonderful moisturization and definitely gives me a je ne sais quoi which is that healthy glow and overall healthy texture.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft now I really love it!</li>
            <li>It feels good going on, but after four days of use my entire face broke out into a mass of acne and bumps.  </li>
            <li>i say  is true .Do</li>
            <li>I still have full bottle of it.  </li>
            <li>I love Lancome products, but this was a complete miss.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW is just from some Lancome product I am re-trying.</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;ll buy more in a bigger size.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>In fact, the bottle&#x27;s top was screwed in crooked when I received it.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face look so much healthier!</li>
            <li>but right now I dont really have them</li>
            <li>Thanks for your message.&lt;br /&gt;  V. Stever</li>
            <li>What everyone wants to hear, &amp;#34;It works!&amp;#34;  Have used for one month and lines are at a minimum.  </li>
            <li>Btw, price on amazon is much lower than at the store.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid in it has shown positive results, but this price to too high for me to recommend.</li>
            <li>Search for other Hyaluronic Acid serums(or powder and make your own) and you&#x27;ll find the price swings wildly.</li>
            <li>Prefer the original packaging to a generic plastic bottle</li>
            <li>She wondered at first if I needed to go back on the antibiotics.</li>
            <li>I love it when I can find a small size of something I use.  </li>
            <li>It currently has no known effects on skin, preliminary studies show no more positive impact than better known ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you get more products that actually work for half the price.</li>
            <li>other main helpful ingredient is supposed to be the Bifida Ferment Lysate(A gram positive bacteria found in DIGESTIVE systems!).</li>
            <li>I had some zits form on my cheek and near my hairline....</li>
            <li>No plastic packaging, there is no production date, no expiry date, the bottle is old bottle.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a younger apperance.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have allergic reactions to perfumes and dyes.  </li>
            <li>old bottles.  </li>
            <li>Anything would work better than this total waste of money.</li>
            <li>Then...I went back to my Avon Genics (which is marketed as direct competition with the Genifique)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A weird zit formed on the corner of my nose, the kind you can&#x27;t cover up and people want to stare at...</li>
            <li>Long term effects are more subtle IF any.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The effects will show instantly, but the instant effects are short term (due to plumping from Hyaluronic acid?</li>
            <li> Clearly, this company somehow cut corners to make the pricing of this product less than Sephora&#x27;s pricing.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for two moths and haven&#x27;t noticed any long term effect whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I use this over my differin gel in sporadic treatments, not all year long because I worry about breakouts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about a week and a half, and my skin is finally making strides back to where it was before I strayed from the Anew to begin with!</li>

            <li> I am not sure if this company sent out an &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; bottle or even mixed something into this bottle before sending it, but it was CLEARLY a different product than one sold at Sephora stores.  </li>
            <li> My skin is in WORSE shape after using this expensive serum than it was on cheap Avon!!</li>
            <li> So a week into using it every night, and my face once again feels rough and is scaly/peely.</li>
            <li> In response to other reviewers, I don&#x27;t understand how they can say they got a sealed bottle from Sephora because mine from Nordstrom was not shrink wrapped, nor is my Lancome eye cream which I also use in sporadic treatments.</li>
            <li> Looking down from head to toe this is not</li>
            <li> You will see brightness, less aging in skin.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> When you put it on, you feel your skin tight immediately.</li>
            <li> Instead, over a month my skin seemed to retreat backwards a little bit in condition.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive with little to no positive results after using according to the directions.</li>
            <li> The worse part was, having a derm appointment after I&#x27;d been using this a few days, and trying to explain to her that yes, my prescriptions are working, THIS SKIN YOU SEE</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was less expensive than the stores or Lancôme website.</li>
            <li> I consider it too expensive for the result.</li>
            <li> WHAT is wrong with this stuff?</li>
            <li> NO i just need to stop using things that make my skin look bad!</li>
            <li> The smell was so bad, that I never used it!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Lancome products, but this was a complete miss.  It feels good going on, but after four days of use my entire face broke out into a mass of acne and bumps.  It took me several months to get rid of all the scaring caused by four days of use.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive with little to no positive results after using according to the directions. It did not do any damage to my skin, but it surely didn&#x27;t activate &#x27;youth cells&#x27;.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> It has an instant effect on complexion. This is the good thing of this product. I have been using it for two moths and haven&#x27;t noticed any long term effect whatsoever. No allergies but I am not prone to them. I consider it too expensive for the result.</li>
            <li> I have used this Lancôme product several times and love  it!!!! I&amp;#34;ll buy more in a bigger size. Thanks for your message.&lt;br /&gt;  V. Stever</li>
            <li> I gave this about 30 days....and it did act like a good night moisturizer so that&#x27;s why it gets 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But sheesh come on, for this price it better tap dance and sing and give me results. Instead, over a month my skin seemed to retreat backwards a little bit in condition. I had some dry scaly patches and my chin became rough and itchy. A weird zit formed on the corner of my nose, the kind you can&#x27;t cover up and people want to stare at...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a month, and then returned it. Then...I went back to my Avon Genics (which is marketed as direct competition with the Genifique)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week and a half, and my skin is finally making strides back to where it was before I strayed from the Anew to begin with! Save your money on the Lancome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I use their Huile Doceur and love their Definicils mascara so I&#x27;m not hatin&#x27; on Lancome, this product is just a dud)&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I received a 10 day trial size sample of this in my Lancome order when I reordered the Huile Doceur and thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it again. It&#x27;s been a long time since I last used the Genifique. So a week into using it every night, and my face once again feels rough and is scaly/peely. I had some zits form on my cheek and near my hairline....WHAT is wrong with this stuff? How can it be so popular?!?!? My skin is in WORSE shape after using this expensive serum than it was on cheap Avon!! Next time they include one of these in my order I&#x27;ll be passing it on to someone else! The worse part was, having a derm appointment after I&#x27;d been using this a few days, and trying to explain to her that yes, my prescriptions are working, THIS SKIN YOU SEE RIGHT NOW is just from some Lancome product I am re-trying. She wondered at first if I needed to go back on the antibiotics. NO i just need to stop using things that make my skin look bad!</li>
            <li> The product seems quite nice and my skin feels good after application........however that being said I see no change in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> No plastic packaging, there is no production date, no expiry date, the bottle is old bottle. Looking down from head to toe this is not real.what i say  is true .Do not refuse my feedback again please</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t. After a moth of use, my fine likes on my forehead are still these. As are my 11&#x27;s, and the ruddiness on my cheeks. Buy Avon Anew line. you get more products that actually work for half the price. Or better yet, buy some Olay from the drugstore. Anything would work better than this total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product worked better than advertised. It makes your skin soft and smooth. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a younger apperance.</li>
            <li> What everyone wants to hear, &amp;#34;It works!&amp;#34;  Have used for one month and lines are at a minimum.  Use under moisturizer and makeup -- Purrrrfect!</li>
            <li> I love it when I can find a small size of something I use.  Prefer the original packaging to a generic plastic bottle so I can spot it easily when I am travelling.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel! My skin is so soft now I really love it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have allergic reactions to perfumes and dyes.  I&#x27;ve ordered this product from Sephora with no problems bc it had no scent, etc.  The product this company sent was NOT the same as Sephora&#x27;s.  I ordered it bc the price was cheaper than Sephora&#x27;s but never again will I order this from this company.  The product they sent had a smell to it. The consistency of product was different. It did not absorb into skin as before when I purchased from Sephora.  I am not sure if this company sent out an &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; bottle or even mixed something into this bottle before sending it, but it was CLEARLY a different product than one sold at Sephora stores.  There was no seal on the bottle of box they sent. so anyone could have already opened the bottle.  In fact, the bottle&#x27;s top was screwed in crooked when I received it.  The smell was so bad, that I never used it!  I still have full bottle of it.  I will end up throwing out.  I will have to rebuy from Sephora.  Clearly, this company somehow cut corners to make the pricing of this product less than Sephora&#x27;s pricing.  Maybe they are selling &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; old bottles.  Whatever the case, buyer be ware!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it truly is helping my skin. Love it and I&#x27;m hooked. It arrived on time and was less expensive than the stores or Lancôme website.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and dont really notice any difference. Wont be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It does WONDERS on my skin! Makes my face look so much healthier! I will definitely be buying Lancome Genifique again.</li>
            <li> I use this over my differin gel in sporadic treatments, not all year long because I worry about breakouts. My dermatologist approved it which is the most important thing to me. It does provide wonderful moisturization and definitely gives me a je ne sais quoi which is that healthy glow and overall healthy texture. I think I like it better than Bienfait Aquavital and lighter for my skin. I like the dropper because I can control the amount of cream. I am hoping it will help prevent wrinkles but right now I dont really have them so we will see. I will keep you posted. Btw, price on amazon is much lower than at the store. In response to other reviewers, I don&#x27;t understand how they can say they got a sealed bottle from Sephora because mine from Nordstrom was not shrink wrapped, nor is my Lancome eye cream which I also use in sporadic treatments.</li>
            <li> You will see brightness, less aging in skin.&lt;br /&gt;When used consistently-best product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Try, you will love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. When you put it on, you feel your skin tight immediately. I put it on at night, and when I wake up, my skin is revived.</li>
            <li> Lancome Genefique does work temporarily. It&#x27;s a great serum compared to some others if ignoring price. However, the price is not justifiable in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Activating Concentrate: Aqua/ Water/Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Salicyloyl Phytosphingosine, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide/Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Octyldodecanol, Citric Acid, Citronellol, Parfum/Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other main helpful ingredient is supposed to be the Bifida Ferment Lysate(A gram positive bacteria found in DIGESTIVE systems!). It currently has no known effects on skin, preliminary studies show no more positive impact than better known ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hyaluronic Acid in it has shown positive results, but this price to too high for me to recommend. Search for other Hyaluronic Acid serums(or powder and make your own) and you&#x27;ll find the price swings wildly. This one is about high-middle of the range. The rest of the ingredients are fillers (silicones, water) and theres a fair amount of alcohol. L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code has almost the same ingredients for lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects will show instantly, but the instant effects are short term (due to plumping from Hyaluronic acid? or maybe smoothing from Dimethicones?) Long term effects are more subtle IF any. Skin will be well moisturized unless you over use the product as hyaluronic acid is a very strong humectant AND this contains alcohol. In small amounts Hyaluronic Acid will draw moisture into your skin (plumping it) or in large amounts pull moisture out.</li>
