            <li>smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s my favorite , also is original from victoria secrect ..</li>
            <li>Application is easy and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel.</li>
            <li>Wore off very quickly</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definetely a \\&quot;Heavenly\\&quot; scent for people that don&#x27;t like that strong perfumey smell.</li>
            <li>I get this perfum so fast like in three days ,, the fragance is so nice</li>
            <li>Clean fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>speeeedy like whew love it, gotta show here often everybody who doesnt know by now, speedy whew whew speedy fast</li>
            <li>IS PLASTIC BOTTLE IS THE ONLY THING THAT I AM NO SHARE, BUT IS GOOD FRAGANCE.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products &amp; I like the fact that I can find really competitive prices on this site as well as the availability.  </li>
            <li>me and my mom love so much</li>
            <li>I am glad that I was able to find this perfume on Amazon because I received it as a  gift awhile back and was bummed when it ran out.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells good but does not last long &amp; the bottle is not same as the picture shows &amp; it was not in the box, just was wrapped inside the plastic wrap which did not make happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just got the right amount of kick to carry the scent through the day.</li>
            <li>The price was right too</li>
            <li>Not at all sweet or overpowering or flowery, just womanly and sexy.</li>
            <li>first at all, this isn&#x60;t</li>
            <li>Love this scent will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Love this body spray and it smells just like the regular perfume version.</li>
            <li>and im very picky!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same good scent but in a smaller size.</li>
            <li>My fiancee loves that it&#x27;s not overpowering so much (she puts on her perfume in the morning and may use this in hot afternoons/etc).  </li>
            <li>this is very close to the perfume.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>however, it was received without packaging, no box, which I thought was strange because then we weren&#x27;t sure if it was use or new as advertised?</li>
            <li>This is definitely a classic perfume....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone who wants a soft sensual scent.</li>
            <li>Easy &amp; convient little plastic bottle that sprays out the perfume.</li>
            <li>I really hope the regular size bottles are not all switching over to plastic...</li>
            <li>Good choice if you&#x27;re not into the overpowering aroma that regular perfumes leave behind.</li>
            <li>I am an employee for Victoria&#x27;s Secret and this is one of our own perfumes.</li>
            <li>The small size makes it easy to carry in her purse and can even be carried on a plane.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a victoria secret fan love all their scents and this is one of my favorite and hard to find</li>
            <li>The little cap inside the top of bottle was broken-will be hard to get the spray out.</li>

            <li> The little cap inside the top of bottle was broken-will be hard to get the spray out.</li>
            <li> last long..</li>
            <li> , THE FRAGRANCE IS SOFT, DELICATE BUT</li>
            <li> Will still use it but will order direct from Victorias Secret next time.</li>
            <li> Will look for other items like this one.</li>
            <li> This was either a sample bottle or had been used because it was way down.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but it also smelled watered down.</li>
            <li> This smells like it&#x27;s been watered down and the bottle looks unauthentic.</li>
            <li> It is delicate and not strong which is my preference.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume, however it comes in a plastic bottle :(  </li>
            <li> Its delicate</li>
            <li> Useless waste of money</li>
            <li> just wish they still made &amp;#34;victoria&amp;#34; by victoria secret</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m very disappointed with this product and this seller.</li>

            <li> This is just the nicest scent I&#x27;ve ever worn. Not at all sweet or overpowering or flowery, just womanly and sexy. I&#x27;ve worn it exclusively since it came out. Everyone compliments me on it - and men LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Clean fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Smells so good but the scent does&#x27;nt last long.. Easy &amp; convient little plastic bottle that sprays out the perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought these as gifts and they were well received.  That is all I know.  The girls wanted them and they loved them.</li>
            <li> Love this scent will definitely purchase again. It is delicate and not strong which is my preference. Good choice if you&#x27;re not into the overpowering aroma that regular perfumes leave behind.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but it also smelled watered down.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll my mom really loved it. It was for a Christmas present. I made her happy. yes I did yeah</li>
            <li> I received this within no time at all. I really love this product and was very pleased with the price as well.</li>
            <li> speeeedy like whew love it, gotta show here often everybody who doesnt know by now, speedy whew whew speedy fast</li>
            <li> This smells like it&#x27;s been watered down and the bottle looks unauthentic. Will still use it but will order direct from Victorias Secret next time. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> scent is awsome.  love it</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! So feminine and makes you feel beautiful... Nothing like smelling good! This is definitely a classic perfume....</li>
            <li> In the beginning I never could smell it.  Then I realized me allergy were blocking the scent.  Its delicate but I do like it.  I prefer Bombshell but this is a nice change.</li>
            <li> Love this body spray and it smells just like the regular perfume version. Its always been my husbands favortie and I get compliments from peolpe all the time.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it. Great price and it smells absolutely wonderful. The bottle is plastic which is great in case you drop it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and price. I will keep stocking up on these!  perfect for keeping in my jeep for on the go!</li>
            <li> GOOD FRAGRANCE&lt;br /&gt;MUCH LIKE THIS PRODUCT, THE FRAGRANCE IS SOFT, DELICATE BUT IS PLASTIC BOTTLE IS THE ONLY THING THAT I AM NO SHARE, BUT IS GOOD FRAGANCE.</li>
            <li> I am an employee for Victoria&#x27;s Secret and this is one of our own perfumes. We sell it for $10 each.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Heavenly...this is very close to the perfume.  My fiancee loves that it&#x27;s not overpowering so much (she puts on her perfume in the morning and may use this in hot afternoons/etc).  It&#x27;s just got the right amount of kick to carry the scent through the day.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, product worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Lasts for like 10 seconds! Useless waste of money</li>
            <li> Anything Victoria makes is the best. When I give it as a gift the appeciation that is showed is priceless.</li>
            <li> I missed this perfume and finally got it :D perfection!!! I love the smell of this and im very picky!</li>

I will definitely recommend this seller/site to others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same good scent but in a smaller size. Our Grand Daughter loves is as well as the 8 oz one I got her.&lt;br /&gt;She always smells so good. I might get me some!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Heavenly for about 10 years now and its my favorite scent!!! I love the price I found it for and with free shipping what could be better!!</li>
            <li> This item was purchase for a Christmas gift... however, it was received without packaging, no box, which I thought was strange because then we weren&#x27;t sure if it was use or new as advertised? However, it was shipped and received promptly.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. This product is wonderful and just a joy.  It has made my life better having it. Will look for other items like this one.</li>

            <li> smells amazing and fits into my purse well for those times on the go.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume, however it comes in a plastic bottle :(  Maybe I am weird about these things, but I really love perfume in a glass bottle. I understand that for travel purposes (or carrying it in your purse) plastic might bemore practical. I really hope the regular size bottles are not all switching over to plastic...</li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell and so do I...this is one of my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, good smell, I recommend it, you will feel fresh, and receives compliments are good, comes in good condition, well packaged. Thank You. I would buy again</li>
