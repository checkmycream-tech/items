            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is the very BEST nipple moisturizer/protector you can buy.</li>
            <li>However my baby now latches on great and this product protects the nipple from baby and pumping perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your breast and nipple feel great.</li>
            <li>This might work great on someone else.</li>
            <li>I am an exclusive pumper and this works great to use while pumping...</li>
            <li>Happy to have this product.</li>

            <li>That said, to each her own!  </li>
            <li>very nice product, loved it....</li>
            <li>This cream feels good on, if you can get it out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great product, I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells great, much better than Lansinoh.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how much I LOVE this nipple creme!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more once this tube runs out!</li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>SO glad I did!</li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>This cream is much better than the lanoish cream I was given in the hospital, cleared up my cracked &amp; bleeding nipples and had continued to protect them as I EBF my daughter!  </li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff worked amazingly well</li>
            <li>soak breast in warm salt water for 10 plus minutes - this also helped to reduce soreness for me  5.</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice, and it helped.</li>
            <li>This nipple butter is nice.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s texture is more like a good lotion which makes its application a breeze.</li>
            <li>And as an added bonus I just started using it in my own baby wipes solution for our daughters bottom.</li>
            <li>The absolute best cream out there</li>
            <li>It applies easily, doesn&#x27;t smell, and does provide a fair amount of healing and lubrication.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is way better than Medela&#x27;s lanolin - goes on nicer, feels smoother and feels much more nourishing to my nips!</li>
            <li>Thats the most effective cream for the breastfeeding mom.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I ordered at a great price.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy 2</li>
            <li>This cream works better than any others I have tried to soothe cracked, irritated nipples.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and texture of this stuff, but better for maintenance than it is for curing sore nipples.  </li>
            <li>then try using this product on your nipples to help prevent more soreness/dryness.  </li>
            <li>When searching for a nipple cream, many things were recommended but nothing did the job like this.</li>
            <li>and it is completely safe to ingest.</li>
            <li>This healed my nipples while breastfeeding; better than anything else I tried.  </li>
            <li>Its way better than that gummy, stinky Lanisoh stuff.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t fight me because there are 3 cute bees on the front</li>
            <li>it is safe for baby to ingest...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the Bella B Nipple Nurture Butter.  </li>
            <li>The lanolin provided more moisture protection.</li>
            <li>I read all these product reviews saying that the stretch mark products used to be creamier, or stayed on better, etc and figure that this creates a layer on the skin that would be sure to promote healing.</li>
            <li>I will update if I see results from this:)</li>
            <li>and it is better for me and the baby.</li>
            <li>Ä° love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the lanolin ones, but doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare to earth momma angel baby nipple balm.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this-</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt or irritate your nipples more when you put the product on.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use all the time and it is safe for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>My nipples were cracked and sore and after one application they felt so much better.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.</li>
            <li>I like that it is okay if the babies get it in their mouths.</li>
            <li>I use a gel that my pediatrician father gave me, and it works much better.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, tastes normal and pleasant, even works for lip balm in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this and started using it in the hospital after my son was born.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great consistency, very moisturizing and glides on easily.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth, soothing, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Of course after reading and hearing from friends about how much pain your nipples go through I was worried about how successful I would be.</li>
            <li>What a great natural and versatile product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smooth texture of the product.</li>
            <li>Wow I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy !</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It has a very mild smell&lt;br /&gt;MUCH</li>
            <li>The exchange and return were easy with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>One tube lasted three months easily.  </li>
            <li>The answer was a very quick</li>
            <li>Smells great and works so much better than the standard nipple cream.  </li>
            <li>It protects my nips and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>and she says it is really soft and is good for sore nipples :)</li>
            <li>Also, the taste seems to be fine because she doesn&#x27;t hesitate to nurse when the cream is on.</li>
            <li>and they told me it was fine</li>
            <li>Easy and smooth to apply</li>
            <li>This was a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>I tried several products which did not heal but this one worked great.</li>
            <li>With my second, things were great, but I still had tenderness and scabbing issues.</li>
            <li>This sliky creamy butter was fantastic.</li>
            <li>yes, within 1 day I was healed and nursing was comfortable again.</li>
            <li>and it is lanolin free-</li>
            <li>I would never have known it was lanolin free unless I read the label.</li>
            <li>I had an allergy to the Lansinoh, and this product is lanolin free which avoids those issues.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s texture is smooth &amp; it feels like it melts on like butter.</li>
            <li>It comes out all on its own when it warm and you really only need a drop or too.</li>
            <li>It was a good product, but far too runny.</li>
            <li>and I noticed right the way that this cream soothing much better</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients in this were great for tender nipples when you first start nursing.</li>
            <li>He explained to me what could have caused the problem &amp; personally checked to be sure the next bottle they were sending me was perfect.  </li>
            <li>He offered to replace my bottle without having to go through returning the original bottle.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t fantastic but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li>i was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>all lubricated and a pain to get clean.</li>
            <li>I got this nipple cream as a baby shower gift, and once I read that it is all natural I fell in love!</li>
            <li>But this product is just the right texture for applications throughout the day!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only nipple butter I&#x27;ve found with ALL plant-based ingredients, and I feel good putting it on, knowing my son may nurse again at any time.  </li>
            <li>I got this the day my baby was born, thanks Amazon Prime :-)</li>
            <li>My experience is that this makes it pretty good for healing, and slightly less effective for providing protection/barrier against clothes.</li>
            <li>I give it as a gift to many of my new mama friends!</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t imagine me eating petroleum, so why would I give it to my precious new baby?!</li>
            <li>I am still pregnant</li>
            <li>I found that the commonly recommended nipple cream (Lansinoh) required a great deal of working to get creamy, and applying it caused my nipples to leak most of the time.</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly and have had no issues with the vendor.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product because it works quickly</li>
            <li>Ä°ts fix feeding scratch quickly asap.</li>
            <li>Truth be told, they aren&#x27;t perfect or back to normal, but they are now a more acceptable version of the new normal.</li>
            <li>6 months pregnant, am currently using the Bella B Tummy Butter and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>This product is not only soothing, but also safe for you and baby!</li>
            <li>I love that it has natural products and not oil from sheep wool!</li>
            <li>It really does feel like butter, nice &amp; creamy (not sticky and gross like other lanolin), gentle, and best of all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually the type who worried too much about that kind of thing</li>
            <li>I used it, wasn&#x27;t a huge fan, but didn&#x27;t really know what else to use.</li>
            <li>prevention is golden - make</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.   </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This along with the cold cabbage leaf treatment proved to be effective and it made my life much easier, painless, and it helped me to do what was best for my child</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that is all natural and there is no need to worry about wiping it off before letting the baby latch.</li>
            <li>so I suppose it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more balmy texture, and this was like a cream or lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky like lansinoh and it&#x27;s all natural and safe for you and baby.</li>
            <li>This cream is great, i needed the lanolin at first, but this cream is great for later use and is better to keep in the baby bag because it is not as greasy as lanolin and doesn&#x27;t stick to your hands like crazy.</li>
            <li>I got to test it out right away</li>
            <li>He latches right on without putting up a fight and stays latched on.</li>
            <li>The other is great before you get in the shower for protecting new mommy nipples!  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different kinds of nipple cream and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, this has a wonderful texture, creamy and a little gooey, but it has enough slip that it doesn&#x27;t pull on my skin when I apply it.</li>
            <li>Not only did it alleviate the messiness since it is plant-based, but it also did a better job of relieving my soreness, and went on smoother.</li>
            <li>After breast feeding and pumping for the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li>(If you are a first time mom...and no one has told you yet...</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t a lot of negatives, in my book, although I do find that the butter either wears off or soaks into the skin pretty rapidly.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>If it is gritty when you get it, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>i used coconut oil at first.</li>
            <li>Let me say right off the bat that I thankfully haven&#x27;t had to use this product too much.</li>
            <li>I too make my own cloth wipes for my cloth diapers and never thought to use this as an ingredient, but reading other comments</li>
            <li>This product is not only vegan, but is completely chemical free and goes on so easily.</li>
            <li>I am a first time mom and really wanted to breastfeed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much this helped me during the first couple of months of breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>This is my first time breastfeeding, and my chest was ALWAYS really sore.</li>
            <li>The little &amp;#34;Scrubs&amp;#34; in this nipple butter is what I think work to relieve any kind of soreness.</li>
            <li>Lanolin was very thick, the Bella B Nipple Butter is great.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a third tube from my hospital where their sample was very creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>However, Lanolin really has never done anything once my nipples get irritated.</li>
            <li>It protects the whole</li>
            <li>This one was grainy and just didn&#x27;t give me a whole lot of relief.  </li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s others out there that do the same and are smooth not grainy</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>It was very soothing and relieved chapping within 2 nights.</li>
            <li>The lanolin doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for me.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact it is natural/plant based.</li>
            <li>I had very sore, cracked and bleeding nipples, and was ready to give up when I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>It helped so much that I decided to keep breastfeeding my baby.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my daughter and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t really penetrate to sooth, it just cakes on and sits there.</li>
            <li>i really like this product.</li>
            <li>It provides some relief but doesn&#x27;t really help in heeling.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t help much either.</li>
            <li>better than any other product I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT for pumping.</li>
            <li>Wife says it works way better than coconut oil, or some of the other stuff she has tried.</li>
            <li>This works so much better than other lanolins sold in stores.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite and literally saved me during those first few weeks of nursing.</li>
            <li>Wanted this because it is all natural ingredients and don&#x27;t like using lanolin from sheep, which I used for my first baby.  </li>
            <li>I only needed it for a couple of months and didn&#x27;t use the full tube.</li>
            <li>I purchased this while I was pregnant with our 3rd daughter because I planned to pump ALOT as a breastmilk donor.</li>
            <li>I figured I was better safe than sorry</li>
            <li>Wife used this during her first pregnancy and it worked overall pretty well.</li>
            <li>It helped a little, but mostly was just more oily and thicker than what I wanted, especially when I realized that there were big oily nipple marks on my shirts that wouldn&#x27;t come off during laundry from when I would walk around the house without a bra.</li>
            <li>Simply add all the ingredients, shake the jar to mix and your all set with a baby bottom wash that is completely chemical free, vegan and safe for your little ones hands &amp; face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend as an alternative to lanolin based products.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend this for any nursing mom.    </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream to every bfing mom out there</li>
            <li>I really wanted to find a safer more natural alternative to the typical brands.  </li>
            <li>Def recommended for new moms new to breast feeding!</li>
            <li>I had lanolin, which was good for protection in a shower, but it was so thick in general that it hurt to put it on after every nursing session.  </li>
            <li>I tried a few options (including the medela) and this was my favorite.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give five stars is because it comes out a little bit chunky, kind of like shea butter or coconut oil</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to new moms, definately.</li>
            <li>I give it to new nursing moms to be</li>
            <li>sure baby is latching properly (opens mouth wide, not just sucking on nipple)  if already having issues try:  2.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t thick at all and goes on very easily.</li>
            <li>My only word of advice - if you live in a hot climate, take care and don&#x27;t squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li>However, the first month or so of breastfeeding did take some getting used to, and so I needed the occasional relief.</li>
            <li>In a 1 quart canning jar I mix the following  3 cups hot water  </li>
            <li>In the early days this saved me!  </li>
            <li>I have trusted the bella b cream since I cam home from the hospital with my daughter, now 1 month old, Leyla!  </li>
            <li>My father recommends applying some breast milk first, air drying nipples, and then using any product for soreness and letting it absorb prior to feeding.</li>
            <li>I love this nipple cream, but when one came that was not the same consistency as other bella b nipple creams I had purchased, I was contacted by the founder of Bella B!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and really helped my nipples when they were raw after first few days of breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it to be a tad bit more emollient and maybe a little greasier, but I realize that in order to get the light texture, it&#x27;s not going to be as thick and clingy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s all natural, no need to wipe off before pumping or feeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think you have to try lots of different products and see what works for you.  </li>
            <li>Bella B&#x27;s butter is all natural and does not have an oily feel or taste too it.</li>
            <li>all natural, no worries of baby ingesting it, and it WORKS.</li>
            <li>I bought this when my baby was almost a month old.  </li>
            <li>It is almost 100% natural...</li>
            <li>It offers relief for soreness and keeps cracking and chapping at bay.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 100% NATURAL.</li>
            <li>I use this frequently on my nipples.</li>
            <li>Bella B Nipple Nurture Butter is completely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>The shea butter seperates easily and almost refuses to melt back down leaving a granule feeling in the cream and on your nursing area.</li>
            <li>ps - I mainly bought this item because I wanted to use some in a homemade babywipes (cloth) recipe I found, but I am using regular babywipes until my baby&#x27;s cord falls off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use it after the first 3 months, and I still have plenty left in the tube, so it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this was not due to incorrect latch, it was because i used this butter...</li>
            <li>This is really very soothing (short and long term) to my nipples.</li>
            <li>Well about 2 months into breast feeding an old enemy came back to haunt me.</li>
            <li>There is no miracle cream that takes away the soreness completely, you really just have to bite your lip the first few weeks until your nipples toughen up, but this did help with cracking and it SEEMED to make them less sore.</li>
            <li>When you have bleeding painful nipples you try everything which I did and this was the only nipple cream that helped me heal and it worked as a great pain reliever.</li>
            <li>My lactation consultant recommended to use a little nipple butter right before pumping and it helped especially in the beginning.</li>
            <li>It was thinner than I expected, but as long as I shook the tube a few times, it was fine.  </li>
            <li>I used it several times a day the first few weeks and now at three months</li>
            <li>(after making sure baby is now latching properly), change up your nursing position (try side by side laying down, or if you usually feed baby in front of you cradling, then try from one side (so baby is under your armpit area, feet pointed toward your back, head next to your breast)</li>
            <li>Nurture Butter because the lanolin that I had been using was very pasty and sticky and made a big mess.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a really great product, I love it.</li>
            <li> It smells great, much better than Lansinoh.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much I LOVE this nipple creme!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more once this tube runs out!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!</li>
            <li> SO glad I did!</li>
            <li> Love the smell!</li>
            <li> This cream is much better than the lanoish cream I was given in the hospital, cleared up my cracked &amp; bleeding nipples and had continued to protect them as I EBF my daughter!  </li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff worked amazingly well</li>
            <li> soak breast in warm salt water for 10 plus minutes - this also helped to reduce soreness for me  5.</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice, and it helped.</li>
            <li> This nipple butter is nice.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is more like a good lotion which makes its application a breeze.</li>
            <li> And as an added bonus I just started using it in my own baby wipes solution for our daughters bottom.</li>
            <li> The absolute best cream out there</li>
            <li> It applies easily, doesn&#x27;t smell, and does provide a fair amount of healing and lubrication.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is way better than Medela&#x27;s lanolin - goes on nicer, feels smoother and feels much more nourishing to my nips!</li>
            <li> Thats the most effective cream for the breastfeeding mom.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered at a great price.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy 2</li>
            <li> This cream works better than any others I have tried to soothe cracked, irritated nipples.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and texture of this stuff, but better for maintenance than it is for curing sore nipples.  </li>
            <li> then try using this product on your nipples to help prevent more soreness/dryness.  </li>
            <li> When searching for a nipple cream, many things were recommended but nothing did the job like this.</li>
            <li> and it is completely safe to ingest.</li>
            <li> This healed my nipples while breastfeeding; better than anything else I tried.  </li>
            <li> Its way better than that gummy, stinky Lanisoh stuff.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t fight me because there are 3 cute bees on the front</li>
            <li> it is safe for baby to ingest...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the Bella B Nipple Nurture Butter.  </li>
            <li> The lanolin provided more moisture protection.</li>
            <li> I read all these product reviews saying that the stretch mark products used to be creamier, or stayed on better, etc and figure that this creates a layer on the skin that would be sure to promote healing.</li>
            <li> I will update if I see results from this:)</li>
            <li> and it is better for me and the baby.</li>
            <li> Ä° love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the lanolin ones, but doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare to earth momma angel baby nipple balm.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt or irritate your nipples more when you put the product on.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use all the time and it is safe for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> My nipples were cracked and sore and after one application they felt so much better.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.</li>
            <li> I like that it is okay if the babies get it in their mouths.</li>
            <li> I use a gel that my pediatrician father gave me, and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, tastes normal and pleasant, even works for lip balm in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this and started using it in the hospital after my son was born.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great consistency, very moisturizing and glides on easily.  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth, soothing, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Of course after reading and hearing from friends about how much pain your nipples go through I was worried about how successful I would be.</li>
            <li> What a great natural and versatile product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smooth texture of the product.</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;m so happy</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy !</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It has a very mild smell&lt;br /&gt;MUCH</li>
            <li> The exchange and return were easy with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> One tube lasted three months easily.  </li>
            <li> The answer was a very quick</li>
            <li> Smells great and works so much better than the standard nipple cream.  </li>
            <li> It protects my nips and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> and she says it is really soft and is good for sore nipples :)</li>
            <li> Also, the taste seems to be fine because she doesn&#x27;t hesitate to nurse when the cream is on.</li>
            <li> and they told me it was fine</li>
            <li> Easy and smooth to apply</li>
            <li> This was a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I tried several products which did not heal but this one worked great.</li>
            <li> With my second, things were great, but I still had tenderness and scabbing issues.</li>
            <li> This sliky creamy butter was fantastic.</li>
            <li> yes, within 1 day I was healed and nursing was comfortable again.</li>
            <li> and it is lanolin free-</li>
            <li> I would never have known it was lanolin free unless I read the label.</li>
            <li> I had an allergy to the Lansinoh, and this product is lanolin free which avoids those issues.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is smooth &amp; it feels like it melts on like butter.</li>
            <li> It comes out all on its own when it warm and you really only need a drop or too.</li>
            <li> It was a good product, but far too runny.</li>
            <li> and I noticed right the way that this cream soothing much better</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients in this were great for tender nipples when you first start nursing.</li>
            <li> He explained to me what could have caused the problem &amp; personally checked to be sure the next bottle they were sending me was perfect.  </li>
            <li> He offered to replace my bottle without having to go through returning the original bottle.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t fantastic but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li> i was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> all lubricated and a pain to get clean.</li>
            <li> I got this nipple cream as a baby shower gift, and once I read that it is all natural I fell in love!</li>
            <li> But this product is just the right texture for applications throughout the day!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only nipple butter I&#x27;ve found with ALL plant-based ingredients, and I feel good putting it on, knowing my son may nurse again at any time.  </li>
            <li> I got this the day my baby was born, thanks Amazon Prime :-)</li>
            <li> My experience is that this makes it pretty good for healing, and slightly less effective for providing protection/barrier against clothes.</li>
            <li> I give it as a gift to many of my new mama friends!</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t imagine me eating petroleum, so why would I give it to my precious new baby?!</li>
            <li> I am still pregnant</li>
            <li> I found that the commonly recommended nipple cream (Lansinoh) required a great deal of working to get creamy, and applying it caused my nipples to leak most of the time.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and have had no issues with the vendor.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product because it works quickly</li>
            <li> Ä°ts fix feeding scratch quickly asap.</li>
            <li> Truth be told, they aren&#x27;t perfect or back to normal, but they are now a more acceptable version of the new normal.</li>
            <li> 6 months pregnant, am currently using the Bella B Tummy Butter and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> This product is not only soothing, but also safe for you and baby!</li>
            <li> I love that it has natural products and not oil from sheep wool!</li>
            <li> It really does feel like butter, nice &amp; creamy (not sticky and gross like other lanolin), gentle, and best of all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually the type who worried too much about that kind of thing</li>
            <li> I used it, wasn&#x27;t a huge fan, but didn&#x27;t really know what else to use.</li>
            <li> prevention is golden - make</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.   </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This along with the cold cabbage leaf treatment proved to be effective and it made my life much easier, painless, and it helped me to do what was best for my child</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that is all natural and there is no need to worry about wiping it off before letting the baby latch.</li>
            <li> so I suppose it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I prefer a more balmy texture, and this was like a cream or lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky like lansinoh and it&#x27;s all natural and safe for you and baby.</li>
            <li> This cream is great, i needed the lanolin at first, but this cream is great for later use and is better to keep in the baby bag because it is not as greasy as lanolin and doesn&#x27;t stick to your hands like crazy.</li>
            <li> I got to test it out right away</li>
            <li> He latches right on without putting up a fight and stays latched on.</li>
            <li> The other is great before you get in the shower for protecting new mommy nipples!  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different kinds of nipple cream and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, this has a wonderful texture, creamy and a little gooey, but it has enough slip that it doesn&#x27;t pull on my skin when I apply it.</li>
            <li> Not only did it alleviate the messiness since it is plant-based, but it also did a better job of relieving my soreness, and went on smoother.</li>
            <li> After breast feeding and pumping for the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li> (If you are a first time mom...and no one has told you yet...</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t a lot of negatives, in my book, although I do find that the butter either wears off or soaks into the skin pretty rapidly.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> If it is gritty when you get it, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> i used coconut oil at first.</li>
            <li> Let me say right off the bat that I thankfully haven&#x27;t had to use this product too much.</li>
            <li> I too make my own cloth wipes for my cloth diapers and never thought to use this as an ingredient, but reading other comments</li>
            <li> This product is not only vegan, but is completely chemical free and goes on so easily.</li>
            <li> I am a first time mom and really wanted to breastfeed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much this helped me during the first couple of months of breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> This is my first time breastfeeding, and my chest was ALWAYS really sore.</li>
            <li> The little &amp;#34;Scrubs&amp;#34; in this nipple butter is what I think work to relieve any kind of soreness.</li>
            <li> Lanolin was very thick, the Bella B Nipple Butter is great.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a third tube from my hospital where their sample was very creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> However, Lanolin really has never done anything once my nipples get irritated.</li>
            <li> It protects the whole</li>
            <li> This one was grainy and just didn&#x27;t give me a whole lot of relief.  </li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s others out there that do the same and are smooth not grainy</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> It was very soothing and relieved chapping within 2 nights.</li>
            <li> The lanolin doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact it is natural/plant based.</li>
            <li> I had very sore, cracked and bleeding nipples, and was ready to give up when I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> It helped so much that I decided to keep breastfeeding my baby.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t really penetrate to sooth, it just cakes on and sits there.</li>
            <li> i really like this product.</li>
            <li> It provides some relief but doesn&#x27;t really help in heeling.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t help much either.</li>
            <li> better than any other product I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT for pumping.</li>
            <li> Wife says it works way better than coconut oil, or some of the other stuff she has tried.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than other lanolins sold in stores.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite and literally saved me during those first few weeks of nursing.</li>
            <li> Wanted this because it is all natural ingredients and don&#x27;t like using lanolin from sheep, which I used for my first baby.  </li>
            <li> I only needed it for a couple of months and didn&#x27;t use the full tube.</li>
            <li> I purchased this while I was pregnant with our 3rd daughter because I planned to pump ALOT as a breastmilk donor.</li>
            <li> I figured I was better safe than sorry</li>
            <li> Wife used this during her first pregnancy and it worked overall pretty well.</li>
            <li> It helped a little, but mostly was just more oily and thicker than what I wanted, especially when I realized that there were big oily nipple marks on my shirts that wouldn&#x27;t come off during laundry from when I would walk around the house without a bra.</li>
            <li> Simply add all the ingredients, shake the jar to mix and your all set with a baby bottom wash that is completely chemical free, vegan and safe for your little ones hands &amp; face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend as an alternative to lanolin based products.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend this for any nursing mom.    </li>
            <li> I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream to every bfing mom out there</li>
            <li> I really wanted to find a safer more natural alternative to the typical brands.  </li>
            <li> Def recommended for new moms new to breast feeding!</li>
            <li> I had lanolin, which was good for protection in a shower, but it was so thick in general that it hurt to put it on after every nursing session.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few options (including the medela) and this was my favorite.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give five stars is because it comes out a little bit chunky, kind of like shea butter or coconut oil</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to new moms, definately.</li>
            <li> I give it to new nursing moms to be</li>
            <li> sure baby is latching properly (opens mouth wide, not just sucking on nipple)  if already having issues try:  2.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick at all and goes on very easily.</li>
            <li> My only word of advice - if you live in a hot climate, take care and don&#x27;t squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li> However, the first month or so of breastfeeding did take some getting used to, and so I needed the occasional relief.</li>
            <li> In a 1 quart canning jar I mix the following  3 cups hot water  </li>
            <li> In the early days this saved me!  </li>
            <li> I have trusted the bella b cream since I cam home from the hospital with my daughter, now 1 month old, Leyla!  </li>
            <li> My father recommends applying some breast milk first, air drying nipples, and then using any product for soreness and letting it absorb prior to feeding.</li>
            <li> I love this nipple cream, but when one came that was not the same consistency as other bella b nipple creams I had purchased, I was contacted by the founder of Bella B!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and really helped my nipples when they were raw after first few days of breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it to be a tad bit more emollient and maybe a little greasier, but I realize that in order to get the light texture, it&#x27;s not going to be as thick and clingy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural, no need to wipe off before pumping or feeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really think you have to try lots of different products and see what works for you.  </li>
            <li> Bella B&#x27;s butter is all natural and does not have an oily feel or taste too it.</li>
            <li> all natural, no worries of baby ingesting it, and it WORKS.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my baby was almost a month old.  </li>
            <li> It is almost 100% natural...</li>
            <li> It offers relief for soreness and keeps cracking and chapping at bay.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 100% NATURAL.</li>
            <li> I use this frequently on my nipples.</li>
            <li> Bella B Nipple Nurture Butter is completely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> The shea butter seperates easily and almost refuses to melt back down leaving a granule feeling in the cream and on your nursing area.</li>
            <li> ps - I mainly bought this item because I wanted to use some in a homemade babywipes (cloth) recipe I found, but I am using regular babywipes until my baby&#x27;s cord falls off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to use it after the first 3 months, and I still have plenty left in the tube, so it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this was not due to incorrect latch, it was because i used this butter...</li>
            <li> This is really very soothing (short and long term) to my nipples.</li>
            <li> Well about 2 months into breast feeding an old enemy came back to haunt me.</li>
            <li> There is no miracle cream that takes away the soreness completely, you really just have to bite your lip the first few weeks until your nipples toughen up, but this did help with cracking and it SEEMED to make them less sore.</li>
            <li> When you have bleeding painful nipples you try everything which I did and this was the only nipple cream that helped me heal and it worked as a great pain reliever.</li>
            <li> My lactation consultant recommended to use a little nipple butter right before pumping and it helped especially in the beginning.</li>
            <li> It was thinner than I expected, but as long as I shook the tube a few times, it was fine.  </li>
            <li> I used it several times a day the first few weeks and now at three months</li>
            <li> (after making sure baby is now latching properly), change up your nursing position (try side by side laying down, or if you usually feed baby in front of you cradling, then try from one side (so baby is under your armpit area, feet pointed toward your back, head next to your breast)</li>
            <li> Nurture Butter because the lanolin that I had been using was very pasty and sticky and made a big mess.  </li>
            <li> the first couple weeks of nursing your newborn is not easy!  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple other natural creams, but they did not even compare.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little small for how often a full time breastfeeding mother needs to use it</li>
            <li> Compared to what i hear other women say about dry cracked bleeding nipples, i have not had near the problem...</li>
            <li> exclusively pump due to baby not latching properly, but only applied it after pumping as I didn&#x27;t like how it made the flanges</li>
            <li> and it helped moisturize and mend the minor scabs and tenderness.</li>
            <li> This butter goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Baby came a bit earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> He says its the only thing that helps his rough hands to heal.</li>
            <li> This little 2oz bottle will last me the entire time I&#x27;m nursing!</li>
            <li> I also have no other use for it since I only used a small amount until my nipples were accustomed to nursing.</li>
            <li> by the time we got out of the hospital (2 days), I had deep cracks in one breast and the other was covered in a scab...</li>
            <li> (they were so dry after leaving the hospital)</li>
            <li> Dry cracked nipples,</li>
            <li> - I got a few extra on my last order just in case.</li>
            <li> I was forced to discontinue breastfeeding our second daughter because the doctors couln&#x27;t figure out what was going on when I suddenly developed a rash</li>
            <li> Well thankgod I had my Bella B Nipple Nurture cream on hand because within a single application the problem cleared up.</li>
            <li> I exchanged my first tube of this because it was very runny and grainy, I assumed it was a bad batch or got exposed to heat during delivery.  </li>
            <li> Also my daughter is 3 now and has VERY dry skin on her face.</li>
            <li> While it melts fairly easily, the chunks made it difficult to use the correct amount, and it was sometimes a bit uncomfortable rubbing it on my sensitive nipples before the chunks had a chance to melt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been a mom for a little less than three weeks</li>
            <li> A little went a long way, and I didn&#x27;t mind my baby ingesting it.</li>
            <li> Instead of using other things which she fights me with</li>
            <li> I simply apply this as needed and have had no problems since which is fantastic because our daughter is 4 months old now and having to wean her would have been devastating.</li>
            <li> it being such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> My babys also don&#x27;t mind this whereas they made faces when the tasted the medela and the other purple one.</li>
            <li> I decided I would give it a try before I bought any other kind.i</li>
            <li> I may just give it a try instead of using baby oil as the wipes are extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a crazy or disturbing scent, which I like because I&#x27;m sensitive to strong scents.</li>
            <li> My nipples get really dry and raw feeling.</li>
            <li> Having some &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; time helps keep the bacterial growth down.</li>
            <li> I used the Gerber and Lansinoh with my other children, until I decided to check out the ingredients!</li>
            <li> Used Lansinoh cream previously</li>
            <li> I had used Lansinoh lanolin in the past but found it horribly thick and difficult to apply, besides its not vegan and the whole idea of my daughter eating sheeps skin oil is just kinda gross.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it because my little girl hates it.</li>
            <li> It kept the pain down and helped me heal!  </li>
            <li> I suggest cutting the gel pad into four pieces to extend the use, otherwise you will be spending lots of money (only last 3 days once you use them)  4.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice alternative to the nasty stuff the hospitals supply.</li>
            <li> It is a heavy salve as some commenters have mentioned but</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is having trouble with breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> It was unavailable for a few weeks on amazon</li>
            <li> If you can get past having to wipe off the little balls of junky shea butter</li>
            <li> so i am not sure what the baby thinks of it</li>
            <li> i put a small amount of this on her face.</li>
            <li> No more steroid creams for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying such a small bottle for what seemed like a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> my nipples were raw and sore!</li>
            <li> With my first I had a horrible time with cracking, bleeding and a bunch of other issues.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to apply on unlike Lanisoh (hard , sticky texture hurts when applied on).</li>
            <li> It is creamy (like butter) and not so thick and greasy like lanolin.</li>
            <li> Thick cream that can be put on both before &amp; after nursing</li>
            <li> and  I was astonished that he was personally concerned about my bad experience with his product.  </li>
            <li> he had a bad latch on the left side, and baby boy loves it!</li>
            <li> Some were too thick (Lansinoh Lanolin) and some were too thin (Medela brand).</li>
            <li> very thick butter cream, cost performanced choice</li>
            <li> I am allergic to wool, so it figures that the lanolin breast creams were making my sore ta-tas worse.  </li>
            <li> I started using the product after 6 weeks of breastfeeding torture, and within 2 days I saw a dramatic difference in the appearance and sensation of my nipples.</li>
            <li> I have some left still, but I am afraid to run out!!  </li>
            <li> It has helped me heal through some tough times!  </li>
            <li> try something cold on your nipple area - like Soothies gel pads from Lansinoh or pads from Medela (I used soothies, haven&#x27;t tried Medela brand)</li>
            <li> When I started breastfeeding and it was difficult and painful</li>
            <li> I use Bella B products for everything and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Skip this and buy earth momma, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> Having to spead on lanolin was just as dreadful as her nursing.</li>
            <li> I hated lanolin though!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish I knew this product existed with my 1st baby. The little &amp;#34;Scrubs&amp;#34; in this nipple butter is what I think work to relieve any kind of soreness. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Let me say right off the bat that I thankfully haven&#x27;t had to use this product too much. However, the first month or so of breastfeeding did take some getting used to, and so I needed the occasional relief. I started off with the traditional Lansinoh Lanolin that comes in the purple tube. It helped a little, but mostly was just more oily and thicker than what I wanted, especially when I realized that there were big oily nipple marks on my shirts that wouldn&#x27;t come off during laundry from when I would walk around the house without a bra. And so I found this product! This was a huge improvement. Not only did it alleviate the messiness since it is plant-based, but it also did a better job of relieving my soreness, and went on smoother. I only wish I had used this from the start!</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  It keeps my belly lubricated.  Make sure you buy 2 they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been a mom for a little less than three weeks and I haven&#x27;t had much in the way of chafing, but the few times I did experience nipple irritation this balm helped a lot. I&#x27;ve used it on my lips (they were so dry after leaving the hospital) and I think it aided in their healing. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Could not survive without this cream.  Great consistency, very moisturizing and glides on easily.  Used Lansinoh cream previously and I didn&#x27;t like the sticky texture.  This cream works better than any others I have tried to soothe cracked, irritated nipples.</li>
            <li> This product has been wonderful. I still use the purple brand of Lanolin before my showers, to keep the water off and avoid irritation from breast pads. However, Lanolin really has never done anything once my nipples get irritated. This product actually makes the soreness go away. I use it just before bed each night, to prevent further irritation and heal damage that my son does during the day. It&#x27;s a really great product, I love it.</li>
            <li> This cream is great, i needed the lanolin at first, but this cream is great for later use and is better to keep in the baby bag because it is not as greasy as lanolin and doesn&#x27;t stick to your hands like crazy.</li>
            <li> I am a first time mom and really wanted to breastfeed. Of course after reading and hearing from friends about how much pain your nipples go through I was worried about how successful I would be. However my baby now latches on great and this product protects the nipple from baby and pumping perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural, no need to wipe off before pumping or feeding.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your breast and nipple feel great. Moisturized and protected&lt;br /&gt;It has a very mild smell&lt;br /&gt;MUCH better than any other product I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT for pumping. I apply to my entire breast area prior to pumping. It protects the whole area.&lt;br /&gt;Use before and after feedings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay. The shea butter seperates easily and almost refuses to melt back down leaving a granule feeling in the cream and on your nursing area. Smells nice, tastes normal and pleasant, even works for lip balm in a pinch. If you can get past having to wipe off the little balls of junky shea butter it&#x27;s a nice alternative to the nasty stuff the hospitals supply.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I tried several products which did not heal but this one worked great. I highly recommend as an alternative to lanolin based products.</li>
            <li> I really think you have to try lots of different products and see what works for you.  This one was grainy and just didn&#x27;t give me a whole lot of relief.  The stuff that worked for me was the Medela Tender Care and MotherLove.  That said, to each her own!  This might work great on someone else.</li>
            <li> Wanted this because it is all natural ingredients and don&#x27;t like using lanolin from sheep, which I used for my first baby.  However, didn&#x27;t help cure sore nipples from breastfeeding for me.  I like the smell and texture of this stuff, but better for maintenance than it is for curing sore nipples.  To treat or prevent sore nipples, here are my tricks:  1. prevention is golden - make sure baby is latching properly (opens mouth wide, not just sucking on nipple)  if already having issues try:  2. (after making sure baby is now latching properly), change up your nursing position (try side by side laying down, or if you usually feed baby in front of you cradling, then try from one side (so baby is under your armpit area, feet pointed toward your back, head next to your breast) so the same part is not being irritated. I think this helped me more than anything else!!  3. try something cold on your nipple area - like Soothies gel pads from Lansinoh or pads from Medela (I used soothies, haven&#x27;t tried Medela brand) - this provided me SOME temporary relief.  I suggest cutting the gel pad into four pieces to extend the use, otherwise you will be spending lots of money (only last 3 days once you use them)  4. soak breast in warm salt water for 10 plus minutes - this also helped to reduce soreness for me  5. then try using this product on your nipples to help prevent more soreness/dryness.  Hope this helps!!!  From day 1 with my baby I was having problems on one side because of my baby&#x27;s latching issues, and went weeks in pain - finally was so unbearable, I started using the tips above (that I found online and tried) and my pain FINALLY went away in about 2 days.  Good luck!!!   ps - I mainly bought this item because I wanted to use some in a homemade babywipes (cloth) recipe I found, but I am using regular babywipes until my baby&#x27;s cord falls off.</li>
            <li> Bella B Nipple Nurture Butter is completely worth the money spent. When searching for a nipple cream, many things were recommended but nothing did the job like this. Cracked and blistered nipples felt instantly relieved and healed within days. At the hospital, we received the generic Lanolin cream but our daughter would not latch on once I had applied it. She&#x27;d start to and then give us a grimace and pull away. Bella B&#x27;s butter is all natural and does not have an oily feel or taste too it. She had no problem feeding while this was on and it is completely safe to ingest. The bottle is a little small for how often a full time breastfeeding mother needs to use it but it is worth it.   This is mother tested and daughter approved so I&#x27;d recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different kinds of nipple cream and this is by far the best. Some were too thick (Lansinoh Lanolin) and some were too thin (Medela brand). This is the perfect texture! I am an exclusive pumper and this works great to use while pumping...and it&#x27;s organic!!!</li>
            <li> I exchanged my first tube of this because it was very runny and grainy, I assumed it was a bad batch or got exposed to heat during delivery.  The second tube had the same problem so I returned it.  The exchange and return were easy with Amazon.  I ended up buying a third tube from my hospital where their sample was very creamy and smooth.  However, the tube I bought had the same grainy texture as those from Amazon so I can&#x27;t use it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff although dealing with amazon is no problem.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much I LOVE this nipple creme! With my first I had a horrible time with cracking, bleeding and a bunch of other issues. Having to spead on lanolin was just as dreadful as her nursing. With my second, things were great, but I still had tenderness and scabbing issues. This sliky creamy butter was fantastic. No pain to spread on since it&#x27;s like honey consistency (without the sticky though) and it helped moisturize and mend the minor scabs and tenderness. My only word of advice - if you live in a hot climate, take care and don&#x27;t squeeze the bottle. It comes out all on its own when it warm and you really only need a drop or too. This little 2oz bottle will last me the entire time I&#x27;m nursing!</li>
            <li> absolutely best stuff ever!!! all natural, no worries of baby ingesting it, and it WORKS. Heals/prevents/soothes chapped skin, chaffing....I even used it on my lips once when I was out of chap stick. I would never buy anything else. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This healed my nipples while breastfeeding; better than anything else I tried.  It is very smooth, soothing, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! After breast feeding and pumping for the first 3 weeks my nipples were raw and sore! This product is not only soothing, but also safe for you and baby! I was skeptical about buying such a small bottle for what seemed like a ridiculous price. This butter goes a long way. I have used it for 3 weeks and have yet to make a dent in the bottle. Wonderful product. I use Bella B products for everything and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I did not like the consistency of this product. It was very grainy and not smooth at all. I will not buy again. If does for job but there&#x27;s others out there that do the same and are smooth not grainy</li>
            <li> I just had a baby three weeks ago and needed something to help with nipple soreness. This stuff is nice, and it helped. There is no miracle cream that takes away the soreness completely, you really just have to bite your lip the first few weeks until your nipples toughen up, but this did help with cracking and it SEEMED to make them less sore. I would recommend this to new moms, definately. Its way better than that gummy, stinky Lanisoh stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my baby was almost a month old.  I had lanolin, which was good for protection in a shower, but it was so thick in general that it hurt to put it on after every nursing session.  Enter this Nurture Butter.  Ahhhh, it was immediately soothing.  It was thinner than I expected, but as long as I shook the tube a few times, it was fine.  A little went a long way, and I didn&#x27;t mind my baby ingesting it. I only needed it for a couple of months and didn&#x27;t use the full tube. Now I give this to friends as part of baby shower gifts.</li>
            <li> It does the job but I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t started nursing yet but I have nursed my younger daughter before and was using Lanolin. Lanolin was very thick, the Bella B Nipple Butter is great. It isn&#x27;t thick at all and goes on very easily. I am still pregnant so i am not sure what the baby thinks of it but i am basically using it now to prepare and avoid dryness and cracks, something that I didn&#x27;t do before.   I have bought 2 bottles, I am thinking of getting another one. Also my daughter is 3 now and has VERY dry skin on her face. Instead of using other things which she fights me with i put a small amount of this on her face. She doesn&#x27;t fight me because there are 3 cute bees on the front and she says it makes her face feel very nice.   Overall a good buy !</li>
            <li> This nipple butter is nice. It doesn&#x27;t have a crazy or disturbing scent, which I like because I&#x27;m sensitive to strong scents. I like that it comes in a convenient tube, as opposed to a jar with a twist-off cap. The only reason I don&#x27;t give five stars is because it comes out a little bit chunky, kind of like shea butter or coconut oil does sometimes. While it melts fairly easily, the chunks made it difficult to use the correct amount, and it was sometimes a bit uncomfortable rubbing it on my sensitive nipples before the chunks had a chance to melt.</li>
            <li> As any nursing mother will attest... the first couple weeks of nursing your newborn is not easy!  You will be sore!  (If you are a first time mom...and no one has told you yet... YOU WILL BE SORE!)  I have 4 children and I have nursed all of them.  I hated lanolin though!  Bella B Nipple Nurture FAR-FAR surpasses lanolin.  It is creamy (like butter) and not so thick and greasy like lanolin. It is almost 100% natural... it is safe for baby to ingest... so you don&#x27;t have to be concerned about wiping it off before each feeding.  (Another convenience in comparison to lanolin.) It offers relief for soreness and keeps cracking and chapping at bay.  I would highly recommend!  I could not have survived nursing without Bella B!</li>
            <li> I use both the lanolin butter and this product.  The other is great before you get in the shower for protecting new mommy nipples!  But this product is just the right texture for applications throughout the day!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best.  It&#x27;s the only nipple butter I&#x27;ve found with ALL plant-based ingredients, and I feel good putting it on, knowing my son may nurse again at any time.  It has helped me heal through some tough times!  I give it as a gift to many of my new mama friends!</li>
            <li> I got this the day my baby was born, thanks Amazon Prime :-) Baby came a bit earlier than expected.  I looked into a lot of different products and finally settled on Bella B.  I got to test it out right away and it was wonderfully soothing.  I used it several times a day the first few weeks and now at three months out I use it after my morning shower and after I pump in the evenings.  It smells great, much better than Lansinoh.  It is a heavy salve as some commenters have mentioned but that&#x27;s what I wanted, and if you use just a dab it does the job.  One tube lasted three months easily.  Now that I&#x27;m going back to work (sob!) I&#x27;m getting a tube to keep with my pump.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered at a great price.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I prefer this product over Medela lanolin cream that I got from the hospital. I used the Madela lanolin cream at the hospital and when I came home I started using this product and I noticed right the way that this cream soothing much better then the Medela one it healed my cracked nipples that I got from breastfeeding at the hospital I put it before and after breastfeeding. Happy to have this product.</li>
            <li> I got this about a week ago and have been using it ever since.  My breasts have been \\&quot;practicing\\&quot; for a while now and sometimes get sore or chapped.  You only have to use a drop or two of this product at a time so I see it lasting for a looooong loooong time.  It was very soothing and relieved chapping within 2 nights.</li>
            <li> I purchased this while I was pregnant with our 3rd daughter because I planned to pump ALOT as a breastmilk donor. I figured I was better safe than sorry so I wanted to have it on hand. Well about 2 months into breast feeding an old enemy came back to haunt me. Dry cracked nipples, YIKES. I was forced to discontinue breastfeeding our second daughter because the doctors couln&#x27;t figure out what was going on when I suddenly developed a rash and my nipples were bleeding which left me writhing in pain everytime our toddler tried to nurse. Imagine my horror when the problem sprung up again this time around just 2 months into nursing baby #3. Well thankgod I had my Bella B Nipple Nurture cream on hand because within a single application the problem cleared up. No more steroid creams for me. I simply apply this as needed and have had no problems since which is fantastic because our daughter is 4 months old now and having to wean her would have been devastating. I had used Lansinoh lanolin in the past but found it horribly thick and difficult to apply, besides its not vegan and the whole idea of my daughter eating sheeps skin oil is just kinda gross. This product is not only vegan, but is completely chemical free and goes on so easily. It&#x27;s texture is more like a good lotion which makes its application a breeze. I would highly reccomend this for any nursing mom.    And as an added bonus I just started using it in my own baby wipes solution for our daughters bottom. Works great. Here is my recipe  In a 1 quart canning jar I mix the following  3 cups hot water  2 tsp Earth Mama Angel Baby body wash   [...]  1/8 tsp Bella B Nipple Nurture  2 tsp Vegetable Glycerine   [...]    Simply add all the ingredients, shake the jar to mix and your all set with a baby bottom wash that is completely chemical free, vegan and safe for your little ones hands &amp; face.</li>
            <li> When I started breastfeeding and it was difficult and painful I purchased a variety of products to make the process easier. If you&#x27;re wanting to avoid an animal product like lanolin, I&#x27;d recommend this product. How someone thought of putting something derived from sheep&#x27;s wool on a sore breast is beyond me. This along with the cold cabbage leaf treatment proved to be effective and it made my life much easier, painless, and it helped me to do what was best for my child and that is priceless.</li>
            <li> I kept my lanolin and also bought this based on customer reviews.  This is really very soothing (short and long term) to my nipples. The lanolin doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for me. This protects and soothes. I just ordered my second tube after a month of use.  I have some left still, but I am afraid to run out!!  I recommend this over any of the lanolin products out there (I tried them).</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the Bella B Nipple Nurture Butter.  I have been breast feeding for a month and this product has allowed me to do it while preventing any damage to my nipples. I also love the fact that is all natural and there is no need to worry about wiping it off before letting the baby latch.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because, being an exclusive pumper, my nipples and areolae were getting itchy and flakey. I found that the commonly recommended nipple cream (Lansinoh) required a great deal of working to get creamy, and applying it caused my nipples to leak most of the time. I wanted something that had a lighter texture, and provided healing and lubricating properties.  On the plus side, this has a wonderful texture, creamy and a little gooey, but it has enough slip that it doesn&#x27;t pull on my skin when I apply it. The scent is not objectionable - in fact, I can&#x27;t recall any scent properties at all, which in my book is a plus. It applies easily, doesn&#x27;t smell, and does provide a fair amount of healing and lubrication.  There aren&#x27;t a lot of negatives, in my book, although I do find that the butter either wears off or soaks into the skin pretty rapidly. I&#x27;d like it to be a tad bit more emollient and maybe a little greasier, but I realize that in order to get the light texture, it&#x27;s not going to be as thick and clingy. My experience is that this makes it pretty good for healing, and slightly less effective for providing protection/barrier against clothes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to find a safer more natural alternative to the typical brands.  And I found that in this product!  In the early days this saved me!  I lathered it on to take a shower, after my shower, between nursing and before bed!  It kept the pain down and helped me heal!  I didn&#x27;t have to use it after the first 3 months, and I still have plenty left in the tube, so it goes a long way.  But man did it stain!!  Never forget to put your nursing pads on when using it.  I ruined multiple tanks with big nipple located grease stains because my mommy brain forgot the pads!  So if you&#x27;re buying this, go buy some nursing pads too!!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the hospital gave me some lanolin and I preferred using the lanolin. The lanolin provided more moisture protection. My nipples get really dry and raw feeling.</li>
            <li> This cream feels good on, if you can get it out of the tube.  I have to put this under my leg to heat it up while my son nurses or I&#x27;m pumping in order to get it out of the bottle.  So for that reason I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something that did not come from animals and its perfect</li>
            <li> A little pricey for it being such a small bottle. I hear it is one of the best creams around though so I suppose it is worth the price. I am including it in a baby shower gift, I hope they like it! I really like the fact it is natural/plant based.</li>
            <li> This was initially given to me as a gift by a friend but I have been buying it for myself ever since. Thick cream that can be put on both before &amp; after nursing and I don&#x27;t need to worry about the ingredients and it&#x27;s affect on my baby. I received this product quickly and have had no issues with the vendor.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients in this were great for tender nipples when you first start nursing. The product practically melts when you put it on. I also decided to try it for stretch marks because of all the healing ingredients in it. I also have no other use for it since I only used a small amount until my nipples were accustomed to nursing. I read all these product reviews saying that the stretch mark products used to be creamier, or stayed on better, etc and figure that this creates a layer on the skin that would be sure to promote healing. I will update if I see results from this:)</li>
            <li> This stuff has everything that I was looking for.My lactation consultant recommended to use a little nipple butter right before pumping and it helped especially in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much this helped me during the first couple of months of breastfeeding. If you use this after every time you feed, you will get quite a lot of relief.</li>
            <li> very nice product, loved it....</li>
            <li> Wife says it works way better than coconut oil, or some of the other stuff she has tried. Will be ordering more once this tube runs out!</li>
            <li> I love that it has natural products and not oil from sheep wool! Def recommended for new moms new to breast feeding!</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I used the Gerber and Lansinoh with my other children, until I decided to check out the ingredients! I&#x27;m not usually the type who worried too much about that kind of thing but I couldn&#x27;t imagine me eating petroleum, so why would I give it to my precious new baby?! The only concern I had was the if the  product would help me. The answer was a very quick yes, within 1 day I was healed and nursing was comfortable again. I recommend this product because it works quickly and it is better for me and the baby. Also, the taste seems to be fine because she doesn&#x27;t hesitate to nurse when the cream is on. I will be buying this again for any of my friends and family who will be nursing!</li>
            <li> Thats the most effective cream for the breastfeeding mom. Ä°ts fix feeding scratch quickly asap. Ä° love it. Ä°m using 5 years.</li>
            <li> This nipple butter goes beyond the lubricating powers of Lanolin by actually soothing and helping heal cracked nipples.  I started using the product after 6 weeks of breastfeeding torture, and within 2 days I saw a dramatic difference in the appearance and sensation of my nipples. Truth be told, they aren&#x27;t perfect or back to normal, but they are now a more acceptable version of the new normal.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Bella B Nipple Nurture Butter because the lanolin that I had been using was very pasty and sticky and made a big mess.  This stuff truly kept me from quitting breastfeeding.  I had very sore, cracked and bleeding nipples, and was ready to give up when I tried this product.  It helped so much that I decided to keep breastfeeding my baby.  The trick is to use it both immediately before and after nursing.  I would recommend this to anyone who is having trouble with breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> After delivering my son, I was given sample packets of Medela lanolin at the hospital to help with sore nipples. I used it, wasn&#x27;t a huge fan, but didn&#x27;t really know what else to use. I searched on Amazon, read lots of reviews, and decided on Nipple Nurture. SO glad I did! This stuff is way better than Medela&#x27;s lanolin - goes on nicer, feels smoother and feels much more nourishing to my nips! Great product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Does what it claims.  Lasts forever.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite and literally saved me during those first few weeks of nursing. We buy this often and actually my husband uses it as well for his hands. He says its the only thing that helps his rough hands to heal. highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best nipple cream and trust me I&#x27;ve tried them all! When you have bleeding painful nipples you try everything which I did and this was the only nipple cream that helped me heal and it worked as a great pain reliever.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works so much better than the standard nipple cream.  If it is gritty when you get it, it&#x27;s okay. I had called the company and they told me it was fine said I could still use it and they also sent me another just because. What a great company.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. I tried a few options (including the medela) and this was my favorite. Soothing and definitely gave me relief. I&#x27;d recommend to nursing or pumping moms!</li>
            <li> 6 months pregnant, am currently using the Bella B Tummy Butter and LOVE it!  Saw this product and thought it would be perfect to use when breastfeeding.  Love the smell!</li>
            <li> It was a good product, but far too runny. I prefer a more balmy texture, and this was like a cream or lotion.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. This works so much better than other lanolins sold in stores. My babys also don&#x27;t mind this whereas they made faces when the tasted the medela and the other purple one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter and she really likes it. The baby does not however.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the lanolin ones, but doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare to earth momma angel baby nipple balm. Skip this and buy earth momma, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. This stuff doesn&#x27;t really penetrate to sooth, it just cakes on and sits there.</li>
            <li> This product totally rocks.  Easy and smooth to apply and it is lanolin free- I am allergic to wool, so it figures that the lanolin breast creams were making my sore ta-tas worse.  So glad I tried this- I give it to new nursing moms to be and they all rave about it.  Can&#x27;t imagine nursing without it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this and started using it in the hospital after my son was born.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on after every feeding per the instructions. by the time we got out of the hospital (2 days), I had deep cracks in one breast and the other was covered in a scab...once i got home i started using the lanolin and it has taken 3 days, but it is finally healing...&lt;br /&gt;this was not due to incorrect latch, it was because i used this butter...very bummed as it was not cheap and i read all the reviews before buying.  hopefully im the only one with this issue though, because i wouldnt wish the cracking nips on anybody!!</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s nipples be hurtin&#x27; but I got this for her and she says it is really soft and is good for sore nipples :)</li>
            <li> very thick butter cream, cost performanced choice</li>
            <li> I am using this instead of Lanolin cream and I actually prefer this product. It hydrates the nipple and baby is not bothered by it at all. I would never have known it was lanolin free unless I read the label.</li>
            <li> This is my first time breastfeeding, and my chest was ALWAYS really sore. Lanolin was keeping my nipples from getting chapped, but was doing nothing for the soreness. THIS DID! I LOVE the smooth texture of the product. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or irritate your nipples more when you put the product on. It really does feel like butter, nice &amp; creamy (not sticky and gross like other lanolin), gentle, and best of all it&#x27;s 100% NATURAL. I highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I love this nipple cream, but when one came that was not the same consistency as other bella b nipple creams I had purchased, I was contacted by the founder of Bella B!  I left a review on amazon regarding the nipple cream and  I was astonished that he was personally concerned about my bad experience with his product.  He explained to me what could have caused the problem &amp; personally checked to be sure the next bottle they were sending me was perfect.  He offered to replace my bottle without having to go through returning the original bottle.  I have trusted the bella b cream since I cam home from the hospital with my daughter, now 1 month old, Leyla!  This cream is much better than the lanoish cream I was given in the hospital, cleared up my cracked &amp; bleeding nipples and had continued to protect them as I EBF my daughter!  I love that I can use all the time and it is safe for my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;Best customer service I have ever witnessed!  *This coming from someone who has worked in customer service all her life!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all breastfeeding mothers.  I had an allergy to the Lansinoh, and this product is lanolin free which avoids those issues.  It also is not as greasy as the lanolin based products.  Another plus is that it actually washes off in the shower.  This allows you to have some time to &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34; after your shower.  Having some &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; time helps keep the bacterial growth down.</li>
            <li> i really like this product. It protects my nips and washes off easily. when i nurse, my son doesnt find the flavor to be offensive. Compared to what i hear other women say about dry cracked bleeding nipples, i have not had near the problem...i attribute this to bella bee!</li>
            <li> It feels soothing. It&#x27;s texture is smooth &amp; it feels like it melts on like butter. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to apply on unlike Lanisoh (hard , sticky texture hurts when applied on).</li>
            <li> Wife used this during her first pregnancy and it worked overall pretty well. The smell isn&#x27;t fantastic but it&#x27;s not bad either. I would suggest doing research and seeing what works for everyone.</li>
            <li> I got this nipple cream as a baby shower gift, and once I read that it is all natural I fell in love! Me being the penny pinching person that I am I decided I would give it a try before I bought any other kind.i exclusively pump due to baby not latching properly, but only applied it after pumping as I didn&#x27;t like how it made the flanges all lubricated and a pain to get clean. Once baby boy latched after several weeks I again had been applying it after I bf bc that&#x27;s what I was used to doig.  but I decided to apply it prior to feeding one day bc he had a bad latch on the left side, and baby boy loves it! He latches right on without putting up a fight and stays latched on. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to nurse on the left side anymore! My nipples were cracked and sore and after one application they felt so much better. Being this is the only nipple cream I&#x27;ve tried, I don&#x27;t plan on using anything else. I too make my own cloth wipes for my cloth diapers and never thought to use this as an ingredient, but reading other comments I may just give it a try instead of using baby oil as the wipes are extremely greasy. I highly recommend this cream to every bfing mom out there</li>
            <li> This will be my 2nd time I will use this! I really love this product. It doesn&#x27;t smell. It works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I came across this product. There is no smell, no residue, just relief from sore nipples! It was unavailable for a few weeks on amazon and I was heartbroken. Wow I&#x27;m so happy it&#x27;s back - I got a few extra on my last order just in case. Great product!</li>
            <li> If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. This stuff worked amazingly well and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> What a great natural and versatile product! We love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on recommendation from a friend for sore breastfeeding nipples. I have twins so my sore nipples NEVER get a break since I breastfeed 95% of the time, and use formula the remaining 5% from a cup or with a spoon. No bottles. So I never have time to heal. I use this frequently on my nipples. As another reviewer mentioned, this does not absorb and has grainy particles. I apply it and cover my nipples so it probably gets on clothing. It provides some relief but doesn&#x27;t really help in heeling. I like that it is okay if the babies get it in their mouths. I use a gel that my pediatrician father gave me, and it works much better. However, I still use this product and save the gel for bigger feedings. My father recommends applying some breast milk first, air drying nipples, and then using any product for soreness and letting it absorb prior to feeding. I use the gel in this fashion and it helps.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and really helped my nipples when they were raw after first few days of breastfeeding. Still using it</li>
            <li> i was excited to try it. i used coconut oil at first. However I had to apply it a lot. So in comes this cream... i couldn&#x27;t get her to latch when i had put this on. it didn&#x27;t help much either. Even if I did like it I couldn&#x27;t use it because my little girl hates it.</li>
            <li> The absolute best cream out there</li>
            <li> This is the very BEST nipple moisturizer/protector you can buy. I don&#x27;t think I could have survived without it! It&#x27;s not sticky like lansinoh and it&#x27;s all natural and safe for you and baby. I tried a couple other natural creams, but they did not even compare. You will NOT be disappointed with this product!</li>
