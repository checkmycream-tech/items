            <li>Love this kit!</li>
            <li>Love this set!</li>
            <li>The brush guards are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing idea but to me it didn&#x27;t work as well as it should.</li>
            <li>The drying cup is nice, but to me it is just a cup with holes which is always good to me :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with the cleaner.</li>
            <li>To be completely honest here I never cleaned my brushes before.</li>
            <li>I like the drying and washing station and the towel from this kit, I own brush guard before I brought this kit.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Its nice that they include some in this kit.  </li>
            <li>I have been giving this as gifts and all my friends have also liked it.</li>
            <li>I own lot of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>The Washing cup: I liked the idea</li>
            <li>The liquid dispenses nicely.</li>
            <li>The brush guards keep the brushes nicely shaped.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome product which has stopped the problem and made my brushes look like new!</li>
            <li>, I was pretty happy with this</li>
            <li>With this kit, the textured washing cup made a great lather that really broke up the make up and</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>(Synthetic hair brushes are more forgiving to be used and handled this way.)</li>
            <li>The cloth is more on the plush side for this type and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>But overall, this is a great deal for a cleaning kit!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>all I was semi satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>would have made more vents and spaced them closer to maximize the airflow.</li>
            <li>going to order more for birthday and Christmas giftys</li>
            <li>After I started using it, I ordered some more Brush Guard packs, for the rest of my brushes :-)</li>
            <li>It gets your make up brushes nice and clean.</li>
            <li>However I did feel my brushes were nice a clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Shop around for a better deal :) PEACE, LOVE and LIGHT</li>
            <li>Gets my brushes super clean and smelling good.</li>
            <li>My brushes haven&#x27;t been this clean since I bought them!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, complete cleaning kit.  </li>
            <li>The Squeaky Clean Brush Shampoo: This was ok.</li>
            <li>i bought the whole kit because i really needed some nice cup to put my brushes in normally, and i figured this would be the perfect opportunity with all the extras (shampoo, washing station, towel and guards).</li>
            <li>I will not return the item as I can certainly use it again and to be fair it did clean my brushes.</li>
            <li>but I to me it has a huge design flaw.</li>
            <li>I am also a huge fan of the Bdellium travel size brushes; which measure around 5 inches in length.</li>
            <li>This kit was such a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>i like the brush guard system, it really helps keep my brushes shaped nicely, i just wish it came with a wider variety of brush guard mesh thingies</li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow and the cleaning solution gets my brushes squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>These are a fabulous buy.</li>
            <li>the idea/concept is fantastic, but I would change a couple of things.  </li>
            <li>But to be fair - I have used many brush cleaners and have found them to be similar.</li>
            <li>My former method of washing swirling the brush in my hand was good, but this cup is better.  </li>
            <li>A classmate had originally given me a set for free.  </li>
            <li>Even though the towel is small, it feels really nice and great for wiping off excess water from the brushes before putting it in the brush guards.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it all nestles together which is great for those of us that have little room to begin with.</li>
            <li>Depending on what you use your brush for; it may not get clean with just shampooing.</li>
            <li>even a dome blush brush won&#x27;t fit.the brush shampoo is alright, not too special about it.</li>
            <li>I used to rub the brush head with brush shampoo on the palm of my hand to create a lather which made my hands very dry and the lather was not that great.  </li>
            <li>The full variety pack of brush guard for the brushes was not included as described...</li>
            <li>However, considering the design of inner pot (for washing) and outer pot (for drying), the blotting cloth (good absorbancy) and the cover...</li>
            <li>its just the right size to fit in my under sink cupboard.</li>
            <li>It also has a convenient super absorbent blotting cloth and a drying bowl.</li>
            <li>This little system is perfect for cleaning and drying your brushes and making sure there&#x27;s no water left in the bristles.  </li>
            <li>My face has experienced less breakouts, too.</li>
            <li>I owned them previously and have been happy with the set.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>However - I do own full-length brushes and I cleaned them with ease.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The washing station&#x27;s surface creates abundant foam which really cleaned my brushes and then rinses completely clean with barely any effort.    </li>
            <li>Everything is solid and it all fits together so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my bathroom, which is good, since I don&#x27;t have a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t think this was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love that they have a variety of sizes to fit big, medium, and the smallest brushes (eyeliner and brow brushes).  </li>
            <li>I also own different sizes (5 in.</li>
            <li>This one cleaned the brushes as expected but when it came to the concealer brushes I felt I needed to clean them again, and I used my own preferred soap.</li>
            <li>I like the bare minerals cleaner a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love the shape that it gives my brush after it dries and it is a great tool to dry my brushes upside down.  </li>
            <li>while i will never repurchase their brush shampoo (olive or baby oil and dish soap are much cheaper and work just, if not more effectively), i like having a towel i know is specifically for brush drying and a washing station (it does work better than a hand).</li>
            <li>I wanted to finish using my Sephora brush shampoo first.</li>
            <li>The soap works pretty well though</li>
            <li>:) I only paid 19.99 for the kit at Ulta.</li>
            <li>First ofall</li>
            <li>I think that they missed the instructions ;-)</li>
            <li>The drying cup is big enough for all of my brushes, which is good, since it means I can take care of them all at much.    </li>
            <li>The brush slips messed up the bristles on one of my brushes, so be careful if you have super fine brushes.</li>
            <li>Also, this product is pushing a much need message, &amp;#34;Clean</li>
            <li>your makeup brushes, keeps your makeup contaminate free and last longer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It was a real wake-up call.  </li>
            <li>Be gentle when cleaning your brushes</li>
            <li>My daughters use it for their brushes too, thanks a bunch guys</li>
            <li>I was getting ready to throw away my expenisve makeup brushes which I&#x27;ve had for years as they no longer were functioning as they were suppose to.  </li>
            <li>My hand barely fit in the cup for me to place the brushes close enough to the textured bottom to swirl it around.</li>
            <li>I felt that I put way too much effort in this process.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the washing cup is textured so it seems to really help and get the makeup out of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>The scrubbing bowl has a rough bottom to gently scrub out the brushes better than you can with just your fingers.</li>
            <li>They looked like new brushes after the first use.</li>
            <li>Overall I felt the brushes felt clean.</li>
            <li>It got all of the makeup and grime off of my brushes and they all look brand new!</li>
            <li>when my brushes are guarded and drying i use the cup for that, and then dry it out and store my brushes upright on my desk.</li>
            <li>I had specific issues with the components individually, which is more a design issue rather that the function of the product that they advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the color teal.</li>
            <li>It cleans my brushes really well and makes them so soft!</li>
            <li>Many of the new formulations contain ingredients that are almost &#x60;water resistant&#x27;, so you have to break down the product before you can get the water and shampoo to do its&#x27; job.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Also, I really like the cleaning solution; it seems to work better than my usual baby wash.  </li>
            <li>If you use a brush for foundation, concealer, long-wearing cream eye shadow, primers, liners, etc., then you most likely need to dip your brush in a solvent based cleaner first, blot it on a paper towel until you &#x27;break down&#x27; or dissolve the product on the brush.</li>
            <li>The brush shampoo works so much better than plain soap.</li>
            <li>Then I tried the brush cleaning kit and all my brushes were like brand new.  </li>
            <li>I would like a new one.</li>
            <li>The blotting cloth is very soft and absorbent.  </li>
            <li>If you,re on a budget, it wouldn&#x27;t be worth to buy this whole set because you can get the brush guards for 5 dollars and the other stuff that come with  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This left my brushes fresh and back in new condition.</li>
            <li>I am not a makeup expert ~ by far.</li>
            <li>--don&#x27;t splay them out, just shampoo the tips and capillary action</li>
            <li>My brushes range from synthetic and natural hairs.</li>
            <li>Mines must be extremely old.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect this kit to clean all your brushes equally, as not all brushes are equal or get used the same.</li>
            <li>This is my only main complaint.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read the directions, as you first wet the brush, then put a drop of shampoo into the wash cup, then swirl, buff and wash your brush in the cup.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a cup with a rough bottom to clean and brushes thoroughly as well as perforated holders and a cup,  allowing the brushes to air dry.</li>
            <li>The brush guards really do make a difference in the brush heads when they are dry.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes when I received this product after several online reviews and YouTube channels.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all you need in this little kit, very practical, it will really make your brushes look the same way they looked when you bought them.  </li>
            <li>, it can only fit a small blush brush,</li>
            <li>I had previously been washing my brushes out with plain hand soap, but this is infinitely better.</li>
            <li>My make up brush had so much build up, even though I was washed them with other cleaning products, that the brush soaked up alot of make up and</li>
            <li>this set are only brush shampoo, a small towel and 2 small cups, which you can always improvise for a baby shampoo and your own similar cups at home that you dont use.</li>
            <li>I am aware that due to the density of some brushes it might take longer to dry.</li>

            <li> its just the right size to fit in my under sink cupboard.</li>
            <li> It also has a convenient super absorbent blotting cloth and a drying bowl.</li>
            <li> This little system is perfect for cleaning and drying your brushes and making sure there&#x27;s no water left in the bristles.  </li>
            <li> My face has experienced less breakouts, too.</li>
            <li> I owned them previously and have been happy with the set.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> However - I do own full-length brushes and I cleaned them with ease.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The washing station&#x27;s surface creates abundant foam which really cleaned my brushes and then rinses completely clean with barely any effort.    </li>
            <li> Everything is solid and it all fits together so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my bathroom, which is good, since I don&#x27;t have a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t think this was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love that they have a variety of sizes to fit big, medium, and the smallest brushes (eyeliner and brow brushes).  </li>
            <li> I also own different sizes (5 in.</li>
            <li> This one cleaned the brushes as expected but when it came to the concealer brushes I felt I needed to clean them again, and I used my own preferred soap.</li>
            <li> I like the bare minerals cleaner a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love the shape that it gives my brush after it dries and it is a great tool to dry my brushes upside down.  </li>
            <li> while i will never repurchase their brush shampoo (olive or baby oil and dish soap are much cheaper and work just, if not more effectively), i like having a towel i know is specifically for brush drying and a washing station (it does work better than a hand).</li>
            <li> I wanted to finish using my Sephora brush shampoo first.</li>
            <li> The soap works pretty well though</li>
            <li> :) I only paid 19.99 for the kit at Ulta.</li>
            <li> First ofall</li>
            <li> I think that they missed the instructions ;-)</li>
            <li> The drying cup is big enough for all of my brushes, which is good, since it means I can take care of them all at much.    </li>
            <li> The brush slips messed up the bristles on one of my brushes, so be careful if you have super fine brushes.</li>
            <li> Also, this product is pushing a much need message, &amp;#34;Clean</li>
            <li> your makeup brushes, keeps your makeup contaminate free and last longer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was a real wake-up call.  </li>
            <li> Be gentle when cleaning your brushes</li>
            <li> My daughters use it for their brushes too, thanks a bunch guys</li>
            <li> I was getting ready to throw away my expenisve makeup brushes which I&#x27;ve had for years as they no longer were functioning as they were suppose to.  </li>
            <li> My hand barely fit in the cup for me to place the brushes close enough to the textured bottom to swirl it around.</li>
            <li> I felt that I put way too much effort in this process.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the washing cup is textured so it seems to really help and get the makeup out of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> The scrubbing bowl has a rough bottom to gently scrub out the brushes better than you can with just your fingers.</li>
            <li> They looked like new brushes after the first use.</li>
            <li> Overall I felt the brushes felt clean.</li>
            <li> It got all of the makeup and grime off of my brushes and they all look brand new!</li>
            <li> when my brushes are guarded and drying i use the cup for that, and then dry it out and store my brushes upright on my desk.</li>
            <li> I had specific issues with the components individually, which is more a design issue rather that the function of the product that they advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the color teal.</li>
            <li> It cleans my brushes really well and makes them so soft!</li>
            <li> Many of the new formulations contain ingredients that are almost &#x60;water resistant&#x27;, so you have to break down the product before you can get the water and shampoo to do its&#x27; job.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Also, I really like the cleaning solution; it seems to work better than my usual baby wash.  </li>
            <li> If you use a brush for foundation, concealer, long-wearing cream eye shadow, primers, liners, etc., then you most likely need to dip your brush in a solvent based cleaner first, blot it on a paper towel until you &#x27;break down&#x27; or dissolve the product on the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush shampoo works so much better than plain soap.</li>
            <li> Then I tried the brush cleaning kit and all my brushes were like brand new.  </li>
            <li> I would like a new one.</li>
            <li> The blotting cloth is very soft and absorbent.  </li>
            <li> If you,re on a budget, it wouldn&#x27;t be worth to buy this whole set because you can get the brush guards for 5 dollars and the other stuff that come with  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This left my brushes fresh and back in new condition.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup expert ~ by far.</li>
            <li> --don&#x27;t splay them out, just shampoo the tips and capillary action</li>
            <li> My brushes range from synthetic and natural hairs.</li>
            <li> Mines must be extremely old.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect this kit to clean all your brushes equally, as not all brushes are equal or get used the same.</li>
            <li> This is my only main complaint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read the directions, as you first wet the brush, then put a drop of shampoo into the wash cup, then swirl, buff and wash your brush in the cup.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a cup with a rough bottom to clean and brushes thoroughly as well as perforated holders and a cup,  allowing the brushes to air dry.</li>
            <li> The brush guards really do make a difference in the brush heads when they are dry.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes when I received this product after several online reviews and YouTube channels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all you need in this little kit, very practical, it will really make your brushes look the same way they looked when you bought them.  </li>
            <li> , it can only fit a small blush brush,</li>
            <li> I had previously been washing my brushes out with plain hand soap, but this is infinitely better.</li>
            <li> My make up brush had so much build up, even though I was washed them with other cleaning products, that the brush soaked up alot of make up and</li>
            <li> this set are only brush shampoo, a small towel and 2 small cups, which you can always improvise for a baby shampoo and your own similar cups at home that you dont use.</li>
            <li> I am aware that due to the density of some brushes it might take longer to dry.</li>
            <li> , i have a short handled kabuki that i cant use with this system because there isnt a wide yet shallow mesh guard that my brush will fit in</li>
            <li> I dont think this towel will last so long for me, I tried not to do that again, but it just happened.</li>
            <li> However, I only put my eyeshadow brushes in there because my face brushes takes too long to dry in such an enclosed space.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure the brush guards won&#x27;t disappointment.</li>
            <li> Today I received the brush guard cleaning kit, but the kit is not complete.</li>
            <li> Between the teal (which is the washing cup), and the dark charcoal grey (which is the drying cup), it made me feel like it was smaller then the actual size.</li>
            <li> Also not sure why it comes in teal -white, pink, or clear... would have been nicer choices.</li>
            <li> I dry my brushes and the brush guard with this towel, brush guard will cought on the towel fabric, and pulling the fabric.</li>
            <li> (note the texture is a little hard - I almost hurt myself when I first ran my figures).</li>
            <li> I used to keep the plastic sleeve that came with my brushes on them, but they were loose.  </li>
            <li> Also, I like that the other cup has openings to allow the brushes to dry.  </li>
            <li> I wet my cloth and found that after I rung it, the water was teal.</li>
            <li> It allows you to dry the brushes upside down while keeping the bristles shapely and intact.</li>
            <li> You place your brushes in the brush guard then place your brush facing down to let it dry.</li>
            <li> Rather than buying the expensive cleaners I decided to try this first.</li>
            <li> I squeeze the bottle a small blob comes out and that&#x27;s enough to add water and start cleaning your brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush shampoo got red pigment out of a dual-fiber stipple brush that I use for blush that stubbornly was left behind from previous cleanings.</li>
            <li> I was at Ulta and somehow this subject came up with one of the consultants.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not sure why I never thought to use one of these types of towels to help dry the brushes!</li>
            <li> I also placed the vase and brushes on a window slick and after 4 hours the brushes were not any dryer than my other brushes that I had placed (on a slight angle) on my window ledge with out the vase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much gunk it got out of my brushes that I didn&#x27;t think were that dirty.</li>
            <li> While firmly holding the handle, I like to shake the brush, hitting the ferrule against the heel of my hand to &#x27;flick&#x27; the water out of the brush before blotting.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the cleaning solution.  </li>
            <li> They are also stiff so it sits up in the cup rather than sliding downwards.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the small brush guard at all</li>
            <li> The vase is just small.</li>
            <li> Note I have small hands</li>
            <li> I was using a small washcloth before.</li>
            <li> The vase and cleaning cups are small.</li>
            <li> My shampoo has these weird white things in there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too afraid to even smell it or open it.</li>
            <li> Have NO idea what the negative reviewer is talking about, re drying her Brush Guard on towel.</li>
            <li> Its really thick and difficult to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> this really sucks!!</li>
            <li> I switch from the expensive MAC cleaner to this.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I will ever by the expensive cleaners.</li>
            <li> The cups I use to place my dirty brushes to wash.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know how dirty my makeup brushes were until I used this!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed about one thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the shampoo looks disgusting.</li>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t have this already, you need to get some. I switch from the expensive MAC cleaner to this. It does the same or better job as the expensive ones, but you get a bonus, the brush guards and drying cup. This left my brushes fresh and back in new condition. They looked like new brushes after the first use. Also, this product is pushing a much need message, &amp;#34;Clean your makeup brushes, keeps your makeup contaminate free and last longer&amp;#34;. In exchanged some of the breakout you&#x27;re having will disappear after you start cleaning your utensils after each use.</li>
            <li> i bought the whole kit because i really needed some nice cup to put my brushes in normally, and i figured this would be the perfect opportunity with all the extras (shampoo, washing station, towel and guards). while i will never repurchase their brush shampoo (olive or baby oil and dish soap are much cheaper and work just, if not more effectively), i like having a towel i know is specifically for brush drying and a washing station (it does work better than a hand). when my brushes are guarded and drying i use the cup for that, and then dry it out and store my brushes upright on my desk. it&#x27;s not too costly for what you get, since i know that everything is specifically for my brushes. if you are on a budget however, buy a mixed pack of guards and substitute everything else. i just wanted to buy the kit so i had everything specifically for my brushes.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic idea and a great price!  It&#x27;s all you need in this little kit, very practical, it will really make your brushes look the same way they looked when you bought them.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this because of the cleaner was great. I bought it because you get A LOT for what you are paying for. It works great to clean your brushes!</li>
            <li> This kit was such a great purchase.  I used to rub the brush head with brush shampoo on the palm of my hand to create a lather which made my hands very dry and the lather was not that great.  The brushes that I used with cream or liquid make up had to be washed two or three times with this method.  With this kit, the textured washing cup made a great lather that really broke up the make up and even the got rid of the cream and liquid make up in one wash!  The drying cup is nice, but to me it is just a cup with holes which is always good to me :)  The blotting cloth is very soft and absorbent.  The brush guards are awesome.  I love the shape that it gives my brush after it dries and it is a great tool to dry my brushes upside down.  I can&#x27;t comment on the brush shampoo because I didn&#x27;t use it.  I wanted to finish using my Sephora brush shampoo first. This kit is awesome.  I would recommend it to anybody that likes to wash their make up brushes regularly without over drying their hands.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but takes some time. The brush slips messed up the bristles on one of my brushes, so be careful if you have super fine brushes. The soap works pretty well though, I was pretty happy with this</li>
            <li> i like the brush guard system, it really helps keep my brushes shaped nicely, i just wish it came with a wider variety of brush guard mesh thingies, i have a short handled kabuki that i cant use with this system because there isnt a wide yet shallow mesh guard that my brush will fit in</li>
            <li> This little system is perfect for cleaning and drying your brushes and making sure there&#x27;s no water left in the bristles.  It allows you to dry the brushes upside down while keeping the bristles shapely and intact.</li>
            <li> If you,re on a budget, it wouldn&#x27;t be worth to buy this whole set because you can get the brush guards for 5 dollars and the other stuff that come with  this set are only brush shampoo, a small towel and 2 small cups, which you can always improvise for a baby shampoo and your own similar cups at home that you dont use. If practicality and frugality are your priority, just get the brush guards and substitute everything else.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail and it is great. I didn&#x27;t even know how dirty my makeup brushes were until I used this! It was a real wake-up call.  The shampoo is excellent and there is a lot of it.  The washing station&#x27;s surface creates abundant foam which really cleaned my brushes and then rinses completely clean with barely any effort.    The blotting cloth is super-soft and absorbent - I wish I had one for my face, and not just the brushes! The drying cup is big enough for all of my brushes, which is good, since it means I can take care of them all at much.    Everything is solid and it all fits together so it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my bathroom, which is good, since I don&#x27;t have a lot of space.  My brushes haven&#x27;t been this clean since I bought them!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! It cleans my brushes really well and makes them so soft! My face has experienced less breakouts, too. Love this kit!</li>
            <li> This is okay. I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with the cleaner. I think you would do just as well to drop some Dawn detergent in a plastic (disposable) cup and swish the brushes around. Then rinse. I did like the sleeves that came with this to keep your bristles from bending and getting out of shape. Just don&#x27;t think this was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am not a makeup expert ~ by far. To be completely honest here I never cleaned my brushes before. I was at Ulta and somehow this subject came up with one of the consultants. Rather than buying the expensive cleaners I decided to try this first. WOW! It&#x27;s amazing! It got all of the makeup and grime off of my brushes and they all look brand new! I am thoroughly impressed and I don&#x27;t think I will ever by the expensive cleaners. I love the fact that it all nestles together which is great for those of us that have little room to begin with. The brush guards are awesome too. 5 ***** all the way. :) I only paid 19.99 for the kit at Ulta. I don&#x27;t know why it is twice the price here on Amazon. Shop around for a better deal :) PEACE, LOVE and LIGHT</li>
            <li> When I saw this kit, I just had to get it, as I wanted a wash cup with a textured bottom. Another company has an insert based on this premise for a solvent based cleaner, and I thought the same concept would work well when washing/shampooing my brushes. How all the products &#x27;nest&#x27; in the cup for storage is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect this kit to clean all your brushes equally, as not all brushes are equal or get used the same. Depending on what you use your brush for; it may not get clean with just shampooing. If you use a brush for foundation, concealer, long-wearing cream eye shadow, primers, liners, etc., then you most likely need to dip your brush in a solvent based cleaner first, blot it on a paper towel until you &#x27;break down&#x27; or dissolve the product on the brush. (Synthetic hair brushes are more forgiving to be used and handled this way.) Many of the new formulations contain ingredients that are almost &#x60;water resistant&#x27;, so you have to break down the product before you can get the water and shampoo to do its&#x27; job. (Note: Isopropyl Alcohol 70% works great as a solvent for the job, with the added bonus of disinfecting your brushes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is great because you do not have to get the shampoo on your hands, because all the shampooing is done in the cup. Read the directions, as you first wet the brush, then put a drop of shampoo into the wash cup, then swirl, buff and wash your brush in the cup. (Don&#x27;t fill the cup with water then a drop of shampoo...) Be gentle when cleaning your brushes--don&#x27;t splay them out, just shampoo the tips and capillary action will work the shampoo up the bristles. Rinse well. While firmly holding the handle, I like to shake the brush, hitting the ferrule against the heel of my hand to &#x27;flick&#x27; the water out of the brush before blotting. The cloth is more on the plush side for this type and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The brush shampoo got red pigment out of a dual-fiber stipple brush that I use for blush that stubbornly was left behind from previous cleanings. This kit can greatly assist and ease your routine brush maintenance. The brush guards really do make a difference in the brush heads when they are dry. I plan to purchase some extra brush guards because I tend to wash a larger variety of different sized brushes.</li>
            <li> Love this set! My friend got her&#x27;s from ULTA and let me try it as well and I fell in love. I had previously been washing my brushes out with plain hand soap, but this is infinitely better. The scrubbing bowl has a rough bottom to gently scrub out the brushes better than you can with just your fingers. It also has a convenient super absorbent blotting cloth and a drying bowl. The brush shampoo works so much better than plain soap. I was amazed at how much gunk it got out of my brushes that I didn&#x27;t think were that dirty.</li>
            <li> I recieved several makeup brushes over Christmas and began to break out because I didn&#x27;t know brushes were supposed to be cleaned daily to weekly. This is an awesome product which has stopped the problem and made my brushes look like new! The directions are easy to follow and the cleaning solution gets my brushes squeaky clean. My only wish is that it came with 2 of each of the 4 sizes of brush guard instead of only 2 of the middle sizes.</li>
            <li> I like the drying and washing station and the towel from this kit, I own brush guard before I brought this kit.&lt;br /&gt;When I dry my brushes and the brush guard with this towel, brush guard will cought on the towel fabric, and pulling the fabric. I dont think this towel will last so long for me, I tried not to do that again, but it just happened. I like the washing station, it just make cleaning brushes a lot easier, a bit tall for the BE mineral brushes.  I don&#x27;t like the small brush guard at all, it can only fit a small blush brush, even a dome blush brush won&#x27;t fit.the brush shampoo is alright, not too special about it. any brush shampoo would do the job.</li>
            <li> There are two cups.  The teal colored cup has is textured at the bottom of the cup so that you can scrub your brushes at the bottom and remove the makeup and bacteria off the brush hairs.  Also, I like that the other cup has openings to allow the brushes to dry.  However, I only put my eyeshadow brushes in there because my face brushes takes too long to dry in such an enclosed space.  Even though the towel is small, it feels really nice and great for wiping off excess water from the brushes before putting it in the brush guards.  The brush guards are amazing.  A classmate had originally given me a set for free.  I love that they have a variety of sizes to fit big, medium, and the smallest brushes (eyeliner and brow brushes).  The brush gaurds can be sold separately.  Its nice that they include some in this kit.  They are also stiff so it sits up in the cup rather than sliding downwards.  I am not a huge fan of the cleaning solution.  Its really thick and difficult to get out of the bottle.  I like the bare minerals cleaner a lot better. But overall, this is a great deal for a cleaning kit!! I LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> The brush guard is a great tool for cleaning and drying your makeup brushes.  The guards are great at protecting your brushes while traveling.</li>
            <li> I liked this product!! It gets your make up brushes nice and clean. I would recommend this product to anyone who wears make up using brushes.</li>
            <li> Today I received the brush guard cleaning kit, but the kit is not complete. The full variety pack of brush guard for the brushes was not included as described...this really sucks!! I won&#x27;t order from this company again..</li>
            <li> Gets my brushes super clean and smelling good. My daughters use it for their brushes too, thanks a bunch guys</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself last year.  I absolutely love it.  I was getting ready to throw away my expenisve makeup brushes which I&#x27;ve had for years as they no longer were functioning as they were suppose to.  My make up brush had so much build up, even though I was washed them with other cleaning products, that the brush soaked up alot of make up and harley left any on my face.  Then I tried the brush cleaning kit and all my brushes were like brand new.  I have been giving this as gifts and all my friends have also liked it.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes when I received this product after several online reviews and YouTube channels. I used it to the manufactures specifications. I own lot of makeup brushes. My brushes range from synthetic and natural hairs. I washed different brushes from eye shadows, foundations, and concealers.  I also own different sizes (5 in. and longer and Kabuki&#x27;s brushes).  I will apologize in advance if it is lengthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up to Amazon. I made the purchase online through Amazon and received and order conformation immediately. Followed by another email informing me when it should arrive. It arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived it was sealed in perfect condition and all the components where inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I was semi satisfied with my purchase. I had specific issues with the components individually, which is more a design issue rather that the function of the product that they advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will now individually review all the components in the kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The brush guards: These are a fabulous buy. If you have not purchase them do so. They keep the hairs on the brushes perfectly shaped while drying. In addition, while traveling the brushes are kept in shape. I owned them previously and have been happy with the set.&lt;br /&gt;2) The Drying Vase. The vase is just small. This is an amazing idea but to me it didn&#x27;t work as well as it should. You place your brushes in the brush guard then place your brush facing down to let it dry. I am aware that due to the density of some brushes it might take longer to dry. The vents on the vase allow the air to circulate. This to me is an excellent. The 3 vents are spaced about 1/2 inch apart,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have made more vents and spaced them closer to maximize the airflow. I also placed the vase and brushes on a window slick and after 4 hours the brushes were not any dryer than my other brushes that I had placed (on a slight angle) on my window ledge with out the vase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) The Washing cup: I liked the idea but I to me it has a huge design flaw. Inside the cup the cup it has the textured bottom (note the texture is a little hard - I almost hurt myself when I first ran my figures). However I did feel my brushes were nice a clean afterwards. The biggest issue I had is the size (3 ¼ in diameter and 4 in in height). Note I have small hands my ring size is a 4 ½. So when it came to washing my 3 kabuki brushes I was frustrated. My hand barely fit in the cup for me to place the brushes close enough to the textured bottom to swirl it around. I am also a huge fan of the Bdellium travel size brushes; which measure around 5 inches in length. After I cleaned the two different size brushes (travel and Kabuki brushes). I felt that I put way too much effort in this process. However - I do own full-length brushes and I cleaned them with ease.&lt;br /&gt;3A) the actual cleaning part (the textured bottom). Overall I felt the brushes felt clean. I cleaned the brushes at twice a third time if the brush is used for concealers or liquid products.&lt;br /&gt;4) The Blotting Cloth. Please wash the cloth before using it. I wet my cloth and found that after I rung it, the water was teal. So I washed it thoroughly. I like the cloth. I was using a small washcloth before. Again no biggie for me.&lt;br /&gt;5) The Squeaky Clean Brush Shampoo: This was ok. But to be fair - I have used many brush cleaners and have found them to be similar. This one cleaned the brushes as expected but when it came to the concealer brushes I felt I needed to clean them again, and I used my own preferred soap. The liquid dispenses nicely. I squeeze the bottle a small blob comes out and that&#x27;s enough to add water and start cleaning your brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase again or recommend this item? Answer is no. I have been cleaning my brushes for years and have been happy with my method. I will not return the item as I can certainly use it again and to be fair it did clean my brushes. First ofall the idea/concept is fantastic, but I would change a couple of things.  The vase and cleaning cups are small. They need to be wider to accommodate all size brushes not just some (see details above). I would also like to see different textures instead of just one (inside the bottom of the cleaning cup). I don&#x27;t particularly care for the color teal. Between the teal (which is the washing cup), and the dark charcoal grey (which is the drying cup), it made me feel like it was smaller then the actual size. Also not sure why it comes in teal -white, pink, or clear... would have been nicer choices. I will add that the cups are made from a sturdy plastic, acrylic feel which I felt was sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: September 17, 2013&lt;br /&gt;After 5 months I have found that I don&#x27;t use this product at all. The cups I use to place my dirty brushes to wash. I finished the brush shampoo and I would not re purchase. I use the brush cloth and the brush guards. Unfortunately, overall this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I just received it in the mail today. Very disappointed about one thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;1) My box was torn. You can tell they ripped it open and then just taped it back. My shampoo has these weird white things in there. Literally, it looks like someone opened it and jizzed in there. I&#x27;m too afraid to even smell it or open it. I searched it up and everybody&#x27;s shampoo is cleared. Mines must be extremely old. I would like a new one. This is my only main complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;1) Came in the mail on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it yet.. Since the shampoo looks disgusting. But I&#x27;m sure the brush guards won&#x27;t disappointment.</li>
            <li> I think someone wrote this is the best thing she has invested. I must agree. There are several fugal ways to do the same thing (like... using dish washing detergent for cleaning with a drop of olive oil, etc.) However, considering the design of inner pot (for washing) and outer pot (for drying), the blotting cloth (good absorbancy) and the cover... I suggest everyone to get this.  You will be so happy to have it.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the washing cup is textured so it seems to really help and get the makeup out of the brushes. And I&#x27;m not sure why I never thought to use one of these types of towels to help dry the brushes! It works great by blotting the water out of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I use this ALL the time! The roughened bottom works like charm!!  My face is a lot clearer with washing my brushes so often.  I prefer using Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo instead of the included shampoo.  But that&#x27;s just personal preference for my brushes.  Recommend!!</li>
            <li> works great. its just the right size to fit in my under sink cupboard. will buy again. going to order more for birthday and Christmas giftys</li>
            <li> Have NO idea what the negative reviewer is talking about, re drying her Brush Guard on towel. Why the heck would u b drying Ur Brush Guard?!? I think that they missed the instructions ;-) This set is AWESOME :-) After I started using it, I ordered some more Brush Guard packs, for the rest of my brushes :-) Great value; great product :-)</li>
            <li> I never even knew these brush guards existed, but now that I know, I never want my brushes to be without them!  I used to keep the plastic sleeve that came with my brushes on them, but they were loose.  The brush guards keep the brushes nicely shaped.  The cleaning cup works great.  My former method of washing swirling the brush in my hand was good, but this cup is better.  Also, I really like the cleaning solution; it seems to work better than my usual baby wash.  Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, complete cleaning kit.  The solution works well.  It also comes with a cup with a rough bottom to clean and brushes thoroughly as well as perforated holders and a cup,  allowing the brushes to air dry.</li>
