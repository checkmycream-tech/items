            <li>I absolutely love this salt crystal bowl lamp.  </li>
            <li>the way, I also happen to love Himalayan for cooking.  </li>
            <li>This product is not only beautiful, but comforting as well.</li>
            <li>In the evening I enjoy smoking my pipe.  </li>
            <li>I have two in my home plus two votive candle holders that I light every night.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the ambience that the lamps and candle holders provide.</li>
            <li>The color is richer, it came with a bulb, and there are no problems with the light fixture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fabulous, it is absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li>And be sure it is the right one.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for health benefits, however I would recommend it to anyone that wants a soft, beautiful glow, creating ambience in any room.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to do and the bulbs can be purchased right here on amazon (of course).  </li>
            <li>Recently I found this on Amazon (where else, of course) and loved how it looked in the photos.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that they clean my environment, but also provide a nice glow to my massage room without much other lighting.</li>
            <li>The whole bowl glows when the light is on.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it well enough</li>
            <li>But maybe, just maybe I would be dozing off more frequently that I am now if I didn&#x27;t have this lamp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I decided I had to have one in my home office (where I am sitting right now typing this</li>
            <li>However, I am aware that tobacco smell can offend some people.  </li>
            <li>I used a chandelier bulb first and it overheated. .</li>
            <li>The one that has pretty colors, and even has a dimmer.</li>
            <li>Some years ago someone gifted me one of the big salt block lamps</li>
            <li>I do think it is very uplifting because it has a kind of glow that is not normally seen in electric lamps.</li>
            <li>I ask visitors the next day if they smell any strong tobacco odor.  </li>
            <li>and I find it much much much nicer than the large salt block lights.  </li>
            <li>Very well made and professioinal craftmanship.</li>
            <li>Price is really reasonable.</li>
            <li>It is everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>but this bowl was very white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more than expected when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>everything I expected and more</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these lamps!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I leave them on with the door closed all day and at night, when I open the door, it smells fresh and clean, like I&#x27;ve had the windows open all day!  </li>
            <li>I am far happier with that one.</li>
            <li>I leave one on in my kitchen at night for soft lighting...</li>
            <li>I finally got the lamp set up, using an ordinary night light.</li>
            <li>And, judging from the amount of time my head hits the keyboard as I doze off when working, I would say the little lamp hasn&#x27;t increased my energy all that much.  </li>

            <li> Love my lamp. This exceeded my expectations. I wish it had a longer cord but fire bowl is a perfect name.  I will get another.</li>
            <li> This product is not only beautiful, but comforting as well. There is a feeling of spiritual prosperity. No, I didn&#x27;t win a lottery yet. That was not my intention anyway. Very well made and professioinal craftmanship.</li>
            <li> I have just recently gotten into Himalayan salt lamps and these are quite a value!</li>
            <li> This item and all the salt lights are totally beautiful. You cannot miss by ordering this.  It cleans the air as well.  Price is really reasonable.</li>
            <li> I just love this lamp. It is everything I expected and more. I unpacked and set it up in the kitchen intending to move it to my office later. Every time I go to the kitchen I see it and think how beautiful it is. I do think it is very uplifting because it has a kind of glow that is not normally seen in electric lamps. I am planning on getting another one so that I can have one in the kitchen too.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this salt lamp!! I have a couple of the big chunk lamps and like this bowl of rocks for variety. Love the fact that they clean my environment, but also provide a nice glow to my massage room without much other lighting. Great buy, great price, would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I finally got the lamp set up, using an ordinary night light. (13 watts) It looks sooo lovely!. It creates an atmosphere of serenity and quietude. I just love it.</li>
            <li> salt gets everywhere but like it overall</li>
            <li> very nice, but sorry I did not get another one that lights up</li>
            <li> In the evening I enjoy smoking my pipe.  However, I am aware that tobacco smell can offend some people.  I ask visitors the next day if they smell any strong tobacco odor.  They usually reply no or very faint.  I have two in my home plus two votive candle holders that I light every night.  I enjoy the ambience that the lamps and candle holders provide.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and intact..it was a gift and the receiver was very pleased with the quality and beauty. I ordered another one as a gift for someone else and they loved it too. I would order again .</li>
            <li> Love them bought three!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product...lOver it....</li>
            <li> Very nice item -wonderful table lamp with a salty surprise.  Soothing to the eyes -like sitting in front of a small fireplace.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s like giving a kid a present on christmas without batteries. Be sure you have one for when yours comes. And be sure it is the right one.  I used a chandelier bulb first and it overheated. . Also the light fixture doesn&#x27;t fit the base. It is too small so it just kinda lays in there. I had previously ordered WBM 1301B. It&#x27;s the one that comes in the metal basket. I am far happier with that one. The color is richer, it came with a bulb, and there are no problems with the light fixture.I realize there are color fluctuations with Himalayan sea salt but this bowl was very white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reducing my review to one star, and ordering another one that comes in the basket. The one that has pretty colors, and even has a dimmer.</li>
            <li> a beautiful centerpeice for the coffee table.  well worth the money.  more than expected when I purchased it.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this at the recommendation from my vegan son to help detox my bedroom. attractive lamp very sturdy. everything I expected and more</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lamp. I bought it for health benefits, however I would recommend it to anyone that wants a soft, beautiful glow, creating ambience in any room. I leave one on in my kitchen at night for soft lighting...I have two in my bedroom.  I leave them on with the door closed all day and at night, when I open the door, it smells fresh and clean, like I&#x27;ve had the windows open all day!  And that&#x27;s in the winter with everything closed up! They can be used as a beautiful night light, as well. I highly recommend these lamps!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this salt crystal bowl lamp.  Some years ago someone gifted me one of the big salt block lamps and I liked it well enough but it was a bit too clunky for my taste.  Recently I found this on Amazon (where else, of course) and loved how it looked in the photos.  Then I read the reviews from people who claimed they could actually feel the ionizing effect when they plugged this in and I decided I had to have one in my home office (where I am sitting right now typing this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous, it is absolutely fabulous.  The air does feel purer, somehow when this is on (I actually leave it on all the time now).  I can&#x27;t say that I feel less stressed but that&#x27;s not for lack of effort on the part of the lamp....  it does seem to be trying to reduce my stress but alas I might be a lost cause.  And, judging from the amount of time my head hits the keyboard as I doze off when working, I would say the little lamp hasn&#x27;t increased my energy all that much.  But maybe, just maybe I would be dozing off more frequently that I am now if I didn&#x27;t have this lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing LOOKS beautiful.  The whole bowl glows when the light is on.  In almost the year since I&#x27;ve owned it, I&#x27;ve changed the bulb once.  It&#x27;s easy to do and the bulbs can be purchased right here on amazon (of course).  This really does make a beautiful accent piece and I find it much much much nicer than the large salt block lights.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about whether to purchase I would say it would make a great addition to most homes so go ahead and hit that &amp;#34;buy it now&amp;#34; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I also happen to love Himalayan for cooking.  Just saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  great looking accent light that does seem to function well as an air purifier</li>
    </ol>
