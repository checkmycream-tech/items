            <li>I think I was my hands more now.  </li>
            <li>Intended as a Christmas gift, I&#x27;m so glad we kept it.</li>
            <li>Awesome product and much better than any standard hand soap.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging, but it smells like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>This is a super nice soap for the kitchen and bath.  </li>
            <li>This is a very gentle hand wash - excellent for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>works great, treats my hands nicely, doesn&#x27;t pass its scent onto food prep, and lasts a very long time...</li>
            <li>This competed with my perfume, it was so strong.</li>
            <li>wonderful scent, not sweet.</li>
            <li>Such a great aroma.</li>
            <li>well worth the $ :-)</li>
            <li>Have never gotten too excited over hand soap before but this one is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I bought this handsoap at a boutique several years ago and it is amazing!  </li>
            <li>aeromatic, rich...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean scent and everyone that uses it</li>
            <li>The feel after is one of being really clean and</li>
            <li>Love it as much as I do the Lime&amp;Cypress scent...</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of sweet balsam.</li>
            <li>Its really pricey but its great with our super dry winter air.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and exactly as described!</li>
            <li>It has a nice Italian kitchen smell to it.</li>
            <li>The bonus is the container is made of hefty glass and has an simple chic design which looks really clean sitting on my granite counter top.</li>
            <li>This hand wash is so rich you only need a tiny bit for a good frothy wash.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you, this is a much higher quality soap than the stuff you buy at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>I also love it seems easier to use than the smaller ones which I use in my bathrooms at times.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time no matter how mant times I need to use it</li>
            <li>I have used this for a long time and have many people ask me what it is and where to buy it</li>
            <li>Feels soft and really cleans &amp; smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Bought a regular sized bottle and quickly ordered a refill because it&#x27;s going so fast and don&#x27;t want to run out even for a day!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It also has great staying power (which, if you&#x27;re me, is somewhat unfortunate).</li>
            <li>Also cleans &amp; rinses off your hands completely --</li>
            <li>Keeps hands soft.</li>
            <li>This arrived with the cap loose, thus the entire package smelled so clean.  </li>

            <li> Amazing scent! I&#x27;m a guy and am in love with this hand soap. Just saying :)</li>
            <li> I have been getting this Hand wash for 7 years .  Love it.  It has a nice Italian kitchen smell to it.</li>
            <li> I had read about these in a European magazine.  Thinking all things European are better and suddenly getting a cold sore just when I didn&#x27;t want it, I rush ordered it.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different cold sore remedies.  This has to be the weirdest.  It&#x27;s like a band-aid. They are by no means invisible.  In fact they drew more attention to it than if I hadn&#x27;t used it at all.  Hmmmmm......</li>
            <li> I bought this handsoap at a boutique several years ago and it is amazing!  I love it&#x27;s clean scent and everyone that uses it asks where to get it!  I buy the refills and always have a bottle by my kitchen sink!</li>
            <li> This hand wash is so rich you only need a tiny bit for a good frothy wash. It has a pleasant fresh fragrance that is appealing. The bonus is the container is made of hefty glass and has an simple chic design which looks really clean sitting on my granite counter top.</li>
            <li> This arrived with the cap loose, thus the entire package smelled so clean.  About a tablespoon had leaked out.  It makes wonderful suds and feels rather luxurious.  The actual scent is coriander and olive tree.  I love it but it may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this soap.  It&#x27;s somewhat expensive but we love the way it smells and how our hands feel after using it.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Cucina!  What can I say?  Amazing fragrance wonderful products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Cucina purifying hand wash. The feel after is one of being really clean and the smell is so heavenly. I have recommended it and sent it as gifts.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hand wash with great fragrance.  Keep on your kitchen sink and treat yourself.  Follow with the hand cream.</li>
            <li> I love this hand wash. It&#x27;s so gentle on the skin &amp; it smells so good!</li>
            <li> This is the best of the Cucina scents! Such a great aroma. Try the mist room spray if you find it.....you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> The smell is like nothing I have ever smelled...aeromatic, rich...we have babsitters who are crazy over this scent.  I also understand that it&#x27;s antibacterial and I can tell you, this is a much higher quality soap than the stuff you buy at the grocery store.  We have it in all of our bathrooms and ofcourse by the kitchen and bar sinks.  And love that I can get refill containers, too.</li>
            <li> wonderful scent, not sweet. Don&#x27;t need a full pump to create a good lather. It&#x27;s hard to find a scent I like so despite the cost I&#x27;ll order this again.</li>
            <li> The store it was shipped from did not seal it properly and it had opened and over half was dripping in the box and the smell was awful. I got a complete refund and was very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle hand wash - excellent for sensitive skin.  My eczema is gone and my nails are healthier.  I keep a bottle in the kitchen and one in the bathroom.  I no longer use any other hand cleaner.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as described! Perfect!</li>
            <li> We love it.  Its really pricey but its great with our super dry winter air.  moistens hands and smells good.  even bought a bottle for a friend who was complaining about his dry hands</li>
            <li> Arrived on time for Christmas giving.. Only problem was it was not in a box &amp; it was leaking..cleaned it up &amp; was able to give it as a gift.. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Love it as much as I do the Lime&amp;Cypress scent...works great, treats my hands nicely, doesn&#x27;t pass its scent onto food prep, and lasts a very long time...well worth the $ :-)</li>
            <li> I just love all things Cucina Coriander and Olive Tree. This hand wash  bottle is beautiful and it looks beautiful on your counter. Sure wish they would make matching dish liquid and lotion in this size. I also love it seems easier to use than the smaller ones which I use in my bathrooms at times. Everyone comes out smelling their hands. Love this.</li>
            <li> Tried this soap at a restaurant  while vacationing in Canada. Fell in love with the scent. It&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this as a birthday present for my friend.  I have used this for a long time and have many people ask me what it is and where to buy it</li>
            <li> best kitchen hand soap I have ever used! I have very dry skin and this is the first time no matter how mant times I need to use it my hands are awesome! Smells awesome too!</li>
            <li> Have never gotten too excited over hand soap before but this one is fabulous.  Bought a regular sized bottle and quickly ordered a refill because it&#x27;s going so fast and don&#x27;t want to run out even for a day!  It has a very subtle scent - earthy, olive-y, but not overwhelming.  Also cleans &amp; rinses off your hands completely -- no feeling of soapy residue or need to rinse &amp; rinse &amp; rinse to achieve that like some other liquid soaps.  I also recommend the hand lotion in this scent -- perfect partner -- again not too overwhelming of a scent.</li>
            <li> We truly love this hand soap.  I think I was my hands more now.  I even ordered the hand lotion because the scent is so wonderful!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. I needed to clean some satin shoes and it worked wonderfully. Nothing else I tried worked. It&#x27;s also a great hand soap.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this soap!!!!!! Just bought the refill!!!</li>
            <li> We stopped in Laramie, for some Thai food, and I bought this at the local emporium. Intended as a Christmas gift, I&#x27;m so glad we kept it. The smell is delish. The scent reminds me of sweet balsam.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and much better than any standard hand soap. Keeps hands soft.</li>
            <li> I can wash without ending up with chapped, cracked fingers and hands! Pleasant, light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!  Feels soft and really cleans &amp; smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, but it smells like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest kitchen hand soaps ever!  I have been a fan for years.</li>
