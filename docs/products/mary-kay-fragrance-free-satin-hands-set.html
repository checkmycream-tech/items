            <li> I love this product...makes my hands really smooth...Thanks</li>
            <li> this is my favorite product</li>
            <li> I tried this product at a Mary Kay consulting party and fell in love... I recently moved to Alaska and didn&#x27;t know anyone here who sold Mary Kay. I found it here on Amazon and purchased it in March and never received it.</li>
            <li> My hands felt soft and new like a baby!  Make sure you get the newest product, it has the prettiest package.  I love this product so much and I plan on giving it to my mother for her birthday next month.</li>
            <li> with my busy schedule as a mom, this helps me feel better at the end of the day.  My hands need pampering at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed. Wasn&#x27;t the satin hands that is in the picture and it looked used.  The packaging was also messed up.  It was as if it was manufactured in another century. I ended up giving the lotion-like set away.  But I would have enjoyed it if it wasn&#x27;t sample sized and better presented.</li>
            <li> Stain hands  set is  everything and more. soften and remove  the dead skin from  you hands. I will be ordering the peach fragrance next.</li>
            <li> I got the peach scent and I wanted the scent free one. Next time I order, I will be sure to order the one that is scent free and not the peach one.</li>
            <li> I heard of this product on the Steve Harvey show, I decided to try it.  It make my hands soft &amp; smooth stopped my cuticles &amp; skin from peeling.  I love this product</li>
            <li> This is such a nice set.  I am giving it to my daughter for Christmas and I got a great price!</li>
            <li> The pump was defective. I had to pour the solution into my hand!</li>
            <li> this is wonderful product and a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Delivered timely.... I have used this product for years and love it!  I am sharing it with my friend for her birthday.  It leaves your hands feeling renewed!</li>
            <li> When ordering this product I was hopeful that this little bag of goodies would have included large product.  Pricey $$$  for being so small...  (samples) ???</li>
            <li> This is the best hand treatment set at a reasonable price. It lasts forever (the first one I bought lasted more than two years and I do use it about once a week.) It&#x27;s such a nice, quick and effective treat for my hands.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with it. Once a week applief, keeps my hands really soft and silky. Love the product. Surely recommend it to all my friends , thank you so much Mary Kay</li>
            <li> I am a very well rounded individual in short. I manicure my hands but am not afraid to get them dirty, this product keeps my hard working hands looking classy-pampered &amp; lady-like dispite my outdoor hobbies... The scrub &amp; hand cream are an absolute must &amp; after a day of gardening or fishing I use the softener. You can&#x27;t beat the price on amazon either, much cheaper than the$34.00 sold from Mary Kay.. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> love it will buy more</li>
            <li> the mary kay satin hands is a wonderful product. I had this item a few years ago. and i found it again. works great. now my hands are  soft and rehydrated. my hands now look  like a ladies hands should. smoothe and hydrated.  the rough spots  are gone. the hand scrubs is a delight. now i polish my nails and proudly wear my rings. i dont hide my hands. i cant believe how it has changed my hands. this product is well worth it weight in gold.  thanks mary kay.  it was delivered on time and perfect packaging.  this product has improved because the night cream was like a vasline rub, now it&#x27;s a cream. great improvement. the hand lotion i carry in my purse. i use all the time...i will be ordering this product again and soon....</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my mom around mother&#x27;s day. I&#x27;ve always loved the hand scrub and hand cream by Mary Kay. Use it once and you&#x27;ll be hooked. Your hands will feel amazing!</li>
            <li> It seemed a little costly for the size you get. The product is great and I love it but the price is a bit much.</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my aunt and it&#x27;s cheaper than buying it from a rep. That said my coworker who is a rep was not too pleased to hear its cheaper on amazon. :/</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend as a gift and she love&#x27;s the product! I am going to get some for myself!</li>
