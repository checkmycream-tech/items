            <li>but then you also get a huge variety of eye brushes!</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality!</li>
            <li>I love the blending brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>But I think my MUA friends would LOVE these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I searched and searched and am so glad I ordered this brand and set.</li>
            <li>I love bundle monster</li>
            <li>Iam glad I bought them</li>
            <li>I really love theses brushes.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The variety of brushes is great too because there are several types of specialized shadow brushes and good face/contour brushes in this set.</li>
            <li>My makeup application looks so much better when I use these brushes -</li>
            <li>I am definitely in love.</li>
            <li>I use the powder, contour, blending and kabuki brushes the most.</li>
            <li>face brushes are soft and feel great on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i cant say enough good things about this set!</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and feel great against my skin.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing, no shedding and soo soft still after many uses.</li>
            <li>They are great quality and only shed a hair here or there once and a while.</li>
            <li>But the other brushes are so perfect that I don&#x27;t really care!</li>
            <li>I have read that the previous bundle monster brushes were not that great but that these are supposed to be a huge step up.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes are comfortable and really perform well.</li>
            <li>But overall they work well :)</li>
            <li>I love the different shadow and blending brushes!</li>
            <li>Is this real?</li>
            <li>but I really do like them.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not cheap vinyl or anything, it&#x27;s a nice canvas.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I would have like more of eye brushes but that is a personal preference.</li>
            <li>so I could purchase a few more blending brushes and a few others :)</li>
            <li>The biggest brushes (blush, tapered, powder, flat kabuki are worth it alone</li>
            <li>Very very soft</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have experience with Bundle Monster&#x27;s old brush sets</li>
            <li>they are a bit of an investment but you save money from not having to buy brushes so frequently, your makeup dosent get messed up from picking shedded hairs off your face and they apply the makeup to your face not just hold it in the brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft, minimal shedding around first uses, couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes but they sent me the same large fluff brush twice and didn&#x27;t send me a blush brush</li>
            <li>totally recommend this set to everyone looking for new brushes.</li>

            <li> am not a professional MUA.</li>
            <li> I intend to use them for a long time.</li>
            <li> There has been minimal shedding from the larger brush.</li>
            <li> A little fall out but not a big problem.</li>
            <li> Need to be careful with that.</li>
            <li> Not much shedding at all.</li>
            <li> It was a hollow metal tube.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints what so ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for seven months now and have only lost a few hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4 months later:&lt;br /&gt;Washed these quiet a few times!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them a little while now used them maybe 3-5 times</li>
            <li> , I have a few that have shed maybe 1 hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars, is that the lip brush was completely broken - there wasn&#x27;t even a brush inside.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Each brush is less than $3!</li>
            <li> Judging from looking at the sigma brushes online and in video and having used these Prima Donna ones I feel like these could rival the 12 piece Sigma brush sets except half the price!</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes shed a little bit, but nothing excessive.</li>
            <li> i use these brushes everyday and have had no falling hairs!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only con would be the retractable lip brush, which unfortunately arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> A few brushes shed the first time I washed them but not too terribly.</li>
            <li> but they are just so expensive</li>
            <li> It shed REALLY bad</li>

            <li> Amazing quality brushes. Each brush is less than $3! Is this real? I&#x27;ve been checking out the sigma brushes online for a while but they are just so expensive and you have to pay shipping too. Judging from looking at the sigma brushes online and in video and having used these Prima Donna ones I feel like these could rival the 12 piece Sigma brush sets except half the price! I have read that the previous bundle monster brushes were not that great but that these are supposed to be a huge step up. I don&#x27;t have experience with Bundle Monster&#x27;s old brush sets but I can say that these ones are really awesome. The biggest brushes (blush, tapered, powder, flat kabuki are worth it alone but then you also get a huge variety of eye brushes! A few brushes shed the first time I washed them but not too terribly. The larger brushes never shed on me at all! Loving it!</li>
            <li> Nice quality brushes! Very very soft</li>
            <li> Solid set of brushes. Love the brow brush and the blending brushes!</li>
            <li> They work well, but sometimes the hair on the brushes fall. Need to be careful with that. But overall they work well :)</li>
            <li> i use these brushes everyday and have had no falling hairs!  totally recommend this set to everyone looking for new brushes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes they are great puts make up on beautifully and clean up very nicely use a good brush cleaner on them</li>
            <li> Beautiful make-up brushes! Fantastic quality! There is no need to spend $100 $200 or $300 on brushes. This set definitely exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are a really nice set and she was thrilled, need to order a set for myself :).</li>
            <li> I planned on using these brushes temporarily until I upgraded to all MAC brushes. I had 2 MAC brushes before I bought this set. I do not need to upgrade them anymore... No, these aren&#x27;t MAC but I really do like them. They&#x27;re all labeled. I can keep them organized with the case that it comes in. They have not shed ONE hair since I received them. Very Happy with quality and price!</li>
            <li> I like the assortment of brushes that come with.  I have used a lot of the brushes and so far they are all in perfect condition. The only thing is that I would have like more of eye brushes but that is a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush in a nice case. Just what I&#x27;m looking for for makeup brush. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! I&#x27;ve had them a little while now used them maybe 3-5 times, I have a few that have shed maybe 1 hair. (amazing!) The retractable lip brush got tossed in the trash. It shed REALLY bad (almost EVERY hair has fallen out) Maybe it was just mine that was like that. But I wasn&#x27;t planning on using that brush anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;The face brushes are soft and feel great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes are soft and pick up and distribute color and product perfectly! I love the blending brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Over all... Amazing set of brushes! I would buy these again!&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional MUA. But I think my MUA friends would LOVE these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 months later:&lt;br /&gt;Washed these quiet a few times! They&#x27;ve held up great! Not much shedding at all. I love these brushes! I wish they sold them individually so I could purchase a few more blending brushes and a few others :) great brushes still 100% satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves them. She&#x27;s had them for about a year now. They are great quality and only shed a hair here or there once and a while. The case it comes with is perfect for travel. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes but they sent me the same large fluff brush twice and didn&#x27;t send me a blush brush I&#x27;m really bummed :/</li>
            <li> If you are looking for inexpensive, quality brushes.. These are it! I searched and searched and am so glad I ordered this brand and set. They are perfect. I intend to use them for a long time. Very soft, minimal shedding around first uses, couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
            <li> I love bundle monster the only think I don&#x27;t like is the change The price and some of them brushes star falling the hair in my face but the are great brushes</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes Iam glad I bought them</li>
            <li> I really love theses brushes. I bought them to replace my Lancaster sable brushes that I&#x27;ve had since 1980!  All of the brushes are comfortable and really perform well. The foundation brush is my favorite. There has been minimal shedding from the larger brush. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars, is that the lip brush was completely broken - there wasn&#x27;t even a brush inside. It was a hollow metal tube.  Also, there is no brush style eyebrow brush, so I put my Lancaster eyebrow brush into the lip brush slot.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for about a week and I&#x27;m in love!!! I agonized for days, overanalyzing at all of the brush sets on Amazon, before I finally decided to buy this one. I&#x27;m so happy to report that these brushes are amazing! The rollup case looks really nice, it&#x27;s not cheap vinyl or anything, it&#x27;s a nice canvas. The brushes themselves are strong, well-made and great quality. The brushes are super soft and feel great against my skin. The variety of brushes is great too because there are several types of specialized shadow brushes and good face/contour brushes in this set. My makeup application looks so much better when I use these brushes - I love the different shadow and blending brushes! Since there is a brush for every use (and they are each labeled with what they should be used for) I can make so many amazing makeup looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con would be the retractable lip brush, which unfortunately arrived broken.  But the other brushes are so perfect that I don&#x27;t really care! I only had 2 hairs shed when I washed them- I&#x27;ve used these brushes almost every day since and they haven&#x27;t shed at all! The value and quality is still amazing regardless! Love this!</li>
            <li> I am a beginner in wearing makeup and have been playing around with these makeup brushes for about three weeks now... I am definitely in love. Some of the brushes shed a little bit, but nothing excessive. I have absolutely no complaints what so ever. I use the powder, contour, blending and kabuki brushes the most. They are all amazing!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, no shedding and soo soft still after many uses. i would def. recomend these brushes. they are a bit of an investment but you save money from not having to buy brushes so frequently, your makeup dosent get messed up from picking shedded hairs off your face and they apply the makeup to your face not just hold it in the brush. i cant say enough good things about this set!</li>
            <li> I abosolutly love these brushes! They are by far the best brushes I have ever owned! I&#x27;ve had them for seven months now and have only lost a few hairs. I recommend that if you&#x27;re looking for a great quality set of brushes for rather cheap, buy these ones! I would be lost without them!  UPDATE! It&#x27;s been over a year since I bought these brushes, and they are still in amazing condition. I use them all the time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I dont know how I lived without these!</li>
            <li> Bought as gifts. They loved them</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! I use them everyday. A little fall out but not a big problem.</li>
