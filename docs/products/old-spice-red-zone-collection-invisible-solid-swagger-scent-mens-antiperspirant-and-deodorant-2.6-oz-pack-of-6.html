            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>And smell good</li>
            <li>do love this fragrance on my husband, though, so</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant, didnt plan on buying six sticks at a time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper here, via subscribe and save then it is at local discount retailers, which is awesome!</li>
            <li>, because I sure don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I was able to get six at once.  </li>
            <li>but I got free shipping and no taxes on it</li>
            <li>I wish Old Spice would focus on a quality ingredient deodorant for men that didn&#x27;t include hazardous ingredients.</li>
            <li>To me its worth it to spend more now to save more in the long run.</li>
            <li>Stained every white shirt I own.</li>
            <li>Thus this swag on deodorant keeps me fresh like p diddy, in my day to day activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I buy most of our toiletries at our local wholesale store.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas, where it&#x27;s too hot to function.</li>
            <li>milky white solid doesn&#x27;t bring all the girls to the yard, but I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I used to wear old spice pure sport and thought of changing to try the swagger</li>
            <li>Thanks old spice.</li>
            <li>I originally used the blue version of this (this is the white...).</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as I would get in the store for 25%</li>
            <li>I love the smell of swagger and it does protect well, perhaps a little too well, some days I find myself uncomfortably dry by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Most mornings I have to drag my lazy ass out of bed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff, so I buy it by the truck-load. This was a good price.</li>
            <li> I buy most of our toiletries at our local wholesale store. They don&#x27;t sell this product there so I got it online. Amazon&#x27;s price is not great but I got free shipping and no taxes on it so it helped to compensate. This is the only deodorant my husband will use...he swears by it.</li>
            <li> At a price of twenty seven seventy for 4 sticks, that makes each stick four dollars and sixty cents.  And this isn&#x27;t even a Prime eligible item, so you would have to pay shipping, too.  That is crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love this fragrance on my husband, though, so I will look for it elsewhere...</li>
            <li> Much better then having everyone faint when I stretch or reach for anything</li>
            <li> Stained every white shirt I own. Used for about a year. This has only been since my last purchase a few months ago. Bought another one thinking there was something wrong with the one I bought. Same issue. Guess they changed something. Not happy. Bleach won&#x27;t even take out the purple stains!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes this smell on me. Thanks old spice.</li>
            <li> I shower at night, then apply the deodorant after drying off. It lasts through the night and throughout the day. I live in Texas, where it&#x27;s too hot to function. I need a long-lasting deodorant and this satisfies that need.</li>
            <li> product as described, delivery was on time,</li>
            <li> I originally used the blue version of this (this is the white...). I love the smell of swagger and it does protect well, perhaps a little too well, some days I find myself uncomfortably dry by the end of the day. Regardless, it gets the job done and smells great doing it.</li>
            <li> My son is just getting to the age where he understands the importance of hygiene!  He loves the Swagger... talk about your marketing!!  Good price and I don&#x27;t have to go to the store to get it.</li>
            <li> I wish Old Spice would focus on a quality ingredient deodorant for men that didn&#x27;t include hazardous ingredients. My husband likes the scent and performance. but I&#x27;m always searching for something less toxic that is still manly.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant, didnt plan on buying six sticks at a time but... Cheaper then going to the store. To me its worth it to spend more now to save more in the long run. And smell good</li>
            <li> I used to wear old spice pure sport and thought of changing to try the swagger but now I&#x27;m hooked to this.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this stuff and he&#x27;s in the Army and PT/running every morning. It&#x27;s cheaper here, via subscribe and save then it is at local discount retailers, which is awesome!</li>
            <li> Do you wake up in the morning feeling like p diddy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good, because I sure don&#x27;t. Most mornings I have to drag my lazy ass out of bed. Wash this mop they call &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; and try and look presentable to my peers. I already look like crap, I don&#x27;t need to be smelling like it too.  Thus this swag on deodorant keeps me fresh like p diddy, in my day to day activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This milky white solid doesn&#x27;t bring all the girls to the yard, but I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Unlike the white little clumps of elf poop it leaves about after you apply to much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fact of the matter is, if you do not want to smell like a dirty patchouli hippy, wear deodorant.  No one wants you to be that guy you get behind at Disneyland that smells like body oder. Seriously dude GO HOME! I feel bad for your wife and kids.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I like the fact that I was able to get six at once.  It saves time and money.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been one to always buy my products in the store, but recently have switched even my personal care products. This is a can&#x27;t beat price! Exactly the same as I would get in the store for 25% cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Braden</li>
