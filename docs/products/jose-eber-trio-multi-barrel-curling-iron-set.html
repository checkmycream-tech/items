            <li> I was shocked when I received this order. It is not the same model shown in the picture. Beware, it is old one and that&#x27;s why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> Excellent Very We combine sizes and save in the procurement process instead of buying for more than one because Sizes</li>
            <li> I like this product and the transaction was so good</li>
            <li> My daughter had one of these so I bought one also as they are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this from &amp;#34;Gorgeous You!&amp;#34; fulfilled by Amazon and it was a slightly different product, a Jose Eber Trio with all clipless wands in sizes 19mm, 25mm and a 32mm barrel instead of the taper barrel. I could not find any mention of such a variation existing on the interwebs. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Great grip and sleek design.  I only with one of the barrels was graduated (thicker at the end than the base) since this gives a more natural look.</li>
            <li> good afternoon i would like to buy your product, but i want to know what kind of warranty have and how many month does im going to have the warranty?</li>
            <li> The product works beautifully. I do, however, think that I was shipped a used set. The box had been opened and there were visible signs of previous use.</li>
            <li> I saw Jose Eber hair curlers like this at the mall and I was so tempted to buy it after watching a demo. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get the same results with my hair. I ordered it and tried several times without getting the results I wanted. I burned my fingers several times. the glove isn&#x27;t much help. I should have returned it but didn&#x27;t want to deal with it. So it is sitting packed away and I doubt I will ever use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  This works even better than I could have imagined.  Easy to use.  Heats up so fast.  I love that I have different barrels to use as well.</li>
            <li> The smallest barrel makes the best curls. I don&#x27;t really use the other two.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly. Love the versatility in barrel sizes.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this at such a great price because I&#x27;ve been wanting on FOREVER! I was so disappointed when I opened the box. It is some sort of knockoff. The item I received does not even look like the Jose Eber trio pictured (which appears to be the real thing). If I wanted a cheap curling wand I would have bought one from a box store for $20 not nearly $80. I would give this 0 stars if I could just because I feel this listing is very dishonest.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it...</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted these at a show we went to and they were triple the price from what Amazon had them for! I bought these for Christmas &amp; she loves them! Her hair is really soft when curled with this iron too.  Extremely hot so the glove is great.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed and still enjoying using this product. I curl me and my daughters hair without breakage. The shipment arrive on time and very well boxed. This was a wonderful purchase.</li>
            <li> The thickest one is my favorite</li>
            <li> The best curling Iron I have ever used.  Follow the instructions for awesome curls that last for 2 days!!</li>
