    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I one word perfect.</li>
            <li>Great razor!</li>
            <li>Once you master pressure, angle, and find the perfect blade, you will not have to purchase another razor in your life time--unless you are a collector like some of us!  </li>
            <li>Happy shaving!</li>
            <li>Shaving has become something like a Zen ceremony for me, and the Feather fits perfectly into it.  </li>
            <li>instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to return it with reluctance, as the quality and feel is superb despite the price.</li>
            <li>Paired with Feather razors provides the perfect shave, with no blood.</li>
            <li>The before shave part I find best to have showered and to keep the skin slippery while shaving.</li>
            <li>Great razor!</li>
            <li>It is superbly crafted and well</li>

            <li>as though it was great rather than admit to my wife</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I started with a Merkur 1904 razor and wasn&#x27;t happy with it because I couldn&#x27;t keep my grip on it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Turns out the Feather razor is great for shaving legs too -</li>
            <li>Works great with Derby blades.</li>
            <li>Cleans very easy, the weight seems to be perfect on this razor also.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Very very nice.</li>
            <li>razor itself is very nice.</li>
            <li>Perfect packaging and the fist opening was magical.</li>
            <li>At $175 bucks it better be the best!</li>
            <li>The best shave I ever had is provided by this truly outstanding work of art.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just enjoyable to use, and the result is a very nice, BBS shave!</li>
            <li>but fortunately I found a website that gave excellent -- and</li>
            <li>and it took a good while of applying pressure to stop the bleeding.  </li>
            <li>I have the cheaper Feather Popular and that one works great with the Astra blades.</li>
            <li>The razor is very nicely made and has a nice weight feel.  </li>
            <li>Ironically he is a 7-day-a-week shaver, confirming my original theory about this being perfect for maintenance shaves.</li>
            <li>Very glad I took the time and effort to rekindle my relationship with shaving by buying the Feather AS-D2 razor.</li>
            <li>The razor produced an excellent shave on the first use.  </li>
            <li>Great product if you have a light beard or if you are doing a once over for the night out.  </li>
            <li>This has proven to me again and again that this is one of the finest, effective, and highest quality razors in my collection.  </li>
            <li>Nice weight and balance.</li>
            <li>AS-D2 model here is very well made to excellent tolerances.</li>
            <li>I grew my beard out in anticipation of this razor&#x27;s arrival and it&#x27;s honestly the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>It slides over your face without catching even after you have no lather on your face</li>
            <li>If you are someone experienced with DE razors and can shave properly (proper prep, control of head, angle, not in hurry, etc) then this will be an excellent shaver for you.  </li>
            <li>I am older, my beard is &amp;#34;tougher.&amp;#34; The Feather&#x27;s angle of address is perfect.</li>
            <li>(He shaves with a Microtouch One Razor Classic Safety Razor)&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the razor is impressive.</li>
            <li>Feather would make a great gift for a special someone (if money is not a concern).</li>
            <li>The precision is amazing and shaves very smoothly and &amp;#34;efficiently&amp;#34; as some have commented as well.</li>
            <li>(And I haven&#x27;t even shaved yet.)&lt;br /&gt;Holding the razor is perfect, very nice grip, it is lightweight, firm, and you can balance with it nicely.</li>
            <li>This is the best I have ever experienced...expensive but worth it if you want a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>very detailed -- descriptions of top quality razors.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Astonishing precision can be seen on every piece of this three part razor blade.</li>
            <li>I love the razor and</li>
            <li>It is a pleasure to use and is one of my top two razors.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews on the Feather DE razor and felt whats one more in the rack.  </li>
            <li>Love the Feather products as you can see.  </li>
            <li>craftsmanship on the Feather is superb - it is a piece of art in itself, a simple design built to perfection with a wonderfully understated matte brushed finish to it.</li>
            <li>When I have the time in the morning, it is an absolute pleasure to reduce the stubble to nothingness, but even when I am in a hurry the Feather delivers a great shave without the risk of nicks and the irritation I got from the C34.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still love this razor and have not used anything else for a while.  </li>
            <li>:  I paid $179 for the razor, many vendors are charging much more, so look around.  </li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, this was one of my top three choices.</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t have the butterfly style top (that opens by twisting a dial) and doesn&#x27;t have a dial to adjust the blade angle, there are no crevices for minerals to accumulate, thus reducing function.</li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>You may be able to find it if you just do a search for Feather razors)</li>
            <li>Well I think this razor is better.</li>
            <li>I offered to return it, but his response was \\&quot;\\&quot;better</li>
            <li>But I read a review elsewhere in which the author used more than one blade in it.  </li>
            <li>But for the daily shave it is excellent.  </li>
            <li>(The jojoba oil - a wax really - is such a great moisturizer, and leaves my skin feeling so good,</li>
            <li>This may have happened because of the smoothness of the mating surfaces or the fact that one may use more pressure with this razor or both.  </li>
            <li>So I roughed up the top of the handle, where it meets the bottom plate, with a Dremel tool</li>
            <li>This razor is FANtastic!  </li>
            <li>If I could come up with a better or nicer way of saying &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been mostly an electric razor guy while venturing on occasion into the disposable multi-blade cartridge world.  </li>
            <li>really wanted this razor to be great but just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This will make an excellent daily shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is also much more agile under the nose and around the lips than the Futura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aggressiveness:  </li>
            <li>As said by many, it exudes quality and precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also find blade replacement to be simpler, more controlled and safer with three piece razors than any of the pop-open, twist-open, injector, or even two piece systems.</li>
            <li>I finally couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and dropped the coinage, $179.95 for this magnificent feat of engineering.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a more aggressive shave, I recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>* much better to justify the cost.</li>
            <li>With the more aggressive (sharper angle)</li>
            <li>Once you get the proper angle it gives you a very remarkable shave.  </li>
            <li>Great design, beautifully crafted with exquisite material but very very mild and almost impossible to shave with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I love the weight of the razor and how easy it is to maneuver on all areas of the face and neck.  </li>
            <li>me, the Feather shaves are not any closer than C34 shaves, but much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>With a few days growth, even when you get the angle perfect and it shaves, you seem to have to take a couple strokes just to get through the cream to your stubble, rinse the head, then a couple more strokes to cut off a teeny bit of the growth, re-lather, repeat 5 more</li>
            <li>materials, fit, finish, grip, handling, balance, and thoughtful execution of the traditional three piece design are all superb.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re buying this for yourself, there are better deals available.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s a good thing, really.</li>
            <li>Near zero irritation after the shave, easy to control, if you&#x27;re looking for a great shave</li>
            <li>Best of the best of all worlds for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use blue personna blades, usually called \\&quot;lab\\&quot; blades.</li>
            <li>It is very mild, and you can shave every day without getting razor burn.</li>
            <li>Easily pays for itself compared with Mach3 razors.  </li>
            <li>The non-slip texture of the handle makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>and then remarry just as easily once the blade has settled onto the precision guides.  </li>
            <li>A very mild razor.....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to grip &amp; doesn&#x27;t give her razor bumps &amp; rash</li>
            <li>So, I had read some reviews about the mildness of the Feather AS-D2 and wanted to invest in a razor that I could get a comfortable, close shave with, as well as enjoy for many years.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, mild but completely effective shave.</li>
            <li>Any good quality blade that you currently use should perform nicely in this razor as well.</li>
            <li>This is not only a precision-built razor that is beautiful to look at, it is very mild on the skin, even with a Feather blade, which is one of the sharpest out there.  </li>
            <li>prep and skin aftercare have as much to do with how often I can shave as anything; however being that even the electric razors can and have cut me, this Feather safety razor is real easy on my face and is now my go to razor for shaving.  </li>
            <li>The comb is very tight against the top plate, which means your angle has to be absolutely perfect or it will not shave.</li>
            <li>It’s on lock down and perfectly even on</li>
            <li>The razor handle &amp; head separate easily through course yet precise threads</li>
            <li>Exceptional razor of high quality.</li>
            <li>Feather blades are too sharp to use for my other razors but perfect here (brilliant marketing strategy).  </li>
            <li>I have a Merkur adjustable Progress and Futur razors which are expensive and well made in their own right but give exceptional versatility and excellent shaves.</li>
            <li>One spends a little bit of time figuring out the best way to use a safety razor, but my face now is smoother than when I used the multi blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>; kind of razors.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleasantly surprised - no sh1t.  </li>
            <li>machined razor when you&#x27;re talking fit and finish.</li>
            <li>Like everything else in life fit and finish must give way to functionality and value.</li>
            <li>I buy 16oz eucalyptus and peppermint oil from Now Foods however and is really cheap in comparison.  </li>
            <li>One was best for people with heavy beards.</li>
            <li>I find that I can shave comfortably with this razor and not have to worry about leaving my face or neck looking like</li>
            <li>Fabulous razor...</li>
            <li>This is gives a great shave and looks like it will last a lifetime</li>
            <li>This is likely the best all stainless steel  </li>
            <li>This is a good use for my old unused \\&quot;assortment\\&quot; blades.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a very nice cardboard presentation box, not the wood presentation box spoken of in earlier reviews.  </li>
            <li>The Feather was best for people with light beards and was described as being very safe so you are unlikely to nick yourself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very mild and you aren&#x27;t going to cut yourself, but too mild for me.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful solid razor that gives my fifty-two year old face a very comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li>Let the the head rest (or start) on your face and adjust your angle as needed; but most importantly let the razor do the work, no need to add much if any pressure at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean up is a breeze</li>
            <li>if you feel like saving yourself the trouble and expense and just want to get right to the best shaves</li>
            <li>When I first shaved with the Feather, I was amazed at how little irritation my skin showed, but I was not too impressed by the shave, which was not as close as I used to get with the C34.  </li>
            <li>It took me about two weeks of playing around with pressure and head angle to find the sweet spot of this razor.</li>
            <li>For me, the sweet spot of this razor is the point where I wonder whether the blade is doing anything at all or whether I am just scraping the lather off my face with the plate.  </li>
            <li>That is true however for any razor</li>
            <li>and that’s cool, but</li>
            <li>But its very mild but still gives a closer yet better shave than my old Merker.</li>
            <li>I started my DE career with a Merkur C34 last year and after some learning time, was able to reliably get very smooth shaves with it.  </li>
            <li>Additionally Shave Nation has some good (free) videos on wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>Even with three blades it is too mild for multi-day beards, and I switch to another razor for that.  </li>
            <li>The Feather is very forgiving, almost like a multi-blade lubricated cartridge but far superior in every way.</li>
            <li>but it was very educational.</li>
            <li>I used the Gillette Mach 3 since it was first available in 1998.</li>
            <li>Another held the blade flat (no bending) and was good for all beard types but required getting the right feel and holding it at the correct angle for your needs.</li>
            <li>The handle is about 1/2\\&quot; longer than an average DE razor, which feels very nice during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and will be the number 1 razor for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So is it worth the money?</li>
            <li>the upside, the D2 is a nice razor, it seems solid and it doesn&#x27;t make the rattling sounds that his Merkur razor makes.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>I don’t think it’s worth it.</li>
            <li>I can shave more often with this razor than my other razors, including my electric if I go more than a day between shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the razor assembles quickly and consistently.</li>
            <li>As a somewhat experienced wet shaver with very bristly beard, I was impressed initially until I used it a few times with a couple of days worth of stubble.</li>
            <li>it’s lined up right</li>
            <li>I think in some ways it has the same affect as the Mach3 &#x27;shaving lubrication pad&#x27;, as well as pushing the hairs up very easily to be cut.  </li>
            <li>The handle really provides a secure grip even with wet soapy fingers, and the weight and balance of this razor makes it a highly effective shaving tool.  </li>
            <li>I use the Feather razor with Feather blades and this combination produces a very smooth glide as it cuts, and does so in almost complete silence, while the C34 is outright noisy in comparison, giving much clearer audible feedback on whether the blade is working correctly or not.  </li>
            <li>I could not give this a higher rating.  </li>
            <li>Friend heard I was sending it back, asked to try it, and it was love at first sight.</li>
            <li>My dad gave me his second razor when I started shaving all those many years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Look most all the reviews here say the same thing.</li>
            <li>All of their products are first rate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read many review talking about the Feather saying it was NOT “aggressive” enough.</li>
            <li>know many people out there end up buying 50 different razors and make a hobby out of it</li>
            <li>was a hot rag and lanolin shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>Its on the heavy side but feels good.</li>
            <li>It gives a great, albeit mild shave - just takes a little extra time &amp; patience to get the close shave desired.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shaves, easy to learn, and economical to use (once over the initially high investment), this razor-blade combination outperforms any other system I have ever</li>
            <li>I recently bought a Feather Artist SS and DX straight razors and love to use them on weekends when I can take the time to perform surgery the correct way.  </li>
            <li>Although this was not the razor he wanted he loves it, it provides a very gentle shave and is very well made.  </li>
            <li>My favorite blade in it is a Shark Super Chrome, which is just as sharp as the Feather, but much smoother.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel after only a few shaves that I will be using the Feather All Stainless and Feather blades until I die or can’t find more blades, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>Paired with Yellow Feather razor blades and a good shaving cream, this hefty, well-made razor glides through my tough beard and gives a nice, close shave for my bald pate with very effort.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a very strong beard, but I have sensitive skin on my neck, and getting my neck smooth with the C34 always left a couple of spots red and irritated.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and when I first started wet shaving earlier this year I experienced some irritation with a couple of other more aggressive razors from Merkur.  </li>
            <li>I found that using almost no pressure and a pretty high angle of about 60-70 degrees, where I feel almost all plate and just a touch of blade on my skin</li>
            <li>The Feather is super sturdy, easy to hold and when put your blade in there and tighten it down</li>
            <li>I decided to go all stainless and</li>
            <li>I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone who wants one of the highest quality razors on the market.    </li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>straight edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have be it the Mach3, Braun electric, Feather straight edge or my safety razors.</li>
            <li>I have had much luck with &#x27;repairing&#x27; the skin after the shave by using some baby/mineral oil and then talc (Clubman) powder.  </li>
            <li>Feather makes surgical knives, straight razors, and safety razors.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel.</li>
            <li>All Stainless Steel</li>
            <li>After much research, I decided to go with the Feather ASD2.  </li>
            <li>I would enjoy alternating them, as they are fairly different.  </li>
            <li>I wanted stainless steel because I&#x27;m looking at this as a lifetime product; no moving parts, nothing to rust/corrode.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon reviews, I discovered the safety razor so decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>MUCH easier to hold onto the machined stainless steel handle of this razor.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the quiet shave (vs electric) &amp; calming pace with my Feather razor.  </li>
            <li>All Stainless using Feather blades.</li>
            <li>It was much closer to the head of the razor.</li>
            <li>I’d go with the Feather All Stainless.</li>
            <li>My Feather all stainless was received in February 2014.  </li>
            <li>There was excellent audible feedback when the blade was cutting.  </li>
            <li>Stainless is slower to machine and polish than brass and plating.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the price is toward the high end of the market, it would be a great razor for a beginner as it is very hard to cut yourself with it.</li>
            <li>I found that three blades gives the right aggressiveness and I can hear the shaving action.  </li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as it should, it will easily pay for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this thing, don&#x27;t know how I ever shaved any other way.</li>
            <li>Decided to go high end with the stainless steel Feather.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I mix a very rich &amp; slick lather suited for straight razor shaving, and I would primarily shave with either a straight razor or the Ikon S3S on a daily basis, both of which are very aggressive.</li>
            <li>I specifically purchased this razor to replace my older DE butterfly razor that eventually corroded.</li>
            <li>This is an extremely high quality razor that produces a BBS shave with a Feather blade.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It became more and more frustrating as it frequently seemed to not even remove the cream completely from my face, let alone the stubble.</li>
            <li>I suppose if I added enough water to make it really runny, it might be a little easier to cut through the cream, but my honest opinion is that the gap between comb and top plate is much too narrow, causing it to load with cream</li>
            <li>upon further inspection we could clearly see that the original product label printed on the box said D2, however a sticker was placed over it mis-marking it as a D1.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or have problems with nicks &amp; weepers with other more aggressive razors, I recommend you try this one.  </li>
            <li>One can use a little more pressure than normal.  </li>
            <li>I started to wonder if I&#x27;m normal or</li>
            <li>My normal three passes with this</li>
            <li>three shaves in with my new Feather</li>
            <li>and this is why if you are new to this type of shaving you should pass on this razor for now (your learning and in my opinion you need the feedback).  </li>
            <li>After less than a month with the 34C I decided I loved DE shaving enough to go out on the limb and hopefully invest in the last razor I’d ever need.</li>
            <li>Feather definitely has a longer learning curve than the C34, but getting that first BBS shave without any nicks or irritation is an absolute revelation well worth every penny spent on this weapon.  </li>
            <li>I have so far only used CVS double edged blades, nothing fancy, and they have worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing my third Feather when my other Daughter discovers her sister&#x27;s Feather:)</li>
            <li>After my first shave I was even able to do a little touch up with a completely dry face!</li>
            <li>I usually buy American, but occasionally I make exceptions for really exceptional products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying several &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34; DE razors and blade combinations with unsatisfactory results, I went ahead and purchased the Feather SS Razor and blades...based on the very high ratings and reviews from Amazon</li>
            <li>/&gt;This replaced my Gillette butterfly adjustable safety razor that is at least 40 - 50 or more years old and still working as it should.  </li>
            <li>I figured I can’t go wrong with the razor that matched such a great blade</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price:  It is clearly a premium luxury item.  </li>
            <li>for the daily shaver with a medium beard, the AS-D2 is a great, albeit expensive</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this double edge razor!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and with this razor I just use a premium shave cream.  </li>
            <li>As this razor is very well built, I expect this to last for decades.  </li>
            <li>use The Real Shaving Company for lather and balm, and I use almond oil mixed with jojoba oil as a face conditioner before shaving.</li>
            <li>perhaps those who reviewed both the D1 &amp; 2 were correct to say that the D2 fixed the problems encountered with the D1.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even hear the shaving action as the whiskers cut.  </li>
            <li>My judgement, a few days of familiarity will give baby smooth, no irritation shaves in three passes or less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not a shaver I recommend if you only have 10min to get ready either.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for nearly a year now.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the blades are far and away cheaper that the Gillette cartridges.  </li>
            <li>All Stainless Steel Double Edge Shaving Razor AND the SEKI Edge Feather</li>
            <li>All Stainless Steel Double Edge Safety Razor (AS-D2) ???????/ Thank you.</li>
            <li>Once I got the angle down I could actually skip directly to a bottom up stroke on my first pass and completely eliminate a pass and come very close to a complete shave in one</li>
            <li>First slide package through outer layer, then origami-alike opening of second coat and then wooden box.</li>
            <li>The razor has a nice weight, not as heavy as some of my others, but heavier than average.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that there are different styles for different needs.</li>
            <li>So today I had my first shave with my new heirloom razor---and this will be a razor that I will pass down to my son.</li>
            <li>While it may be more expensive than other quality choices, I&#x27;m sure that this will be a razor that can be passed on to my son and future generations.  </li>
            <li>It could be said that this razor is a little too mild.</li>
            <li>One day I decided to invest in new DE and visually Feather&#x27;s All-Stainless Steel Safety Razor got my attention.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to DE (Double Edge) shaving</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this razor to someone new to shaving with a double edge.</li>
            <li>It was aggressive enough to cut through my steel wool hairs and gentle enough not to shave my skin off with it, so I think anyone saying it’s not aggressive needs to give it a few more tries and realize it’s in a league</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d get a different one next time, this one seems to be pretty basic.  </li>
            <li>Everyone told me to try other blades first</li>
            <li>Price is a little steep, but worth it once you get it.</li>
            <li>The previous days shave, with a Futura, had left a patch of slight irritation on my neck, my own fault for stretching an extra day from the blade.  </li>
            <li>Generally, I shave every day during the week (Monday-Friday) and relax over the weekend.</li>
            <li>Even adjusting my angle it barely removed the shaving cream off of my face.</li>
            <li>Not only does it produce a far smoother shave</li>
            <li>I have found that a much better razor for me is the Merkur 34HD as my beard is average to heavy in weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure if you can manage to master this subtle technique then this uber expensive razor that I&#x27;m supposed to be able to use if I&#x27;m any man at all&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Here is what you really need to know if you don’t feel like reading all the other reviews like I have:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>My older Gillette safety razor takes much longer and nicks are not uncommon; especially on the chin and against the grain on the neck when going for a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In dark foam laid my first and last DE safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Whole story of packaging, building customers&#x27; excitement, looking after every detail...</li>
            <li>This Feathers razor looks not much shiny and fancy as neat and simple; real gentleman tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will use an up-stroke if several days have passed since last shave, and follow with a down-stroke to complete a close shave.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s bought a $200 razor I can&#x27;t use properly or &#x27;doesn&#x27;t work&#x27; - this is the complete opposite of that.  </li>
            <li>The angle of the Feather razor is different and it took me a few times to get it right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve rambled on so I may as well continue with a suggestion for consideration for those new to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>am thinking to buy one for my nephew, a new wet shaver.  </li>
            <li>read some other reviews claiming that this particular razor isn&#x27;t aggressive enough; this isn&#x27;t my experience at all.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I one word perfect.</li>
            <li> Great razor!</li>
            <li> Once you master pressure, angle, and find the perfect blade, you will not have to purchase another razor in your life time--unless you are a collector like some of us!  </li>
            <li> Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> Shaving has become something like a Zen ceremony for me, and the Feather fits perfectly into it.  </li>
            <li> instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to return it with reluctance, as the quality and feel is superb despite the price.</li>
            <li> Paired with Feather razors provides the perfect shave, with no blood.</li>
            <li> The before shave part I find best to have showered and to keep the skin slippery while shaving.</li>
            <li> Great razor!</li>
            <li> It is superbly crafted and well</li>

            <li> Great razor, even for beginners.  </li>
            <li> as though it was great rather than admit to my wife</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I started with a Merkur 1904 razor and wasn&#x27;t happy with it because I couldn&#x27;t keep my grip on it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Turns out the Feather razor is great for shaving legs too -</li>
            <li> Works great with Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Cleans very easy, the weight seems to be perfect on this razor also.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Very very nice.</li>
            <li> razor itself is very nice.</li>
            <li> Perfect packaging and the fist opening was magical.</li>
            <li> At $175 bucks it better be the best!</li>
            <li> The best shave I ever had is provided by this truly outstanding work of art.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just enjoyable to use, and the result is a very nice, BBS shave!</li>
            <li> but fortunately I found a website that gave excellent -- and</li>
            <li> and it took a good while of applying pressure to stop the bleeding.  </li>
            <li> I have the cheaper Feather Popular and that one works great with the Astra blades.</li>
            <li> The razor is very nicely made and has a nice weight feel.  </li>
            <li> Ironically he is a 7-day-a-week shaver, confirming my original theory about this being perfect for maintenance shaves.</li>
            <li> Very glad I took the time and effort to rekindle my relationship with shaving by buying the Feather AS-D2 razor.</li>
            <li> The razor produced an excellent shave on the first use.  </li>
            <li> Great product if you have a light beard or if you are doing a once over for the night out.  </li>
            <li> This has proven to me again and again that this is one of the finest, effective, and highest quality razors in my collection.  </li>
            <li> Nice weight and balance.</li>
            <li> AS-D2 model here is very well made to excellent tolerances.</li>
            <li> I grew my beard out in anticipation of this razor&#x27;s arrival and it&#x27;s honestly the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It slides over your face without catching even after you have no lather on your face</li>
            <li> If you are someone experienced with DE razors and can shave properly (proper prep, control of head, angle, not in hurry, etc) then this will be an excellent shaver for you.  </li>
            <li> I am older, my beard is &amp;#34;tougher.&amp;#34; The Feather&#x27;s angle of address is perfect.</li>
            <li> (He shaves with a Microtouch One Razor Classic Safety Razor)&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the razor is impressive.</li>
            <li> Feather would make a great gift for a special someone (if money is not a concern).</li>
            <li> The precision is amazing and shaves very smoothly and &amp;#34;efficiently&amp;#34; as some have commented as well.</li>
            <li> (And I haven&#x27;t even shaved yet.)&lt;br /&gt;Holding the razor is perfect, very nice grip, it is lightweight, firm, and you can balance with it nicely.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever experienced...expensive but worth it if you want a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> very detailed -- descriptions of top quality razors.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Astonishing precision can be seen on every piece of this three part razor blade.</li>
            <li> I love the razor and</li>
            <li> It is a pleasure to use and is one of my top two razors.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on the Feather DE razor and felt whats one more in the rack.  </li>
            <li> Love the Feather products as you can see.  </li>
            <li> craftsmanship on the Feather is superb - it is a piece of art in itself, a simple design built to perfection with a wonderfully understated matte brushed finish to it.</li>
            <li> When I have the time in the morning, it is an absolute pleasure to reduce the stubble to nothingness, but even when I am in a hurry the Feather delivers a great shave without the risk of nicks and the irritation I got from the C34.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still love this razor and have not used anything else for a while.  </li>
            <li> :  I paid $179 for the razor, many vendors are charging much more, so look around.  </li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, this was one of my top three choices.</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t have the butterfly style top (that opens by twisting a dial) and doesn&#x27;t have a dial to adjust the blade angle, there are no crevices for minerals to accumulate, thus reducing function.</li>
            <li> In short, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> You may be able to find it if you just do a search for Feather razors)</li>
            <li> Well I think this razor is better.</li>
            <li> I offered to return it, but his response was \\&quot;\\&quot;better</li>
            <li> But I read a review elsewhere in which the author used more than one blade in it.  </li>
            <li> But for the daily shave it is excellent.  </li>
            <li> (The jojoba oil - a wax really - is such a great moisturizer, and leaves my skin feeling so good,</li>
            <li> This may have happened because of the smoothness of the mating surfaces or the fact that one may use more pressure with this razor or both.  </li>
            <li> So I roughed up the top of the handle, where it meets the bottom plate, with a Dremel tool</li>
            <li> This razor is FANtastic!  </li>
            <li> If I could come up with a better or nicer way of saying &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been mostly an electric razor guy while venturing on occasion into the disposable multi-blade cartridge world.  </li>
            <li> really wanted this razor to be great but just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This will make an excellent daily shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is also much more agile under the nose and around the lips than the Futura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aggressiveness:  </li>
            <li> As said by many, it exudes quality and precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also find blade replacement to be simpler, more controlled and safer with three piece razors than any of the pop-open, twist-open, injector, or even two piece systems.</li>
            <li> I finally couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and dropped the coinage, $179.95 for this magnificent feat of engineering.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for a more aggressive shave, I recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> * much better to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> With the more aggressive (sharper angle)</li>
            <li> Once you get the proper angle it gives you a very remarkable shave.  </li>
            <li> Great design, beautifully crafted with exquisite material but very very mild and almost impossible to shave with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I love the weight of the razor and how easy it is to maneuver on all areas of the face and neck.  </li>
            <li> me, the Feather shaves are not any closer than C34 shaves, but much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> With a few days growth, even when you get the angle perfect and it shaves, you seem to have to take a couple strokes just to get through the cream to your stubble, rinse the head, then a couple more strokes to cut off a teeny bit of the growth, re-lather, repeat 5 more</li>
            <li> materials, fit, finish, grip, handling, balance, and thoughtful execution of the traditional three piece design are all superb.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re buying this for yourself, there are better deals available.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s a good thing, really.</li>
            <li> Near zero irritation after the shave, easy to control, if you&#x27;re looking for a great shave</li>
            <li> Best of the best of all worlds for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use blue personna blades, usually called \\&quot;lab\\&quot; blades.</li>
            <li> It is very mild, and you can shave every day without getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> Easily pays for itself compared with Mach3 razors.  </li>
            <li> The non-slip texture of the handle makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> and then remarry just as easily once the blade has settled onto the precision guides.  </li>
            <li> A very mild razor.....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to grip &amp; doesn&#x27;t give her razor bumps &amp; rash</li>
            <li> So, I had read some reviews about the mildness of the Feather AS-D2 and wanted to invest in a razor that I could get a comfortable, close shave with, as well as enjoy for many years.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, mild but completely effective shave.</li>
            <li> Any good quality blade that you currently use should perform nicely in this razor as well.</li>
            <li> This is not only a precision-built razor that is beautiful to look at, it is very mild on the skin, even with a Feather blade, which is one of the sharpest out there.  </li>
            <li> prep and skin aftercare have as much to do with how often I can shave as anything; however being that even the electric razors can and have cut me, this Feather safety razor is real easy on my face and is now my go to razor for shaving.  </li>
            <li> The comb is very tight against the top plate, which means your angle has to be absolutely perfect or it will not shave.</li>
            <li> It’s on lock down and perfectly even on</li>
            <li> The razor handle &amp; head separate easily through course yet precise threads</li>
            <li> Exceptional razor of high quality.</li>
            <li> Feather blades are too sharp to use for my other razors but perfect here (brilliant marketing strategy).  </li>
            <li> I have a Merkur adjustable Progress and Futur razors which are expensive and well made in their own right but give exceptional versatility and excellent shaves.</li>
            <li> One spends a little bit of time figuring out the best way to use a safety razor, but my face now is smoother than when I used the multi blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ; kind of razors.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleasantly surprised - no sh1t.  </li>
            <li> machined razor when you&#x27;re talking fit and finish.</li>
            <li> Like everything else in life fit and finish must give way to functionality and value.</li>
            <li> I buy 16oz eucalyptus and peppermint oil from Now Foods however and is really cheap in comparison.  </li>
            <li> One was best for people with heavy beards.</li>
            <li> I find that I can shave comfortably with this razor and not have to worry about leaving my face or neck looking like</li>
            <li> Fabulous razor...</li>
            <li> This is gives a great shave and looks like it will last a lifetime</li>
            <li> This is likely the best all stainless steel  </li>
            <li> This is a good use for my old unused \\&quot;assortment\\&quot; blades.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a very nice cardboard presentation box, not the wood presentation box spoken of in earlier reviews.  </li>
            <li> The Feather was best for people with light beards and was described as being very safe so you are unlikely to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very mild and you aren&#x27;t going to cut yourself, but too mild for me.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful solid razor that gives my fifty-two year old face a very comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> Let the the head rest (or start) on your face and adjust your angle as needed; but most importantly let the razor do the work, no need to add much if any pressure at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean up is a breeze</li>
            <li> if you feel like saving yourself the trouble and expense and just want to get right to the best shaves</li>
            <li> When I first shaved with the Feather, I was amazed at how little irritation my skin showed, but I was not too impressed by the shave, which was not as close as I used to get with the C34.  </li>
            <li> It took me about two weeks of playing around with pressure and head angle to find the sweet spot of this razor.</li>
            <li> For me, the sweet spot of this razor is the point where I wonder whether the blade is doing anything at all or whether I am just scraping the lather off my face with the plate.  </li>
            <li> That is true however for any razor</li>
            <li> and that’s cool, but</li>
            <li> But its very mild but still gives a closer yet better shave than my old Merker.</li>
            <li> I started my DE career with a Merkur C34 last year and after some learning time, was able to reliably get very smooth shaves with it.  </li>
            <li> Additionally Shave Nation has some good (free) videos on wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> Even with three blades it is too mild for multi-day beards, and I switch to another razor for that.  </li>
            <li> The Feather is very forgiving, almost like a multi-blade lubricated cartridge but far superior in every way.</li>
            <li> but it was very educational.</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette Mach 3 since it was first available in 1998.</li>
            <li> Another held the blade flat (no bending) and was good for all beard types but required getting the right feel and holding it at the correct angle for your needs.</li>
            <li> The handle is about 1/2\\&quot; longer than an average DE razor, which feels very nice during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money and will be the number 1 razor for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So is it worth the money?</li>
            <li> the upside, the D2 is a nice razor, it seems solid and it doesn&#x27;t make the rattling sounds that his Merkur razor makes.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> I don’t think it’s worth it.</li>
            <li> I can shave more often with this razor than my other razors, including my electric if I go more than a day between shaves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the razor assembles quickly and consistently.</li>
            <li> As a somewhat experienced wet shaver with very bristly beard, I was impressed initially until I used it a few times with a couple of days worth of stubble.</li>
            <li> it’s lined up right</li>
            <li> I think in some ways it has the same affect as the Mach3 &#x27;shaving lubrication pad&#x27;, as well as pushing the hairs up very easily to be cut.  </li>
            <li> The handle really provides a secure grip even with wet soapy fingers, and the weight and balance of this razor makes it a highly effective shaving tool.  </li>
            <li> I use the Feather razor with Feather blades and this combination produces a very smooth glide as it cuts, and does so in almost complete silence, while the C34 is outright noisy in comparison, giving much clearer audible feedback on whether the blade is working correctly or not.  </li>
            <li> I could not give this a higher rating.  </li>
            <li> Friend heard I was sending it back, asked to try it, and it was love at first sight.</li>
            <li> My dad gave me his second razor when I started shaving all those many years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Look most all the reviews here say the same thing.</li>
            <li> All of their products are first rate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read many review talking about the Feather saying it was NOT “aggressive” enough.</li>
            <li> know many people out there end up buying 50 different razors and make a hobby out of it</li>
            <li> was a hot rag and lanolin shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> Its on the heavy side but feels good.</li>
            <li> It gives a great, albeit mild shave - just takes a little extra time &amp; patience to get the close shave desired.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shaves, easy to learn, and economical to use (once over the initially high investment), this razor-blade combination outperforms any other system I have ever</li>
            <li> I recently bought a Feather Artist SS and DX straight razors and love to use them on weekends when I can take the time to perform surgery the correct way.  </li>
            <li> Although this was not the razor he wanted he loves it, it provides a very gentle shave and is very well made.  </li>
            <li> My favorite blade in it is a Shark Super Chrome, which is just as sharp as the Feather, but much smoother.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel after only a few shaves that I will be using the Feather All Stainless and Feather blades until I die or can’t find more blades, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li> Paired with Yellow Feather razor blades and a good shaving cream, this hefty, well-made razor glides through my tough beard and gives a nice, close shave for my bald pate with very effort.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very strong beard, but I have sensitive skin on my neck, and getting my neck smooth with the C34 always left a couple of spots red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and when I first started wet shaving earlier this year I experienced some irritation with a couple of other more aggressive razors from Merkur.  </li>
            <li> I found that using almost no pressure and a pretty high angle of about 60-70 degrees, where I feel almost all plate and just a touch of blade on my skin</li>
            <li> The Feather is super sturdy, easy to hold and when put your blade in there and tighten it down</li>
            <li> I decided to go all stainless and</li>
            <li> I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone who wants one of the highest quality razors on the market.    </li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> straight edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have be it the Mach3, Braun electric, Feather straight edge or my safety razors.</li>
            <li> I have had much luck with &#x27;repairing&#x27; the skin after the shave by using some baby/mineral oil and then talc (Clubman) powder.  </li>
            <li> Feather makes surgical knives, straight razors, and safety razors.</li>
            <li> Stainless steel.</li>
            <li> All Stainless Steel</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided to go with the Feather ASD2.  </li>
            <li> I would enjoy alternating them, as they are fairly different.  </li>
            <li> I wanted stainless steel because I&#x27;m looking at this as a lifetime product; no moving parts, nothing to rust/corrode.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon reviews, I discovered the safety razor so decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> MUCH easier to hold onto the machined stainless steel handle of this razor.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the quiet shave (vs electric) &amp; calming pace with my Feather razor.  </li>
            <li> All Stainless using Feather blades.</li>
            <li> It was much closer to the head of the razor.</li>
            <li> I’d go with the Feather All Stainless.</li>
            <li> My Feather all stainless was received in February 2014.  </li>
            <li> There was excellent audible feedback when the blade was cutting.  </li>
            <li> Stainless is slower to machine and polish than brass and plating.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the price is toward the high end of the market, it would be a great razor for a beginner as it is very hard to cut yourself with it.</li>
            <li> I found that three blades gives the right aggressiveness and I can hear the shaving action.  </li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as it should, it will easily pay for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this thing, don&#x27;t know how I ever shaved any other way.</li>
            <li> Decided to go high end with the stainless steel Feather.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I mix a very rich &amp; slick lather suited for straight razor shaving, and I would primarily shave with either a straight razor or the Ikon S3S on a daily basis, both of which are very aggressive.</li>
            <li> I specifically purchased this razor to replace my older DE butterfly razor that eventually corroded.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely high quality razor that produces a BBS shave with a Feather blade.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It became more and more frustrating as it frequently seemed to not even remove the cream completely from my face, let alone the stubble.</li>
            <li> I suppose if I added enough water to make it really runny, it might be a little easier to cut through the cream, but my honest opinion is that the gap between comb and top plate is much too narrow, causing it to load with cream</li>
            <li> upon further inspection we could clearly see that the original product label printed on the box said D2, however a sticker was placed over it mis-marking it as a D1.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or have problems with nicks &amp; weepers with other more aggressive razors, I recommend you try this one.  </li>
            <li> One can use a little more pressure than normal.  </li>
            <li> I started to wonder if I&#x27;m normal or</li>
            <li> My normal three passes with this</li>
            <li> three shaves in with my new Feather</li>
            <li> and this is why if you are new to this type of shaving you should pass on this razor for now (your learning and in my opinion you need the feedback).  </li>
            <li> After less than a month with the 34C I decided I loved DE shaving enough to go out on the limb and hopefully invest in the last razor I’d ever need.</li>
            <li> Feather definitely has a longer learning curve than the C34, but getting that first BBS shave without any nicks or irritation is an absolute revelation well worth every penny spent on this weapon.  </li>
            <li> I have so far only used CVS double edged blades, nothing fancy, and they have worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing my third Feather when my other Daughter discovers her sister&#x27;s Feather:)</li>
            <li> After my first shave I was even able to do a little touch up with a completely dry face!</li>
            <li> I usually buy American, but occasionally I make exceptions for really exceptional products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying several &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34; DE razors and blade combinations with unsatisfactory results, I went ahead and purchased the Feather SS Razor and blades...based on the very high ratings and reviews from Amazon</li>
            <li> /&gt;This replaced my Gillette butterfly adjustable safety razor that is at least 40 - 50 or more years old and still working as it should.  </li>
            <li> I figured I can’t go wrong with the razor that matched such a great blade</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price:  It is clearly a premium luxury item.  </li>
            <li> for the daily shaver with a medium beard, the AS-D2 is a great, albeit expensive</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this double edge razor!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and with this razor I just use a premium shave cream.  </li>
            <li> As this razor is very well built, I expect this to last for decades.  </li>
            <li> use The Real Shaving Company for lather and balm, and I use almond oil mixed with jojoba oil as a face conditioner before shaving.</li>
            <li> perhaps those who reviewed both the D1 &amp; 2 were correct to say that the D2 fixed the problems encountered with the D1.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even hear the shaving action as the whiskers cut.  </li>
            <li> My judgement, a few days of familiarity will give baby smooth, no irritation shaves in three passes or less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a shaver I recommend if you only have 10min to get ready either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for nearly a year now.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the blades are far and away cheaper that the Gillette cartridges.  </li>
            <li> All Stainless Steel Double Edge Shaving Razor AND the SEKI Edge Feather</li>
            <li> All Stainless Steel Double Edge Safety Razor (AS-D2) ???????/ Thank you.</li>
            <li> Once I got the angle down I could actually skip directly to a bottom up stroke on my first pass and completely eliminate a pass and come very close to a complete shave in one</li>
            <li> First slide package through outer layer, then origami-alike opening of second coat and then wooden box.</li>
            <li> The razor has a nice weight, not as heavy as some of my others, but heavier than average.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that there are different styles for different needs.</li>
            <li> So today I had my first shave with my new heirloom razor---and this will be a razor that I will pass down to my son.</li>
            <li> While it may be more expensive than other quality choices, I&#x27;m sure that this will be a razor that can be passed on to my son and future generations.  </li>
            <li> It could be said that this razor is a little too mild.</li>
            <li> One day I decided to invest in new DE and visually Feather&#x27;s All-Stainless Steel Safety Razor got my attention.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to DE (Double Edge) shaving</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this razor to someone new to shaving with a double edge.</li>
            <li> It was aggressive enough to cut through my steel wool hairs and gentle enough not to shave my skin off with it, so I think anyone saying it’s not aggressive needs to give it a few more tries and realize it’s in a league</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d get a different one next time, this one seems to be pretty basic.  </li>
            <li> Everyone told me to try other blades first</li>
            <li> Price is a little steep, but worth it once you get it.</li>
            <li> The previous days shave, with a Futura, had left a patch of slight irritation on my neck, my own fault for stretching an extra day from the blade.  </li>
            <li> Generally, I shave every day during the week (Monday-Friday) and relax over the weekend.</li>
            <li> Even adjusting my angle it barely removed the shaving cream off of my face.</li>
            <li> Not only does it produce a far smoother shave</li>
            <li> I have found that a much better razor for me is the Merkur 34HD as my beard is average to heavy in weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure if you can manage to master this subtle technique then this uber expensive razor that I&#x27;m supposed to be able to use if I&#x27;m any man at all&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Here is what you really need to know if you don’t feel like reading all the other reviews like I have:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> My older Gillette safety razor takes much longer and nicks are not uncommon; especially on the chin and against the grain on the neck when going for a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In dark foam laid my first and last DE safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Whole story of packaging, building customers&#x27; excitement, looking after every detail...</li>
            <li> This Feathers razor looks not much shiny and fancy as neat and simple; real gentleman tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will use an up-stroke if several days have passed since last shave, and follow with a down-stroke to complete a close shave.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s bought a $200 razor I can&#x27;t use properly or &#x27;doesn&#x27;t work&#x27; - this is the complete opposite of that.  </li>
            <li> The angle of the Feather razor is different and it took me a few times to get it right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve rambled on so I may as well continue with a suggestion for consideration for those new to wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> am thinking to buy one for my nephew, a new wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> read some other reviews claiming that this particular razor isn&#x27;t aggressive enough; this isn&#x27;t my experience at all.</li>
            <li> I quickly learned that with this razor, I didn&#x27;t have to press down as hard as with my old multi-blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The low and wide profile of the shaving head compared to my Gillette safety razor allows me to get under the nose and behind the ears just as well and nearly as easily as</li>
            <li> I was wary about spending so much on something I couldn&#x27;t hold in my hands first</li>
            <li> Even I was reluctant to put the money down on this shaver especially seeing some less than positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought the Feather based on the reviews saying that it was very well made and that it had a small blade gap and still delivered BBS shaves with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> My beard is northern european brown hair gone grey.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for a couple years, since what I&#x27;ve got left on top isn&#x27;t worth the trip to the barber and was initially worried I would end up with a bloody mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable, all stainless steal and the blade fits in nicely, only complaint is it does not give you a close shave.  </li>
            <li> You can tell from the moment you carefully unwrap the origami paper and take it out of the sparkly red box that it’s made to last forever.</li>
            <li> If you do, do you have the experience to appreciate the subtle (read &amp;#34;subtle&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34;) qualities of this shaver?</li>
            <li> The precision design results in a very uniform, very small blade gap, which, in turn, makes it very hard (though not impossible) to nick your skin with this razor.  </li>
            <li> Get rid of that cheap cartridge razor with its expensive blades.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening he noticed it was not in the wooden box he expected,</li>
            <li> Even so, there is long term economy.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor for a while now, but I have had my eye on the Feather AS-D2.</li>
            <li> No weepers, no cuts; and I have a few sensitive areas on my face.</li>
            <li> but I’m old enough to know the contours of my face well enough that it was a very small learning curve.</li>
            <li> Although one might consider it expensive, it is worth the investment!  </li>
            <li> Nothing special about the shave and of course the price is as expensive as it comes.</li>
            <li> problem I had is that a couple of months into using it the head worked loose during a shave</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant making a third pass against the grain.  </li>
            <li> its been sanded with sandpaper or spotted by little red dots all over the place.  </li>
            <li> The blades only go in one completely obvious way, or at least the Feather brand blades that came with it</li>
            <li> Expensive, but definitely worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy enough that the weight of the razor does the work; you don&#x27;t have to pull.</li>
            <li> and it’s just slightly wet.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prep</li>
            <li> But the Feather produced absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The weight combined with the angle of the blades make the &amp;#34;feedback&amp;#34; from the razor minimal.  </li>
            <li> It is rarely necessary to shave against the grain unless I have missed a few days of shaving.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and thick curly hair, so I needed the Samurai sword of blades.</li>
            <li> The C34 gave me much less irritation than the cartridge razor I used before that, but my skin still burned slightly after shaving with it, and the occasional nick still occurred.</li>
            <li> but these have become rarer due to manufacturing issues in Japan because of the nuclear reactor disasters.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any other DE with this blade holding system.</li>
            <li> delivers extremely close shaves that are virtually irritation-</li>
            <li> I never had that happen with other razors.  </li>
            <li> My advise is to use feather blades with other safety razors.</li>
            <li> That’s not exactly a word that I would want to describe something that I was using to shave my face anyway,</li>
            <li> all unmatched by any other razor.</li>
            <li> The angle of this razor is a little tame, and I find that I have to go over an area several times to get all the whiskers.</li>
            <li> hard to believe there can be such a difference between instruments.  </li>
            <li> and I can work nearly as fast and nearly as carelessly as I can with the Mach3.  </li>
            <li> (I can see a disadvantage here for the three piece design where the head twists vs. the two-piece where a knob at the base of the handle releases the top plate.)  </li>
            <li> The chrome on the Merkur also broke down after some number of years.  </li>
            <li> I take small passes not long ones, that is shave a small area at one time not in comparison</li>
            <li> I have this razor paid about 20 bucks less</li>
            <li> This makes the razor cut smoother with less irritation.  </li>
            <li> As is typical of Feather products, the machining of the razor is immaculate, and you would have to use a magnifying glass to find any flaws.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say that about my previous safety razor or my Feather</li>
            <li> somewhat less easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is much less abusive to my skin than the Gillette Mach 3 it replaced.  </li>
            <li> Prepping the skin with a little eucalyptus or peppermint oil and some water before using the shave soap or cream doesn&#x27;t hurt either.  </li>
            <li> A little pricy</li>
            <li> I had to do a little against the grain touch up.  </li>
            <li> It is very well balanced and a delight to hold, but the resulting shave, for me, was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, firm, and glides well.   </li>
            <li> However, if you wait a few days between shaves, you may find yourself needing to take 5-7 passes to knock everything off smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started with the Merkur 34C and after a few shaves, also using a Feather blade</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times with Astra blades but it kept nicking me and giving me razor burn.</li>
            <li> No better than razors at half the price.</li>
            <li> If you are used to an aggressive razor (like my Ikon S3S, Merkur Open Comb Slant Bar, or Muehle Open Comb R-41), you will likely be very disappointed by the shave from the Feather.</li>
            <li> I was never absolutely satisfied with close shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using Merkur razors for the past 30 years.  </li>
            <li> They also make \\&quot;med prep\\&quot; blades which are almost twice as expensive, but they shave the same on my face.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this purchase because of the price, but finally did get one about months ago</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the design holds the blade very firm, no play.  </li>
            <li> Also, because it is so hard to nick your skin with this razor, I can use it in the shower, which I would never dare to do with the C34.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So think lots of medium thick hairs.  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to actually cut yourself while you use it.</li>
            <li> and I got a nick, not too serious.  </li>
            <li> These two bad boys are as close as you are going to get to a cut throat razor, without actually using one.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Used it a few times before returning it and came to the conclusion that it would be useless to me.</li>
            <li> I was never completely happy with the shave I got however.  </li>
            <li> It will pay for itself approximately once per year in blade costs compared to a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; cartridge handle.  </li>
            <li> Fifty bucks for a package of twelve blades is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need oil or expensive pre-shave soaps.  </li>
            <li> I decided to quit buying the expensive cartridges and seek shaving nirvana.  </li>
            <li> Some people have complained about the price of this razor, but once you see the quality of its build and experience the effectiveness of it, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Also, use cold water for preparation and rinsing.  </li>
            <li> That razor and its very expensive blades has diminished in shave capability over the years for my beard.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this thing, don&#x27;t know how I ever shaved any other way. It&#x27;s worth every penny!! Great quality and workmanship</li>
            <li> Love it. This is a precision instrument. Very nice. Very very nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this double edge razor! But let&#x27;s go form beginning.&lt;br /&gt;I used several different DE razor I was never absolutely satisfied with close shave. One day I decided to invest in new DE and visually Feather&#x27;s All-Stainless Steel Safety Razor got my attention. I ordered it and while I was waiting for my package to arrive I started to wonder if I&#x27;m normal or not.&lt;br /&gt;The moment I got the package all my sanity doubts disappear. Perfect packaging and the fist opening was magical. First slide package through outer layer, then origami-alike opening of second coat and then wooden box. Tension and excitement reached the maximum. In dark foam laid my first and last DE safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Whole story of packaging, building customers&#x27; excitement, looking after every detail... I one word perfect. (And I haven&#x27;t even shaved yet.)&lt;br /&gt;Holding the razor is perfect, very nice grip, it is lightweight, firm, and you can balance with it nicely. Astonishing precision can be seen on every piece of this three part razor blade. This Feathers razor looks not much shiny and fancy as neat and simple; real gentleman tool.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with Feather razor blades it became my dream shave combination.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable, all stainless steal and the blade fits in nicely, only complaint is it does not give you a close shave.  I also can&#x27;t get under my nose with this.  It&#x27;d get a different one next time, this one seems to be pretty basic.  Durable, and will last forever, just doesn&#x27;t give me the shave I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have been using Merkur razors for the past 30 years.  I was never completely happy with the shave I got however.  The two that I had didn&#x27;t give me a close enough shave so I supplemented with a multi-blade razor to finish the job.  The chrome on the Merkur also broke down after some number of years.  I decided to go all stainless and the Feather is what came up in a Google search.  An expensive razor for sure but now that I have it I love the razor and the money is forgotten.  Definitely a precision machined piece of hardware that is a pleasure to shave with.  I am also getting a closer shave than the Merkur&#x27;s gave me and it doesn&#x27;t tear your face off in the process.  I have so far only used CVS double edged blades, nothing fancy, and they have worked just fine.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely high quality razor that produces a BBS shave with a Feather blade.  It is a pleasure to use and is one of my top two razors.  I would buy this again and recommend it to anyone who wants one of the highest quality razors on the market.    31 Jan 15 Update:  This has proven to me again and again that this is one of the finest, effective, and highest quality razors in my collection.  The handle really provides a secure grip even with wet soapy fingers, and the weight and balance of this razor makes it a highly effective shaving tool.  It glides through my whiskers with aplomb.  I could not give this a higher rating.  At $175 bucks it better be the best!</li>
            <li> Great razor! Cleans very easy, the weight seems to be perfect on this razor also. The precision is amazing and shaves very smoothly and &amp;#34;efficiently&amp;#34; as some have commented as well. Not aggressive, but will surprise you how efficient it is. Don&#x27;t have a ton of razors, but the only one I use out of the several that I do have. Price is a little steep, but worth it once you get it.</li>
            <li> This is likely the best all stainless steel  machined razor when you&#x27;re talking fit and finish. Like everything else in life fit and finish must give way to functionality and value. I have this razor paid about 20 bucks less but these have become rarer due to manufacturing issues in Japan because of the nuclear reactor disasters. Nice weight and balance. Feels substantial when you hold it. Its on the heavy side but feels good. Will likely last forever. Now for the shaving review. No better than razors at half the price. I have a Merkur adjustable Progress and Futur razors which are expensive and well made in their own right but give exceptional versatility and excellent shaves. The Progress is my go to razor. This is a razor you get or give as a gift or if you want to splurge on something that has no match in terms of metal working and looks. I have one and use it occasionally. Nothing special about the shave and of course the price is as expensive as it comes. I have one because I&#x27;m a mini collector. Have about 10 DE razors. If you don&#x27;t mind the cost and are not looking for some mind blowing shaving experience you will appreciate this razor.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004E5GV82 Feather AS-D1 All-Stainless Steel Safety Razor 3.5 inch razor]]    This is a luxurious, brilliantly designed safety razor.  Although one might consider it expensive, it is worth the investment!  It is lightweight, firm, and glides well.   Once you master pressure, angle, and find the perfect blade, you will not have to purchase another razor in your life time--unless you are a collector like some of us!  Read the book, \\&quot;Gourmet Shaving\\&quot; for further advice and conversation. Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> The best shave I ever had is provided by this truly outstanding work of art. Expensive, but definitely worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;Use the feather blades for the ultimate shave.</li>
            <li> Since I started DE shaving again in the last 6 months, I bought a Mekur 34C, Futur and Progress and of course the Edwin Jagger DE89.  The DE 89 was my favorite but still not perfect.  I recently bought a Feather Artist SS and DX straight razors and love to use them on weekends when I can take the time to perform surgery the correct way.  With a feather blade, it is the closest shave you will ever get.  I read the reviews on the Feather DE razor and felt whats one more in the rack.  This one is the one.  Engineering wise, perfect.  Shave wise, the best.  I have sensitive skin and with this razor I just use a premium shave cream.  Don&#x27;t need oil or expensive pre-shave soaps.  I takes a couple of shaves to get the correct angle but after that I get the closest shave and no irritation.  You can tell when you use the alum bloc.  It&#x27;s worth the money and will be the number 1 razor for me.  Love the Feather products as you can see.  I also noticed that the design holds the blade very firm, no play.  This makes the razor cut smoother with less irritation.  I haven&#x27;t seen any other DE with this blade holding system.</li>
            <li> This is my second, and probably last, DE razor. I started my DE career with a Merkur C34 last year and after some learning time, was able to reliably get very smooth shaves with it.  The C34 gave me much less irritation than the cartridge razor I used before that, but my skin still burned slightly after shaving with it, and the occasional nick still occurred. I don&#x27;t have a very strong beard, but I have sensitive skin on my neck, and getting my neck smooth with the C34 always left a couple of spots red and irritated.  I bought the Feather based on the reviews saying that it was very well made and that it had a small blade gap and still delivered BBS shaves with no irritation.  I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The craftsmanship on the Feather is superb - it is a piece of art in itself, a simple design built to perfection with a wonderfully understated matte brushed finish to it. I shave every day and I look forward to taking this tool into my hand every morning.  The precision design results in a very uniform, very small blade gap, which, in turn, makes it very hard (though not impossible) to nick your skin with this razor.  When I first shaved with the Feather, I was amazed at how little irritation my skin showed, but I was not too impressed by the shave, which was not as close as I used to get with the C34.  It took me about two weeks of playing around with pressure and head angle to find the sweet spot of this razor. I found that using almost no pressure and a pretty high angle of about 60-70 degrees, where I feel almost all plate and just a touch of blade on my skin delivers extremely close shaves that are virtually irritation-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the Feather shave is very different from that of the C34.  I use the Feather razor with Feather blades and this combination produces a very smooth glide as it cuts, and does so in almost complete silence, while the C34 is outright noisy in comparison, giving much clearer audible feedback on whether the blade is working correctly or not.  With the Feather, I almost exclusively rely on how the razor feels on my skin.  For me, the sweet spot of this razor is the point where I wonder whether the blade is doing anything at all or whether I am just scraping the lather off my face with the plate.  This took some getting used to, but now I actually like these \\&quot;silent cuts\\&quot; the Feather delivers.  Also, because it is so hard to nick your skin with this razor, I can use it in the shower, which I would never dare to do with the C34.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feather definitely has a longer learning curve than the C34, but getting that first BBS shave without any nicks or irritation is an absolute revelation well worth every penny spent on this weapon.  Shaving has become something like a Zen ceremony for me, and the Feather fits perfectly into it.  When I have the time in the morning, it is an absolute pleasure to reduce the stubble to nothingness, but even when I am in a hurry the Feather delivers a great shave without the risk of nicks and the irritation I got from the C34.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Feather shaves are not any closer than C34 shaves, but much more comfortable. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/2013:  I still love this razor and have not used anything else for a while.  As this razor is very well built, I expect this to last for decades.  My favorite blade in it is a Shark Super Chrome, which is just as sharp as the Feather, but much smoother.</li>
            <li> As is typical of Feather products, the machining of the razor is immaculate, and you would have to use a magnifying glass to find any flaws. The razor has a nice weight, not as heavy as some of my others, but heavier than average. The handle is about 1/2\\&quot; longer than an average DE razor, which feels very nice during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is it worth the money? That depends: 1)What type of shaver are you? and 2)What are you used to shaving with? So let&#x27;s address this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The razor seems great if you have to shave every day of the week (i.e. you are basically a maintenance shaver). It is very mild, and you can shave every day without getting razor burn. However, if you wait a few days between shaves, you may find yourself needing to take 5-7 passes to knock everything off smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you are used to an aggressive razor (like my Ikon S3S, Merkur Open Comb Slant Bar, or Muehle Open Comb R-41), you will likely be very disappointed by the shave from the Feather. The comb is very tight against the top plate, which means your angle has to be absolutely perfect or it will not shave. With a few days growth, even when you get the angle perfect and it shaves, you seem to have to take a couple strokes just to get through the cream to your stubble, rinse the head, then a couple more strokes to cut off a teeny bit of the growth, re-lather, repeat 5 more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the price is toward the high end of the market, it would be a great razor for a beginner as it is very hard to cut yourself with it. In addition, since it will only shave when held within a window of just a couple of degrees, it will teach you proper angles very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final impressions: As a somewhat experienced wet shaver with very bristly beard, I was impressed initially until I used it a few times with a couple of days worth of stubble. It became more and more frustrating as it frequently seemed to not even remove the cream completely from my face, let alone the stubble. I added a second blade, and finally a third, and with three blades in it the comb had opened enough that it felt like a medium-aggressive razor (i.e. Edwin Jagger DE-89). Granted, I mix a very rich &amp; slick lather suited for straight razor shaving, and I would primarily shave with either a straight razor or the Ikon S3S on a daily basis, both of which are very aggressive. I suppose if I added enough water to make it really runny, it might be a little easier to cut through the cream, but my honest opinion is that the gap between comb and top plate is much too narrow, causing it to load with cream instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to return it with reluctance, as the quality and feel is superb despite the price. Friend heard I was sending it back, asked to try it, and it was love at first sight. Ironically he is a 7-day-a-week shaver, confirming my original theory about this being perfect for maintenance shaves.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.  Paired with Feather razors provides the perfect shave, with no blood.</li>
            <li> Great razor, even for beginners.  Easily pays for itself compared with Mach3 razors.  I would recommend the switch if the cost of the Mach3 is an issue or an annoyance.  I couldn&#x27;t say that about my previous safety razor or my Feather straight edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replaced my Gillette butterfly adjustable safety razor that is at least 40 - 50 or more years old and still working as it should.  My dad gave me his second razor when I started shaving all those many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low and wide profile of the shaving head compared to my Gillette safety razor allows me to get under the nose and behind the ears just as well and nearly as easily as a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave both my face and my head and with this razor and I can work nearly as fast and nearly as carelessly as I can with the Mach3.  My older Gillette safety razor takes much longer and nicks are not uncommon; especially on the chin and against the grain on the neck when going for a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to take several passes depending on the length of the beard at the time.  That is true however for any razor I have be it the Mach3, Braun electric, Feather straight edge or my safety razors. I take small passes not long ones, that is shave a small area at one time not in comparison a larger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heaviness of the shaving head (I think but don&#x27;t know) is a bonus and helps with the shave.  I think in some ways it has the same affect as the Mach3 &#x27;shaving lubrication pad&#x27;, as well as pushing the hairs up very easily to be cut.  I can shave more often with this razor than my other razors, including my electric if I go more than a day between shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin prep and skin aftercare have as much to do with how often I can shave as anything; however being that even the electric razors can and have cut me, this Feather safety razor is real easy on my face and is now my go to razor for shaving.  Haven&#x27;t had to use a styptic pencil yet in the short time I&#x27;ve had this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve rambled on so I may as well continue with a suggestion for consideration for those new to wet shaving.  I have had much luck with &#x27;repairing&#x27; the skin after the shave by using some baby/mineral oil and then talc (Clubman) powder.  I may use witch hazel and some aftershave (Proraso liquid cream) before that if I&#x27;m so inclined.  The before shave part I find best to have showered and to keep the skin slippery while shaving. Prepping the skin with a little eucalyptus or peppermint oil and some water before using the shave soap or cream doesn&#x27;t hurt either.  The Proraso line of products have the eucalyptus and menthol already mixed in various creams or soaps and you may find that is to your liking.  I buy 16oz eucalyptus and peppermint oil from Now Foods however and is really cheap in comparison.  Additionally Shave Nation has some good (free) videos on wet shaving.  [...]  Do know that unlike the Mach3 you don&#x27;t shave as if you were using a rake on your skin.  Let the the head rest (or start) on your face and adjust your angle as needed; but most importantly let the razor do the work, no need to add much if any pressure at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  I paid $179 for the razor, many vendors are charging much more, so look around.  I wish I could get the stand that goes with this razor but it is sold as a package deal and it is well over $300 for the combo.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I was wary about spending so much on something I couldn&#x27;t hold in my hands first but fortunately I found a website that gave excellent -- and very detailed -- descriptions of top quality razors. Based on the reviews, this was one of my top three choices. One was best for people with heavy beards. Another held the blade flat (no bending) and was good for all beard types but required getting the right feel and holding it at the correct angle for your needs. The Feather was best for people with light beards and was described as being very safe so you are unlikely to nick yourself. It is heavy enough that the weight of the razor does the work; you don&#x27;t have to pull. The non-slip texture of the handle makes it easy to hold. Since it doesn&#x27;t have the butterfly style top (that opens by twisting a dial) and doesn&#x27;t have a dial to adjust the blade angle, there are no crevices for minerals to accumulate, thus reducing function. In short, it&#x27;s perfect. Just be aware that there are different styles for different needs. (The guidelines say not to include promotional content so I probably can&#x27;t give the name of that reviewing website but it was very educational. You may be able to find it if you just do a search for Feather razors)</li>
            <li> As beautifully made as one would expect at this price. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Look most all the reviews here say the same thing. And that&#x27;s a good thing, really. This is a splendid piece. Feather makes surgical knives, straight razors, and safety razors. All of their products are first rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AS-D2 model here is very well made to excellent tolerances. The blade is cradled in the head with no play. the razor assembles quickly and consistently. Easy to use, easy to clean, mild but completely effective shave. Stainless steel. Best of the best of all worlds for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use blue personna blades, usually called \\&quot;lab\\&quot; blades. They also make \\&quot;med prep\\&quot; blades which are almost twice as expensive, but they shave the same on my face. AND they are made in the USA. I usually buy American, but occasionally I make exceptions for really exceptional products. This razor is one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up shaving with double edge razors. Somehow I fell for the never ending &#x27;improvements&#x27; sold with multiple blades in plastic. Well I think this razor is better. One spends a little bit of time figuring out the best way to use a safety razor, but my face now is smoother than when I used the multi blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use The Real Shaving Company for lather and balm, and I use almond oil mixed with jojoba oil as a face conditioner before shaving. Very glad I took the time and effort to rekindle my relationship with shaving by buying the Feather AS-D2 razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husbands birthday, he&#x27;s a razor connoisseur... he specifically asked for the D1.  Upon opening he noticed it was not in the wooden box he expected, upon further inspection we could clearly see that the original product label printed on the box said D2, however a sticker was placed over it mis-marking it as a D1.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00C9M506G Feather AS-D2 All Stainless Steel Double Edge Safety Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, the D2 is a nice razor, it seems solid and it doesn&#x27;t make the rattling sounds that his Merkur razor makes.  Although this was not the razor he wanted he loves it, it provides a very gentle shave and is very well made.  I offered to return it, but his response was \\&quot;\\&quot;better the devil you know than the devil you don&#x27;t\\&quot; perhaps those who reviewed both the D1 &amp; 2 were correct to say that the D2 fixed the problems encountered with the D1.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Let me say up front, I&#x27;m not a razor expert.  Yeah, I&#x27;ve got my Dad&#x27;s Gillette double-edge razor he had in his kit during WWII but I kept that one in the box it came in.  What motivated me to consider going to double edge shaving was the ever-increasing cost of multi-blade razors.  Fifty bucks for a package of twelve blades is ridiculous!  After much research, I decided to go with the Feather ASD2.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for a couple years, since what I&#x27;ve got left on top isn&#x27;t worth the trip to the barber and was initially worried I would end up with a bloody mess.  I quickly learned that with this razor, I didn&#x27;t have to press down as hard as with my old multi-blade.  Paired with Yellow Feather razor blades and a good shaving cream, this hefty, well-made razor glides through my tough beard and gives a nice, close shave for my bald pate with very effort.  Clean up is a breeze and I&#x27;m no longer worried about gunk building up between blades like with a multi.  While it may be more expensive than other quality choices, I&#x27;m sure that this will be a razor that can be passed on to my son and future generations.  Great razor!</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette Mach 3 since it was first available in 1998. That razor and its very expensive blades has diminished in shave capability over the years for my beard. I decided to return to that with which I began as a teenager: the traditional double-edge safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying several &amp;#34;upscale&amp;#34; DE razors and blade combinations with unsatisfactory results, I went ahead and purchased the Feather SS Razor and blades...based on the very high ratings and reviews from Amazon customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this razor, when combined with the Feather blades, deserves all five stars. Smooth shaves, easy to learn, and economical to use (once over the initially high investment), this razor-blade combination outperforms any other system I have ever had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am older, my beard is &amp;#34;tougher.&amp;#34; The Feather&#x27;s angle of address is perfect. I will use an up-stroke if several days have passed since last shave, and follow with a down-stroke to complete a close shave. Generally, I shave every day during the week (Monday-Friday) and relax over the weekend. Monday&#x27;s beard is thicker than the maintenance beards the rest of the week, ergo the up-stroke, down-stroke technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this razor and the Feather brand blades. You will not be disappointed with your investment in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have an assortment of Merkur and Jagger razors. I would enjoy alternating them, as they are fairly different.  I was skeptical of this purchase because of the price, but finally did get one about months ago and I use it almost exclusively now.  It is superbly crafted and well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very mild and you aren&#x27;t going to cut yourself, but too mild for me.  I can&#x27;t even hear the shaving action as the whiskers cut.  But I read a review elsewhere in which the author used more than one blade in it.  I found that three blades gives the right aggressiveness and I can hear the shaving action.  This is a good use for my old unused \\&quot;assortment\\&quot; blades.  For the blade closest to the face I use a Feather.  Feather blades are too sharp to use for my other razors but perfect here (brilliant marketing strategy).  Even with three blades it is too mild for multi-day beards, and I switch to another razor for that.  But for the daily shave it is excellent.  One can use a little more pressure than normal.  I do three passes (standard with, across, and against the grain) followed by a \\&quot;polishing\\&quot; pass - see \\&quot;Gourmet Shaving\\&quot; - using jojoba oil.  (The jojoba oil - a wax really - is such a great moisturizer, and leaves my skin feeling so good, that I now apply it to my entire face. Why not - it just takes ten drops?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem I had is that a couple of months into using it the head worked loose during a shave and I got a nick, not too serious.  (I can see a disadvantage here for the three piece design where the head twists vs. the two-piece where a knob at the base of the handle releases the top plate.)  But a couple of days ago the same thing happened while shaving my chin and it took a good while of applying pressure to stop the bleeding.  All of a sudden in the mirror I saw blood in several places.  I never had that happen with other razors.  This may have happened because of the smoothness of the mating surfaces or the fact that one may use more pressure with this razor or both.  So I roughed up the top of the handle, where it meets the bottom plate, with a Dremel tool and it now releases somewhat less easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking to buy one for my nephew, a new wet shaver.  Worth the $$</li>
            <li> For those wondering, the picture is of the AS-D1 model but the actual razor is the AS-D2 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is very nice. I have used a Merker 34C for over 3 years and this will take some getting used to. Its longer and the angle required for shaving is different. But its very mild but still gives a closer yet better shave than my old Merker.</li>
            <li> This razor is FANtastic!  I was concerned this would be one of those &amp;#34;well sure if you can manage to master this subtle technique then this uber expensive razor that I&#x27;m supposed to be able to use if I&#x27;m any man at all&amp;#34; kind of razors.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleasantly surprised - no sh1t.  The razor handle &amp; head separate easily through course yet precise threads and then remarry just as easily once the blade has settled onto the precision guides.  The blades only go in one completely obvious way, or at least the Feather brand blades that came with it do.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I worried that I would end up with something I had to keep &#x27;enduring&#x27; as though it was great rather than admit to my wife she&#x27;s bought a $200 razor I can&#x27;t use properly or &#x27;doesn&#x27;t work&#x27; - this is the complete opposite of that.  Near zero irritation after the shave, easy to control, if you&#x27;re looking for a great shave this is the one.  If I could come up with a better or nicer way of saying &amp;#34;if you&#x27;re already considering this razor go ahead and buy it because you won&#x27;t be disappointed&amp;#34; I would.&lt;br /&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;Issac (Shannon&#x27;s husband)</li>
            <li> Great design, beautifully crafted with exquisite material but very very mild and almost impossible to shave with. Even adjusting my angle it barely removed the shaving cream off of my face. Used it a few times before returning it and came to the conclusion that it would be useless to me. My normal three passes with this didn&#x27;t equal to one pass with my regular razor. My advise is to use feather blades with other safety razors.</li>
            <li> Exceptional razor of high quality. I specifically purchased this razor to replace my older DE butterfly razor that eventually corroded. I wanted stainless steel because I&#x27;m looking at this as a lifetime product; no moving parts, nothing to rust/corrode. A little pricy but you get what you pay for. If it lasts as long as it should, it will easily pay for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some other reviews claiming that this particular razor isn&#x27;t aggressive enough; this isn&#x27;t my experience at all. I grew my beard out in anticipation of this razor&#x27;s arrival and it&#x27;s honestly the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Great product.</li>
            <li> A very mild razor.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been mostly an electric razor guy while venturing on occasion into the disposable multi-blade cartridge world.  I decided to quit buying the expensive cartridges and seek shaving nirvana.  Thanks to Amazon reviews, I discovered the safety razor so decided to give it a try.  I started with a Merkur 1904 razor and wasn&#x27;t happy with it because I couldn&#x27;t keep my grip on it in the shower.  Decided to go high end with the stainless steel Feather.  Bingo!  MUCH easier to hold onto the machined stainless steel handle of this razor.  The razor is very nicely made and has a nice weight feel.  It gives a great, albeit mild shave - just takes a little extra time &amp; patience to get the close shave desired.  I enjoy the quiet shave (vs electric) &amp; calming pace with my Feather razor.  My daughter tried this razor on her legs ... loved it ... &amp; kept the damn thing!  Turns out the Feather razor is great for shaving legs too - it&#x27;s easy to grip &amp; doesn&#x27;t give her razor bumps &amp; rash she was experiencing with the cartridge razors.  Yes - I did try to get her to like my Merkur 1904 but no dice.  So I bought another safety razor, this time an Edwin Jagger (looked grippy) hoping to save some $$.  Turns out I couldn&#x27;t grip it in the shower.  So I purchased my second Feather razor.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing my third Feather when my other Daughter discovers her sister&#x27;s Feather:)</li>
            <li> the best razor ever, I look forward to the mornings.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but I’m making an exception in this case. I’m three shaves in with my new Feather All Stainless using Feather blades. I am fairly new to DE (Double Edge) shaving but I’m old enough to know the contours of my face well enough that it was a very small learning curve. I also did a lot of research. I started with the Merkur 34C and after a few shaves, also using a Feather blade, I got the best shaves of my life without incident or injury. Everyone told me to try other blades first and I did, but found them all to fall short of the Feather. I have sensitive skin and thick curly hair, so I needed the Samurai sword of blades. After less than a month with the 34C I decided I loved DE shaving enough to go out on the limb and hopefully invest in the last razor I’d ever need. I figured I can’t go wrong with the razor that matched such a great blade and I was correct. I honestly feel after only a few shaves that I will be using the Feather All Stainless and Feather blades until I die or can’t find more blades, whichever comes first. Here is what you really need to know if you don’t feel like reading all the other reviews like I have:&lt;br /&gt;1. The angle of the Feather razor is different and it took me a few times to get it right. It was much closer to the head of the razor. Once I got the angle down I could actually skip directly to a bottom up stroke on my first pass and completely eliminate a pass and come very close to a complete shave in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;2. The Feather is very forgiving, almost like a multi-blade lubricated cartridge but far superior in every way. It slides over your face without catching even after you have no lather on your face and it’s just slightly wet. After my first shave I was even able to do a little touch up with a completely dry face! I read many review talking about the Feather saying it was NOT “aggressive” enough. That’s not exactly a word that I would want to describe something that I was using to shave my face anyway, butmaybe those people like self-punishment. It was aggressive enough to cut through my steel wool hairs and gentle enough not to shave my skin off with it, so I think anyone saying it’s not aggressive needs to give it a few more tries and realize it’s in a league all its own.&lt;br /&gt;3. The Feather is super sturdy, easy to hold and when put your blade in there and tighten it down it’s lined up right and you have no chance of having it being off kilter like I did with the 34C. It’s on lock down and perfectly even on both sides!&lt;br /&gt;4. It’s a work of metal art. You can tell from the moment you carefully unwrap the origami paper and take it out of the sparkly red box that it’s made to last forever. Respect it, but I think you could abuse it too and it would still last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;I know many people out there end up buying 50 different razors and make a hobby out of it and that’s cool, but if you feel like saving yourself the trouble and expense and just want to get right to the best shaves I’d go with the Feather All Stainless. And if you’re debating it, save your money and skip the stand. I don’t think it’s worth it. I personally wouldn&#x27;t want to leave it out on my sink on display where it gets covered in bathroom funk in-between anyway.</li>
            <li> Great product if you have a light beard or if you are doing a once over for the night out.  It is very well balanced and a delight to hold, but the resulting shave, for me, was disappointing.  I have found that a much better razor for me is the Merkur 34HD as my beard is average to heavy in weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this razor to be great but just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My Feather all stainless was received in February 2014.  It arrived in a very nice cardboard presentation box, not the wood presentation box spoken of in earlier reviews.  A pack of feather blades was included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pack of generic drugstore blades was open.  That is what was used.  The razor produced an excellent shave on the first use.  The shaving angle was intuitive and not especially critical.  There was excellent audible feedback when the blade was cutting.  Absolutely no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prep was a hot rag and lanolin shaving soap.  My beard is northern european brown hair gone grey.  So think lots of medium thick hairs.  The previous days shave, with a Futura, had left a patch of slight irritation on my neck, my own fault for stretching an extra day from the blade.  I was a little hesitant making a third pass against the grain.  But the Feather produced absolutely no irritation.  This will make an excellent daily shaver.  It is also much more agile under the nose and around the lips than the Futura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aggressiveness:  I had to do a little against the grain touch up.  Still no irritation.  My judgement, a few days of familiarity will give baby smooth, no irritation shaves in three passes or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The materials, fit, finish, grip, handling, balance, and thoughtful execution of the traditional three piece design are all superb.  As said by many, it exudes quality and precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  It is clearly a premium luxury item.  Even so, there is long term economy.  It will pay for itself approximately once per year in blade costs compared to a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; cartridge handle.  Stainless is slower to machine and polish than brass and plating.  The materials, precision, and finish justify a premium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find blade replacement to be simpler, more controlled and safer with three piece razors than any of the pop-open, twist-open, injector, or even two piece systems.</li>
            <li> The D2 is the pinnacle of shaving.  All 5 stars from me come from my overall experience with this razor.  Any good quality blade that you currently use should perform nicely in this razor as well. Is it a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; shaver?; This is an objective question, but my answer is &amp;#34;sort of&amp;#34;.  Because the blade angle is different and the safety bar appears a touch longer along with the weight of the body, the razor does have a different &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; but I assure you this thing cuts and cuts well. Even I was reluctant to put the money down on this shaver especially seeing some less than positive reviews. That is why I am writing my review. These are my opinion(s) and should be taken as such however, to the &amp;#34;less than positive&amp;#34; reviews, I must ask; Do you know how to shave at all?  If you do, do you have the experience to appreciate the subtle (read &amp;#34;subtle&amp;#34; as &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34;) qualities of this shaver? I do not recommend this razor to someone new to shaving with a double edge. If you are someone experienced with DE razors and can shave properly (proper prep, control of head, angle, not in hurry, etc) then this will be an excellent shaver for you.  The weight combined with the angle of the blades make the &amp;#34;feedback&amp;#34; from the razor minimal.  Resist the temptation to press the razor- multi-pass is the key here. You may not hear, nor feel the razor doing its job and this is why if you are new to this type of shaving you should pass on this razor for now (your learning and in my opinion you need the feedback).  This is not a shaver I recommend if you only have 10min to get ready either.  In my opinion this razor is like a Rolls-Royce not a Ferrari. Again, opinion, but you have to accept the &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; of shaving that goes with this type of razor.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor for a while now, but I have had my eye on the Feather AS-D2. I finally couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and dropped the coinage, $179.95 for this magnificent feat of engineering. The moment you take it out of the gift box, there is no doubt that you have in your hand the epitome of safety razors. The heft, the balance, the finish...all unmatched by any other razor. So today I had my first shave with my new heirloom razor---and this will be a razor that I will pass down to my son. (He shaves with a Microtouch One Razor Classic Safety Razor)&lt;br /&gt;The weight of the razor is impressive. You truly do not need to press. No weepers, no cuts; and I have a few sensitive areas on my face. It could be said that this razor is a little too mild. I concur. Because I am a daily shaver, two passes suffice; with the grain and across the grain. It is rarely necessary to shave against the grain unless I have missed a few days of shaving. But if you are looking for a more aggressive shave, I recommend the [[ASIN:B001LY7GEM Merkur HD Slant Safety Razor 37C]] or the [[ASIN:B0047A6WLA Muhle Open Comb Double Edge Safety Razor, R41, Chrome Plated Metal]]. These two bad boys are as close as you are going to get to a cut throat razor, without actually using one.&lt;br /&gt;But for the daily shaver with a medium beard, the AS-D2 is a great, albeit expensive choice.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a definite notch above the quality and feel of the Merkur razors, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s *that* much better to justify the cost. The angle of this razor is a little tame, and I find that I have to go over an area several times to get all the whiskers. With the more aggressive (sharper angle) Merkur, even their non-adjustables, it only takes one or two passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Feather would make a great gift for a special someone (if money is not a concern). But if you&#x27;re buying this for yourself, there are better deals available.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and when I first started wet shaving earlier this year I experienced some irritation with a couple of other more aggressive razors from Merkur.  So, I had read some reviews about the mildness of the Feather AS-D2 and wanted to invest in a razor that I could get a comfortable, close shave with, as well as enjoy for many years.  This is not only a precision-built razor that is beautiful to look at, it is very mild on the skin, even with a Feather blade, which is one of the sharpest out there.  I love the weight of the razor and how easy it is to maneuver on all areas of the face and neck.  Some people have complained about the price of this razor, but once you see the quality of its build and experience the effectiveness of it, you will not be disappointed.  If you have sensitive skin or have problems with nicks &amp; weepers with other more aggressive razors, I recommend you try this one.  I find that I can shave comfortably with this razor and not have to worry about leaving my face or neck looking like its been sanded with sandpaper or spotted by little red dots all over the place.  It&#x27;s just enjoyable to use, and the result is a very nice, BBS shave!</li>
            <li> The best razor I ever used.  Once you get the proper angle it gives you a very remarkable shave.  Very difficult to actually cut yourself while you use it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous razor...hard to believe there can be such a difference between instruments.  This is the best I have ever experienced...expensive but worth it if you want a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Beautiful solid razor that gives my fifty-two year old face a very comfortable and close shave. Works great with Derby blades. Tried it a few times with Astra blades but it kept nicking me and giving me razor burn. I have the cheaper Feather Popular and that one works great with the Astra blades. I thought the Astra blades would work with this razor too but they don&#x27;t in my case.</li>
            <li> This is gives a great shave and looks like it will last a lifetime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for nearly a year now.  Not only does it produce a far smoother shave, it is much less abusive to my skin than the Gillette Mach 3 it replaced.  In addition, the blades are far and away cheaper that the Gillette cartridges.  I change them once a week.  Two tips that have served me well: hold the razor at a near-perpendicular angle, 70 to 80 degrees.  Also, use cold water for preparation and rinsing.  Get rid of that cheap cartridge razor with its expensive blades.  This razor will last you a lifetime.</li>
            <li> So what is the difference between the Feather All Stainless Steel Double Edge Shaving Razor AND the SEKI Edge Feather All Stainless Steel Double Edge Safety Razor (AS-D2) ???????/ Thank you.</li>
