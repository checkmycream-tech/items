    <ol>
            <li>so these are perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great for my 18 month daughter.</li>
            <li>I have used these clips from when the kids were infants until now when the oldest fixes her own hair!  </li>
            <li>great for my dog hair knots on top</li>
            <li>I love them, they hold very nicely.</li>
            <li>My daughter has lots of curly hair, but it&#x27;s very fine</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied, thank you</li>
            <li>The Goody Micro pack is a better size for us.</li>
            <li>The colors are cute.</li>
            <li>she seems to enjoy them.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 2-year-old to keep her fine curly hair out of her eyes and while the coloring is very cute (subtle color, but attractive)...</li>
            <li>I bought this for my small Yorkie dog and they are the perfect size.</li>
            <li>but these have better grip than most bows or barrettes, which she is constantly  pulling out.</li>
            <li>Our local big boxes don&#x27;t carry a great slection of colors.  </li>
            <li>My girls love these - they work well in a line to keep bangs back with a side part or across the crown like an alice band.  </li>
            <li>AND SHE FELL IN LOVE INSTANTLY!  </li>
            <li>Solid grip, they stay all day (unless you manage to break them, which is pretty easy to do.</li>
            <li>These little clips are dirt cheap and fairly fragile, but they&#x27;re really cute and definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes these.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;d say well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Clips are cute for hair ornaments but not big enough to hold up orchid stems.</li>
            <li>Love these for a toddlers little hair bb</li>
            <li>Little clips that are cute.</li>
            <li>, so big clips slide right out.</li>
            <li>But I think with thicker hair or an older girl&#x27;s hair you would need a clip that is a little larger or use more than one.&lt;br /&gt;Other than needing a bigger upgrade in the future, I love them.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is still pretty fine and thin</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected, and a little flimsy, but really cute!</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t like having her hair pulled back in clear bands because it pulls</li>
            <li>cute clips, small enough to clip tiny braids hung down from hair without bulkiness.</li>
            <li>They work well for my two year old whose hair is just long enough now that she needs something to pull it out of her eyes.  </li>
            <li>Ridiculously super tiny- can hardly see them in the hair.</li>

            <li> Too small and really quite flimsy.  </li>
            <li> These mini clips hold the hair very well, but they are very tiny and hard to put in the hair.</li>
            <li> I was expecting little bigger.</li>
            <li> And too tiny for little kids, choke hazard.</li>
            <li> This tiny clips are hard to find in our area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say you can probably get a solid 5 - 15 uses out of one clip before a few off the teeth break off and the clip becomes useless.</li>
            <li> They are small - about 7mm across.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realise the clips were so small.  </li>
            <li> Too small to stay in her hair well.  </li>
            <li> these are very small.  </li>
            <li> CRAZY</li>
            <li> Disappointing, esp.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re keeping them since we lose hair accessories like crazy around our house, but I would not purchase them again.  </li>
            <li> Break easily bad quality</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love these for a toddlers little hair bb</li>
            <li> I bought them for my daughter she seems to enjoy them. They work for what she wanted them to work for.</li>
            <li> I have used these clips from when the kids were infants until now when the oldest fixes her own hair!  I love them, they hold very nicely.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, and a little flimsy, but really cute!</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied, thank you</li>
            <li> Clips are cute for hair ornaments but not big enough to hold up orchid stems. I don&#x27;t think they would work for plants at all</li>
            <li> These are teeny tiny, probably the smallest I have seen on the market.  They work well for my two year old whose hair is just long enough now that she needs something to pull it out of her eyes.  Her hair is still pretty fine and thin so these are perfect.  But I think with thicker hair or an older girl&#x27;s hair you would need a clip that is a little larger or use more than one.&lt;br /&gt;Other than needing a bigger upgrade in the future, I love them.  She doesn&#x27;t like having her hair pulled back in clear bands because it pulls but these have better grip than most bows or barrettes, which she is constantly  pulling out.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously super tiny- can hardly see them in the hair. And too tiny for little kids, choke hazard. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> My girls love these - they work well in a line to keep bangs back with a side part or across the crown like an alice band.  They are small - about 7mm across.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS BECAUSE SHE IS HAIR CLIP CRAZY AND SHE FELL IN LOVE INSTANTLY!  I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THESE FOR A CHILD 3 AND UP AS THEY ARE VERY TINY!</li>
            <li> Little clips that are cute.</li>
            <li> cute clips, small enough to clip tiny braids hung down from hair without bulkiness.</li>
            <li> Great for my 18 month daughter.</li>
            <li> Too small and really quite flimsy.  For babies not even &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Brittle.  Will not buy again.  Disappointing, esp. for &amp;#34;Goody&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These little clips are dirt cheap and fairly fragile, but they&#x27;re really cute and definitely worth it! I&#x27;d say you can probably get a solid 5 - 15 uses out of one clip before a few off the teeth break off and the clip becomes useless. Maybe that&#x27;s just with curly hair but overall I&#x27;d say well worth the price! Solid grip, they stay all day (unless you manage to break them, which is pretty easy to do. Just whack your head against anything and they will crack and fall to bits).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realise the clips were so small.  It would still work but for different use.</li>
            <li> This tiny clips are hard to find in our area.  Our local big boxes don&#x27;t carry a great slection of colors.  My daughter really likes these.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 2-year-old to keep her fine curly hair out of her eyes and while the coloring is very cute (subtle color, but attractive)... these are very small.  Too small to stay in her hair well.  We&#x27;re keeping them since we lose hair accessories like crazy around our house, but I would not purchase them again.  The Goody Micro pack is a better size for us.</li>
            <li> great for my dog hair knots on top</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re mini claw clips, as described. The colors are cute. My daughter has lots of curly hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, so big clips slide right out. She loves these, and they keep her hair out of her face.</li>
            <li> Break easily bad quality</li>
            <li> I bought this for my small Yorkie dog and they are the perfect size.</li>
            <li> These mini clips hold the hair very well, but they are very tiny and hard to put in the hair.</li>
