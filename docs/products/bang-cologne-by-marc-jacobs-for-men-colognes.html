            <li>Best cologne on the market...</li>
            <li>it looks awesome</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this batch of the cologne from this supplier, but I continue to trust Amazon to be a great place to do my shopping!</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this cologne!!</li>
            <li>This is the best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever found and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say after a good 8 hours, give or take based on where you spray it, diet, and so on.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good luck trying to find it retail though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as unique as Marc Jacobs for Men, but I&#x27;m very happy having it a part of my cologne collection.</li>
            <li>great price and quick delivery!</li>
            <li>It has a nice, woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>You want great smelling cologne try True Religion Drifter Cologne</li>
            <li>If you like spicy scents, this may be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li>women love this fragrance</li>
            <li>Love this frgrance definitely one of my best fragrances.</li>
            <li>:) thank you</li>
            <li>I have been using this cologne over 5 years now and still love it.</li>
            <li>sure what is going on.</li>
            <li>I happen to like that top note, to me</li>
            <li>Love this cologne.</li>
            <li>Favorite cologne ever.</li>
            <li>Love for my man to smell good!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Recd my Bang by Marc Jacobs, and enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>So glad it was available since it is now out of production</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love many women&#x27;s scents because they are too sweet or too strong.</li>
            <li>a very rich woodsy smell, primarily noted with peppercorn smell.</li>
            <li>Not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li>A special mention is required for the sexy bottle</li>
            <li>I must admit, I bought this product only after I saw the beautiful picture of Marc Jacobs in a magazine.</li>
            <li>The pepper at the beginning is quite strong, but fades quickly into something more wearable.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, very masculine and he says he gets comments on it all the time.</li>
            <li>But it does smell fabulous, and I always get complimented on it.</li>
            <li>I wear it every day and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous patchouli-esque fragrance.</li>
            <li>Mellows to a rich earthy manly scent.</li>
            <li>Smile!</li>
            <li>It is definitely unique...</li>
            <li>Also over time I noticed it has a almost sweet smell like that of something citrusy.</li>
            <li>and that is good enough for</li>
            <li>Nice, strong cologne, lasts a long time, be careful not to wear too much, this is best for party wear.</li>
            <li>I love Polo by Ralph Lauren and this scent is an updated slightly better smell if that were possible.</li>
            <li>If your woman likes the smell of fresh cracked pepper then get this asap.</li>
            <li>Thankful we have Amazon for this rare and indelible fragrance.</li>
            <li>unique with so much personality.</li>
            <li>Right</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be hard to pinpoint the exact time and occasion for Bang, but I guessing it would be more of a fall/winter type of fragrance that is popular at night.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that hits you with a, well, bang, is the spicy blast of pepper corns.  </li>
            <li>For the avid collector, pick it up based on the uniqueness of the fragrance and the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very intellectual smell like that of and old book or something of that nature.</li>
            <li>It is right around this time that the main smell wears off.</li>
            <li>This is really a BANG fragrance.</li>
            <li>The seller delivered in a very neat and timely manner</li>
            <li>Get ready for the pepper..</li>
            <li>fast shipper ...</li>
            <li>I was strong and lasted long.</li>
            <li>bottle is uniquely designed and is definitely a conversation piece.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really say this is closer to a 3.5 due to the problems with longevity and silage, but the scent is fun and unique.</li>
            <li>However, if you are willing to spend a little more for a similar (but, I&#x27;d argue, more complex and sophisticated) scent, I&#x27;d recommend Terre d&#x27;Hermes.</li>
            <li>Strong black pepper smell when first put on the skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very masculine and unusual.  </li>
            <li>I would also recommend for those who do not like the price that you try Gentleman Citrus &amp; Wood Cologne by Yardley of London for men, as it smells very similar, and fairly priced, but doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>It really does open with a \\&quot;Bang\\&quot; but dries down nicely.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s delicious, too bad</li>
            <li>Maybe its old stock?</li>
            <li>This is an old stock.</li>
            <li>But Oxkhom sells old items.</li>
            <li>Wooodsy, earthy, and masculine.</li>
            <li>nobody accepts buy something as a new and it is actually from auction or Marc Jacobs clearnce.</li>
            <li>When spraying it on, I can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Yes the bottle is odd shaped but real men don&#x27;t care about the shape, size, weight or how &amp;#34;cumbersome&amp;#34; the bottle is.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The base is very nice once the pepper is over, I get a sense of vanilla, toasted wood, patchouli, cloves and copper pennies.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have to say it isn&#x27;t long lasting though, so</li>
            <li> As the name says it hits you hard with its peppery overpower,but the dry down is very subtle and nice.</li>
            <li> Basically when your woman smells this she&#x27;ll think of a man who can rip a oak tree in half using only his pinkys.</li>
            <li> Received product faster than the expected day.  </li>
            <li> But it loses points for longevity - it didn&#x27;t last long at me, and silage is minimal as well.</li>
            <li> However I had to give it a 3, due to the shape of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The longevity is below average and the projection/</li>
            <li> sillage is about average.  </li>
            <li> Find product for almoust half price</li>
            <li> you like the scent of Black Pepper with outdoors \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Only a little weak.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the spicy woodsy type of fragrances, but Sweetie tends to gravitate towards these - and for some reason, my collection of these seems to be growing..</li>
            <li> On a less important note, the bottle is weird and annoying..</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m a sucker for advertising.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the perfume&#x27;s fragrance is incredibly weak.  </li>
            <li> This cologne is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re afraid of smelling like a pepper-mill all day don&#x27;t worry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward.</li>

            <li> Best cologne on the market...women love this fragrance</li>
            <li> Nice, strong cologne, lasts a long time, be careful not to wear too much, this is best for party wear.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I bought this product only after I saw the beautiful picture of Marc Jacobs in a magazine. I guess I&#x27;m a sucker for advertising. But it does smell fabulous, and I always get complimented on it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as unique as Marc Jacobs for Men, but I&#x27;m very happy having it a part of my cologne collection. And the bottle is just a fantastic shape in itself!!!</li>
            <li> This is really a BANG fragrance. As the name says it hits you hard with its peppery overpower,but the dry down is very subtle and nice. Love this frgrance definitely one of my best fragrances.A special mention is required for the sexy bottle it looks awesome i would recommend this one for anyone who can bear the pepper notes....</li>
            <li> Received product faster than the expected day.  Me my expectations:) thank you</li>
            <li> I coerced my husband to buy this after receiving a sample from my birchbox. It smells so good, very masculine and he says he gets comments on it all the time. On a less important note, the bottle is weird and annoying..</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne over 5 years now and still love it. It´s unique with so much personality. Spicy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the perfume&#x27;s fragrance is incredibly weak.  When spraying it on, I can barely smell it.  Immediately after spraying, I cannot smell it, neither can anyone else!Not sure what is going on. Maybe its old stock? I have bought it before and it wasn&#x27;t like this. I contacted Amazon and they took care of the situation immediately. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this batch of the cologne from this supplier, but I continue to trust Amazon to be a great place to do my shopping!</li>
            <li> Find product for almoust half price</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cologne!! I&#x27;m upset that it has been discontinued and find myself looking for&lt;br /&gt;testers for sale on-line. Bring it back, Marc!!</li>
            <li> Great scent! It has a nice, woodsy scent. Not too strong or overpowering. I definitely recommend this. It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If your woman likes the smell of fresh cracked pepper then get this asap. a very rich woodsy smell, primarily noted with peppercorn smell. Also over time I noticed it has a almost sweet smell like that of something citrusy. It is right around this time that the main smell wears off. I&#x27;d say after a good 8 hours, give or take based on where you spray it, diet, and so on. This cologne is very hard to find. Yes the bottle is odd shaped but real men don&#x27;t care about the shape, size, weight or how &amp;#34;cumbersome&amp;#34; the bottle is.

I would also recommend for those who do not like the price that you try Gentleman Citrus &amp; Wood Cologne by Yardley of London for men, as it smells very similar, and fairly priced, but doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Good product. Just wish it last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> This is an old stock. I bought one before from Faces I was strong and lasted long. But Oxkhom sells old items. This is unethical and I will write claim against this person. nobody accepts buy something as a new and it is actually from auction or Marc Jacobs clearnce.</li>
            <li> My husband smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great perfume. Only a little weak. Doesn&#x27;t last long. The seller delivered in a very neat and timely manner</li>
            <li> The first thing that hits you with a, well, bang, is the spicy blast of pepper corns.  I happen to like that top note, to me it&#x27;s very masculine and unusual.  I have to say it isn&#x27;t long lasting though, so if you&#x27;re afraid of smelling like a pepper-mill all day don&#x27;t worry.  The base is very nice once the pepper is over, I get a sense of vanilla, toasted wood, patchouli, cloves and copper pennies.  I think it&#x27;s delicious, too bad it wasn&#x27;t a hit.  I wear it every day and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Strong black pepper smell when first put on the skin. Mellows to a rich earthy manly scent. Favorite cologne ever.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever found and love it. However I had to give it a 3, due to the shape of the bottle. It&#x27;s awkward. Falls over on the sink. Cumbersome to handle.</li>
            <li> Why he stopped producing this unrelenting fragrance I will NEVER know? Wooodsy, earthy, and masculine. Just how &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; like me colognes. INSTANT conversation piece with the ladies fellas. Good luck trying to find it retail though. Thankful we have Amazon for this rare and indelible fragrance.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like wasp and hornet spray.:Terrible; i would never ever put this on my body. I haven&#x27;t tried to use it for wasp&amp;hornets yet.  You want great smelling cologne try True Religion Drifter Cologne</li>
            <li> Love for my man to smell good!&lt;br /&gt;Love for my man to smell good!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it folks! Enough said! Smile!</li>
            <li> Get ready for the pepper..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the scent of Black Pepper with outdoors \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; finishing notes, this fragrance is for you.  It is definitely unique... I am not a huge fan of the spicy woodsy type of fragrances, but Sweetie tends to gravitate towards these - and for some reason, my collection of these seems to be growing..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is uniquely designed and is definitely a conversation piece.  The longevity is below average and the projection/sillage is about average.  While I have not received any compliments, again, Sweetie does like the fragrance - and that is good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be hard to pinpoint the exact time and occasion for Bang, but I guessing it would be more of a fall/winter type of fragrance that is popular at night.  For the avid collector, pick it up based on the uniqueness of the fragrance and the bottle design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give Bang 3.7 stars out of 5.  I am not a fan, but am a collector.  Enthusiasm moves the world...</li>
            <li> About the only male fragrance I like on my husband. Not so flowery.</li>
            <li> Recd my Bang by Marc Jacobs, and enjoying the product. Great service.</li>
            <li> should be called Got It Right</li>
            <li> If you like spicy scents, this may be a good fit for you. It really does open with a \\&quot;Bang\\&quot; but dries down nicely. But it loses points for longevity - it didn&#x27;t last long at me, and silage is minimal as well. The pepper at the beginning is quite strong, but fades quickly into something more wearable. I&#x27;d really say this is closer to a 3.5 due to the problems with longevity and silage, but the scent is fun and unique. However, if you are willing to spend a little more for a similar (but, I&#x27;d argue, more complex and sophisticated) scent, I&#x27;d recommend Terre d&#x27;Hermes.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous patchouli-esque fragrance. So glad it was available since it is now out of production</li>
            <li> I love Polo by Ralph Lauren and this scent is an updated slightly better smell if that were possible. I wear it and get tons of compliments from men and women. I know its for boys but I don&#x27;t love many women&#x27;s scents because they are too sweet or too strong. I wear this every day and would bathe in it if I could!</li>
