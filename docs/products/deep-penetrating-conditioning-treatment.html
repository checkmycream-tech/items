            <li>I heard a lot of good reviews about this product , thats the main reason I decided to try it out.</li>

            <li>I first discovered this product a couple of years ago or so, and I totally love it.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>My hair type is fine and straight.</li>
            <li>It somewhat helps with the frizzies too, but it&#x27;s so humid right now that I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li>I bought it and used it right after I dyed my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks you!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS TECH DEEP COND!!</li>
            <li>The first time I tried This product a 1 oz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this in addition to the regular conditioner and shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I had been using what I thought was a good conditioner beforehand, but once I got out of the shower and dried off, my hair was losing the silky slipperiness that was there in the shower when rinsing the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft and was so bouncy!!!!</li>
            <li>If you can find the deep conditioning treatment at a good price, definitely buy it.  </li>
            <li>If you find the regular Brazilian Tech conditioner, which should be even cheaper for a greater volume, I highly recommend that as well.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It did make my hair stronger it does not fall as much</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t wait how much shinier it will turn out!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>hair is very manageable and shiny after using it.</li>
            <li>The first use, I left it in for like 10 or 15 mins and then braided it then quickly washed the two braids, so I wouldnt wash all of it out.</li>
            <li>(i usually braid my super frizzy curly hair and unwravel for a more sleek wavy look) and it wa shiny</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong for my taste, but worth it for the results.</li>
            <li>I used it as a leave in- a little bit in my hair and my curls were nice and hair was soft.</li>
            <li>With this product, and with its sister product, the Brazilian Tech Keratin conditioner (the regular conditioner, not deep conditioning treatment), my hair looks and feels a million times better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice now, and it leaves my highlighted, wavy, mid-length hair very soft!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend thisto anyone whose hair has lost its bounce.  </li>
            <li>AND MY ENDS FELT SOOO SOFT!!</li>
            <li>Still so soft and bouncy!!</li>
            <li>My hair is growing a little, but hopefully itll grow more..</li>
            <li>I put a dab of this one and let it sit for a few minutes, and it makes it feel MUCH better - soft &amp; silky but still management.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re extensions will be soft, shiny and silky!</li>
            <li>When I used the regular conditioner the next time, the results were noticeably less spectacular.  </li>
            <li>You can use the regular conditioner daily, and the deep conditioning treatment once a week, and it will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle but clearly helped my hair.</li>
            <li>so it looks soft, silky, stay straighter longer</li>
            <li>product leaves your hair soft and beautifull</li>
            <li>Make your hair nice and sleek but it does not take volume away for people who has thin hair.</li>
            <li>It really smoothed out my frizzy dry damaged hair and left it soft and glossy.</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry, and most products leave it feeling drier and hard to manage.</li>
            <li>although its pretty expensive at the stores this was a much better deal (even if I had to wait a few days)</li>
            <li>If you have thin hair that tangles easily, this will definitely help.  </li>

            <li> I have long med. texture hair and use a deep conditioner often.</li>
            <li> Used it once, left my hair soft while still wet, but when I dried it with a diffuser it became frizzy and untamed.</li>

            <li> IT&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Daily Conditioner on other days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for dry, damaged and unmanageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Allow your extensions to air dry.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soooo soft and yet doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, its a must have for me!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t really deep condition but it does make it less wavey when it dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was on the look out for a product that would help with my dry, brittle hair due to my Hashimoto&#x27;s disease.</li>
            <li> When I was buying hair color from Sallys, I saw this product on the shelf being promoted with pink writing bc of Breast Cancer Awareness.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavey/curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries a bit quicker but not nearly as fast as other keratin products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry hair and this helped to tame my curls and frizz.</li>
            <li> it is concentrated, so you only use a little amount, leaves the hair espectacular!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a little over a month ago and use it about once a week as advised.</li>
            <li> Used a little bit and my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy at all</li>
            <li> Very thick and left my hair feeling greasy</li>
            <li> I let it sit on my hair for a few minutes, working it in.</li>
            <li> and I periodically get Brazilian Blowout treatments to tame it.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick, frizzy, medium length hair and this product protects my hair</li>
            <li> Co wash your extensions with this treatment and place your extensions in a zip lock bag and put it in the microwave for approximately 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> May be it was wrong to use a diffuser.</li>
            <li> this is not one of them it makes ur hair look unhealthy n dirty</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cant go wrong!!</li>
            <li> Idk if my horrible splits are all gone but it helped it alot!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li> AWESOME STUFF!! SMELLS GREAT! Leaves hair is silky and smooth! Thanks you! Will suggest to friends! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Great price for such a good product.  I&#x27;ve tried pricier keratin conditioners and this one is as good or better.  I wash my hair at the beginning of my shower and let the conditioner sit as i wash my body, face and shave and by the end of my shower my hair is silky smooth!

            <li> A must have for color treated hair. It really smoothed out my frizzy dry damaged hair and left it soft and glossy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice now, and it leaves my highlighted, wavy, mid-length hair very soft! It somewhat helps with the frizzies too, but it&#x27;s so humid right now that I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle. My hair is very dry, and most products leave it feeling drier and hard to manage. This product leaves it feeling hydrated and easier to comb and brush through. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is  one of the best that I have purchased in many years.  Leaves my hair very shiny and manageable.  I would highly recommend thisto anyone whose hair has lost its bounce.  Greatly improved the texture too.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good reviews about this product , thats the main reason I decided to try it out. I been using it for about a month n I dont plan to buy another one. I like hair treatments that u can leave on ur hair n this is not one of them it makes ur hair look unhealthy n dirty it does not work for my type of hair. It did make my hair stronger it does not fall as much but thats it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a little over a month ago and use it about once a week as advised. I sometimes used it twice a week. But went back to once a week, then using a curly smoothing treatment on another day of the week. (which doesn&#x27;t seen to work lol I just like how it feels in my hair )&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, bought this with ion keratin shampoo. Lemmie tell ya I LOVE THIS TECH DEEP COND!! The first use, I left it in for like 10 or 15 mins and then braided it then quickly washed the two braids, so I wouldnt wash all of it out. Omigosh!!! My hair felt so soft and was so bouncy!!!! (i usually braid my super frizzy curly hair and unwravel for a more sleek wavy look) and it wa shiny and I kid u not..bounced all the way to china!! I get it straightened tomorw so can&#x27;t wait how much shinier it will turn out!&lt;br /&gt;Once weekly I put some on my ends after I was and braid AND MY ENDS FELT SOOO SOFT!! Idk if my horrible splits are all gone but it helped it alot!&lt;br /&gt;Also, after just three or four days of not washing, its as if it just got washed lol,! Still so soft and bouncy!! Will buy some for my cousin who straighten her hair too often and more for me! My hair is growing a little, but hopefully itll grow more..it grows an inch in 6 _7months idk y!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant go wrong!!</li>
            <li> this is the best conditioner ever!!  and smells great!!  it is concentrated, so you only use a little amount, leaves the hair espectacular!!</li>
            <li> I was on the look out for a product that would help with my dry, brittle hair due to my Hashimoto&#x27;s disease. I have been using WEN products, which has helped but not like I would of hoped. When I was buying hair color from Sallys, I saw this product on the shelf being promoted with pink writing bc of Breast Cancer Awareness. I already use the leave in conditioner but I needed that extra deep conditioner. I bought it and used it right after I dyed my hair. I let it sit on my hair for a few minutes, working it in. During that process, my hair already felt like silk and I could run a a comb through it. After I blow dried and straightened my hair, it was so shiny, soft and weightless. I think I will try the entire collection and switch from WEN to this product.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried This product a 1 oz. came with my flatiron, and I loved it.  I have a lot of thick, frizzy, medium length hair and this product protects my hair so it looks soft, silky, stay straighter longer and it left my hair smelling great, not that burnt smell. Just a little goes a long way. I was able to get 4 uses out of the 1 oz pack I got. Loved it so much that I just ordered the 5oz bottle</li>
            <li> Your hair will absolutely love this conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Best for dry, damaged and unmanageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves your hair soft and beautifull</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product a couple of years ago or so, and I totally love it.  FYI, I have wavy/frizzy hair and I periodically get Brazilian Blowout treatments to tame it.  I had been using what I thought was a good conditioner beforehand, but once I got out of the shower and dried off, my hair was losing the silky slipperiness that was there in the shower when rinsing the conditioner out.  With this product, and with its sister product, the Brazilian Tech Keratin conditioner (the regular conditioner, not deep conditioning treatment), my hair looks and feels a million times better.  If you can find the deep conditioning treatment at a good price, definitely buy it.  If you find the regular Brazilian Tech conditioner, which should be even cheaper for a greater volume, I highly recommend that as well.  You can use the regular conditioner daily, and the deep conditioning treatment once a week, and it will make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. If you have thin hair that tangles easily, this will definitely help.  It repairs lost moisture and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Then you have to invest in this deep penetrating conditioning treatment. This is great for your Brazilian, Peruvian, Mongolian and Malaysian hair extensions. Co wash your extensions with this treatment and place your extensions in a zip lock bag and put it in the microwave for approximately 3 minutes. Then remove it and rinse hair. Allow your extensions to air dry.  You&#x27;re extensions will be soft, shiny and silky!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavey/curly thick hair. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t really deep condition but it does make it less wavey when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;It dries a bit quicker but not nearly as fast as other keratin products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I bought this in addition to the regular conditioner and shampoo.  My admittedly wiry and aging hair has gotten totally unmanageable.  But with the initial wash and conditioning with this product, my hair had seemingly lost 20 years!  When I used the regular conditioner the next time, the results were noticeably less spectacular.  Consider me a BIG fan!</li>
            <li> Still one of the best treatments around!! Makes my hair soooo soft and yet doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, its a must have for me!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright but would not  purchase again</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this hair product. I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I comb a quarter size amount in my hair after shampooing and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very manageable and shiny after using it. I use this product&lt;br /&gt;twice a week. I use  IT&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Daily Conditioner on other days.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> WONT USE ANYTHING ELSE</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry hair and this helped to tame my curls and frizz. I used it as a leave in- a little bit in my hair and my curls were nice and hair was soft. Used a little bit and my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy at all</li>
            <li> does nothing for me.  well, nothing good.  was so hoping it would be the conditioning solution I was hoping for,  Nyyyeeet.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!! its my fav! although its pretty expensive at the stores this was a much better deal (even if I had to wait a few days)</li>
            <li> Not as good as I was expecting...</li>
            <li> I have long med. texture hair and use a deep conditioner often. This product isn&#x27;t the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve used but definetly not the best. I did like the smell of it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels after using this product. The smell is a little strong for my taste, but worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> Product helped my hair alot. It &#x27;s not a miracle product but my hair has severe damage. Would still recommend this product. It&#x27;s not a miracle but clearly helped my hair.</li>
